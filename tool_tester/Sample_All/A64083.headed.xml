<OPENER><SALUTE>To all Impartial and unprejudiced Readers, especially those of our Hopeful and Ingenious Nobility, and Gentry..</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving, out of Curiosity, for some years before the late wonder∣ful happy Revolution, as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> since, for the satisfaction of my own Conscience, carefully perused all Treatises of any value that have been published of late years concerning the Original, and Rights of Civil Government, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well of Monarchy, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the other kinds thereof; as al∣so of the Antient Government, and Fundamental Constitutions of this Kingdom, I have found it necessary in order to my better retaining of what I had read, and making a more certain Iudgment thereupon, to commit to writing the most considerable Arguments on both sides, as well of those who have Monarchy to be <HI>Jure Devino,</HI> as of those who only allow it to Government in general; of those who hold an Absolute Subjection, or Passive Obedience (as their Phrase is) as well as of those who hold Resistance in some Cases necessary: of those that maintain our Monarchy to have been limitted, by the very constitution it self, &amp; of those that suppose all our rights, and Liberties, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the very Being of Parliaments themselves, to owe their Original wholly to the gracious Concession, and Favour of our former Kings. Having made some impartial Collections of this Nature, I showed them to some Friends, who told me they thought they might prove of great use for the satisfying of some mens doubts and scruples concerning Lawful Obedi∣ence to the Government of their present Majesties, as looking upon it as the best and most ingenious way of Conviction to propose the Arguments fairly on both sides, without interposing my own Iudgment, but to leave it to the intelligent, and impartial Reader to embrace that side on which he found the most rational and convincing Arguments: This task, tho' troublesome enough, I was prevail'd with to undertake, not for Fame's sake, since I do not desire to be known; but meerly for the puplick good and happiness of my Country; but being also satisfied that a Subject of this great important deserved more pains than what I had yet bestowed upon it, and to be handled in a more Artificial Method, than the old dry Sch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lastick way of Objection, and Solution: I therefore thought that it would prove more pleasant, as well as profitable for the Readers (especially those of our young Nobility and Gentry, for whom I principally design this undertak∣ing) to digest all that I had written on these Subjects into so many distinct Dialogues, or Conversations, supposed to be held between two intimate Friends, who, notwithstanding their different Principles and Opinions in Politicks, had always maintained a strict and generous correspondency: but I was the more inclined to this way of writing, not only because I have observ∣ed that Controversial matters written by way of Dialogue, according to the true Rules thereof, have very well obtained among all intelligent Readers;
<PB REF="7"/>
but also since the Subjects I treat of are of a nice nature, and that the Col∣lections I had made contained strict Inquiries into the Principles, and Te∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, in the Writings of diverse persons of Reputation for Learning, and Ingenuity; I was sensible how invidicus a T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k it must be to write on pur∣pose against so many great men, as also how troublesom and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edious is would prove to my self, as well as the Readers, to pursue and confute the Opinions of any Author page by page, since it must be chiefly imputed to that mannar of managing of Controversies, that answers to Books prove so unacceptable to the World. And though I grant that this way of writ∣ing hath also its difficulties and objections, as being more diffu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive, and so taking up more time both to write and read Discourses Dialogue-wise; where either one or other of the Disputants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> often apt to rove from the Sub∣ject; ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I must also affirm, that this may be in great part prevented by the Writer, who may, if he plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> take care to keep close to the Question, and not start afresh, Har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the old one is run down; and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the dif∣fusiveness of Dialogues above Polemical Discourses, that is no considerable Objection, since a man may either make, or answer Objections in almost as few words this way as the other. And thô it be granted that matter of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een form in Dialogues the more tedious, yet the Reader, as well as Travel∣ler, will find that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Road often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> somewhat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. But whether I have truly put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Rules of Dialogue in that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>suing Discourses I intend to publish on these Subjects, Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Readers. Iudgment; but this much I think I may safely affirm that I have carefuly avoided all bitter, &amp; reflecting langu∣age on either side, since I designe these Discourses for common places of Ar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>nt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forms of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. And I have also declined showing my self a Party, or giving my own opinion in any Question proposed, and there∣fore I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Disputants converting each other to his own Opinion; since I know nothing is more easie in writing of Dialogues, well as Romances, than to make the Knight Efrane always beat the Gyant.</P>
<P>But it is fit I give you some account of this present▪ Discourse, as also of the rest that may follow it. This first Dialogue then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> chiefly on this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>Whether any particular Spec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of Government is of Divine Right, or Institution</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The next shall be, <HI>Whether there can be made out from the natural, or revealed Law of God any Suc∣cession to Crowns by Divine Right?</HI> The third and fourth, <HI>Whether Passive Obedience</HI> (as it is called) <HI>or an absolute Nonresistance of the Supream Powers, in any case whatsoever, be enjoyed by the Law of Nature, and the holy Scriptures?</HI> As also, <HI>Whether this hath al∣ways been the Doctrine of our Reformed Church of</HI> England? The fifth concerns the Original of <HI>Civil Authority, in what sense it is de∣rived from God, and in what form the People, and whether their Consent be always necessary to make any Government to be obey∣ed for Conscience sake</HI>? The sixth shall treat of the <HI>Original, and
<PB REF="7"/>
Fundamental Constitution of our English Government, whether it was an absolute or limited Monarchy in its first Institution; and whether the King is, and hath been the sole Legislative Power of the Nation?</HI> The seventh, <HI>Whether the Parliament, or great Coun∣sel, owe its Orignal to the meer Grace, and Favour of our Kings, or whether it is not as Antient as the Constitution it self?</HI> The eighth and last, <HI>Whether our late Revolution, and the Conventions and present Parliament's Declaration, and Recognition of their present Majesties K.</HI> William <HI>and Q.</HI> Mary, <HI>be not</HI> Legal, <HI>and according to the Antient Constitution, and Fundamental Gov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnment of this King∣dom?</HI> and consequently, <HI>Whether the Oath of Allegiance may not be taken to them, not only as King and Q.</HI> de facto <HI>but</HI> de Iure?</P>
<P>In all which Discourses I have considered and contracted the best Argu∣ments that I could find made use of by the most considerable both Antient and Modern Authors, either in Latine, or English, especially the Pamphlets that have been writ on either side since the late Revolution: But as for those in our own Language, when-ever any Author speaks so well, and argues so closely, that to put it into other words would make it worse, I have still put the Arguments of either one, or other of the Disputants in his own word, thô, because I would not be thought guilty of Plagiary, I have truly quoted the book and page from whence I took it, and I hope no Author will take it ill, if I have made bold sometimes to contract their Arguments, without altering their sense, or words farther, than by putting in or out a word or expression to make the style run the more smoothly, and I desire they would not think I write on purpose to confute them: since I freely declare my design is not to write against any man's Opinions, as they are his, but only freely to examine them, in order to an impartial discovery of the Truth; and since some of them may have been perhaps, too commonly, and favourably received by our ordinary Gentry and Clergy, if therefore any ingenious person will take upon him farther to assert or vindicate any Opinion here questioned either by the one or other of our Disputants, and will clearly, and fairly shew me where my Argument might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been put more home, or any Objection more solidly answered, shall be so far from taking it amiss, that I shall ra∣ther give him my thanks for his pains; and do here farther promise to insert all, or at least the substance of his Arguments under their poper Heads, with all due acknowledgments to their Authors, if ever the Discourses will bear a second Impression; only I desire him, whosoever he shall be, so far to imi∣tate the Gentlemen who are supposed to converse in these Dialogues, as to for. bear all rude Reflections, and course Language, otherwise I hope they will give me their pardon if I only take notice of their Reasons, and pass by their Passion.</P>
<P>Nor would I have any Candid Reader to slight the two first Dialogues, because they treat of Opinions at present out of fashion. <HI>viz. The Divine Right of Monarchy and Succession from the Patriarchal Power given by God to</HI> Adam, since you may easily remember that it is not
<PB REF="8"/>
many years ago, that our Pulpits and Presses would scarce suffer any o∣ther Doctrines either to be Preacht or Publisht, than on these Subjects: It faring with some Political Opinions, as with Fashions, which are never so generally received, and worn, as when they have been in Vogue at Court. Those Divines and Lawyers who were the first Inventers, or new Vampers of them, commonly receiving the greatest Rewards and Pre∣fermets, who (as the Court Taylors did Fashions) could invent such Doctrines, and Opinions, as were most burthensome, and uneasie to all sort of People, except a few Great ones, who were to gain by them; and I desire you also farther to consider, that however odd, or unreasonable these Doctrines may seem to most men, yet certainly they must have, at least, a great appearance of Truth, since they were able to Captivate the Reasons of the <HI>Major</HI> part of both Houses of Convocation in the begining of the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the First, they then declaring them by several Cannons, made on purpose, the only sure Foundations of all Civil Authority, as also of Obedience thereunto; as plainly appears by that late Treatise which goes under the name of <HI>Bishop Overal</HI>'s <HI>Convocation-Book.</HI> And thô neither the King, nor Parliament, then thought fit to give those Cannons the stamp of Civil Authority, whereby they might be∣come Laws: Yet for all this, it did not hinder divers Learned, and In∣genious men, as well of Clergy, as Laity, from embracing these Opinions, such as were Sir <HI>Robert Filmer,</HI> and his Vindicatior Mr. <HI>B.</HI> as also the most Reverend and Learned Bishop <HI>Sanderson,</HI> with divers others of note, whose Arguments I have made use of, and considered in the two first Dialogues, and that in a way as little reflective as possible; since I know what is due to the memory and fame of such great, and worthy Per∣sons; and therefore I have only made use of the initial Letters of their Names, or Titles of their Books in the Margine, with an Index at the be∣ginning of each Discourse, shewing what Book each mark does signifie; which Method I have persued through all the rest of these Discourses; and of what is not so mark<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I desire the Reader to look upon the words, if not the sense, to be my own; since I do not pretend to be an Inventer of new Notions in Politicks, and there is no man more sensible than my self of that Old Latine Sentence, <HI>Nihil dictum, quod non dictum prius.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' I have already finisht almost all the Discourses, on the Subjects above mentioned, yet am I not very fond of publishing them, after so many several Treatises that have been written thereon; tho' my design be for the saving of the Readers money as well as time, to reduce what is material in all of them into so many <HI>12 d.</HI> Books, and therefore I have at present pub∣lished this first Dialogue, as an Introduction to the rest, that according to the success I find this meets with abroad, I may be more, or less encouraged to pro∣ceed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed it seem strange to any considering person, that I chuse rather to publish one Discourse at a time; since it is but too publick a Complaint how scarce a Commodity Money (as well as Paper) is at this time.</P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>And therefore I have given the Printer leave to publish one of these Dis∣courses in a month, or oftner, as he shall think good, since I am sensible the greatest part of common Reader would rather part with eight or ten shilling<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at so many several times, than all at once; and have therein endeavoured to imitate the Great Council of the Nation, who have thought fit to divide the present Pole-Tax into four quarterly Payments.</P>
<P>I have but one thing more to advertise the Reader; <HI>viz.</HI> That tho' the Title of this Discourse mentions no more than the discussing the Question <HI>Divine Right of Monarchy,</HI> yet the natural Powers of Fathers, and Masters of Fa∣milies, and Freemen, are here dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inctly treated of, and closely enquired into, as being the first Elements, or Principles of all Civil Powers, as those alone out of which they could be at first regularly made, and into which they are upon the dissolution of Civil Governments again to be resolved.</P>
<P>To conclude therefore, I hope that the Arguments in this, and all the follow∣ing Discourses, may prove so plai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and convincing to all careful, and unpre∣judiced Readers, that they may as easily discover the Truth, as an honest un∣byass'd Iury-man can a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Tryal judge on which side the Right and Iustice of the Cause inclines, upon the barehearing the Evidence on both sides; nay, even before the Court hath summed it up: Since, I think it may prove more use∣ful, as well as divertive, to hear, or peruse the Arguments, and Reasons, in short, that may be brought o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> either side, and thereon to pass a Judgment, than to Read over the tedious and Voluminous De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds, and Evidences of the Estate in Question; But on which side soever you bring in your Verdict, I heartily wish that God would direct your minds, and guide your Iudgments to find out and embrace the Truth, which as it was the only End of my writing, so it is now and will be also of publishing this and those other Treatises, I intend on the Subjects I have before mentioned.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Sir, I'll tell you: Being awake very early this Morning, and not able to sleep for thinking on the great Change, that might happen, let either the King or Prince get the better: and hearing some odd Rumours last Night of the King's Intentions to go away: I was resolved to get up, and go to the Coffee-house, to hear what News; where I had scarc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> down, before a Gentleman comes in from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and brings us a certain account, that the King withdrew himself this Morning between three and four of the Clock, no Body knows whither, (tho' most believe he is gone after the Queen into <HI>France</HI>) which I thought would be so surpri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing (I will not say welcome) to you, that being so near your Lodgings, I thought it would be worth while to step up, and tell you of it, and take your Thoughts of this great (and <HI>I</HI> hope happy) Change, which so great a Revolution is likely to produce in this Nation.</P>

<P>I thank you, Sir, for your kindness, tho' it is not half an Hour ago, that one <HI>I</HI> employ in some Business relating to a Client of mine, came hither, and gave me the same account that you do, tho' it was no great surprize to me, for ever since <HI>Sunday</HI> that the King sent the Queen and Prince away, <HI>I</HI> be∣liev'd that he gave the Game for lost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> must confess <HI>I</HI> was of another Mind, and thought that when he had secured the Queen and Child, he would have had one Brush with the Prince before he could have got to <HI>London,</HI> and if he had the worst of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he could have but gone away at last. But to leap away on this Manner, and to loose Three Kingdoms without ever striking one stroke, it is not, <HI>I</HI> confess, suta∣ble to that high Character his Admirer have always had of his Courage and Conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Good King what would you have him do? Or whom could he relye on? When some of his near Relations, and divers of those whom he had raised almost from nothing had deserted him? How could he then trust an Army of Mercenaries, who being most of them but the Dregs of the People, would, it is likely, rather have delivered him up to the Prince, than have ventured their Lives for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you have said concerning his Majesties Relations and Confidents deserting him, makes rather against than for the King's Cause; since it can∣not be supposed they would have left a Prince to whom they were so much obliged, to joyn themselves with his Enemy, from whom they had no reason to expect greater Advantages, than they had already, unless they had been satisfied in their Conscience<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the Protestant Religion Establisht in these Nations, and also our Civil Rights and Liberties were in imminent danger of being utterly lost and destroyed; and tho' <HI>I</HI> grant that some of the King's Officers and Souldiers went over to the Prince; yet considering how few they were, that did so, not being (as <HI>I</HI> am credibly informed) above seven or eight hundred Men at the most; and what great numbers of Men he had left with him, he might methings, have turned out those Officers, he suspected, and put others in their Rooms, who would have Engaged to Live and Die with him, and if this would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot have done, he might have sent those Regiments he most suspected back to <HI>London</HI>: And then reckoning the <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Forces that came lately over, besides the Papists he had in his Army, and those who having more Courage, than Conscience, could never expect to Fight for a Prince, who would pay them better: <HI>I</HI> am confident (if this had been done) he migh after the going over of those few Troups, have made up as good, if not a better Army than the Princes; and so need not have scampored last Week from <HI>Salisbury</HI> in that haste he did, whilst the Enemy was near fifty Miles off. But as it is, <HI>I</HI> am very well satisfied with all that hath happen'd in this great Revolution, and convinced of the Truth of that old saying▪ <HI>Ques perdora vult Iupiter, demantat pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far <HI>I</HI> go along with you, that God doth often make use of the Wick∣edness and Treachery of Men, to bring his great Designs about▪ But whe∣ther God hath ordained this great Revolution, as you call it, for a Deli∣verance or Punishment to this Nation, <HI>I</HI> am yet in doubt, for if you please to consider how much those two Causes have contributed to this turn of Affairs, <HI>I</HI> suppose if you argue according to my Principles we must own that tho' this Change hath happened by Gods permissive Providence, (as all
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
things else tho' never so ill) yet whether he doth approve of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll that hath been done to procure it, I much doubt; since if divers of our Nobility, with some of our Clergy had not quitted their Doctrines of Passive Obedience, and Non Resistance, so long owned by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> this Revolu∣ion could not have happened at all, or at least not so suddenly, as it did: So that indeed I must confess, I am not only grieved at his Majesties hard Fortune, but also stand amazed, and cannot but reflect with wonder on the strange Vi∣cissitude of Worldly Affairs, to see a Great King, who but last Week com∣manded a Powerful Army of more than Forty Thousand Men forced out of his Throne, and made to fly his Kingdom by a Prince that did not bring half that Number into the Field. And who can sufficiently Bewail the King's Misfortunes, who hath been at once betrayed by the ill Advice of his Counsellors, the Trea∣chery of his Friends, and tho Cowardice of his Souldiers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks Sir. there is no such great cause of wonder, much less of con∣cern in all this: For who can much admire that a Prince should be thus used, who had not only provok'd a Powerful Enemy to invade him from Abroad, but (by industriously labouring to introduce Popery and Arbitrary Government at Home) had lost the Hearts of almost all, except his <HI>Popish Subjects,</HI> inso∣much that many of his own Souldiers were so terrified with the Thoughts of being discarded (like the Protestant Army in <HI>Ireland</HI>) to make room for <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>French Papists,</HI> that they had very little Courage to Fight, when they saw Casheering was the best Reward they could expect, if they proved Victorious: And who can much pity a Prince, who would rather loose the Affections of his People, than displease a few <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Jesuites:</HI> So that if he suffers he may thank himself; it not being Religion, but Superstition, which brought this Misfortune upon him. Since the King having got a Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and (as it is highly suspected) joined himself in a strict League with <HI>France</HI> for the Extirpation of Hereticks, it laid an absolute necessity upon the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to come over, that by the Assistance of the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> he might not only relieve us, but vindicate his own, and her Royal Highness his Princess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Right to the Succession, and secure his Countrey from a dangerous and power∣ful invasion, which it was threatned with both by Sea and Land, whenever the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> should be at leisure to joyn their Forces to make War upon them; which you know all <HI>Europe</HI> hath expected for above these two Years last past.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>These things were somewhat, if they could be proved; but indeed, to deal freely with you, I look upon this League, and the Story of the Supposi∣tious Birth of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Wales,</HI> as meer Calumnies cast out of Wicked and Crafty Men to render the King more odious to his People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, you don't hear me positively affirm, either the one or the o∣ther; since I grant they are not yet made out; but whatsoever will consider all the Circumstances of the Birth of this <HI>Child</HI> cannot but be strongly in∣clined to believe it an <HI>Imposture,</HI> notwithstanding all the Depositions that are taken to the contrary. And as for the <HI>French</HI> League, you may be sure if there be any such thing, it is kept very private; and yet I must tell you there are very high and violent Presumptions to believe it true, or else why should the King of <HI>France</HI> in a late Memorial to the <HI>Pope, complain that his Holi∣ness by Opposing his Interest in</HI> Europe <HI>had hindered him in those great De∣signs
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
he had for the Extirpation of Heresie,</HI> by which he must surely intend <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI>; Protestantism being sufficiently expelled out of his own Countrey already. And he could not do it in either of the other without the Consent and Assistance of his Brother the King of <HI>England</HI>? Or to what pur∣pose should the King of <HI>England</HI> joyn with <HI>France</HI> to ruin <HI>Holland,</HI> and his own Son in Law into the Bargain, but to make a War meerly for Religion; since neither the <HI>Dutch,</HI> nor the Prince their Stadt-holder, gave him till now any just Provocation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, however, these are but bare suspitions and presumptions, at most, and not proofs; and therefore in a doubtful matter, as this is, if we ought to judge favourably of the Actions of others, much more of Princes, whose Councils and Actions, tho' private, yet are still exposed to the Censure and Calumnies of their Enemies, and therefore I hope you will not blame me, if I freely confess, that I am deeply concerned to see an innocent and Misled King forced to seek his Bread in a Forreign Land, and the more, since many of the Nobility, Gentry and Common People have contributed so much to it, by taking up Arms against him; and that so great a part of his own Army, and Officers should contrary to their Allegiance and Trust reposed in them, run over to the Enemy. Nay, that some of our Bishops and Clergy-men should, contrary to the so often acknowledged Doctrines of Passive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Obedience and Non-Resistance, not only Countenance, but be likewise active in such desperate undertakings, and this in-direct opposition to the known Laws of God and this Kingdom; which must needs make our Church a Scorn to our Enemies the Papists, and a Shame and Reproach to all Protestant Churches abroad, and ren∣der the people of <HI>England</HI> odious to all the <HI>Crowned Heads in</HI> Europe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, I see you are very warm, and I hope, more than the cause deserves. You may Judge as favourably of the King's Proceedings, and as hardly of the Actions of the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy and People in this matter as you please. But yet I think I can make it as clear as the Day, that they have done nothing by joining in Arms with he Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> but what is justifiable by the Principles of Self preservation, the Fundamental Constitutions of the Government, and a just Zoal for their Religion and Civil Liberties, as they stand secured by our Laws; unless you would give the King a Power of making up Papists, and Slaves whenever he pleased. But as for your Doctrine of an Absolute <HI>Obedience without Reserve,</HI> and the Divine Right of Monarchy and Succession, you need not be much concerned whether the <HI>Papists</HI> laugh at you or no, since there are very few of them (if any) who are such Fools themselves as to believe such futilous Opinions. But indeed they have more reason to laugh at you whilst you maintain, than when you quit them; since as they have only rendered you a fit Object of their Scorn, so they would have made you but a more cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Sacrifice to their Malice. For what can Thieves desire more, than that those they design to Rob, should think it unlawful to resist them? And what could the <HI>Papists</HI> have wisht for more, than that our Hands being fotterred by this Doctrine of an indefinite Passive-Obedience, our Lives, Religion and Liberties should lye at their Mercy; Which how long we should have enjoyed, whenever they thought themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rong enough to take them away, the late cruel Persecutions, and Extirpations of the Protestants in <HI>France, Savey, Hungary,</HI> and other places have proved but too fatal Examples, and therefore no wonder (let your high∣flown
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
Church-men write or preach what they please) if the Body of the Nobility, Gentry, and People of <HI>England</HI> could never be perswaded to swallow Doctrines so fatal to their Religion, and destructive to their Civil Rights and Liberties both as Mon and Christians.</P>
<P>And as for the Antiquity of these Doctrines, I think they are so far from be∣ing the Antient Tenets of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that they are neither to be found in its Chatechism, Thirty Nine Articles, or Book of Homilies, taken in their true Sense and Meaning; thô indeed there is something that may tend that way in some of the late Church-Canons about fifty years ago, but <HI>I</HI> do not look upon them as the Antient Establisht Doctrine of our Church, because these Canons are not confirmed, but condemned by two Acts of Parliaments, and consequently never legally Established as they ought to be by the publick Saction of the King and Nation? Our Old Queen <HI>Elix</HI> Di∣vines,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Bilson <HI>of Christian Sub∣jection, Edi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 1586. <HI>p.</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9, 280.</NOTE> such as Bishop <HI>Bilson</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> being wholly ignorant of these Doctrines, nay, teaching in several places of their Writings the quite contrary. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was this Doctrine of absolute Subjection, and Non-Resistance ever generally maintained, until about the middle of King <HI>Iame</HI>'s Reign, when some Court Bishops and Divines began to make new Discoveries in Politicks as well as Divinity, and did by their Preaching and Writings affirm that the King had an absolute Power over Mens Estates.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hooke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s <HI>Ecclesi∣as.

<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
his Commands, but what is against the Law of God and Nature: And that Kings had Power to lay Pole Money upon their Subject Heads▪ But this much I have read, that this Sermon was Licensed by Dr. <HI>Laud</HI> then Bishop of St. <HI>Davids,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Archbishop</HI> Abbot<HI>'s Narra∣tive, R.

But as for this <HI>Sioth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rp,</HI> tho he lived long after, (even till the Kings Return) yet being (as Archbishop <HI>Abbot</HI> describes him) a man of but small Learning, I cannot learn that he was ever preferred higher than the Parsonages of <HI>Barchley,</HI> and in <HI>Northamptonshire.</HI></P>
<P>But I find a New Doctrine broach'd by some Modern Bishops and Divines about the middle of the Reign of King <HI>Iames</HI> the first. That Monarchy was of <HI>Divine Right, or Institution at least</HI>; so that any other Government was scarce warrantable or lawful; and of this New Sect we must more especially take notice of Sir <HI>R. F.</HI> who hath written several Treatises to prove this Do∣ctrine, and which is worse, That all Monarchs being Absolute, they cannot be limited or obliged either by Oaths, Laws or Contracts with their People,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. P. c.</HI> 3. § 7, 8.</NOTE> farther than they themselves shall think fit, or consistent with their supposed Prerogatives; of which they only are to be the Sole Judges: So that whoever will but consider from the Reign of our four last Kings, what strong inclinations they had to render themselves Absolute, and that few Divines, or Common, or Civil Lawyers were preferr'd in their Reigns to any considerable Place, either in Church or State,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Cowel<HI>'s In∣terpreter Titles King, Parliament, Prerogative.</HI></NOTE> who did not maintain these New Opinions both on the Bench and in the Pulpit: You need not wonder when the Stream of Court Preferment ran so strong that way, if so many were carried away with it; since it was but to expose themselves to certain mise∣ry, if not to utter ruin, to oppugn it. All who offered by Speaking or Wri∣ting to maintain the contrary, being branded with the odious Names of Puri∣tans, Common-wealths-men, Whigs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some of whom you may remem∣ber were not long since imprisoned, Fined, nay, Whipt for so doing. So that it was no wonder if there were but very few to be found who durst with so great hazard speak what they thought, nor could any thing but the imminent danger upon our Laws, Religion and Properties, proceeding from the Kings illegal practices have opened the Eyes of a great many Noblemen, Gentlemen and Clergy, who contrary to the Opinions so much lately in vogue, did generously venture both their Lives and Estates, to joyn their Arms with the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> against the King's unjust and violent Proceedings.</P>

<P>I do not doubt, notwithstanding all you have said, to prove before I have done, these Doctrines of Non-Resistance, and of the Divine institu∣tion of Monarchy to be most consonant to the Word of God, and to the Doctrine of the Primitive Church, and also to that of our Reformed Church of <HI>England.</HI> Nor were those Divines you mention in K. <HI>Iames</HI> the First's time, the Authors or▪ inventers of these Doctrines which were publickly received, and Decreed by both Houses of that Convocation which began in the first Year of K. <HI>Iames,</HI> and continued till the Year 1610. as appears by divers Ma∣nuscript
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
Copies of the Acts or Decrees of this Convocation, the Original of which was lately in the Library founded by Dr. <HI>Cousins</HI> late Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> besides a very fair Copy, now to be seen in the Archbishops Library at <HI>Lambeth:</HI> which if you please to peruse, you may be quickly satisfied that the Church of <HI>England</HI> (long before ever Sir <HI>R. F.</HI> writ thoses Treatises you mention) held that Civil Power was given by God to <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> and their Descendants, as also that absolute subjection and obedience was due to all Soveraign Powers, without any resistance; as claiming under those Original Charters: These Doctrines being there fully and plainly laid down and asserted, as the Doctrines of our Church: So that you deal very unjustly with the memory of those Divines, as also of Sir <HI>R. F.</HI> to make them the first breachers of it, whereas you may find that it was the opinion of the whole Convocation, for many years before ever those Divines, or that Gentleman began to Preach, or write upon this subject; Nor were these the only men who maintained these Principles, but Archbishop <HI>Usher</HI> and Bishop <HI>Sanderson,</HI> (whom I suppose you will not reckon among your flattering Court Bishops) have as learnedly and fully asserted those Doctrines, you so much condemn, as any of that party you find fault with, and have very well proved all resistance of the Supream Powers to be unlawful, not only in absolute but limited Monarchies Of the Truth of which you may sufficiently satisfie your self, if you will but take the Pains to read the Learned and Elaborate Treatises written by those good Bishops, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Lord Primate <HI>Usher</HI>'s Power of the Prince, and Obedience of the Subject, and the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s Preface before it, as also the said Bishop's Treatise <HI>de Iura nouto,</HI> written whilst he was Doctor of the Chair in <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>

<P>I must beg your pardon, Sir, if <HI>I</HI> have never yet seen or heard of that Convocation Book you mention, much less of the opinions therein contained, since there is no mention made of their proceedings, in any History or Record of those times either Ecclesiastical or Civil, as <HI>I</HI> know of. But this much I am certain of; That these Determinations or Decrees you mention, (call them which you please) never received the Royal Assent, much less the con∣firmation of the King and Parliament, one of which (if not both) is certain∣ly requisite to make any opinion either in Doctrine or Discipline to be received by us Lay-men for the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> otherwise the Ca∣nons made in 1640 would oblige us in Conscience, tho' they stand at this day <HI>condemned</HI> by Act of Parliament: so that however, even according to your own Principles, you cannot urge this Book as the Authoritative Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> unless their Determinations had received the Royal Assent: which you your self do not affirm they had, for you very well know that, as in Civil Laws, no Bill is any more than waste Parchment if once the King hath refused to give his Royal Assent to it, so likewise in Spiritual or Ecclesiastical matters, <HI>I</HI> think no Decrees or Determinations of Convocations are to be received, as binding either in points of Faith or Manners by us Lay∣men, till they have received the confirmation of the King, and the two Houses of Parliament; or otherwise the consequence would be, that if the King who hath the nomination of all the Bishopricks and Deaneries, as also of most of the great Prebendaries in <HI>England,</HI> of which the Convocation chiefly consists, should nominate such men into those places, which would agree with him to alter the present establisht Reformed Religion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Governmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and to bring in Popery or Arbitrary Power, the whole Kingdom would be obliged in Con∣science
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
to embrace it, or at least to submit without any contraditio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to those Canons the King and Convocation should thus agree to make, which of how fatal a consequence it might prove to the Reformed Religion in this Kingdom, this Kings choice of Bishops and Deans, such as he thought most fit for his turn, would have taught <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s when it had been too late.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You very must mistake me Sir, if you believe that I urge the Authority of this Book to you, as containing any Ecclesiastical Canons, which I grant must have the Royal Assent, but whether that of the two Houses of Parlia∣ment, I very much question, since the King without the Parliament is Head of the Church, and diverse Canons made under Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and King <HI>Iames</HI> are good in Law at this day, tho' they were never confirmed by Par∣liament. But I only urge the Authority of this Book to you, to let you see that these Doctrines are more Antient than the time you prescribe, and also that the Major part of the Bishops and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> held these Doctrines which you so much condemn, long before those Court Bishops or Divines you mention; medled with this controversie, and I sup∣pose we may as well quote such a Convocation Book, as a Testimony of their sense upon these subjects, as we do the <HI>French, Helvetian,</HI> or any other Protestant Churches Confessions of Faith, drawn up and passed in Synod of their Divines, tho' without any confirmation of the Civil Power.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you urge this Convocation Book only as a Testimony, and not Au∣thority, I shall not contend any further about it, but then let me tell you, that if the Canons or Decrees of a Convocation, though never so much con∣firmed by King and Parliament, do no further oblige in Conscience, than as they are agreable to the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, sure their deter∣minations without any such Authority can only be look'd upon as the Opi∣nions of so many particular private Men. And tho' I have a very great Re∣uerence for the Judgments of so many Learned Men; yet granting those Do∣ctrines you mention to be contained in this Book, I think notwithstanding, that we may justly examine them according to the Rules of Reason, and ex∣press Testimonies of Scripture, by either of which, when <HI>I</HI> see you can con∣vince me of the falshood of my Tenets, <HI>I</HI> shall count my self happy to be be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er informed. But as for those Treatises of Bishop <HI>Us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI> and Bishop <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anderson</HI> which you now mentioned, I must needs confess they are learned∣ly and elaborately writen, and tho' I am against Rebellion as much as any man, and do believe that subjects may too often be guilty of it, yet am I not therefore convinced that it is absolutely unlawful in all cases whatso∣ever, even in the most Absolute and Arbitrary sort of Civil Government, for the People when violently and intolerably opprest, to take up Arms and resist such unjust violence, or to join with any Foraign Prince who will be so generous as to take upon him their deliverance. So that though I freely ac∣knowledge that those good Bishops you mention, were very Pious and Learn∣ed men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat I bear great reverence to their memories, yet doth it not therefore follow, that <HI>I</HI> must o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> them to be Infallible, or as great Poli∣titians as they were Learned Divines; or that they understood the Laws of <HI>England</HI> as well as they did the Scriptures or Fathers; and perhaps there may be a great deal, more said on their behalfe than can be for divers others, who have since W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>een and Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> so much upon those subjects, for if you
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
please to consider the times of their writing those Treatises, you will find them written about the beginning or middle of the late Civil Wars, which they sup∣posed to be beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and carried on contrary to all Law and Justice, under the pretenced Authority of the two Houses of Parliament, against King <HI>Charles</HI> the First; and therefore it is no wonder if they thought themselves obliged to Write very high, for the Prerogatives and Rights of Princes, and the abso∣lute obedience of Subjects when they saw even the Kings just and lawful Pre∣rogatives in danger to be taken from him by force. And altho' they may per∣haps stretch several of these points too far, yet this may be very excuseable, since it is a hard matter to Write so exactly against any error, as not to fall into the contrary Extream, which nevertheless may sometimes prove useful enough: As those who would set a stick straight are forced to bend it to the other side: and so these Doctrines which might then be seasonable, whilst the People carried on their animosities against the King, farther than in Justice they ought, have not now the same reason and cogency, when this King hath so manifestly endea∣voured to pull up the very foundations both of our Religion and Government▪ So that I am perswaded, could those good Bishops have lived by the course of Nature to our times, and have seen the ill and fatal use hath been made of those Doctrines by those in Power, they would either absolutely have renounc'd them, or at least have been very cautious how they publish't such doubtful opinions to the World.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must beg your pardon Sir, if I am not of your Opinion, for I look upon the absolute subjection of the subjects to the higher or supream Powers to be a thing of such constant and eternal Obligation, that no change of times or circumstances can ever dispense with us in, or discharge us from it; and I am so far from believing that those good Bishops would ever have recanted their opinions in this particular, that had th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y lived until this time, I think they could not, without the imputation of time servers, have forborn publickly to declare and maintain them: for sure we must not deny or lay aside true Principles, because of some inconveniences or hardships that may thereby happen to our Religion, Persons or Civil Liberties, since that were the ready way to give a Licence to the rankest Rebellion, and the highest disobedience to the Supream Powers, for so the Primitive Christians might have claimed a right to Rebel against the Heathen Emperors, pretending they were not bound to submit themselves unto them, because they persecuted Gods Church, and put the Christians to death for no other reason than that they were such. Whereas we may plainly see St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> teach us another lesson, and command <HI>absolute subjection without reserve</HI> to the higher Powers, which were then the Tyrannical persecuting Emperours, and that the Primitive Christians, who immediately followed the Apostles, understood them in this sense; and altho' they had sufficient strength, yet thought it unlawful to resist those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea∣then Emperor's under which they liv'd. I refer you to that vast Treasure of Quotations, out of the Fathers and Antient Church Historians, collected with such Learning and Industry by the Lord Primate <HI>Usher</HI> in the second Trea∣tise.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not my intention Sir, at present to fall into a severe examination of so many Texts of Scripture and Quotations of Fathers and other Authors, as are made use of by those Learned Men you lately mentioned, which require
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
more consideration than our short time will now afford, therefore the best me∣thod I can propose to you for the true stating and understanding this Noble Con∣troversie, were <HI>first</HI> to look into the Natural state of Mankind, after the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> and enquire, <HI>First,</HI> If God has appointed any kind of Government by <HI>Divine Institution</HI> before another. <HI>Secondly,</HI> If he has not; how far Civil power may be lookt upon as from God, and in what sense, as deriv'd from the people. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Whether Resistance by the Subjects, in some Cases, be incompatible and absolutely destructive to all Civil Government whatsoever. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> Whether such Resistance be absolutely contrary to the Doctrine of Christ contain'd in the Scriptures, and that of the Primitive Church pursuant thereunto. <HI>Fifthly,</HI> Whether such Resistance be contrary to the Constitution of this Government. and the express Laws of the Land. <HI>Sixthly,</HI> Whether what has been done by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and those of the Nobility, Gentry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in pursuance of these Principles, has been done according to the Law of Nature, the Scrip∣tures, and Ancient Constitutions of this Kingdom; which material Points, if we can once suttle, and discover where the Truth lyes, it will prove the clearest Comment and best Interpretation of all those places of Scripture, and Quo∣tations of Fathers, and other Authors which are Cited by Divines or other Writers, for the Doctrines of the <HI>Divine Institution</HI> of <HI>Monarchy,</HI> and the Absolute Subjection of Subjects without any Resistance. For when we have once discovered what the Law of Nature or right Reason dictates; I think we may rest satisfy'd that that is the true Sense of the Scripture: God not having given us any Precept or Command, in Moral, or Practical things, that can be contrary to the Law of Nature or Reason; or incompatible with the happiness and welfare of Mankind in this Life; as the Reveal'd Will of God does chiefly regard that which is to come.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do very well approve of your Proposal, and therefore pray give me first your Opinion on those Heads, that I may see how far I may agree with you, and wherein I must differ from you; for I do assure you my Intention is not to argue with you meerly for disputes sake, but that we may correct the Errors of each others understanding, and discover, if it be possible, where the Truth lyes; therefore pray Sir, begin <HI>first</HI> with the Natural state of Mankind, but re∣member to do it like a Christian, and one that believes that we are all deriv'd from one <HI>first Parents,</HI> and that we did not at first spring up out of the Earth like Mushrooms, or as the Men whom <HI>Ovid</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eigns to have been produc'd of the Dragons Teeth <HI>Cadmus</HI> is feigned to have sown, who as soon as they sprung out of the Earth, immediately fell a Fighting and Killing each other.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you Sir for your honest and kind advice, and shall therefore in the <HI>first place</HI> suppose, that the necessity as well as being of all Civil Go∣vernment, proceeded from the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> since if that had not been, we had still liv'd as the Poets fancy Men did under the Golden Age, without any need of Kings or Common-wealths to make Laws against Oppression, Theft, Adultery, Murder, and those other Injuries which Men are now too apt in this lapsed corrupt state to commit against each other, much less would there have been any need of Judges or Executioners, either to sen∣tence or punish Offenders, for if Man had continued as free from Sin as he was in Paradise, there could have been no need of a Supream Coercive Power, since every Man would have perform'd his Duty towards God and
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
his Neighbour without any punishment or constraint, So that all the Au∣thority that can be suppos'd could have been then necessary for the Good and Happiness of Mankind, would have been no more than that of the Hus∣band over his Wife, or that of Parents over their Children, the former of which would not have been an Absolute Coercive power neither, but rather such a power as his understanding then had over the inferiour Faculties of his Soul, join'd with a <HI>voluntary submission of her will to his,</HI> the Coercive power of the Husband, and his more absolute Rule over her being conferr'd by God on <HI>Adam,</HI> and in him on all his posterity after the Fall, for the regula∣ting and restraining the unreasonable desires and passions of the Woman, which then began to exert and shew themselves in her; and as for paternal Authority, that would have been so far from being Coercive, that Children having no Inclination to disorder either in their Wills, Appetites or Passions, there would have been so little need of punishments, that they would not have required so much as reproof or correction: God having planted the Laws of Nature or Reason in every Mans Breast, then free from Rebellions Motions against it, so that Children then could have had no more to do, than to pay their Parents all that Gratitude. Duty and Obedience which was due to them, as the subordinate Causes of their Being, which could on∣ly consist in performing those indifferent things, which they then would have had occasion to command them, since Mankind being Immortal, and the Earth bringing forth of it self all Necessaries for Humane Life, there could have been no occasion of attending and relieving their Parents when Sick, Old or Decrepit, and unable to keep themselves; and so likewise upon the same grounds all other Men would have been equal by Nature, in respect of any civil difference; for when there was no necessity of Mens Service, there would have been no distinction between Master and Servant: But after the Fall, the stare of Mankind was altered, and Self-love, and the desire of Self-preservation grew so strong and exorbitant above all Natural Equity, that the inordinate passions of Men blinding their Reasons, they began to think they had a Right, not only to the Necessaries of Life, but to whatever their unruly Appetites d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sired, or that they thought they could make themselves Masters of. To remedy which Inconveniences, I suppose the Fathers and Masters of Families, and other Freemen (in whom alone then resided that little Government that then was in the World) were forced after some time to agree upon one or more Men into whose hands they might resign all their particular powers, and to make Laws for the due Governing and Re∣straining those disorderly Appetites and Passions, and also endowing them with a sufficient Authority to put them in Execution: But which of the Go∣vernments now extant, or that have been formerly, were Prior in Nature, I think cannot well be known; whether it was a Monarchy, or an Aristocra∣cy, consisting of all the Heads or Fathers of Families, or Freemen, is not material since the <HI>SS.</HI> are silent in it; but it being sufficient to suppose, that it was at first begun by the perswasion or mediation of some one or more Wise and Vertuous persons, and was consented to by thy whole num∣ber, consisting of many Families, who were sensible of those great Inconve∣niences and Mischiefs they lay under for want of Civil Government. But be it which way it will, 'tis most certain that it was <HI>principally intended by God, for the God and Preservation of the Governed, and not for the Greatness or Advantage of the Person or Parsons appointed t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> since
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
God designed all Civil Government for the restraining of Mans inordinate Passions and Lusts after the Fall, and procuring by sufficient rewards and puni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ments, that Peace and Happiness which could now no longer be obtained by Mens Natural Inclinations to that which was equitable and honest; and besides, it is absolutely impossible to suppose, that any great number of people not pressed by the Invasion of a powerful Enemy from abroad▪ (which could not be supposed in this early Age of the World) would ever be brought to consent to put themselves under the absolute power of others, but for their own greater Good and Preservation, or to part with their Natural Liberty without advantaging themselves at all by the Change.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not take upon me to assert, after what manner Mankind would have been governed in case our First Parents had continued in their Primi∣tive state of Innocency; But this much I think I may boldly affirm in op∣position to what you have already said, that Civil Government after the Fall was not alike in all the Fathers and Masters of Families, but that <HI>Adam</HI> alone was by God endued with it, as the great Father and Monarch of Man∣kind; so that not only Civil Power, <HI>in genere,</HI> but in <HI>specie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R. F. A. M M. p.</HI> 254, 255.</NOTE> <HI>(viz.)</HI> Monarchical, was immediately after the Creation conferred by God upon him. And <HI>Adam</HI> was Monarch of the whole World even before he had any Subjects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, not to interrupt you, it seems somewhat hard to conceive how <HI>Adam</HI> could be a Father before he had Children, or a Monarch before he had Sub∣jects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you please to consider it, you will find no absurdity at all in this Assertion. For though I confess there could be no actual Government without Subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> nor Fatherhood without Sons; yet by the Right of Nature it was due to <HI>Adam</HI> to be Governour of the World, when as yet he had neither Sons, nor Subjects, so though not in act, yet at least in habit, or in <HI>Potentia</HI> (as they say in the Schools) <HI>Adam</HI> was a King, and a Father, from his Creation, and even in the state of Innocency, he had been Governour over his Wife and Children; for the Integrity, or Excellency of the Subjects doth not take away the Order, or Eminency of the Governour: For <HI>Eve</HI> was subject to <HI>Adam</HI> before he sinned, and the Angels who are of a most pure Nature, and cannot Sin, are yet Subjects to God, and perform all his Commands: Which will serve to con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ute what you say in Derogation of Civil Government, or Power, that it was introduced by Sin, or the Fall of Man. Government, I grant as to co-active Power, was not till after Sin, because Co-action supposeth some disorder which was not in the state of Innocency; but as for directive Government, the State of Humane Nature requires it; since Civil Society cannot be imagined with∣out a Power of Government. For although as long as Men continued in the State of Innocency, they might not need the direction of <HI>Adam</HI> in those things that were necessarily and morally to be done. Yet things indifferent that depended meerly on their Free-will, might well be directed by <HI>Adam</HI>'s sole Com∣mand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, give me leave to settle this Point-between us, before you proceed farther, and I doubt not when you better consider what I say, you will not think we have any just occasion to differ. So far then you and I are agreed, that even before the Fall, <HI>Adam</HI> was superior over his Wife and
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Children, and that they owed him, not only Gratitude and Respect, as a Parent, but also Obedience in all indifferent things: Yet I deny that this Power or Sup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iority of <HI>Adam</HI> over his Wife and Children, was at all a De∣spotical or Civil Power, but meerly Oeconomical, for the Good and Con∣venience of <HI>Adam,</HI> and the well ordering and preservation of his Family; which you will easily grant, if you please to consider what are the Essential Differences of Civil Government from Oeconomical. Now the Essential Pro∣perties of Civil Government consist in preserving and defending the Subjects, both in War and Peace, from Forreign Enemies, and Intestine Injurie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Invasions of Mens Persons or Properties, and in revenging and punishing all such Transgressions by Death, or other Punishments, and consequently in making Laws concerning Property, and for restraining all Robberies, Mur∣ders, and the like▪ Now, in the state of Innocency there could be no need of any of these Essential Functions of Civil Power; for your self must grant, that Man was then not apt to Sin, and immortal; so that all Laws about Peach or War, Punishments of Offences, publick Judgments concerning <HI>Meum, &amp; Tuum,</HI> and all Injuries, were absolutely needless, and had never been in Nature, if <HI>Adam</HI> had not sinned; and then how you can call this Authority, or Supe∣riority (which I grant <HI>Adam</HI> had over his Wife and Children) Civil Power, I can by no means understand.</P>
<P>But I do utterly deny, that even after the Fall, <HI>Adam</HI> was a Monarch, or <HI>Sole</HI> and <HI>Absolute Lord</HI> over the whole Earth, and all Creatures therein contained; and desire you to give me such plain proofs of it, either from Reason, or Scrip∣ture, that I need no more doubt of it, than your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall first of all give you an Argument drawn from the Reason of the thing▪ and in the next place, the Authority of Scripture, for my Opinion: and first, I think it is evident, that every Man that is Born, is so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at from being Free, that by his very Birth he becomes a Subject of him that begets him; and even <HI>Groti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mself acknowledges that, <HI>Generatione <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us acquiritur in liberos.</HI> And indeed, the Act of Begetting, being that which makes a Man a Father, his Right of a Father over his Children, can Naturally arise from nothing else; and the same Author in another pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce hath these words upon the Fourth Com∣mandment, <HI>Parentum nomine, qui naturales luns Magistraus, etiam alios Rectores par est iutelligi▪ quorum authoritas Soci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tatem humanam continet:</HI> And if Parents be natural Magistrates, Children must needs he Born Natural Subjects. So that, not only <HI>Adam,</HI> but the succeeding Patriarchs had, by Right of Fatherhood, Regal Authority over their Children, as may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by divers Testimonies out of Scr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pture, and therefore at is very reasonable that all Fathers should have a Power over the Lives of their Children, since it is to them that they owe their Life, Being and Education; and I think that even the Power which God himself exerciseth over Mankind, is by Right of Fatherhood.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before you come to Scripture, give me leave, in the first place to exa∣mine your first Argument, which you deduced from the Law of Nature or Reason: For I doubt, if you please better to consider of it, you will and that so light and Transitory an▪ Action, as that of Generation, canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> give any Man an absolute Property and Dominion over the Person and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fe of those whom he Begets; <HI>since sew Men do principally intend the giving of a Being
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
to another, so much <UNCLEAR>as</UNCLEAR> they do their own pleasure, in that Action</HI>; nor do we owe our Lives (properly speaking) to our Parents, but to God, who is the true and original Cause of our Being, though it is true, he makes use of our Parents as Physical, though not as Moral Means, or Instruments for that end; since it doth not lye in their power to hinder their Generating of Children, if they perform the Acts necessary thereunto; so that both the an∣tecedent and the consequent are altogether false, <HI>viz.</HI> That Parents give their Children, Life and Being, and that therefore they have and absolute power over their Lives and Persons; which if it were true, would give the Mother an equal Title to the Lives of the Children, as the Father, seeing they owe their Lives as much to the one as the other: Which power in the Mother, I am sure you will not admit of. But as for what you say concern∣ing the power of Fathers, arising from Education, though I confess that is a much better Title than the other: Yet doth it not follow, that, because by reason of my Parents care of me before I was able to help my self, I owe my preservation and well being to them; that therefore they are to be per∣petual and absolule Lords over my Person and Life: Since by thus breeding me up, they only perform'd that Duty, and Trust which God had laid upon them, for the good and preservation of Manking, and which they could not without committing a Sin, either refuse or decline, and therefore their Authority or Power over my Person, being only for my well-being, can extend no farther tan whilst I am not of years of discretion to understand the true means of my own good and preservation: And though I grant that I am bound in gratitude to return this Care and Kindness by all Acts of Duty and Piety towards them, as long I live; yet doth it not therefore follow, thar they are Masters of my Life, and of all that I have; since this were to take away more than they themselves ever gave▪ and though I should grant you that even the Power which God himself exerciseth over Mankind is by Right of Fatherhood; yet this Fatherhood is such,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. T. G. c.</HI> 5. <HI>p.</HI> 69.</NOTE> as utterly excludes all pretence of Title in Earthly Parents; for he is our King, because he is indeed maker of us all, which no Natural Parents can pretend to be of their Children: but if you please more closely to consider your own Argument, you will find that he will quite destroy your Hypothesis. For if all Fathers have an absolute power over their Children, by Generations, then <HI>Adam</HI> could only have power over his own Children which he begat, and none at all over his Grand-Children, since their Fathers by this Argument of Gene∣ration ought to have had the same power over their Children, which <HI>A∣dam</HI> had over them, for the same reason: So that this Monarchical Power of <HI>Adam</HI> as a Father could extend no farther than one Genera∣tion</P>

<P>I shall not further urge this Argument of Generation, since I see you are not satisfied with it; but this much I think I can clearly prove from Scripture, that <HI>Adam</HI> was Lord over the Persons and Lives of his Wife and Children, by vertue of that command which God gave <HI>Eve,</HI> Gen. 3. v. 16. <HI>Unto the Woman he said, I will greatly mutilply thy sorrow and thy Conception; In sorrow thou shalt bring forth Children, and thy desire shall be to thy Husband, and he shall rule over thee.</HI> From which words it appears that <HI>Adam</HI> had not only an absolute Power granted him by God over his Wife, but all the posterity that should be born of her. For in the first place it here
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
appears that <HI>Eve</HI> was to yield an absolute subjection to her Husband; who was to rule over her as her Lord, from these Words, <HI>and thy desire shall be</HI> [subject] <HI>to thy Husband,</HI> (as it is better exprest in the Margin) <HI>and he shall rule over thee.</HI> And if his Wife was thus to be subject to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P.</HI> § 21.</NOTE> then likewise by a party of reason all her Children were to be so too: it being a maxime in the Law of Na∣ture, as well as in the Civil Law, that <HI>Partus sequitur ventrem</HI>: so that if <HI>Eve</HI> was to be absolutely subject to <HI>Adam,</HI> the Issue by her must be so too, as in the case of a <HI>Master of a she Slave,</HI> not only the person of the Woman, but all that are begotten of her either by her master or any other man, are likewise his servants, otherwise the Children would be in a better condition than their Mother, for <HI>Adam</HI> having no Superiour but God, both his Wife and Children must have been a like subject to him. There is likewise another rule in the Civil Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> § 32.</NOTE> which is a voice of Nature too, <HI>quicquid ex me, &amp; uxore mea nascitur, in potestate mea est,</HI> and tho this is true in some sense in all Fathers whatsoever; yet it was so in a more superlative degree, where the Father had no Supe∣riour over him but God; as <HI>Adam</HI> had not;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> § 20, 21.</NOTE> and farther it seems apparent to me from the very method that God us'd in Creating Mankind that <HI>Adam</HI>'s Wife and Children should be subject to him: for if <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> had been Created at once, it could not have been known which of these two had the best right to com∣mand, and which was to obey. For <HI>Adam's</HI> strength or wit alone, would not have given him any Authority over her, and it might be that <HI>Eve</HI> was as strong and as wise as he, or at least she mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht have thought her self so, and if these two had differ'd and fought, nought but the event could have declared which of them should have been Master.</P>
<P>So when they had Children born between them, the Children could have told as little which of the Parents they should have obey'd, in case they had differ'd in their commands: so that it had been impossible this way that any Government could have been in the World. But when God Created only one Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> § 22.</NOTE> and out of him one Woman was made, sure he had some great design in this, for no other Creature was thus made at twice but Man.<NOTE PLACE="marg">§ 24. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.12, 13</NOTE> Now St. <HI>Paul</HI> shews a reason for Gods acting thus, when he says, the Woman should not Teach, nor usurp Authority over the Man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And mark the reason; for <HI>Adam</HI> was Created and then <HI>Eve.</HI> So that in the Apostles Judgment this was one main cause why <HI>Adam</HI> should be Superiour to his Wife, and all other Hus∣bands to their Wives;<NOTE PLACE="marg">§ 25.</NOTE> and in the <HI>Corinthians</HI> from the Hi∣story of the Creation the same Apostle deduces two other Reasons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.8, 9.</NOTE> for the Superiority of the Man over the Woman. <HI>For</HI> (says he) <HI>the Man is not of the Woman, but the Woman of the Man</HI>; (that is, <HI>Eve</HI> was formed out of <HI>Adam</HI>) <HI>neither was the Man Created for the Woman, but the Woman for the Man:</HI> So that you see here is <HI>Adam</HI> stated in a degree Superiority over his Wife before the Fall: and immediately after it, God again renewed <HI>Adam</HI>'s Title,<NOTE PLACE="marg">§ 26.</NOTE> when he told <HI>Eve</HI> (as I have but now mention'd) <HI>thy desire shall be subject to thy Husband, and he shall rule ever thee</HI>; now I so far agree with what you at first lay'd down; that if the fall
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
had not disordered her faculties, and rendered her apt and prone to disobey her Husband, this command need not have been given her, but she would have known her duty from the order and end of the Creation, without this explicite positive Command.</P>

<P>You have Sir, taken a great deal of pains to prove that which I do not at all deny, that as well before as after the Fall, <HI>Adam</HI> (and consequently all other Husbands and Fathers) ought to be Superiour to their Wives and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hil∣dren, and likewise Govern and Command them in all things relating to their own good and that of the Family, as long as they continue Members of it: nay, that after Children are separated from their Fathers Family, they still owe their Parents all the gratitude, duty, and respect imaginable; but yet I deny that this power which <HI>Adam</HI> had over <HI>Eve,</HI> and his Issue by her, and all other Husbands have over their Wives and Children, is a regal despotical power, or any more than Conjugal in respect of his Wife, and Paternal in respect of the Children, nor is that filial reverence: and obedience which Children yield their Fathers, the same with that respect and duty which a Wife owes her Hus∣band, or the same with that servile subjection which slaves owe their Lord and Master; neither is the duty of a Wife of the same kind with that which Sons pay their Fathers, or Slaves their Lords; nor did <HI>Sarah</HI> when she called <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> Lord (who was then Master of a separate Family, and so subject to none) ever suppose that her Husband had the same Authority over her as he had over <HI>Hagar</HI> her Bond-woman, to sell her, or turn her out of doors at his pleasure: but to make it more apparent to you, that this power granted to <HI>Adam</HI> over <HI>Eve,</HI> was not regal nor despotical, but only conjugal, and for the well ordering of the Family, where some one must command in chief, and the rest obey to avoid confusion, will appear, first, If you consider that this Subjection of <HI>Eve</HI> to <HI>Adam</HI> was not enjoyn'd till after the Fall, and is part of Gods Judg∣ments denounc'd against Her, for tempting Her Husband to eat the forbid∣den Fruit, and certainly included somewhat more than that Superiority which he had over her by his Creation, or else God should not have made it any part of the Judgment denounc'd upon her. If this submission she ow'd to her Husband before the Fall, had been of the same Nature with that Subjection she was to be under after it; which yet I take to be neither servile nor absolute, but only a conjugal Obedience or Submission of her will to his, in all things Relating to the Government of the Family and the carriage of her self; though I do not deny but the Husband may sometimes restrain her by force▪ in case she carries her self unchastly, or indiscreetly, to the loss of her Reputation, and prejudice of his Interest, when she will not be directed, or advis'd by his persua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, or commands, which before the Fall when she was in a state of Innocency there was no need of; since, (as your self grant) before the Fall she know what was her duty, and per∣formed it without any force or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And therefore that Text which you have now quoted out of <HI>Genesis, thy desire shall be [Subject] to thy Husband, and he shall rule over thee,</HI> is not fairly cited, for as for the Marginal addition, <HI>viz.</HI> [<HI>Subject</HI>] to thy Husband, it is not warranted from the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣brew Original or Version of the LXX. The Hebrew having no more than (<HI>thy desire shall be to thy Husband</HI>) which the LXX renders <HI>i. e.</HI> the conversion or inclination of the desire; by which some Interpreters understand no more than the carnal Appetite: so likewise <HI>from the words
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
(rule over thee)</HI> they likewise observe that <HI>Moses</HI> makes use of the same Hebrew word, when he makes mention of the Sun and Moon ruling the Day and Night, tho they do not do it by any violence, or corporeal force; so likewise by this ruling of the Husband, is not to be understood any absolute, despotick power, whereby he hath a right to dispose of the person and actions of his Wife in all things at his pleasure, but that she may in many cases refuse, nay controul his commands, and resist his actions, in case they prove unlawful or destructive to her self and Children.</P>
<P>But that this Argument of St. <HI>Paul</HI> of the Husband's Superiority over his Wife, was not granted to <HI>Adam</HI> alone, but equally extends to all Husbands whatsoever, appears from the very Text it self, or otherwise St <HI>Paul</HI> had argu∣ed very impertinently of the duty of all Wives; and if so, it will follow that every one of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sons as soon as he took a Wife, had the like Authority over her as <HI>Adam</HI> had over their Mother; And if over their Wives, then by your Maxims (of <HI>partus sequitur ventrein</HI>) <HI>&amp; quicquid e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me &amp; uxore mea nasci∣tur, in potestate mea est,</HI> all the Sons of <HI>Adam</HI> must have had the same Power over their Children as their Father had over them: So that the same conse∣quence will still follow from theses places of Scripture, and also from you Civil Law Maxims, that either <HI>Adam</HI> had no Civil, or Despotick Power over his Wife, and Children, or else, if he had, that every one of his Sons when Married, an separated from his Fathers Family had the same, and consequently there were as many Princes as distinct Masters of Families, and then what would become of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Monarchy, I give you leave to Judge.</P>

<P>I must beg your pardon if I am not satisfied with your answer to my last argument: For I am still of opinion notwithstanding what you have said, that <HI>Eve</HI> was to yield an absolute subjection to her Husband, from that place already cited, <HI>That her</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> Eve's) <HI>desire</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> will) <HI>should be subject to her Hus∣band,</HI> &amp;c. To which you answer that this subjection of <HI>Eve</HI> to <HI>Adam,</HI> was not the same which Sons owe their Fathers, or Slaves to their Lords; And that <HI>Eve</HI> owed <HI>Adam,</HI> not a filial, or servile, but a conjugal subjection.</P>
<P>For I would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain know the difference in the State of Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P.</HI> § 27, 28.</NOTE> be∣tween one and the other: For if you please to compare that place of <HI>Genesiis,</HI> I but now quoted with that other, where God gives <HI>Cain</HI> power over <HI>Abel</HI> his Younger Brother, you will find them the same in words as also in sense. For in this God likewise tells <HI>Cain, That unto thee, shall his desire be subject and thou shalt rule over him.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 4.7.</NOTE> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure God could not intend by these words, that <HI>Abel</HI> should yield a Conjugal, but a filial subjection to his elder Brother, and these words are not capable of two senses, but must be understood a like in both places (<HI>i. e.</HI>) That the Desire (which is a Faculty of the Soul, and that the most active too) was to be subject, and the body, and all the Powers of it, were to be over-ruled by him▪ which is as full and absolute a subjection as can be ex∣press'd in words; and whereas you say that these words were not spoken till after the Fall, and thence seem to infer, that <HI>Eve</HI> did not owe <HI>Adam</HI> so much as a Conjugal Subjection before that; St. <HI>Paul</HI> hath given you an answer to that already, which it is needless to repeat, and therefore upon the whole matter I think your distinction of a Conjugal Subjection different from a Filial or Servile one, will signifie nothing,</P>

<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not, Sir, but I shall be able to make good this distinction of a Servile and a Filial Obedience, and in order to it, shall reply to the consequence you have made, for <HI>Eve</HI>'s absolute subjection to <HI>Adam</HI> from the like Expression used by God to <HI>Cain,</HI> concerning his ruling over his Brother <HI>Abel,</HI> as is us'd here to <HI>Eve</HI> concerning her Subjection to her Husband; and that because the Subjection of <HI>Abel</HI> was absolute, that therefore her Subjection must be so too. I must crave your pardon if I deny your Assumption; for I think I am able to prove, that neither <HI>Abel,</HI> nor any other younger Brother, was, or is obliged, by vertue of this Text to yield an absolute Obedience to his Elder Brother, in the state of Nature or that he is therefore his Lord and Master. Nor can I see any absurdity, but that the same words might be spoken to several Persons, yet in different senses, which according to the Nature of the Persons to whom they were spoken might have different Effects. As here these words when spoken to <HI>Eve</HI> enjoyn a Conjugal Submission of <HI>Eve</HI>'s Will to <HI>Adam</HI> as her Husband, but when spoken to <HI>Abel</HI> they may signifie a Fraternal Submission of <HI>Abel</HI>'s Will to <HI>Cain</HI>'s as the Elder, and perhaps the wiser of the two, but without giving any absolute or despotick power over either.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot be yet satisfied with your Reply; for methinks this is but to play the Fool, and trifle with God's Word, when he told <HI>Cain</HI> thy Brother's desire shall be Subject to thee, that is, (<HI>say you,</HI>) Thou shalt rule over him only as far as he thinks sir, or if thou hast the knack to wheedle or perswade him: Was not this a mighty matter for God Almighty to appear to <HI>Cain</HI> about? An Ex∣cellent and Rational way to appease his Wrath towards his Brother? Whereas God here plainly enjoyneth a subjection from <HI>Abel</HI> to his Elder Brother, and if so, by Vertue of the same words, a like Subjection of <HI>Eve</HI> to <HI>Adam,</HI> and then it will likewise follow, that as the streams are of the same Nature with the Fountain, the Subjection of all her Posterity will likewise be included in hers, which I have sufficiently proved already, had you not mistaken the true sense of those two Maxim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I laid down. For first, if <HI>Partus sequitur vontrem▪</HI> and the Mother be a Subject, as <HI>Eve</HI> was, all her Posterity must be so to all Genera∣tions. And if <HI>Quicquid ex me &amp; uxore mea nascitur in potestate mea est</HI> be true, then <HI>Adam</HI>'s Grand-Children, and Great-Grand-Children, deriving them∣selves from him and <HI>Eve,</HI> must be likewise under <HI>Adam</HI>'s power. Nor ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I see how his Sons, or Grand-Children, by setting up separate Families, could ever discharge themselves from this absolute Subjection to <HI>Adam,</HI> since they could never have quitted his Family without his consent; and when they did quit it, unless he pleased to manumit them, they, their Wives and Children, were still as much Subject as they were before. Since I do not see if they were once Sub∣jects to him, how any thing but his express will, and consent could ever discharge them from it. Nor was that Authority (which every one of these Sons of <HI>Adam</HI> might Exercise over their Wives and Children, though they were not freed from the power of their Father) any more inconsistent with that Subjection and Obedience they owed him, as their Prince, than in an absolute Monar∣chy, the power of Fathers, and Husbands, over their Wives and Children, as to the things relating to the well-ordering and governing their Families, is inconsistent with that supreme predominant power which the Monarch hath over the Father himself, and all his Family, or than the power of a Master of a Family, in the Isle of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> over his Slaves that are Married, and
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
have Children, is inconsistent with that Marital and Paternal power which such a Slave may exercise over his Wife and Children within his own Family, though still subordinate to the will of the Master, who may forbid any such Slaves, or their Children to Marry, but where he hath a mind they should and may like∣wise hinder them, from correcting or putting to Death their Wives and Children without his consent. Though such Subjects in an absolute Monarchy, or Slaves in a Plantation cannot have or enjoy any Property in Lande or Goods but at the Monarchs, or Masters will▪ And so likewise at first none of these Sons of <HI>Adam,</HI> though they set up distinct Families from their Fathers, could enjoy or inclose any part of the Earth without his Grant or Assignment to whom the whole was given by God before.</P>
<P>It seems likewise to be a great mistake, when you at first affirmed that all Civil Government was Ordained by God, for the benefit and advantage of the Subjects, rather than the Governours. Whereas from the first and most Natural Government it appears that Children who were the Subjects were Or∣dained as much for the benefit and help of their Parents, who were the first Monarchs, as their Parents for them. From all which we may draw these Conclusions:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. A. M. M. p.</HI> 244.</NOTE> First, that from <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. <HI>v.</HI> 6. already Cited, we have the Original Charter of Government, and the Fountain of all Civil Power derived from <HI>Adam</HI> as the Father of all Mankind. So that not only the Constitution of power in general, but the special limitation of it to one kind, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Monarchy, and the determination of it, to the individual person of <HI>Adam,</HI> are all Ordinances of God. Neither had <HI>Eve</HI> or her Children any Right to limit <HI>Adam'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Power, or joyn themselves with him in the Government. Now if this Supreme Power was setled, and sounded by God himself in Fatherhood, how is it possible for the people to have any Right to alter, or dispose of it otherwise; it being God's Ordinance that this Supremacy▪ should be unlimited in <HI>Adam,</HI> and as large as any Acts of his Will. So that he was not only a Father, but a King and absolute Lord over his Family; a Son, a Subject, and a Servant, or Slave, being one and the same thing at first, the Father having power to dispose of or sell his Children or Servants at his pleasure;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. P. O.

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have, Sir, made a very long Speech upon the Monarchical power of <HI>Adam,</HI> which you have made of so large an Extent, that this imaginary Kingship will swallow up all the other more dear and tender Relations both of a Husband, and of a Father▪ So that were I not satisfied you were a very good natured Man, and spoke more the sense of others than from your own Natural Inclinations, I should be apt to believe that if you had suffi∣cient Power you would prove as great a Tyrant over your Wife, Children, and all that should be under your Command; as such Arbitrary Tenets would give you leave; but since I hope your Errour lyes rather in your Understanding, than in your Nature<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I shall make bold to shew you the mistakes you have committed in those Principles you here lay down. I might first begin with the place of Scripture you farther insist upon; for <HI>Eve</HI>'s absolute Subjection to <HI>Adam</HI> from the like Expression used by God to
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
<HI>Cain</HI> concerning his ruling over his Brother <HI>Abel,</HI> as is us'd here to <HI>Eve,</HI> and tho' you are pleased to think my exposition of this place so ridiculous; yet I doubt not but I be able to prove, when I come to speak of this pretended Divine Author of Elder Brothers over this younger, that this place cannot be under∣stood in any such sense, according to the best Interpretation that both the reason of the Subject, and the sense the best Commentators put upon it can allow▪ but I shall defer this till we come to discourse concerning the successors of <HI>Adam</HI> in this Monarchical Power you suppose. And therefore I shall only at present pursue that absolute Power, which you suppose <HI>Adam</HI> to have had, not only over <HI>Eve,</HI> but all her descendants. So that your Argument of <HI>Eve</HI>'s, and consequently all her Childrens, absolute Subjection to <HI>Adam,</HI> depends upon a very false supposition. For if the Subjection of <HI>Eve</HI> to <HI>Adam,</HI> and of all Wives to their Husbands is not servile or absolute, neither can that of the Chil∣dren be so, since according to your own simile, if the streams are of the same nature of the Fountain, they can never rise higher than it, and tho' I grant, <HI>Adam</HI> might in some cases have put his Wife or Children to death, for any enormous crime against the Law of Nature, yet I allow him that power, not as a Husband or Father, but only as a Lord or Master of a separate Family, who having no Superiour in the state of Nature, I grant it is endued by God with this Prerogative, for the good of his Family, and preservation of Mankind, lest such horrid crimes, so much to its prejudice should pass unpunisht. But that the Husband or Father doth not act thus in either of these two capacities, I can easily prove.</P>
<P>First, Because the Scripture tells us the Husband and Wife are one Flesh,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 2.24. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5.29, 30.</NOTE> and that no man ever yet hated his own Flesh▪ so that it is impossible for a Husband to put his Wife to death, till by the greatness of her Crimes, she be∣comes no longer worthy of that tender affection he ought to bear her. Then as to the Father, he, as a Father, ought not to desire to put his Son to death, whose being he hath been the cause of, and who is principally made out of his own substance, and on whom he hath bestowed nourishment and education for so many Years, until he finds that instead of a Son he proves an Enemy to his Family, or hath so laid wait against his Life, that as long as he lives he cannot be safe; or else commits some of those heinous crimes which by the Laws of God and Nature do justly deserve no less punishment than Death, in short when he ceases any longer to deserve the name of a Son.</P>
<P>Yet this Authority holds no longer than whilst the Son remains part of his Fathers Family, and so Subject to his Power, and this I take to be the reason why we do not read, that <HI>Adam</HI> took any notice of <HI>Cains</HI>'s murdering his Bro∣ther, because he was before freed from his Power, by setting up another Family, which certainly had been <HI>Adam</HI>'s duty to have done, had he been then under his jurisdiction, Murder being as great a crime before the Flood as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 9.5.</NOTE> tho' the punishment of in by Death were not posi∣tively enjoin'd by God till then: But I shall prove this point more particularly by and by, as also, that <HI>Adam</HI>'s Children might enjoy, or enclose some part of the Earth without any grant or assent from <HI>Adam,</HI> to whom you suppose (tho' without any proof as yet) that the whole Earth was given by God.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="19"/>To conclude, I doubt you mistook me when you say, I at first affirmed that all Civil Government was ordained by God, for the benefit or advantage of the the Subjects, rather than that of the Governours, and therefore you undertake to shew me, that in the first and most natural Government, <HI>viz.</HI> that of a Fa∣mily, Children who are subjects in the state of Nature, are ordained as much for the benefit, and help of their Parents, who are their Princes or Masters, as their Parents for them; in which assertion you fall in to more than on mistake, for I do not assert that in Civil Government the benefit or advantage of the Sub∣ject, is only to be considered; For I shall easily grant that Princes may very well challenge a very great share in the honour and other advantages that may be reapt by their Government; and yet for all that when the happiness and pre∣servation of the Subjects, is incompatible with that of the Prince, the former is to be preferred, and Bishop <HI>Sanderson</HI> is of this opinion; when he tells us in his Lecture <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>De oblg. consc. Prael.</HI> 5. §. 19.</NOTE> <HI>De Iuramento; That the end of Civil Government, and the obedience that is due to it, is the safety and tranquillity of humane society,</HI> and therefore the end is certainly to be preferred before the means, when they cannot both consist together; but this is no argument for the preferring the benefit or advantages of Parents, before that of their Children, since Paternal Government is not Civil Government; nor are Fathers absolute Princes or Masters over their Children, as you suppose, and yet I think I may safely affirm, that even in this Paternal Government, tho' it be granted that Children are ordained for the benefit, or help of their Parents, yet when their happiness and preservation is inconsistent with that of their Children, it may be a great doubt which is to be prefer'd, since Gods chief intention in Parents, was for the Preservation and Propagation of Mankind; and therefore I cannot see how it could ever be any part of the Pa∣ternal Power, for a Father to make his Child a Slave, or to sell him to others at his pleasure as you suppose: This being no part or end of the design or duty of a Father.</P>
<P>And whereas you lay to my charge my mistaking the true sense of those Civil Law Maxims you have quoted; I think I can easily prove that the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ake lyes on your side, and that you have misapplied them, to make them serve your purpose: For as to your first Maxim, <HI>Partus sequitur Ventrem,</HI> from which you infer, that the Child ought to be of the same condition with the Mother, this rule in your Civil Law relates only to Bastards, and not Legitimate Children, who follow the condition of the Father according to your Digest:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dig.</HI> 1. <HI>Tit.</HI> 6. <HI>L.</HI> 16.</NOTE> <HI>Qui ex uxore mea nascitur filius mariti est habendus,</HI> so likewise in your <HI>Code,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cod. Tit.</HI> 19. <HI>L.</HI> 14.</NOTE> <HI>Cum legitimae nuptiae factae sunt, patrem liberi sequun∣tur, vulgo quaesitus matrem sequitur.</HI> Nor is your second Maxim more true;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dig. Tit.</HI> 5. <HI>L.</HI> 19:</NOTE> for tho' I grant according to your <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Law, the Father might have absolute power over his Wife and Children: yet I cannot see how this word and <HI>nascitur,</HI> can be extended beyond those that are born of a man and his Wife, and therefore can never con∣cern Grand-children, much less any more remote Descendants, and this very Law, that a Son or Daughter might be killed by a Father, seem'd so cruel and odious, even to the Antient <HI>Romans</HI> themselves, that neither the Law of the Twelve Tables, nor the <HI>Iulian</HI> Law of Adulteries, which were pro∣vided against Fathers, Sons, and Daughters, ever extended it to the Grand-Father,
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
Grand-son, or Grand-daughter by Interpretation; or argument <HI>à cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> consimili.</HI> Nor do these words, <HI>in Potestate mea est,</HI> prove more than that all Children are born under the Power of their Parents, tho' whether they shall always continue so as long as they live; is not to be proved from this Maxim; nor if it were, doth that make it a Law of Nature. For I must needs observe this, of divers of you Civilians, that what ever Maxim you find in your Civil Law Books, that will make for your Notions, you presently adopt them for Laws of Nature, without ever enquiring by the strict Rules of Reason, and the Good of Mankind, (by which alone any Law of Nature is to be tryed) whether they are so or no.</P>
<P>I shall not trouble my self to confute those false Conclusions you have brought from those weak Promises; for if I have destroyed your Foundation, I think your Superstructure cannot stand; and therefore you must pardon me, if I cannot find this Original Charter of Government, and of all Civil Power, to be derived from <HI>Adam</HI> by any Argument that yet you have brought either from Scripture, or Reason; only give me leave to observe thus much, upon what you have said, <HI>That if not only the Constitution of Civil Power</HI> in general, but the special Limitation of it to one kind, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Monarchy, be the Ordi∣nance of God, I cannot see how any other Government but that can be lawfully set up, or obeyed by Men, since no Government can challenge this Priviledge against Divine Institution.</P>

P.</HI> § 36.</NOTE> or of Civil Government, than this, that God gave <HI>Adam</HI> over <HI>Eve,</HI> who indeed was as at the first Subject, so the Representative of all that followed, and it reaches not only to all her Daugh∣ters in relation to their Husbands, but to all of them in relation to their Fathers, and to her Sons too, in relation to both their Father, and their Eldest Brother after his Decease, if no body Superior to both of them, and him interposed, and diverted, or rather over-ruled it.</P>
<P>For (1.) If a Priority of Being gave <HI>Adam</HI> a power over his Wife, it gave him much more so over his Children.</P>
<P>(2.) If God's taking <HI>Eve</HI> out of <HI>Adam,</HI> the forming her of one of his Ribs without his concurrence, did yet make her his Inferiour, his Children were much more so, which were derived from him, and by his Act.</P>
<P>(3.) If she were formed for him, not he for her; and that was another rea∣son; this extended to his Children too, who were begotten for the comfort and assistance of both him, and her.</P>
<P>(4.) When God put <HI>Eve</HI> under the Subjection of her Husband after the Fall, her Children must needs be so too, if they were not excepted, but we Read of no exception.</P>
<P>(5.) Is it not an Eternal Law of Nature, that all Children should be subject to their Parents? And did not this Law spread it self over the Face of all the Earth, as Mankind encreased?</P>
<P>And whereas you would limit this Power of Parents over their Children,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> both in its Extent and Duration, this is purely owing to the Civil Laws of Nations, and not to the Laws of Nature, and is different in different places; some having restrained the Powe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Pa∣rents more▪ and some less. But God gave the Parents a Power of Life and Death over their own Children, amongst his own People the Jews, and that not
<PB N="23" REF="20"/>
limited in Duration neither, for the Fathers Power over his Son was not deter∣mined but by his Death, though they could not execute that Power, but in the presence of a Magistrate. And I am also sure that in all the Histories and Re∣lations I have met with, amongst civiliz'd Nations (where it is not otherwise order'd by the Civil Laws of the Country) all Husbands, and Fathers have Power of Life and Death over their Wives, and Children, and so it is at this day amongst many Eastern Nations, and was antiently amongst the <HI>Romans, Gauls,</HI> and <HI>Persians, &amp;c.</HI> Which power I take not to have been given, or conferred on them, but rather left to them by the Civil Laws of their Country in the same state, as it was establisht by the Law of Nature, or rather Nations. Now if such Husbands and Fathers antiently had, and still have a power of Life and Death in divers Countries over their Wives and Children, I desire to know what higher power they could enjoy, since he that hath power over a Man's Life, which is of the highest concern to him, may certainly command him in all things else?</P>
<P>But as for your last Scruple that you cannot see, if Monarchy be of <HI>Divine Institution,</HI> how any Government but that can be lawfully set up or obeyed by Men, I think it may be a satisfactory Answer, if I tell you, that if those who are Born under a Monarchy can justifie the Form they live under to be God's Ordinance,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. A. MM. p.</HI> 266.</NOTE> they are not bound to forbear their own Justification, because others cannot do the like for the Forms they live under; let others look to the defence of their own Govern∣ment: If it cannot be proved, or shewed that any other Form of Government had ever any Lawful beginning, but was brought in, or erected by Rebellion, must therefore the Lawful and Just Obedience to Monarchy be denied to be the Ordinance of God?</P>

<P>I hope before I have done, to give you a clearer Original from the Law of Nature, as well of Paternal Authority, as Civil Government, without re∣curring to Divine Revelation which (as I said before) would oblige none but Jews, and Christians, or Mahometans, whose Law is a mixture of both the other. In the mean time give me leave to tell you, that <HI>Eve</HI>'s being the Representative of all Wives, did not put either her self or her Daughters into any absolute Subjection either to <HI>Adam,</HI> or their Husbands; if it did, then could not this Subjection be likewise owing either to <HI>Adam</HI> as the Patriarch, or Grandfather of the Family, or to his Eldest Son after his Decease, since this would make every Wife in the state of Nature to have had two absolute Lords, her Husband, and her Husband's Father, which is contrary to our Saviour's Rule, That no man can serve two Masters, that is, in the same kind of Service: And therefore it plainly makes out my distinction, that there is a great deal of difference between a Conjugal Submission of a Wife to her Husband, and a Servile Subjection of a Servant to his Lord, as also of that Obedience, or Duty, which a Subject oweth his Soveraign, since by your own Hypothesis it necessarily follows that either <HI>Cain</HI>'s Wife (for Example) was not to be subject to her Husband, or else must be free from all Subjection to her Father <HI>Adam</HI>: But as for any Submission to <HI>Cain,</HI> as Elder Brother after <HI>Adam</HI>'s Decease, I desire to be excused medling with it till we have dispatcht the Question in hand.</P>
<P>I come now to those fresh Considerations you bring for this Monarchical power of <HI>Adam</HI>; for indeed I cannot call them new Arguments, because most of them have been answered already. The first Consideration is from
<PB N="24" REF="21"/>
the Priority of the Being which you suppose gave <HI>Adam</HI> a Power over his Wife, and consequently over his Children; but I think his Priority of Being could give him no such Power at all over her, and consequently not over them, for I desire to know whether if God had been pleased to have Created, the same day that <HI>Eve</HI> was made, twenty single Men, and their Wives, that therefore <HI>Adam</HI> must have been from his being first Created, Monarch over them all, unless God had particularly commanded it?</P>
<P>I grant indeed that from God's Creating <HI>Eve</HI> out of <HI>Adam,</HI> it did render her inferiour to him, and also from God's express command, that she was to be subject to him in all Conjugal Duties, yet did neither of these render her, or her Children absolute of perpetual Subjects, and Slaves to <HI>Adam.</HI> And that their being deriv'd from him, or by his Act doth not at all alter the Case, I have al∣ready proved.</P>
<P>As for the third, that if she wene formed for him, and not he for her, that this must be another reason which must extend to his Children too: Here the As∣sumption is not only false, but the Consequence too: For she was not only formed for him, but that they might be a mutual help to each other, and there∣fore the Scripture tell us, <HI>A Man shall leave his Father and his Mother,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 2.24.</NOTE> <HI>and shall cleave unto hit Wife, and they two shall be one Flesh</HI>; which words (in my Opinion) are very far from proving any such absolute Subjection; for no Man can ever tyrannize over his own Flesh; and if such an absolute Subjection had been intended, from <HI>Eve</HI> to <HI>Adam,</HI> it had been more consonant to reason, for the Scripture to have enjoyn'd her to have left her Father, and Mother, to cleave to her Husband. Whereas indeed there was no more meant by this Text, than that when a Man marries, he may freely quit his Fathers Family, and joyning himself to his Wife, may set up another of his own. But as for the Children that were begotten between them, tho' I grant they might be intended both for the comfort, and assistance of him, and her, yet I have already proved that the Parents are more chiefly intended for their Childrens Propagation, and Preservation, than the Children are for their Interest and Happyness.</P>
<P>Your fouth consideration is only a supposition of the question which is yet to be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oved, that <HI>Eve</HI> was under an absolute subjection to <HI>Adam</HI> after the Fall, I have already proved this supposition not to be true, and therefore the conse∣quence, as to the Children is false likewise.</P>
<P>Your fifth, is rather an interrogation than an Argument, whether Children ought not to be, and have not always, been subject to their Parents all over the World? In answer to which I grant that it is true, that they have ever been so, tho' not in your sense. For I hold this subjection neither to be servile, or absolute, nor yet perpetual, as long as they live: but in reply to this limitation of the Power of Parents over their Children both in its extent and duration, you tell me this is purely owing to the Civil Laws of Nations, and not to the Laws of Nature, and for a proof of this you produce Gods own people the Jews, for an example that the power of the Father over his Son, was not determined but by his Death. But your self confesses that he could not exercise this Power of Life and Death, but in the presence of the Magistrate; the circumstances of which if they be considered, will rather make against you; for first the Father could not have this rebellio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s▪ Son put to Death, till he had accus'd him before the Elders of the City, that, is the Judges who were establisht in every Precinct, who
<PB N="25" REF="21"/>
upon a solemn hearing, were to sentence such a rebellious Son to be stoned to Death by all the People of the City: where you may observe that the Father had no power to put him to Death himself, and therefore acted in this case as an accuser or a witness, not as a Judge. But if you'l believe <HI>Maimonides,</HI> one of the most Learned of the Jewish Rabbins, he will tell you that by the Municipal Law of the Jews,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tract. Memarim.</HI></NOTE> this power of the Father did scarce extend beyond the thirteenth year of the Son's Age, after which the Son was reckoned Adult, and Emancipated from his Fathers Powers, and could not after that incur this punishment of a Stubborn and Rebel∣lious Son; and a Father who did but strike his Son after he was Adult, incurr'd Excommunication, for that he offended against the Law. And tho' I grant that the Nations you mention did exercise a Power of Life and Death over their Wives, and Children, yet will not the Practice of some particular Nations, tho' never so much civiliz'd, amount to a proof of a Law of Nature, which is only to be made out from evident Rules of Right Reason, and the great end of this Law, the common good of Mankind; and especially when against the Examples of those Nations which you produce, I can likewise set those of many more Nations, where this Custum was not allowed, after once Civil Government was establisht. And as for the <HI>Romans</HI> themselves, amongst whom the greatest Examples of this kind are to be found, they will not all of them amount to above three, or four, in six or seven hundred years, and then, tho' there might be very good cause for it, yet the People of <HI>Rome</HI> never so much esteemed or loved such Fathers after they had put their Sons to Death, as they did before, but counted them too severe and cruel for so doing.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Clem.</HI></NOTE> And you read in <HI>Valerius Maximus,</HI> and <HI>Seneca,</HI> that they killed <HI>Erixiin</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Gentleman, for whipping his Son to Death like a Slave; so much did they abhor all such Cruelty of Parents towards their Children; and afterwards, when by the General Corruption of Manners amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI> Fathers grew more cruel to their Children, and often put them to Death without cause. Those of your Faculty, suppose that some of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperous (tho' it is uncertain who) took away this Power from Fathers, and made it (as it is now among us) Murder, for a Father to put his Son to Death, tho' others, since there are no particular Edicts to be found concerning this matter, do suppose this Law to be changed by degrees, and to be left off by common consent of the <HI>Romans</HI> themselves for it seems dangerous to grant to a private person the cognizance of any crime, which might belong to publick Authority; and they thought it better to strengthen both the Paternal and Marital Power by other Laws than putting to Death. And therefore <HI>Simplecius</HI> upon <HI>Epictetus</HI> his <HI>Enchiridion,</HI> says, that the <HI>Romans</HI> allowed Fathers this Power, because they thought they might very well trust their Natural Affection to their Children, for the exercise of that Power of selling them or putting them to Death, which 'twas supposed they would rarely use, unless compelled by extream necessity or unpardonable crimes; and therefore if a Father would put his Son to death, he was to do it with his own hands, that he might suffer as well as his Son, but when this render affection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo failed, it was no wonder that the Roman Empe∣rors did not think it for the common good of their People, to trust Fathers with this Power any longer, which they had hitherto exercised, not so properly by right of Fatherhood, as that of the Master of a Family, who governed his Servants and his Sons by a like Authority.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="22"/>To conclude, I cannot but observe, how slyly▪ you wave my objection a∣gainst the Divine Institution of Monarchy, for tho' you seem loth expresly to condemn all other Governments as unlawful, yet the consequence will be the same upon your principles: For if it be a good argument which some make use of, for the Government of the Church by Bishops, be∣cause that Government being supposed by them to have been instituted by the Apostles by Divine Precept, therefore that no other Government but Episcopacy can be lawful, or any true Church, where that Government is not in use: so the same argument will likewise hold in Civil Govern∣ments, that all others must be unlawful if Monarchy alone were ordained by God, and that all other forms whatsoever began from Rebellion or the Fancies of Men.</P>

<P>To answer what you have said, in the first place I cannot so slightly pass over this argument of the Law of Nations, by which I supposed the Power of Fathers over the Persons of their Children is sufficiently esta∣blished, and from whence also it appears that among the <HI>Iews</HI> as well as <HI>Romans,</HI> the Children were lookt upon as part of the substance of their Father, and consequently that they had a perpetual right in their Persons, as long as they lived, that the <HI>Romans</HI> had the power of selling their Chil∣dren three times, your self do not deny; that the <HI>Iews</HI> also had it in use among them appears, first by the story of the poor Woman, the Widdow of one of the Sons of the Prophets, who complained to <HI>Elisha,</HI> in the second of <HI>Kings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 4.1.</NOTE> <HI>telling him that her Husband is dead, and the Creditor is come to take her two Sons to be Bond-men.</HI> And so likewise in the New Testament, our Saviour in St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> supposes it as a thing commonly practised in those parts of the World where he lived. For in the Parable of the King, who would take account of his Servants,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 18.24, 25.</NOTE> amongst whom one owed him Ten thousand Talents: <HI>But for as much as he had nothing to pay, his Lord commanded him to be sold, and his Wife, and Children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</HI> Which was founded upon that Law amongst the Jews, that Fathers might sell their Children for Bond-servants,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Verse</HI> 5.</NOTE> until the year of <HI>Iubilee</HI>▪ as appears by <HI>Nehemiah, Chap.</HI> 5. where he relates the Com∣plaint of those poor Jews, who had been forced for want <HI>to bring their Sons and their Daughters into Bondage: Neither was it in their power to redeem them, for other Men had their Lands, and their Vineyards.</HI></P>
<P>And amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI> this Power of selling their Children continued till it was forbidden by the Emperour <HI>Iustinian.</HI> And as for the <HI>Grecians, Plu∣tarch</HI> in his Life of <HI>Solon</HI> relates, that till his time it was lawful amongst the <HI>Athenians,</HI> for Fathers to sell their Children to pay their own Debts: And I suppose it was upon this account, that <HI>Cymon</HI> the Son of the great General <HI>Miltiades,</HI> was kept in Prison by the <HI>Athenians,</HI> till he had paid the Fine of ten Thousand Talents, which his Father died indebted to the Common-wealth. And <HI>Philostratus</HI> in his Life of <HI>Apollonius Thyanaus</HI> relates, that it was com∣mon amongst the <HI>Phrygians</HI> to sell their own Sons: And to come to more Modern Times, a Son amongst the <HI>Muscovites</HI>▪ may by sold four times, but after the fourth Sale the Eather hath no longer a Right in him, as the Baron
<PB N="27" REF="22"/>
of <HI>Heber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lein</HI> tells us in his Relation of <HI>Muscovy</HI>; and it is not only in use amongst them, but also amongst the <HI>Tartars, East-Indians, Chineses,</HI> and the People of <HI>Japan,</HI> not only to sell their Children themselves, but also, that they are liable to be sold by the Prince, or his Officers, for their Fathers Debts, or Offences: So that you see here is the Consent of most of the Civiliz'd Nations in the World, who sure, in this, follow the Dictates of Nature, and Reason, in the exercise of a full, and absolute Propriety, and Dominion in, and over the Persons of their Children; so that if it be a received Custom, or Law amongst most Nations, it is also from Reason too, since the Law of Nations is only that which receives its obligation from the Consent of many Nations, as <HI>Grotius</HI> well observes: And <HI>Aristotle</HI> lays it down as one of the strongest proofs, when all men agree in any thing: And <HI>Cicero</HI> tells us, That the Consent of most Nations is to be looked upon as a Law of Nature; and therefore these Customs are to be esteemed as obligatory amongst all Ci∣viliz'd Nations, where the Municipal Laws of those Countreys have not re∣strained or altered this Natural Power, and Interest, which Fathers had origi∣nally over the Persons of their Children.</P>
<P>But as for what you say, that according to my Principles no other Go∣vernment can be Lawful besides Monarchy, I shall give you the same Answer, that some of the most Moderate of our Divines have given to those, who would make the like Objection against us of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> believe Episcopacy to be <HI>Iure Divin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; viz.</HI> That God may for the ne∣cessity of some Ecclesiastical Order and Government in a Church, allow that Form of Government to be Lawful, which himself never Instituted; Nay, which perhaps was unlawful to have been set up in the Church at all; and so likewise in Civil Governments, I will not deny, that those Forms may be lawfully obeyed as the Ordinance of God which he never Institu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, but have wholly proceeded from the Rebellions, or Inventions of Men.</P>

<P>I must confess, Sir, I cannot see how any Law of Nations can be supposed to lay any Obligation upon Mankind different from the Law of Nature, and Reason, or the revealed Law of God in Scripture. And, tho' I confess there is some division amongst Learned Men about this matter; yet I think it is far more rational to suppose▪ that there are but two Law that can be Rules of Humane Actions, the Natural Law, and the Divine. And of this Opinion is the Learned <HI>Grotius</HI> himself in the place you but now cited, where he says, he added the words, <HI>many Nations,</HI> because there can scarce be found any Natural Law, which is also wont to be called the Law of Nations, that is common to all Nations: Yea, that is often lookt upon as a Law of Nations in one Country, which is not so any where else; as (says he) we shall shew in its due place, concerning Captivity, and <HI>Postluminium.</HI></P>
<P>And for a farther confirmation of this, I will make bold to read to you in English some part of what th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Excellent <HI>Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endof</HI> hath writ∣ten upon this Subject in his Learned Work <HI>De Jure Na∣turae &amp; Gentium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S.</HI> 23.</NOTE> <HI>Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 3. which you may here read with me.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="23"/><HI>The Law of Nature and the Law of Nations is accounted by many one and the same, which only differ by an extrinsick denomination. And form hence,</HI> Hobbs, De Cive, C. 14. § 4. <HI>Divides the Law of Nature into the Natural Law of Men, and the Natural Law of Common Wealths, which is commonly called</HI> Jus Gentium: <HI>And then adds that the Precepts of both are the same; but because Common-Wealths, when once instituted do put on the personal pro∣perties of Men, that Law which speaking of the duty of particular men, we call Natural, being applied to all Common-Wealths or Nations, is called</HI> Jus Gentium▪ <HI>to which opinion we do likewise subscribe; neither do we think there can be any other voluntary or positive Law of Nations, which can have the power of a Law properly so called, and which may oblige all Nations as pro∣ceeding from a Superiour. But most of those things which amongst the</HI> Roman <HI>Civil Lawyers, and others are referred to the Law of Nations, as suppose about the manner, of acquiring of Contracts, and the like, do either belong to the Law of Nature, or else to the Civil Laws of particular Nations, which agree together, for the most part, in these things: yet from which n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> new, or distinct sort of Law is Rightly constituted, because those Laws are common to Nations not from any Agreement or Mutual Obligation, but in that they do by accident agree from the peculiar Will of the Law-givers in each particular Common-Wealth; from whence the same things may be changed by one People or Nation, without consulting the rest, and often times are found to be so changed.</HI></P>
<P>And of this he here gives us several Examples of different customs amongst Nations in making War upon each other, according to diverse forms, or tacit Agreements, whereby War may be managed with a little Cruelty as may be: but thus he proceeds;</P>
<P><HI>These Customs altho' they may seem to contain some Obligation, as arising from this sort of Tacit agreement amongst Nations, yet if any Prince shall wage a lawful War, or neglect them, or should do quite contrary to them, he would not be guilty of any sin against the Law of Nature</HI>; but only of a piece of Roughness or Incivility, that he did not make War according to those Rules of Honour which are used among them, by whom War is looked upon as a liberal Art. [And a little farther proceeds thus.]</P>
<P><HI>Amongst the principal Heads of the voluntary Law of Nations,</HI> Grotius <HI>reckons the right of Ambassadors, where we also suppose that by the very Law of Nature, Ambassadors are inviolable even with the Enemy, as long as they appear Ambassadors, and not Spyes, and do not contrive Plots against those to whom, they are sent, and having shown the necessity of Ambassadors in order to Peace, he thus goes on; but there are other priviledges Attributed to Am∣bassadors, especially to those, who reside in a place rather to fish out the Se∣crets of another State, than for Peace sake, those priviledges depend from the meer indulgence of that Prince to whom they are sent, and so if it seems good to him may be denied them, without the violation of any Right, if he will likewise suffer that his own Ambassadors should be Treated in a like man∣ner.</HI></P>

<PB N="29" REF="23"/>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I will quickly shew you if you please to have a little Patience, and therefore to apply what I have now read, to the matter in hand, in the first place, it is apparent from this Author, that the Law, or Custom of Nations, hath no Obligation as such, but only as it agreeth with the Law of Nature, and the Law of God, and what Laws of Nations, are founded on the Law of Nature, can only be tryed by some rule, which certainly is not to be learned from the Knowledge of the Customs or Laws of all Nations, since who is able to know them all? And therefore these Laws must be tryed either by the natural light of a Mans own Conscience, or else by considering whether this or that practice of a Nation conduces to the Honour or Service of God, or the com∣mon good and happiness of Mankind, and so may be known as well by the unlearned as the learned. Now I suppose you will not affirm, that this Law of the absolute Property and Dominion of Fathers in and over their Children, can be discovered by either of these ways, or that a Mans Conscience will tell him, that it is his duty to let his Father Kill him or Sell him, or use him like a Brute, without any contradiction or resistance. And as for the other, I think I have sufficiently proved that this absolute power which you assert of Fathers over their Children, doth not proceed from that great Law of Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> the common good and preservation of Mankind, to which the practice of it may prove very destructive, which if proved, I think, I may easily answer all that you have now said about the particular Customs, or Laws of diverse Nations concerning this Matter, tho' your Instances were many more than they are.</P>
<P>For in the first place as for those you alledge out of the Scripture, they do (as I said before) only regard th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Municipal Laws of the <HI>Iews</HI>; those of the <HI>Romans</HI> touching this matter, did only concern those Common-wealths whilst they were in being and no other Nations whatsoever, and for this opinion, I have both <HI>Grotius</HI> and <HI>Pufendrof</HI> of my side, for the former in the beginning of the Chapter last quoted, after having set down the different Powers which Fathers may exercise over their Children, according to their different Ages: thus affirms; <HI>as you may here see.</HI>
<Q><HI>Whatsoever</HI> is beyond these Powers, proceeds, only from a voluntary Law, which is different in diverse places so by the Law which God gave the <HI>Iews,</HI> the Power of the Father over his Son or Daughter, to dissolve their Vows was not perpetual, but only endured as long as the Children were parts of their Fathers Family.</Q></P>
<P>And by the same Rule I may add, that Children were not reckoned as part of their Fathers Goods, and to be sold by him, or seized upon by Credi∣tors for his Debts any longer, than they continued Members of their Fathers Family, and consequently were not seized upon as his Sons, but Servants. And I desire you to shew me an Example, where ever among the <HI>Iews,</HI> the Children after they were Adult, and parted from their Fathers House, were sold or seized as Slaves for their Fathers Debts. And as for the <HI>Romans,</HI> it is plain, they acknowledged their <HI>Patria Potestas</HI> to be in use amongst them, nei∣ther by the Law of Nature, or Nations, but only from their own Civil Law, as appears by this Title, almost at the very beginning of <HI>Iustini∣nian</HI>'s
<PB N="30" REF="24"/>
Institutions, (as I suppose you know better than I) <HI>Patria Potestas est Juris Civilis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iust. L.</HI> 1. § 2. <HI>T</HI> 9.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; Civium Romano∣rum propria.</HI> The Text follows in these words (as I re∣member) <HI>Jus Potestatis quod in liberos habemus proprium est Civium Roma∣norum, nulli enim alii sunt homines qui talem in liberos habeant Potesta∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, qualem nos habemus</HI>; And therefore they would not permit strangers to exercise it over their Children within the City of <HI>Rome.</HI> And if the Power of the Father among the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> was not by the Law of Nature, or Nations, no more could it be so, tho' exercised amongst never so many other Nations, since if it were one of the Laws or Preceps of Nature, it could never have been taken away, or restrained by any Civil Law without the express Consents of all Fathers. And as for your Instance of <HI>Cymon</HI> a∣mongst the <HI>Athenians</HI>; it makes nothing to this purpose; since if I take it at the worst, it maketh no more, than that the <HI>Athenian</HI> Common-wealth dealt very ungratefully, and Tyrannically with <HI>Miltiades</HI> and his Son; and it might be that they kept him Prisoner as being Heir to his Fathers Principality in the <HI>Thracian Chersonnese,</HI> out of which they supposed he might pay the Debt; as the King with us doth often put an Heir in Prison for his Fathers Debts, where he hath Assets by Descent.</P>
<P>But for all your other Examples, unless they have a reason in Nature to support them, they will no more prove that by the Law of Nations Fa∣thers should have a Right of Life and Death, or of selling their Children, than if you should argue from the Common Custom amongst the <HI>Lacedemo∣nians,</HI> the <HI>Aborigines</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> the Inhabitants of the Kingdom of <HI>Sophiris,</HI> as amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> mentioned by <HI>Qu Curtius,</HI> and the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and the Inhabitants of <HI>Formosa</HI> at this day; all which either did, or now do destroy their Children as soon as they are brought forth, or else in the Womb afore they are born, if they please so to do. And as for some of these Nations you have instanced in, and particularly the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell their Children, but four times, it is apparent it is only a Municipal Law; for if the Property of the Father over the Sons Persons were by them looked upon as perpetual, he might not only sell him four times, but forty, if it were possible.</P>
<P>But on the other side, I have against this Custom of your N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions, the Examples of divers altogether as Wise, and Civiliz'd, who did not permit Fathers to exercise this absolute Power over their Children, and therefore against your Example of the <HI>Jews,</HI> I set that of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who did not Permit Parents to put their Children to Death, nor yet to sell them, unless in case of great necessity, and when they could not otherwise maintain them, and then I grant it may be necessary, So likewise against your <HI>Roman</HI> Law, I set that of all the Greek Nations, none of whom per∣mitted Fathers to put their Children to Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plutarch in Lycurgo.</HI></NOTE> except the <HI>Spartans,</HI> and that was only in one case, and that was only in one case, and that with the judgment and consent of the eldest Men of the Family, yet when their new born Infants were so weak or ill shaped as to be thougt not worth the rearing. So likewise against▪ your examples of the Antient <HI>Gauls,</HI> I set that of the <HI>Germans,</HI> a Nation altogether as wise and civilized as the other, to whom I could likewise add the Antient
<PB N="31" REF="24"/>
<HI>Britains, Spaniards,</HI> and divers others, and to the more Modern examples of the Eastern Nations, where this custom is permitted of selling or killing their Children; I shall oppose the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> amongst whom it is forbid∣den, as also amongst all the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> who believe Christianity; and if we go over to <HI>America,</HI> we shall find that they are there so indulgent to their Children, that no fault whatsoever, tho' never so great, shall make them put them to Death. And to let you see that this is most suitable to Reason, the two greatest Philosophers amongst the Greeks, <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Aristotle,</HI> have condemned it; The former in his Laws, where he expresly forbids it, supposing that in no case whatever, a Father ought to put off all Piety and Humanity towards his Son, and that a Son should be rather led by Nature, than driven by force to obey his Father; especially since his Power is suffi∣ciently established by the Law, and the appointing of publick Judges; and <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his Morals to <HI>Nicomachus, Lib.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 12. accuses the <HI>Jus Pa∣trium</HI> in use among the <HI>Persians</HI> as Tyrannical, and <HI>Grotius</HI> tells you; he makes use of these examples of the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> only that we might distinguish Civil Rights from natural. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">VI. <HI>P.

<P>Yet for all this I think all the wisest and most Civilized Nations were of my opinion, and it is from them that we ought to take this Law of Na∣tions rather than the others; and therefore I think the <HI>Romans</HI> were a great deal wiser and better People than the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and the Antient <HI>Gauls,</HI> than the <HI>Germans.</HI> Nor does your argument against this power of Life and Death in Fathers by the Law of Nature, seem cogent, that if it were so, it could never be taken away or restrained by any Civil Law▪ since this argument will make v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much against that power of Life and Death, with which you invest your Fa∣thers of Families in the state of Nature, since if they have it by the Law of Nature, it could no more he restrained, or taken away by Civil Laws, than any Paternal Power in the like case.</P>

<P>I pray Sir, hold, if this controversie is to be decided by the Wisdom and the Civility of Nations, we shall never have done; For in the first place, who shall judge of this consent of the most Civilized People? and that no account is to be made of those whom you call Barbarous; for what Nation will acknowledge it self to be so; or can arrogate so much to it self, as that it may require all others to conform themselves to their Laws and Customs; and that all Nations must be barbarous that act otherwise? Antiently the arrogance of the Greeks, made them look upon all other Nations as Barbarous, and then the <HI>Romans</HI> succeeded in this foolish con∣ceit of themselves; and at this day we People of <HI>Europe</HI> (who are but a few in comparison of the rest of the World) do suppose our selves to exceed all others in Knowledge. And yet on the other side there are diverse
<PB N="32" REF="25"/>
Nations who prefer themselves far before us, and I have read that the <HI>Chineses</HI> have a saying, that the <HI>Europeans</HI> see with one Eye, themselves with two, but that all the rest of the World are stark blind, and yet this Nation maintains a Power of selling, and exposing their Children, which we <HI>Europeans</HI> abhor. Now pray tell me if there is not some common rule to be drawn from reason, or the common good of Mankind, how shall we judge which is in the right? So that notwithstanding all that hath been said on this subject: I think I may safely conclude with the Judgment of the Learned <HI>Pufendorf,</HI> in <HI>Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>Cap.</HI> 2. where speaking of the Paternal Power, he says thus, <HI>But neither th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same Power as such, seems to extend it self to that of Life and Death by reason of any fault, but only to a moderate chastisement. For since this authority is employed about an Age, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> weak and tender, and in which such incorrigible crimes can hardly be committed, which nothing but Life can expiate, it is much better that a Father should turn out of Doors a Son who doth willfully refuse through obstinacy and wickedness all due correction. So that Abdication and Disinheriting seems to be the utmost punishment which can be inflicted by a Father on a Son considered as such.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see it is to no purpose to spend longer time about this question but since your self have all along allowed that the Father of a separate Family in the state of Nature, hath a Power to put his Wife or Children to Death, in case they have committed any heinous sins or offences against the Laws of God or Nature, but you have not yet told me (and I doubt cannot) how <HI>Adam</HI> or any other Master of a Family could be endued with this Power of Life and Death, unless it were granted him by God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I promise to give you full satisfaction to this question by and by; but in the mean time, pray let me make it a little more plain to you, that this Power of Life and Death, which may be exercised by Masters of separate Families, over their Wives and Children in some cases, is not by any Power they receive from God, as Husbands or Fathers but only as Heads or Masters of such Families, may by proved by this instance, suppose a Master of a Family independant on any other (as in the <HI>Indies</HI>) hath neither Wife nor Children, yet sure he hath notwithstanding the same Power of Life and Death over his Servants or Slaves, for such great offences as you have mentioned, in case there be no superiour Power over him to take Cognizance of such Crimes. And to make this yet plainer, suppose a Married Man having a Wife and Children will live (together with them) in the Family of such a Master as I have now described (yet not a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Ser∣vant, but as an Inmate or Boarder) and whilst he so continues, his Wife Kills one of her Children, or one of his Sons, Murders his Brother, who hath right to punish this offence, but the Master in whose Family he is an Inmate▪ And this follows from your own supposed: for if every separate Family in the state of Nature be a distinct independant Government, then all those that enter themselves, as Members of such a Family must be subject to the Master or Governour of it. Nor do you reduce me into any absurdity by your reply to my argument, That if▪ the Power of Life and Death were Originally in Fathers by the
<PB N="33" REF="25"/>
Law of Nature, it could never be restrain'd nor taken from them without their consent; that then this will make as much against the like Power of Masters of Families; since I must grant, this is taken away by Civil Laws, And why not the other? To this I reply, that you do not observe the strength of these words, <HI>Without their consent</HI>; For I suppose that no Power whatever can take this out of the hands of such Fathers, or Masters of Families in the state of Nature, without they assign it to the Supream Powers of the Common∣wealth upon its first Institution; whereas you make this Power to be obtain∣able by Force, as by Conquest, or Usurpation, not only over those that are not at their own disposal, as Children and Servants; but over their Fathers and Masters too, without their consents; which is contrary to the Law of Na∣ture and Reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you take it for granted, that I will admit your Instance of the Power of Life and Death to be in the Masters of Families, and not as Fathers in the State of Nature: But as plain as you think it, since you question the Power of Life and Death, which I suppose to be inherent in all Fathers; I know not why I may not with more Reason question your allowing the like Power to Masters of separate Families, since there is no reason, in my Opi∣nion, which you can bring for such a Power in your Masters of Families, which I cannot with like reason urge may be also exercised by Fathers, and Husbands, over their Wives and Children, in case they deserve it. For if it be for the good and preservation of mankind, that great and enormous Crimes, such as Murder and Adultery, should be punished, and that with Death; Who is more fit to inflict these punishments, or who can be supposed to judge more impartially of them, than the Father, or Husband himself? Since he cannot put his Son or Wife to Death, however they may deserve it, without very great reluctancy; since he, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it were, thereby lops off a Limb from his own Body. And therefore I cannot see any Reason, why such a Married man as you describe, should by coming under another Man's Roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only, as an Inmate, or Boarder, and not as a Slave, (which I grant would alter the Case) should lose that Power of Life and Death, which I suppose he hath by the Laws of God and Nature over his Wife and Children, unless he had actually given it up to the Master of that Family with whom he came to Board. And therefore as I do not deny, but that a Master of a separate Family hath power of Life and Death, and also of making Peace and War, with other such Masters of Families, nay, with Princes themselves, if there be occasion, as we read in <HI>Genesis, Chap.</HI> 14. That <HI>Abraham</HI> made War with the four Kings who had taken <HI>Lot</HI> Prisoner. So likewise when <HI>Judah</HI> pronounced Sentence of Death against <HI>Thamar</HI> his Daughter-in-Law, for playing the Harlot, <HI>Bring her forth, says he, and let her be burnt,</HI> Gen. 38. I own this was not done by the Authority of a Father alone (she not being his own Daughter, and his Son being then dead;) but as the Master of a separate Family, who hath (I grant) power of Life and Death, as he is Lord over the persons of his Children, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Servants, and consequently over their Wives also; for if he hath power over his Son, he hath certainly the like over all that belong to him, as long as they continue members of his Family, and that he hath not thought fit to manumit, or set them free. But now I desire to know by what right these Patriarch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could exercise all these mark<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Soveraignty, especially this great Power of Life and Death, unless it were derived from
<PB N="34" REF="26"/>
God at first; since no Man hath any power to dispose of his own Life at his pleasure, and therefore sure hath naturally no power over that of another man's: So that not only this <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> but also that of all <HI>Mo∣narchs</HI> to this day, must be derived from this <HI>Divine Original.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I find you're forced to quit the power of a Father, as such by Generation, since it plainly appears, that this power of Life and Death, which you affirm a Husband, or Father may exercise over their Wives or Children in the state of Nature, is not, <HI>quatenus,</HI> as a Father, but Lord and Master over them; which in the first place I cannot allow to be true in relation to the Wife; nor that the submission of the Wife's Will to the Husband must imply a power of Life and Death over her; for if she is not his Slave (as certainly she is not, for then a Man might sell his Wife when he pleased) I cannot see how she her self could convey by force of the contract, any such Power over her Life, tho I grant, indeed, if she happen to commit Murder upon one of her Children, or other Person of the Family, he may proceed against her as an Enemy, but not as a Subject; and if it be for Adultery it self, I cannot see that the Husband can by the Law of Nature punish her with Death; for since that Crime doth really dissolve the bond of Matrimony, Divorce, or putting her away, and deserting the Child born in Adultery, was even a∣mong the <HI>Romans</HI> look'd upon as a sufficient punishment. But as for the Power of Parents over their Children, I do not deny, but that a Father may have the like power over his Children whilst they are part of his Family, as over his Slaves or Servants in Case of such great and enormous Crimes as you have already mentioned; but that this is not as a Father, but Master of a Family, your self have already granted in your Instances of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI>; tho if you will consider the last a little better, you will find that <HI>Judah</HI> did not pro∣ceed thus against <HI>Thamar,</HI> as her Father, or Master, but by some other Right; For if you please to look upon the 11th <HI>Verse</HI> of that <HI>Chap.</HI> of <HI>Genesis,</HI> from whence you cite this Example, you will find that <HI>Thamar,</HI> after the Death of <HI>Onan</HI> her Husband, went with <HI>Judah</HI>'s leave, and dwelt in her own Father's House, and she was then a Member of his Family, and consequently (ac∣cording to your Hypothesis) not under <HI>Judah</HI>'s Power, when she was thus got with Child by him; and therefore not he, but her own Father ought to have condemned her, if this Judgment had belonged to him as to the Master of the Family. And therefore some of the Rabbins suppose, that when <HI>Judah</HI> gave this Judgment against <HI>Thamar,</HI> he did not act either as a Father, or Master of the Family, for he was then under the Power of the <HI>Cananites</HI>; (who cer∣tainly had some Civil Government among them at that time) and therefore they suppose that he acted thus as a Civil Judge, appointed by the supreme Magistrate of that Nation.</P>
<P>But to defend the Instance I have given you of a Father of a Family lo∣sing his power of Life and Death, upon his becoming a part or Member of another Family; you your self have already yielded me as much as <HI>I</HI> can rea∣sonably desire for the defence of my Assertion, since you allow this power of Life and Death to Fathers, not as such, but as Lords, and Masters over their Children, as over their Slaves; and if so, <HI>I</HI> desire to know who can challenge this Power but the Master of the Family with whom he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ives, un∣less you can suppose two distinct Heads, or Masters in the same House, and
<PB N="35" REF="26"/>
then they will not be one Family, but two, under distinct Heads, each of them still retaining their distinct Rights. But you will say, that this Boarder, or Inmate, is not a Servant, or Slave to the Master with whom he lives, and therefore hath not forfeited; or given up his Right, or Power of Life and Death over his own Children to him; but it is no matter whether he did, or not, since by making himself a Member of the others Family, he ceased to be Master of his own, and concequently must lose all the Natural Rights or Prerogatives belonging to it, of which, I grant this of Life and Death to be the chief; for if Families in the state of Nature, are like so many distin Commonweat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, in∣dependant upon each other; it will likewise follow, that the Heads of those Families must be in all things necessary for the Good and Preservation of the Family, like so many distinct Civil Soveraigns, and consequently must have a power of Life and Death, and also of making Laws, with Punishments an∣nexed to them▪ in all Cases where the good and peace of the Family require it. If therefore in a Civil State, or Monarchy, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>solute Prince come into the Dominions or Teritories of another, it is acknowledg'd by all Writets on this Subject, That such a Prince loses that power of Life and Death which he had be∣fore, and cannot exercise it as long as he is in the other Princes Dominions: So by the same Reason, if the Masters of Families, in the State of Nature, are like so many Civil Soveraigns, it will follow, that they must cease to be such, when they become members of anothers Family, unless you will fall into the absurdity of supposing to absolute independant Heads, or Masters, in one and the same House; which, what a confusion it would bring, I leave to your self to judge.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not much dispute this Power of Life and Death with you, as belonging to Masters of seperate Families: But pray shew me how they can exercise this Power over the Lives of those that are under their Jurisdiction, un∣less it were granted them by God, by virtue of that <HI>Original Power</HI> given to <HI>Adam,</HI> not only as a Father, but Prince of his Posterity.</P>

<SPEAKER>F,</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not doubt but I shall give you a satisfactory Answer to this important Demand, without supposing any extraordinary Divine Commission from God to <HI>Adam</HI>; For as for your Instance of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s making War, Leagues, or Covemants with other Princes, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no more than what any Master of a seperat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Family may do for his own and their defence; and what if you or I were Masters of a Family in the <HI>In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies,</HI> where their is no Power above us, we might do as well as <HI>Abraham,</HI> and all this without any other Commission from God, than the great Right of Nature, Self-preservation, and the Well performance of that trust which God hath put into our hands, of defending, and providing for our selves and our Families, since if God hath ordained the End, he hath likewise ordained all means necessary thereunto; and therefore there is no such great Mystery in this as you suppose.</P>

<P>If there were no more in it than a meer Right of Self defence, for which <HI>I</HI> grant Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aliation, or Revenge may be also necessary, you would have a great d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l of Reason on your side; But pray shew me how a Fa∣ther, or Master of a Family▪ can Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mn either his Wife, Child, or Servant to Death, as a Punishment for any enormous Crime, such as <HI>I</HI> have mentioned (and you agreed to) without such a Divine Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion as <HI>I</HI> suppose <HI>Adam</HI> had. Since <HI>I</HI> own Revenge or Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e used by private men in the State of Nature, by the Right of Self defence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="36" REF="27"/>
grant may be exercised between equals; But since all punishments, properly taken, are the Acts of Superiors towards their Inferiors, I cannot conceive how any Father, or Master of a Family, can inflict so great a Punishment as Death upon any Member of it, unless he derived this Power immediately from God, by virtue of the Divine Charter committed by him to <HI>Adam,</HI> and and from thence to be derived to all Masters of Families, or civil Soveraigns, who could never derive this Power from the Joynt Compacts or consent of Fa∣thers, of Masters of Families; since no man could convey that to another, which he had not himself. And I have already, I think, with a great deal of Truth Asserted, That no man hath power over his own Life, to take it away when he pleases, and therefore cannot have it over another man's; much less can convey any such Right to others, except it were granted at first by God, in the manner I have supposed, which I conceive may easily be made out by several places in <HI>Genesis</HI>; by which it plainly appears that <HI>Adam,</HI> and after him <HI>Noah,</HI> were supernaturally endued with this Divine Power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> am satisfied that this Hypothesis is extreamly absurd, since if it were so only, Christian or Jewish Soveraigns, or Magistrates, who acknow∣ledg the Scriptures, could lay any claim to▪ or exercise this Divine Power; whereas we find it practised by all those Nations, with whom the memory of <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI> is quite lost, and therefore must claim this Prerogative, not from any Revealed, but Natural Law of God; yet however since you think you have such clear Texts of Scripture on your side, I desire you to produce them, tho, if they should make out what you say, they would only serve to confirm, by Divine Revelation, that Prerogative of Life and Death, which all Masters of Families, as well as Civil Soveraigns, enjoyed by the Law of Nature, before ever the Bible was written.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for my own part, I am so well satisfied of this Supream Power of life and death granted at first by God to <HI>Adam,</HI> and after to <HI>Noah,</HI> that I cannot see that without the supposal of this, any Supream power could lawfully be exercised by civil Soveraigns at this day: And therefore I am of Mr. <HI><UNCLEAR>Selden</UNCLEAR></HI>'s opinion, who in his most learned Treatise, <HI>De Iure gentium apud Hebraeos,</HI> maintains with the <HI>Iewish</HI> Rabbins, That the Law of Nature can never be planly proved, and made out by Reason, without a Tradition of its Preceps, as given by God to <HI>Adam,</HI> and thence conveyed to <HI>Noah,</HI> and his posterity: Which Divine Laws, or Commands, are called by the <HI>Iews</HI> the Seven precepts of <HI>Noah,</HI> which whatsoever Nation, or People, would observe, they permitted them to live as Inhabitans among them; though they did not embrace Circumci∣sion, or those other Rights and Ceremonies commanded by the Law of <HI>Moses.</HI> Now amongst these Precepts, that of instituting publick Judgments for capital Crimes, is one of the first, in pursuance of that Command which God gave <HI>Noah</HI> immediately after the Flood, <HI>Gen.</HI> 9. v. 6. <HI>Whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.</HI> By which Text almost all Commentators understand that it is not any com∣mon man, but the person of the civil Magistrate or Soveraign that is to be meant: Since it would be both impracticable, and also breed great confusion in civil Societies, if by this word <HI>man,</HI> every common person, not endued by God with this Supream Power of Life and Death, should be understood; and there∣fore I do suppose with the most Learned <HI>Iews,</HI> that this Power was first exer∣cised by vertue of that Divine Charter that was given of it by God to <HI>Adam,</HI> and then renewed again to <HI>Noah,</HI> by the Text abovementioned.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="27"/>Now that <HI>Adam</HI> had by Divine grant an absolute Dominion over the whole World,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F.</HI> O▪ 210, 211▪</NOTE> and all Creatures therein contained, will appear from <HI>Gen.</HI> 1. v. 27, 28. (here is the Bible, I desire you would read it with me) <HI>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them; and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the Earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the Fish of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth.</HI> By which Grant, or Donation, from God of subduing the Earth, and having dominion over the Creatures, <HI>Adam</HI> was made the general Lord of all things, with such a particular propriety to himself, as did exclude his Children from having any share in it. So that if <HI>Cain</HI> had his Fields for Corn, or <HI>Abel</HI> his Flocks, and Pasture for them, it was only by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Grant▪ or Assignation, none of his Children or Descendents having any property in Lands or Goods, without his particular Grant, or Permission.</P>

<P>You must pardon me, Sir, if I cannot be of your Opinion, that all the Preceps of the Law of Nature must depend upon no firmer foundation, than a Tradition of the Seven Preceps, supposed by the <HI>Jewish</HI> Rabbins to be given to <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> and from them conveyed to all their Posterity, since we find not the least mention of any such Precepts in the Scripture, or in <HI>Josephus, Philo Judaeus,</HI> or any other ancient Writer, but only in the <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmud</HI>: Which though it pretends to a great Antiquity in its Traditions, yet any judicious man that will but peruse it, may easily see the falshood, as well as absurdity of the pretended Tradition of these Precepts; one of which is against ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the Members of any living Creature; which savours so strongly of a <HI>Jewish</HI> Su∣perstition, that if that were a true Precept, or Law of Nature, no man could eat a Dish of Lambstones, or a Black pudding, without sinning a∣gainst the Law of Nature: And it is very impro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to suppose, that all mankind, except <HI>Jews, Christians</HI> and <HI>Mahometans,</HI> should be obliged to live or act by those Laws or Preceps they never heard of. For▪ it (as you your self must grant) the memory or tradition of these Precepts be quite lost amongst all Nations, except the <HI>Jews,</HI> it is all one as if they had acted without any Law at all; and consequently, if they have not some better grounds for their obser∣vation of the Law of Nature, than these Preceps of <HI>Noah,</HI> I doubt whether (ac∣cording to your Hypothesis) all Civil Soveraigns that do not own the original of their Power of life and death▪ to this Divine Charter granted to <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> must be no better than Murtherers, since they take upon them to exer∣cise this great Prerogative without any Divine Authority for so doing. But I hope to shew you before we have concluded this conversation, that, not only the Power of Life, and Death, but also other Laws of Nature, may easily be deduced, by Reason, to have been given by God to Mankind, by the ordi∣nary Course of his Providence, without recurring to Divine Revelation; which can only oblige those that have heard of it. But since you lay so much stress upon those Texts of Scripture you have now cited; <HI>I</HI> pray give me leave to examine, whether they will bear that sense you put upon them. As for the first of those Texts you quote, <HI>Whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed,</HI> &amp;c. Suppose <HI>I</HI> should take it in that sense you put upon it, only to extend to Civil Soveraigns, or Magistrates, it will be so far from proving a Power of Life and Death to have been granted by God to <HI>Adam,</HI> and from him conveyed to <HI>Noah,</HI> that this place seems to imply the
<PB N="38" REF="28"/>
contrary; for if it was a known Law before, that Murther was to be punish∣ed with death by a Father, or other Magistrate, to what purpose was this Command now given to <HI>Noah</HI>? Since if it were a Divine Law before the Flood, wherefore is it here repeated? And therefore all Expositors a∣gree, that this is the first Precept enjoyning Murther to be punished by the Civil Magistrate, which, before any of the Kin of the Person slain might have executed, as appears by <HI>Genesis</HI> 4. v. 14. when <HI>Cain</HI> said unto the Lord, <HI>I shall be a fugitive, and a vagabond on the Earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me, shall slay me</HI>; which had been a needless fear, if none but <HI>Adam</HI> had a power to take away his life for the murther of his Brother, as you suppose; much less that God should have needed to have set a mark upon him to keep him from being murthered by his Brethren, or other Relations. Nor will that other place you cite out of <HI>Genesis</HI> prove <HI>Adam</HI>'s sole dominion over the Earth, and all the things and persons therein contain∣ed: For if you please to consider it, you will find, That it is so far from pro∣ving your Opinion, that it speaks the direct contrary. pray therefore ob∣serve of whom <HI>Moses</HI> speaks in that place; surely not of <HI>Adam</HI> alone, when he says, <HI>Male and Female created he them; and God blessed them, and said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the Earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the Fish of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth:</HI> From whence we may observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> n. <HI>M. p.</HI> 10.</NOTE> First, That these words being di∣rected in the plural number, both to the Male and Female, were not intended to <HI>Adam</HI> alone, but by way of anticipa∣tion, not only to himself, and <HI>Eve,</HI> (who was not then made) but likewise to their Posterity (that is) all mankind; Then that they should <HI>be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the Earth, and subdue it,</HI> (that is, possess and enjoy it) <HI>and have dominion,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>over every living thing that moveth</HI> (in the <HI>Hebrew</HI>) creepeth upon the face of the Earth. By which words it appears, That not any dominion over Mankind, but only over Bruit-beasts, that move or creep upon the Earth, is hereby conferred. And that this must be the true meaning of this place, is plain, if you will but read the two next Verses that follow. <HI>And God said, Behold, I have given you every Herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the Earth; and every Tree, in which is the fruit of a Tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the Earth, and to every Fowl of the Air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the Earth, wherein there is life▪ I have given every green Herb for meat; and it was so.</HI> Which words are certainly directed to the same persons as the former (that is) to all Mankind, by the same Argument as that every green Herb is here granted for meat to every Beast of the Earth, and every Fowl of the Air, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that then was, or ever shall exist in Nature. So that this Text which you have cited to prove this absolute and sole dominion of <HI>Adam</HI> over the Earth, and all thee Creatures therein contained, is so far from proving any such thing, that it seems to me to make out the direct contrary Doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Earth, and all the Creatures th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rein, were not granted to <HI>Adam</HI> alone, as the sole Lord and Master of them; but in common to himself, his Wife, and all his Po∣sterity, who had as good a right to them, `as he had himself. So that I must tell you, if you intend to bring me over to your Opinion, you must produce some better proofs out of Scripture, or Reason, than those made use of by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>R.

<PB N="39" REF="28"/>
absolute Power over his Wife, and all his posterity, than hitherto you have done; since I cannot see any <HI>Divine Charter</HI> granted by God in Scripture, of any <HI>absolute power,</HI> or dominion, over their Lives, or Persons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall, Sir, do my best endeavour to give you all the satisfaction I can possibly therein; therefore I desire you farther to take notice, That Mr. <HI>Sel∣den,</HI> in his <HI>Mare Clasum,</HI> and all the <HI>Jewish</HI> Rabbins have understood this Text in <HI>Genesis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 4.</NOTE> to give <HI>Adam</HI> an absolute power over the Earth, and all things therein contained, ex∣clusive to his Posterity as long as he lived. And the said Au∣thor from the ancient Tradition of the <HI>Jews,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> is of the same Opinion in his <HI>Mare Clausum</HI>▪ So that if Sir <HI>R. F.</HI> and divers others have erred in the sense of this place, I believe it is more than you or I can prove, since sure they would not have put this sense upon it, without they had some good reason for it.</P>
<P>But this much I suppose you will admit, that <HI>Adam</HI> was created by God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 3.27.</NOTE> and is in Scripture called the Son of God, as indeed he was; and if so, let your self, or any other ra∣tional man consider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Whether it be at all likely that God should not endow this Son of his,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P.</HI> Sect. 32.</NOTE> the Father of mankind, with somuch Authority and Power as should enable him to govern his own Family, and Children, as long as he lived, without depending upon them for their consent, and chopping Logick with them, whethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Commands were reasonable, or lawful or not: And if a po∣wer of life and death was necessary (as the murther of <HI>Abel</HI> by <HI>Cain</HI> shews it was) whether <HI>Adam</HI> had no more share in that Power, than any of his Chil∣dren, or Grand-children: which is sufficient to shew you the absurdity of your Tenets. That the Authority of <HI>Adam</HI> over his posterity was not absolute in its exercise, as well as perpetual in its duration; and this I think you cannot but admit, because you have already acknowledged this Power of life and death to proceed from, or to be granted by God to <HI>Adam</HI>; and so consequently must have continued with him as long as he lived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I perceive you find your Monarchy, or absolute Dominion of <HI>Adam</HI> over <HI>Eve,</HI> and all her Posterity, as also over all the Creatures of the Earth, not to be proved from any of these Places of Scripture you have brought for this extravagant Opinion▪ and therefore you now urge upon me my own concession of this Supream and Absolute Authority of Life and Death, which I do not de∣ny but <HI>Adam</HI> might have exercised in some cases over his Wife and Children as long as they continued part of his Family: But that he was not endued with this Prerogative as a Father, but as a Head or Master of his own Family, I think I have sufficiently proved, and therefore need not repeat it. And indeed your own instance of the murther of <HI>Abel</HI> by <HI>Cain,</HI> (which for all we can find past unpunish'd by <HI>Adam</HI>) sufficienly proves, That this Power of Life and Death o∣ver his Children or Grand children, when once they were separated from his Fa∣mily, was not a necessary Prerogative of his Government, or else that his Chil∣dren, and Grand-children, when they have erected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> milies of their own, had it as much from God as he▪ and that from the same reason which you give, why God endowed <HI>Adam</HI> with it, <HI>viz.</HI> because without such a Power they could not have been enabled to Govern their Children and Families as long as they lived. So that <HI>Adam</HI>'s being created by God, or called his Son, gave him not a jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more power over his Children, and his Descendents, than what
<PB N="40" REF="29"/>
as a Master, or Head of a Family he would have had by the Law of Nature however; and it is all one in this Case, whether you suppose Mankind to have been created by God, or to have existed from all Eternity, provided you hold the being of a God, according to the Hypothesis of the more modern, <HI>Plato∣nists,</HI> who tho they held the Eternity of the World, yet likewise owned all things to be governed by God's Providence: And therefore if on this Suppo∣sition, Mankind could not be well governed, nor preserved, without inflicting of Capital Punishments for great Crimes, and that they are necessary for its peace and preservation; it is likewise as necessary, that there should be some Judge appointed by God to inflict them, which in the State of Nature can be only the Head, or Master of a Family; as after Civil Government is once in∣stituted, it belongs to the Civil Sovereign, or Commonwealth. And this I hope will serve to answer your Scruple, how <HI>Adam,</HI> or any other Master of a separate Family, may very well be endued with this great Power of Life and Death by the Law of Nature, without supposing any Charter granted him for it by Divine Revelation▪ or else depending upon his Childrens consent for his exercise of it.</P>
<P>But before I farther consider, whether this Power of <HI>Adam,</HI> or of any other Father, or Master, be perpetual or not, and extends any farther than his own Family, give me leave to examine, Whether or no Children, when grown to years of Discretion, and even whilst they continue Members of their Father's Family, may not in some Cases chop Logick with him (as you call it) and not only question, but judge whether their Commands be reasonable, or lawful, or not; or else <HI>Abraham</HI> (for example) mut have sacri∣ficed to Idols,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Jos. <HI>Ant. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI></NOTE> because his Father bid him. Whereas <HI>Josephus</HI> tells us, He <HI>rather chose to quit his Country, and his Father's house, than to sin against God.</HI> And therefore I think you cannot deny, but if Husbands, or Fathers command their Wives or Children to do any thing that is morally unlawful, or contrary to the Laws of God, or Nature, they may lawfully (nay are obliged) not to obey such unlawful Commands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall so far agree with you, That if the thing command∣ed be apparently contrary to the Laws of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P.</HI> Sect. 48.</NOTE> and Nature, that they are not obliged to obey their Commands; but they must be evidently, and apparently so, before they thus take upon them to refuse obedience to them; otherwise I deny that their Conscience, how∣ever misguided, ought to be any excuse, or just ground of their disobedience. For if their Conscience be truly grounded upon the Laws of God, or Nature, that will excuse them, but if it be not, Conscience without such a Law, can never do it. And yet this non-performance of the unlawful Commands of the Husband, or Father, may very well consist without any Anarchy, or disorder in the Family, since the Wife and Children must always yield him an active-obe∣dience, in performing all his Commands; or else a passive one, in submitting to whatever harsh usage, or punishment such a Husband, or Father shall please to exercise, or inflict upon them for their non performance of them, tho never so unlawful▪ But yet certainly in all possible and indifferent things, Children are boun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yeild, not only a passive, but an active obedience to their Father's commands. For if his Children should have a liberty to judge of his commands, whether they are reasonable, or not, what can ensue but Anarchy and Confusion in all Families?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am glad we are so far agreed, that a Wife and Children in the
<PB N="41" REF="29"/>
state of Nature have liberty to Judge of their Husband's and Father's Com∣mands, whether they are lawful, or not, and also to disobey them, when they are not so: And I think I may carry this a little farther, and affirm, That such Wife and Children ought not to obey the Commands of such a Husband or Father, though they are not really contrary to such Divine, or Moral Laws, but only erroneously supposed so by them; and therefore most Casuists agree, That even an erroneous Conscience does oblige, as long as a man lies under that mistake. For St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, <HI>Whatsoever is not of faith, is sin,</HI> Rom. 14. Nay farther, Such an erroneous Conscience may excuse a man before God, if his ignorance was not wilful, but invincible, and not proceeding from his own fault; but of this no man can Judge, but God alone, and the Party whose Conscience it is; and therefore such a Husband, or Father, can have no Right or Authority to compel their Wives and Children to perform such Com∣mands, because the Will ought always to follow the Dictates of the Under∣standing; and therefore they should not be forced to do that which they Judge contrary to God's Moral, or Divine Law; <HI>since Conscience may be instructed, but can never be forced.</HI> Neither will your distinction of an Active and Passive Obedience help you in this matter; For Active Obedience I understand well enough; but as for Passive Obedience, I think it is next door to that we call a Bull, or Nonsense. And to prove this, I shall give you this plain instance; Suppose you had a <HI>Iew</HI> to your Servant, and should command him to do you some work or other on a <HI>Saturday,</HI> which he judged a Breach of the Fourth Commandment, that forbids him to work on the Seventh Day, (or Sabbath) and you being very angry, should cudgel him soundly for this refusal; where∣upon he tells you, That you may beat him as long as you please, he would not resist, but yield a passive Obedience; but yet could not perform your Com∣mands. I ask you now, Whether you would rest satisfied that this <HI>Iewish</HI> Ser∣vant had sufficiently performed what you bad him, by submitting to your cudgelling? And whether your Dinner or Horse would not be as much un∣dress'd after this sort of passive Obedience, as it was before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps indeed this Phrase of Passive Obedience may be somewhat im∣proper, and may be more properly termed an absolute Subjection, or Submissi∣on; but it is all one what we call it, as long as you understand what we mean, since such Submission doth sufficiently avoid that Anarchy and confusion which would necessarily follow, in case it were lawful for Wives, or Children, in any case whatsoever, to resist their Husbands, or Fathers, though for the defence of life it self; since no Government can be maintained, where the Parties go∣verned have a right to resist their Superiors, or Governors, in any case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant indeed that no Government can be maintained where the Parties governed resist their Superiours or Governors in the due exercise of their Power;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> n. <HI>M. p.</HI> 110.</NOTE> but when, they exceed those limits, they cease to Act as true Superiors, or Governors; and therefore when instead of Husbands, or Fathers, they prove Destroyers of their Families, I doubt not but they may then be lawfully resisted by them. For suppose such a Father of a Family should in a furious or drunken fit go about to kill his Wife, or one of his innocent Children, can any body think this was Treason against the Monarch of the Family, if his Wife, or one of his Sons, should rescue her self, or this innocent Child out of his hands by force, if they could not otherwise quiet him?</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>This supposition of Madness, or Drunkenness, in Fathers of Families,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P. Sect.</HI> 47.</NOTE> you Gentlemen of Commonwealth Principles make great use of, to justify your Doctrin of Resistance; and I know no reason why you might not extend it as well to Anger, Lust, or any other Passion that a man is subject to; and have given all the World a power to Judg when a man is Drunk, or mad, as well as his Wife, Children, or Servants, nor do I know why you so much insist upon it, but because the Authors from whence you had it, are so in love with Rebellion and Disorder, that they seek and catch at every opportunity to recommend it to the World. But, I believe, had you a Wife, Child, or Servant, that should take the liber∣ty of controling you upon this pretence, you would be more enraged with the Reason of the Resistance, than with the Resistance it self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, <HI>Sir,</HI> any thing I have said can so far transport you to passion, as to make such unkind Reflections upon your Friends; but pray be not so hot; is it not possible that a Master, or Father, in the State of Nature, may be mad, or drunk?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; And is it not possible also that the Wife may be so too?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P. Ibid.</HI></NOTE> Now suppose they should mutually charge each other with madness, or drinking too much, who shall Judg betwixt them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> What horrible confusion must this introduce into all Societies, to give inferiors a power to Judg their Superiors to be mad, or drunk, and there∣upon to resist, and oppose them with force? But if it doth at any time happen; Wives, Children, and Servants, that are dutiful, may have ways to appease their Husbands, Fathers, or Masters, when mad, or drunk, without resisting or Fighting them; as by getting out of the way, or by submission, Prayers and Tears, which Nature hath taught them on such occasions to make use of, and which is a thousand times a better method, than those violent Courses you propose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>All I desire of you in this Conversation, is, that you would be pleased to believe, I do not Argue out of any love to Rebellion, or Disorder, or that I desire to encourage it in private Families, much less to recommend it to the World; only what I speak, is purely out of a desire of the happiness and pre∣servation of Mankind; and <HI>I</HI> hope <HI>I</HI> say no more, than what all sober men will allow may be every day practised in private Families; and therefore, since you will needs have it, <HI>I</HI> do extend this Power of Resistance, not only to Madness, or Drunkenness alone, but even to Anger, Lust, or any other Exorbitant Passion a man can be subject to; and <HI>I</HI> do likewise give all the World a power to Judg when such a man is mad, or furiously passionate, as well as his Wife, Servants, or Children, if in those drunken or mad fits he goeth about to kill them, or any else. For I think in that case, you will not deny, but any honest Neighbour may step in and bind him, or hold his hands, and so may likewise the Wife or Children themselves. As suppose this Father or Husband should be so far Transported with passion, or lust, as to go about to kill his Wife, or ravish his Daughter; <HI>I</HI> hope you will not deny, but they may lawfully resist him, if they can neither run away, nor yet pacify him by submission, prayers, or tears, which <HI>I</HI> grant are much better methods, if they may prevail: But what if they can neither get away, nor yet any of those gentle means, you propose, can work any good upon him, what shall they do then? Can any one believe that God hath appointed an innocent Wife, or Children, to be made a Sacrifice to the madness, drunkenness, passion, or lust of such a Father, or Husband? And as for the Case you put, Where the
<PB N="43" REF="30"/>
Husband or Wife should charge each other with madness, or drinking too much, who should judg between them? it is a meer Cavil; for as long as they only fall out, and only brangle, it is no matter whether there be any Judg, or not. But if it proceeds to blows, and they are like to mischif or kill each other, no doubt but the Children or Neighbours may come in, and part them; and may either hold, or shut up one, or both of them, till they are sober.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, <HI>Sir,</HI> let us leave this touchy Discourse concerning Self-defence, till anon, when we shall have occasion to fall more naturally upon it. Suppose then I should at present grant you, That a Wise or Children may (in case of such Extremities as may happen to them by the madness, or Drunkenness of the Husband, or Father) restrain, or resist his violence, in case no other means can prevail; what is this to disobeying his Commands, or resisting him when he is sober? Which certainly they have no right to do. But to come as near you as possible I can, and to let you see I am not a man of a domineering temper, and who approves of unnecessary Severities, or unnatural Rigours, either in Masters of Families, Husbands, or Fathers; I grant that no Father, or Master of a Family, has any right to punish, or put to death the meanest of his Slaves, much less his Children, without a sufficient cause; or that he may sell his Chil∣dren, or otherwise Tyrannize over them by cruel usage, or too severe punish∣ments, since they are not only part of his own Substance, and to whom by the order of the Creation he gave a being, but was also (as you well observe) ordained by God for their happiness, and preservation, as they were also (as well as his Wife) for his constant help, comfort and subsistence; and therefore they were, as much, or more, made for him, as he for them, as it is plain concerning the Wife from the Text in <HI>Genesis,</HI> when <HI>God said, It is not good that the man should be alone, I will make him a help meet for him,</HI> Gen. 2.17. (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Woman; and therefore, as her subjection to her Husband is perpe∣tual, as long as she lives, so likewise is that of the Children in whom he acqui∣reth a Property by their Education for so many years; which I look upon as a greater obligation than their Generation; and over both whom he must, in the State of Nature, have an absolute power of life and death; which though I grant he may happen sometimes to abuse, yet I suppose no person living hath any right in that state to resist him in the Execution of it, much less to call him to an account, or punish him for the Male-administration of his Power. And you have granted, that the Husband in the state of Nature hath a power of life and death over his Wife, if she murthers her Children, or commits any other abominable sin against Nature; and that then she may be justly cut off from the Family, and punish'd as an Enemy to Mankind, and so certainly may his Children too. But what need <HI>I</HI> say any more of this Subject, when you have not as yet answered my former Arguments, concerning the absoluteness and per∣petuiry of this Conjugal Subjection, (and that which will likewise follow from it) the constant service and subjection of Wives and Children to their Fathers in the state of Nature. Therefore pray, <HI>Sir,</HI> let us return again to that Head, and let me hear what you have to object against those Reasons <HI>I</HI> have brought for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon, <HI>Sir,</HI> if <HI>I</HI> have not kept so close to the Point as <HI>I</HI> might have done; but you may thank your self for it, who brought me off from what <HI>I</HI> was going farther to say on that Head, by your discourse of <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> and <HI>Non-Resistance,</HI> and <HI>I</HI> know not what strange unintel∣ligible Power of Life and Death conferred by God on <HI>Adam,</HI> as a Husband, and a Father. But first give me leave farther to prove, that this subjection of
<PB N="44" REF="31"/>
the Wife is neither absolute, nor irrevocable. For proof of which I shall lay down these Principles. 1. That the Wife in the State of Nature, when she submits her self to the power of her Husband, does it to live as happily as she did before, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rather to enjoy more of the comforts of life than in a sin∣gle State. 2. That therefore she did not renounce either her own happiness or Self-preservation. 3. Neither did she make him the sole and absolute Judg of the means that may conduce to these ends: for if this were so, let him use her never so cruelly, or severely, she could have no cause to censure him, or complain in the least against him. 4. If she have not so absolutely given up her Will to his, she is still Judge when she is well used by him; or else so cruelly, that it is no longer to be endured. And therefore if such a Hus∣band will not allow his Wife sufficient Food and Raiment, and other neces∣saries; or that he uses her cruelly, by beating, or other punishments, or hath endeavoured to take away her Life; in all these cases in the State of Nature, and where there is no Superior Power to complain, or appeal to, she may certainly quit him; and I think she is not bound to return, to co-habit with him again, until she is satisfied he is sorry for his former cruel Treatment of her, and is resolved to make amends for the future. But whether this Re∣pentance be real, or not, she only can be Judge, since she can only Judge of her own happiness, and the means of her preservation. And the end of Matri∣mony being for their mutual happiness, and help to each other; if he have broke his part of the Compact, she is then so far discharged from hers, and consequently in the meer state of Nature (which is that we are now talking of) the <HI>Vinculum Matrimonii</HI> (as you Civilians term it) will be likewise dissolved: So likewise such a Husband, for no just cause, or crime in the Wife, but only to be rid of her, should endeavour to take away her life, as suppose to strangle her in her sleep, or the like, no doubt but she may (notwithstanding your Conjugal Subjection) resist him by force, and save her life, until she can call in her Children, or Family, for her rescue and assistance; who sure may also notwithstanding this absolute Daspotick Power you place in their Father, or Master, rescure her from his rage and malice whether he will or not: Nay they are bound to do it, unless they will be Accessaries to her Murther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are doubtful Cases at best, and do very seldom happen; and a Husband can scarce ever be supposed to be so wicked, as to hate, and destroy his own Flesh, and therefore we need not make Laws on purpose for Cases that so rarely happen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rarely happen! I see you are not very conversant at the <HI>Old Bayly,</HI> nor at our Countrey Assizes; where if you please to come, you may often hear of Cases of this Nature; and I wonder you that are a Civilian, and have so many Matrimonial Causes in your Spiritual Courts, brought by Wives for Separation, <HI>propter Saevitiam,</HI> &amp;c. Should doubt whether Husbands do often use their Wives so ill, that it is not to be endured. But if the Wife have these Privi∣leges, pray tell me why the Children shall not have the same, according to your own Maxime of <HI>partus Sequitur Ventrem,</HI> since the Subjection of Chil∣dren must be according to your own Principles, of the same natere with that of the Mother; and then pray what becomes of this absolute and perpetual Subjection you talk of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet I hope you will not affirm, but that Children are under higher ob∣ligations of Duty and Obedience to their Father, than a Wife is to her Hus∣band, with whom perhaps she may in some cases be upon equal terms; but Children can never be so in respect of their Father, to whom they are always
<PB N="45" REF="31"/>
inferior, and ought to be absolutely Subject in the state of Nature (that is) be∣fore Civil Laws have restrained Paternal Power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you <HI>Sir,</HI> for bringing me so naturally to the other Head I was coming to, and I agree with you in your other Maxim, of <HI>Quicquid ex me &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xore mea nascitur in potestate mea est,</HI> yet not in your sense; For i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I should grant, that the Father's Power over the Child, commences from his Power over the Mother by her becoming his Wife, and submitting her self, and con∣sequently all the issue that should be begotten of her, to her Husband's Power; yet (as I have proved already) in case of the Wife, so I think I may affirm the same in that of the Children, That they are not deliver'd by God so abso∣lutely to the Father's Will, or disposal, as that they have no Right, when they attain to years of Discretion, to seek their own happiness and preservation in another place, in case the Father uses them as Slaves, or else goes about to take away their Lives without any just cause, since when Children are at those years, I think they are by the Laws of Nature sufficient Judges of their own happiness, or misery, that is, whether they are well, or ill used; and whether their Lives are in danger, or not, by their Father's Cruelty.</P>
<P>For tho' I grant that Children considered as such, are always inferior to their Parents; yet I must likewise affirm, that in another respect, as they are men, and make a part of that great aggregate body of mankind, they are in all points equal to them; that is, as the Parents have a right to Life, Happiness, and Self-preservation, so have they likewise, and consequentially to all necessary means thereunto, such as Food, Cloaths, Liberty (I mean from being used as Slaves) which Principles, if true, will likewise serve for a farther proof against that absolute Property, and Dominion, you supposed to be conferred on <HI>Adam</HI> over the Earth, and all things therein, exclusive to that of his Wife and Children. For if they had a right to a Being and Self-preservation, whether he would or not, so had they likewise to all the means necessary thereunto; and he was not only obliged to provide Food and Raiment for his Children, whilst they were unable to do it for themselves, but also when they grew up to Years of Discretion, they might take it without his assignment, and this by Virtue of that Grant in <HI>Genesis,</HI> I before quoted, <HI>And God said,</HI> Gen. 1. (<HI>viz.</HI> to the Man and the Woman, and in them to all mankind then in their Loins) <HI>Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the Earth,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Behold, to you it shall be for meat.</HI> So that sure you were too rash, in affirming with Sir <HI>R. F.</HI> That a Son, a Slave, and a Servant, were all one at the first: For I hope I have proved the Father doth not acquire any absolute Property in the person of the Son, either by his begetting him, or bringing him up; for then I grant, a Son and a Slave would be all one. But if you please better to consider it, you will find, that Fathers were never ordained by God for perpetual Lords and Masters over their Children, but rather as Tutors and Guardians, till they are of Years of Discretion, and able to shift for themselves; God having designed the Father to beget, and bring up his Child, nor for his own interest, or ad∣vantage only, but rather for the Child's happiness and preservation, which by the Laws of God and Nature he is bound to procure: For as it is the Son's Duty never to do any Action that may make his Father repent his be∣getting, or bringing him up; so on the other side, the Father ought not to Treat his Son so severely, as to make him weaay of his Family, much less of his Life. It is the Apostle's Precept, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 6.4. <HI>Parents provoke
<PB N="46" REF="32"/>
not your Children to wrath</HI>; which certainly he knew they were apt to do, or else that precept had been needless. Now pray tell me, if <HI>Adam</HI> had used one of his Sons (whom he loved worse than the rest) so cruelly, as to make him a Slave instead of a Son, and when grown a Man, should have put him to all the servile and hard labour imaginable, with scarce Victuals enough to live upon, or Cloaths to cover him, What must this Son have done? Born all patiently? Or else do you think it had been a damnable sin, if he had fled into the Land of <HI>Nod,</HI> to <HI>Cain</HI> his elder Brother?</P>

<P>To answer your Question, I think in the first place it had; for I do not only take <HI>Cain</HI> to have been the first Murderer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P.

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that be the condition of Children, they are then, instead of Sons, as absolute Slaves as any in <HI>Turkey,</HI> whenever their Father pleases. But you have already granted, that Fathers ought not to use their Children like Slaves, nor to sell them for such to others; And tho I have no great kindness for <HI>Cain,</HI> yet I know not what warrant you have to call him Rebel; I am sure neither the Scripture, nor <HI>Iosephus,</HI> mention his going to the Land of <HI>Nod,</HI> as an offence committed against his King and Father <HI>Adam</HI>; but rather as a piece of compliance, or obedience to God's Sentence, who had made it part of his Curse so to do.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not much trouble my self whether <HI>Cain</HI> was a Rebel or not; I only tell you▪ what some Learned men have thought of his quitting his Coun∣try; but as for other Children, tho I grant their Fathers ought not to use them like Slaves, yet if they should happen to do so, I think such Children ought to bear it as a Judgment inflicted by God for their Sins, and should not by any means set themselves free, tho their Fathers use them never so severe∣ly, since it is God's will they should be Born, and continue under the power of such severe Fathers.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, <HI>Sir,</HI> tell me, what if this Son had fallen into the power of a Stranger who would thus make a Slave of him, Was he likewise bound to bear this as a punishment from God for his Sins, and might he by no means set himself free? Since this could not happen without God's permissive Providence at least, and I think you will s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arce prove it more in the Case of the Father, unless you will allow God to be the Author of Tyranny and Oppression.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Grant that a Man that is made a Slave to a Stranger by force, without just cause given by him, may set himself free by what means he can; But I deny he hath the same Liberty in respect of his Father, since the Father's power over him is from God, and so is not the Stranger's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>What power of the Father do you mean? That of making his Son a Slave, or of using him as a Father ought to use a Son? The latter of these I very well understand to be from God, but not the former; And if the Father hath no such power from God, I cannot see how it can be any Act of disobedience in a Son to look to his own Liberty, and Preservation, since Cruelty and Ty∣ranny can never be Prerogatives of Paternal Power, as you your self confess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="47" REF="32"/>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant, indeed, a Father hath no such Power from God to treat his Son thus cruelly; but if he does, I say again▪ That God having ordained the Son to be absolutely subject to his Father, he must endure it, let the consequence of it be what it will: And I suppose you will not deny, but that in case of ne∣cessity, as when a Father hath not wherewithal to nourish, and breed up his Children, he may sell, or assign his interest in them to any person who will un∣dertake to provide for their Nourishment and Education; and that the Chil∣dren so sold, or assigned, do thereby become absolute Servants to the person to whom they were thus assigned as long as they lived; and why this should be their condition in respect of a Stranger, and not so to their Father, I can see no Reason, since their Father would have been at as much trouble and charge for their Education as the Stranger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I so far go along with you, that in case of such necessity as you mention, a Father may sell, or assign the present interest in his Child to a Stranger; yet I cannot see any Reason that this Sale, or Assignment, should confer so abso∣lute a Property in the Person of this Child, as that therefore he should be a Slave to this Master, or Fosterer, as long as he lived, since admitting that the Father, or other person who takes upon him that Care, may perhaps justly claim a Right in the Service or Labour of the Child, to satisfy them for their trouble and charge in bringing him up; yet it doth not therefore follow, that this Service is due as long as the Child lives, but rather until such time as they can make their Labour satisfy them for their Charge and Trouble in keeping him, which may very well be by that time the Child attains to Twenty five years of Age at farthest; and there are those that have offered, to breed up and maintain all the Foundlings, and Bastard Children in <HI>England,</HI> if they may be bound to serve them until about that Age; so that I see no reason, why a few years of Education, should give any Man a right over another's person as long as he lived.</P>
<P>But if you urge, that the Child owed his Life to his Father, or Fosterer, since without his assistance he must have perished, and therefore the Service of the Child's whole Life is but little enough to recompence it: To this I Answer, That the Parents are under an absolute Obligation, by the Laws of God and Nature, to breed up their Child, and they sin, if they do not per∣form it as they ought; the end of a Father being chiefly for the Breeding up, and preservation of the Child, and therefore there is no Reason he should acquire such a property in him, merely because he did his Duty; And the Duty of a Father being to better the condition of his Son, and not to make it worse, I doubt whether an absolute and perpetual Servitude, or Death it self, were the better bargain; and if this Right will not hold for the Father himself, much less will it be for a Fosterer, since he is likewise obliged by the Laws of Nature, and common Humanity, as well as by his Contract with the Father, to breed up this Child so assigned him; and not to let him perish, if he be able to breed him up. Nor ought this Father's or Fosterer's temporal advantage, which he may make of this Child, to be the principal end of his undertaking, but the doing good to mankind, and the advantage he may reap thereby, is to be considered only as an encouragement, and not as the only motive to this Duty, since he is Obliged to do the same thing, tho he were sure the Child would either dye, or be taken away from him, before he could be with him half long enough to satisfy him for his Charge.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="33"/>Neither doth this reason hold true even according to the Scripture Rules of gratitude, That a Man hath a right to exact of one to whom he hath done a Courtesy, or bestowed a Benefit, a return as great as the benefit bestowed; since this were not Beneficence, but meer Bartering, or Exchange; and a Man who had his Life saved by another's assistance, (suppose by pulling him out of the Water) must be obliged by this Principle to submit his Life to his disposal ever after. And therefore I desire you would give me some better Reasons, why such a Son ought to be so absolutely subject to his Father's Power, as that it is not lawful for him upon any account whatsoever to free himself from it, let his Father use him never so cruelly or severely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well <HI>Sir,</HI> since you desire it, I will give you the best Reasons I have, why God cannot permit so unreasonable a Liberty as this would give to all Children, in case they should make use of it whenever they thought fit; and therefore God hath ordained it thus, to take away all those pretences of un∣dutifulness and disobedience which Children might make, should they be per∣mitted to be their own Judges, when they might quit their Father's Family without his leave; which pretence of cruel usage they would be sure to make use of, thereby to leave their Parents upon every slight occasion, saying, That their Fathers were so cruel and severe, that there was no living with them any longer; when, indeed, it was not so, but on the contrary, no just cause of complaint against them, more than bare correcting them for their Faults, and so the Father be Berest of any, nay, all his Children who should be helpful and serviceable to him in his old Age, which would breed great confusion and inconveniences in Families, especially in the State of Nature, as in the Case you have put concerning <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sons, they being the only Servants he could have to make use of, on all occasions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire you in the first place to take notice, That I put this Case con∣cerning <HI>Adam</HI> by way of supposition only; not but that I have a better opi∣nion of our first Parent (notwithstanding his Fall) than to believe him so ill-nattur'd, or that he was ever so cruel as to use his Children thus hardly. But in this depraved state of Nature such unnatural Rigours and Cruelties in Fa∣thers, as well as Disobedience in Children, is but too frequent, which no man needs to doubt of, that will but consult the Custom of divers Nations in <HI>Africa,</HI> and other Countries at this day, where they sell their Sons for Slaves, and ex∣ercise this Fatherly Power with the greatest Tyranny and Rigor; using them as Slaves, or felling them to others for such things as they want. And if you think it against the Law of Nature for such Children, when they see themselves ready to be sold to work in the Mines in <HI>Peru,</HI> or Sugar-works at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> to run away into another Countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to avoid such a Condition, which is as bad or worse than death, you may enjoy your own opinion; but I am sure you'l have but f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w Proselites, but such as are of the like Arbitrary Principles; and as for your Pretence, that if Children should be allowed to judge when their Fathers treated them too severely, or like Slaves, they would all run away, that is but a Subterfuge: For first, it is a needless Caution, Children being, when young, not apt to leave their Parents who have bred them up, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon whom they depend for their subsistence, and to whom, if they are treated like Children, they seldom fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l to bear a natural Duty and Affection; and if well used, they will, when of years of discretion, be likewise willing to stay with them, and look after them when Sick, or Old, not only for Duty, but also for their own advantage, and in hopes of having a share in what Goods, of Estates they may leave behind them when they dye. But if, when they
<PB N="49" REF="33"/>
come to years of discretion, they can better their condition by marrying, and leaving their Fathers Family, their Parents are bound in conscience to let tehm go, since it is their duty to better the condition of their Children, and not to make it worse: Always provided that such Children either take care of their Parents themselves, or else hire others to do it for them, in case they want their assistance by reason of their old age, Poverty or Sickness; but if children may not quit their Fathers Families, thô they are never so hardly or severly dealt with, the consequence will be, that Fathers may keep their children as Slaves as long as they live, thô it were a hundred years, or else may sell them to others, to be used worse if possible; the absurdity of which assertions, and how contrary to the common good of Mankind, <HI>I</HI> might leave to any indifferent Person to judge of.</P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>I</HI> think, <HI>I</HI> may very well (according to the learned <HI>Grotius</HI>) di∣vide the lives of children into <HI>three Periods</HI> of ages. The <HI>first</HI> is the Period of Infancy or imperfect Judgment, before the child comes to be able to exer∣cise his reason. The <HI>Second</HI> is the Period of perfect Judgment or discretior, yet whilst the child continues still part of his Fathers Family. The <HI>third</HI> is, after he has left his Fathers, and entered into another Family, or sets up a Fa∣mily himself. In the <HI>First Period,</HI> all the actions of children are under the ab∣solute Government of their Parents: For since they have not the use of reason, nor are able to judge what is good or bad for themselves, they could not grow up nor b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> preserv'd, unless their Parents judged for them what means best con∣duced to this end; yet this power is still to be directed to the principal end, <HI>viz.</HI> The good and preservation of the Child. In the <HI>second Period,</HI> when they are of Mature Judgment, yet continue part of their Fathers Family, they are still under their Fathers Command, and ought to be obedient to it in all actions which tend to the good of their Fathers Family and concerns. And in both these Ages, I allow the Father has a Right to make his Children work, as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> enable them to get their own living, as also to recompence himself for the pains and care he has taken, and the charge he may have been at in their Edu∣cation, and also to correct them in case they refuse to work or obey his Com∣mands. But in other actions, the Children have a Power of acting freely, yet still with a respect of gratifying and pleasing their Parents, to whom they are obliged for their being and Education▪ Since without their care they could not have attain'd to that age. But this duty being not by force of any absolute sub∣jection, but only of Piety, Gratitude and Observance, it does not make void any act, thô done contrary to their duty. The <HI>third</HI> and <HI>last Period</HI> is, when the Son being of years of discretion, either by marriage or otherwise, is seperated from his Fathers Family. In which Case, he is in all actions free, and at his own disposal, thô still with respect to those duties of Piety and Observance, which such a Son must always owe his Father, the cause thereof being perpetual.</P>

<P>I must beg your pardon if I cannot come over to your opinion, notwith∣standing all you have said in this long discourse; since I cannot conceive,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. O.

<PB N="50" REF="34"/>
Fatherly Power of Princes, who can regulate, limite or assume the Au∣thority of inferiour Fathers for the publick benefit of the Common-wealth. So that naturally the Power of Parents over their Children never ceases by any seperations, thô by the permission of the transcendant, Fatherly power of the Supream Prince, Children may be dispens'd with or priviledged in some cases from obedience to subordinate Parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I must beg your pardon, Sir, if I cannot alter my opinion in this matter, for all that you have now said, since you can give me no better Reasons than what you did at first; and thô you say, you cannot conceive how Children can ever in any case, have a power or moral faculty of doing what they will without their Parents leave, yet they may have such power in many cases, whether you can conceive it or no. For thô I do grant, that Children are always bound to study to please their parents,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. n. M.</HI> 20.21.</NOTE> yet doth not this duty of gratitude or compla∣cency include a full and perfect Dominion of Fathers, in the state of Nature o∣ver the persons of their Children, and an absolute power over them in all cases whatsoever, so that the Children can have no right to consult their own good or preservation, however it may be endangered by their Fathers passion or ill nature, since a Wife is always obliged to this duty of complacency to her Hus∣band; yet is not this so absolute, but that in a State of Nature she may quit his Family in those Cases I have already mentioned, and against which you had nothing to object; and I deny your position, that Children when they at∣tain to years of discretion, derive that power, and liberty they use it many actions, from positive Humane Laws only, or that the power which Parents naturally have over their Children, can never cease by any seperation, but on∣ly by the permission of the Father.</P>
<P>For as for <HI>Bodin,</HI> and divers others that have written on this Subject, they do no more than follw others, who have asserted this absolute power of Fa∣thers upon no better grounds than the Civil or <HI>Roman</HI> Municipal-Laws, with∣out ever troubling themselves to look into the true Original of Paternal Autho∣rity or Filial Subjection, according to the Laws of Reason or Nature. And most Treatises of this Subject being commonly writ by Fathers, no wonder if they have been very exact in setting forth their own power over their Children, but have said little or nothing of the Rights of Children in the State of Nature, and therefore I shall farther let you see, that this duty of Children, even of pleas∣ing or obeying their Parents, can only extend to such things as they may rea∣sonably or Lawfully command. For suppose, that <HI>Adam</HI> had commanded some of his Sons or Daughters never to Marry, you cannot deny but this command had been void: (that being the only means then appointed to propagate Man∣kind,) for when there then lay a higher obligation upon them to encrease and multiply, than there is now, they might then certainly have chosen Wives for themselves, when they were of years of dicretion and capable of Marriage.</P>
<P>And farther to shew you, that Children may in some Cases seperate them∣selves from their Fathers Family and Subjection, without their Fathers consent, is apparent, as to the Daughters, who if they were at first obliged by this pre∣cept to Marry, might likewise do it, whether he would or not, and were to be obedient to their Husbands when they were Married, the obedience which they before owed to their Father, being now transferred to their Husband, or also they must serve two Masters, which is against our Saviours Rule, by which it
<PB N="51" REF="34"/>
appears, that the subjection of Daughters in the State of Nature is not perpe∣tual: And to prove that Sons have a like Right to separate from their Fathers Family, let us suppose that <HI>Adam</HI> had been so cruel, and unnatural as some Fathers are, that being only sensible of the profit he received from his Sons labours, he would never have permitted them to leave his Family, nor to en∣joy any thing of their own, but would have kept them like Slaves as long as they lived; if you affirm, that he might have done so if he had pleased, and that the Sons had no Lawful means to help themselves, since he only was Judge whether ever he thought fit to set them free or not: You your self have already granted the contrary, when you affirmed, that a Father had no Right to sell his Child as a Slave, and then sure he can have as little Right to use him so himself.</P>
<P>But as for what you say against that natural equality of Children to their Parents considered as Men, you might easily have understood it, if your thoughts were not so wholly taken up with this transcendant imaginary Empire of Fa∣thers in the State of Nature, as if they were some what more than Men. For pray tell me, are they not equal, who have the same Right from God to the same things? For if Fathers have a Right to live and be preserved, so likewise have the Children, and if they have a Right to the end, they have likewise the same to the means necessary thereunto, such as are food rayment freedom from Slavery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if they are thus equal, they must likewise when they attain to years of discretion, be endued with a Power of judging for themselves, con∣cerning what things are necessary to their happiness and perservation, and what tends to their misery or destruction, and consequently may very well judge whether their Fathers treat them kindly or cruelly; for if the Father in the State of Nature in the sole Judge of the means that conduce to his Sons happi∣ness and preservation, without his consent he may determine that Poverty. Sla∣very and Torment, shall be fit means, and conducing to this end, which is a∣gainst sense and reason; and tho I grant, that Sons may sometime be mistaken in the true means that may lead to these great ends of life, yet doth not this take away their Right of judging for themselves, any more than it doth the same Right from their Fathers, who as Men are also lyable to the like mistakes. Neither did any Slave or Subject ever give up his will so totally to his Master or Monarch, as absolutely to renounce all Right to happiness and self preserva∣tion, or to the means that may conduce thereunto. But I think, we have suffi∣ciently debated this great point of the Natural Power of Fathers over their Children, and therefore.</P>
<P>Let us in the next place consider whether Children may not upon these Principles in some Cases make use also of self defence, even against their Fathers, if they cannot otherwise avoid certain ruine and destruction, therefore I will first ask you what you think of this Case? A Son in the State of Nature being separated from his Father's Family, and having Children and House of his own, what shall he doe in Case his Father, by the evil suggestions of a Step-mother, or other wicked Persons, be so far incensed against his Son, as to send Men to burn his House, plunder him of his Goods, and destroy his Plantation?</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Son be absolutely set free from his Fathers Family and Power with his consent, I do not deny but that such a Son may resist those Persons his Fa∣ther sends to ruine him and his Family, and may repel their violence by force, but I do not allow the Son the same power to resist the Person of the Father, if he should come himself thus to destroy him.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so? Do you think a Father by being so, hath any greater Right to destroy his Son and ruine his Family then a Stranger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but because the Person of a Father ought always to be esteemed by the Son as Sacred as his Natural Prince, and if he should have a Right to resist his Father by force, he might happen to kill him in the scuffle, which would be a sin against Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, suppose the worst, would this be more a sin against Nature, than to suffer himself, Wife, and Innocent Children to be turned out of all they have, and left to perish by hunger and cold? St. <HI>Paul</HI> says, <HI>That he that doth not provide for his Family is worse than an Infidel,</HI> and <HI>I</HI> think so would the Son be if for fear of hurting his Fathers Person, he should permit all his Family to be exposed to certain beggery and ruine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>This precept of St. <HI>Paul</HI> obliges only, when a Man may provide for his Family by Lawful means, but not when it cannot be procured but by doing what is unlawful, as <HI>I</HI> take this resistance of the Person of the Father to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> grant indeed that a Father, acting as such, is not to be resisted, even when he corrects his Son, but <HI>I</HI> suppose you will not say that in the Case <HI>I</HI> put, he acts as a Father, but an Enemy, when he goeth about without any just occasion to kill or ruine him, unless you can suppose, that the will to preserve and destroy can consist together in the same Subject; neither can you affirm that the Father hath any right to deal thus wickedly and violently towards his Son, and his innocent Family. By what Law then must the Son be obliged to Sacrifice his own life, and that of Wife and Children, and all that he hath, to this imaginary Duty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>There seems to me two good reasons for it. The first is that gratitude which the Son must always owe his Father for his Being and Educa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, and therefore if he give up his Wife, Children, and all that he hath to his Will, it would scarce be a sufficient requital for all the Benefits he hath received from him. The second is, because no circumstances whatsoever can take off or obliterate this Relation; and thô 'tis true your Father, whilst acting thus doth not deal with you as a Father, but an Enemy, yet he is still your Father, and you are and will be always his Son do what you can, and so consequently you will still owe him Subjection. For it is a maxime not only of the Civil Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P.</HI> §. 15.</NOTE> but that of Nature too, and this most of all in the State of Nature, that is, before Civil Laws had restrained tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Paternal Power, <HI>Iura Sanguinis nullo delicto dirimi possunt,</HI> and lastly from the fourth Commandment of, <HI>Honour the Father,</HI> &amp;c. Now no Man can tender honour to him whom he goeth about to resist, and so may also destroy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> consists you have urged this Argument as home as the thing will bear; but yet <HI>I</HI> think <HI>I</HI> can shew you, that the Son is so far from acting against the Law of Nature in thus resisting his Father, that <HI>I</HI> think he would rather trans∣gress it if he acted otherwise. But first to answer your Arguments, <HI>I</HI> deny, that either Generation or Education do confer so great a benefit, that a Man is obliged to Sacrifice himself, his Wife, and Children, and all he hath in return for it. First for Generation, <HI>I</HI> suppose you will not much insist on that, since you must grant that a Father doth not act in that matter, as a voluntary, but Natural Agent; neither is it in his Power to hinder the Child that he gets from being conceived or born; neither did he get him so much to propagate his Spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, as to gratify his own present natural appetite.</P>
<P>Then for Education, which <HI>I</HI> grant is much the greater obligation, since
<PB N="53" REF="35"/>
by the former <HI>I</HI> am only born an irrational helpless Creature, but by the other <HI>I</HI> am made a reasonable Man, able to help and provide for my self, and know∣ing my duty to God and other Men, yet even these obligations are not great enough to make me Sacrifice my self and all that <HI>I</HI> have to his fury or humour. <HI>I</HI> grant indeed, that if it were to save a kind Father's life, a Son may be obliged to venture, nay lay down his life to perform it; but <HI>I</HI> deny, that even for such a Father, he hath a Right to give up the lives of others which are not at his disposal (as those of his Wife and Children are not) in this case. For this were not only to return more than was first given, but also to pay debts with that which is not my own; and to give up their lives, and let my Father take them away is all one, if I can hinder it, <HI>qui non prohibet facit.</HI> Then as for the Relation of a Father, which you say no fault of his can obliterate or destroy; you must grant that it may be suspended for a time, as when a Man binds, or resists his mad or druken Father who would kill him, or his Wife or Children, he doth not do it to the Father, but to the mad Man or Drun∣kard, and so likwise in this Case, he doth not resist his Father, but a furious un∣reasonable Creature, who is so far from behaving himself as becomes a Father, that he doth not act like a Man: Nor doth your Maxime hold true in all Cases, and therefore is no Law of Nature, for <HI>Iura Sanguinis aliquo delicto dirimi possunt,</HI> or else a Father could never put his Son to death for any crime whatever, which you have affirmed he may; but certainly when he acts thus, it is not as a Father, nor doth he destroy him as a Son, but an Enemy or Malefactor.</P>
<P>Now I desire you or any indifferent Man to consider, since the common good of Mankind is the sum of all the the Laws of Nature, and the great rule by which they are to be tryed, which rule is to be preferred, and conduces more thereunto when they cannot consist at once or together. That a Father, who by your own confession, comes to do an unlawful wicked action, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to ruine and destroy his Son, with his Wife and Children, should be resisted, and con∣sequently one Mans life put in hazard, than that many innocent Persons should be ruined, and perhaps starved to death for want of food and shelter. And as for the fifth Commandment, that extends no more to the Father than to the Mother; thô you are pleased to leave her out, because it makes against your opinion: and therefore if by Honour, is meant, <HI>Thou shalt no resist,</HI> then no Man should resist his Mother any more than his Father, if she went about to kill him, and yet not the Mother, but the Father, is by your Hypothesis, the natural Monarch that hath this Power of Life and Death over the Son. But let us pur∣sue this point no farther, if you will not be convinced I cannot help it.</P>
<P>But pray tell me now, what a Son must do, if his Father transported by fury and malice should go about to kill him with a Sword or other Weapon, and that he hath no other way left to save his life, neither by intreaty nor flight, (which I grant ought to be done if possible,) whether he may resist his Father with what next comes to hand, or suffer himself to be killed?</P>

<P>I am much better satisfyed in this Case than in the other, that he ought rather to let his Father take away his life than resist him, since here is but one life to be lost, whereas, I confess, the other Case was harder, because there were more lives concerned than the Sons, and I am of this opinion partly for the same reasons as before, and partly because 'tis more suitable both to Reason, and the Law of Nature, as also to Holy Scripture, Preceps and Examples: For i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> St. <HI>Peter</HI> command, <HI>Servants to be Subject to their Masters,</HI> &amp;c.

Sons, who owe their Fathers a higher duty and obedience, than Servants can owe their Masters; and <HI>Isaac</HI> was so far convinced, that his Father <HI>Abraham</HI> had Power over his life; that thô he was a lusty young Man, and could carry Wood enough to consume a Burnt-offering, yet do we not find, that he offered in the least to resist his Father, when he was about to bind him to be Sacrificed: For he very well knew, that his Father could not be resisted without endanger∣ing his life if not taking it away in the scuffle; and sure you will grant, that a Son ought rather of the two to let his Father kill him, than he take away his life, by whose means he received his own; especially since <HI>Abraham</HI> was the Master of a great Family; and in whose life and well being, not only his Mo∣ther, but all the Family had an interest as necessary for their well being and happiness: Nor can I think, that <HI>Abraham</HI> would have so readily assented to God's Command for the doing of it, had he not been already satisfyed, that he had an unaccountable power of Life and Death over his Son by the Laws of God and Nature.</P>

<P>In the first place, to answer your authorities from Scripture, as for that place of St <HI>Peter</HI> you have cited, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is not a precept given by the Apostle to Sons, but to Servants or Slaves, whose lives and all that they had were at their Masters absolue disposal, being those whom the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> calls, <HI>Servants under the yoke</HI>; and unless you will make a Slave and a Son to be all one, (which you have already denyed) this precept doth not at all concern them. And as for Example of <HI>Isaac,</HI> that will make as little for your advantage, for first as to <HI>Abraham,</HI> he could not but know, that to kill his Son without any just cause, was as much murder in him as in any other Man: Now what could be a juster or a higher cause than Gods particular Command? So that as this act of <HI>Abraham</HI> is not to be taken as an Example by other Fathers, so neither doth the Exam∣ple of <HI>Isaac</HI> oblige other Sons to the like Submission; therefore it is most rea∣sonable to suppose, that <HI>Isaac</HI> being then (as Chronologers make him to be) about nineteen or twenty years of age,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. n. M. p.</HI> 27.</NOTE> and of years of discretion to ask where was the Lamb for the Burnt-offering, was also instructed by his Father, before he came to be offered, of the reason of his dealing thus with him, and then the Submission was not payed to his Fathers but to Gods will, from whom he miraculously received his being. But if any Man doubt wheter resistance in such a Case were Lawful, I leave it to his own conscience to consider, whether if his Father had him alone in a place where he could neither run away nor yet call for help, he would suffer his Fa∣ther to cut his Troat without any resistance, only because he pretended Divine Revelation for it. Not but that I so far agree with you likewise, as to limit such a resistance only to the holding his Fathers Hands, or warding off his blows, but not to the taking away his life, but of the two rather to lose his own than to kill him, for the reasons you have given, and which I will not deny; but yet if the Father be mad, I much doubt whether the Son is bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to let him kill him rather than take away his life, since such a Father's life is no way useful to the good of the Family. So that thô I should grant that Paternal Power is from God, and consequently irresissible, yet doth it not follow that all the unjust force or violence, which a Father as a Man may use against his Sons life or fortune, is such part of a Paternal Power as God hath commanded us not to resist, since your self must grant that he doth not thus act (in going about to kill his Son) as a father, but a violent and wicked Man: So that where the father hath no Right, to take away his Sons life, I think in all such Cases,
<PB N="55" REF="36"/>
the Right of the Son to resist him doth take place. And if a Man may resist or bind his Father when he is Mad or Drunk, and in such fits goeth about to kill him, I can see nothing to the contrary why he may not do the same thing, when his Father is transported by a sudden rage or unreasonable malice, since both of them do take away the use of natural Reason as much the one as the o∣ther, according to that saying of the Poet, <HI>Ira furor brevis est.</HI> Anger is but a short madness: Fury and Malice being alike fatal and destructive to the Sons life and safety, with Drunkenness and Madness; nor doth such a Son resist his Paternal Power but only his Brutish force and violence. So that if Sons when grown to years of discretion) have not a right to defend their lives in the State of Nature against all Persons whatsoever, who go about to take it away without any just Cause, every Son ought to suffer his Father to kill him, when ever being transported by madness, drunkenness or sudden passion, he hath will so to do: which how it can consist with that great Law of Nature, of propagating and preserving the species of Mankind, if a Father should have any unreason∣able unlimitted Power, I'll leave it to your self or any other reasonable Man to consider; nor doth it follow, that because a Son can in no wise be Superiour to his Father, he ought not therefore to resist him; since thô I grant punishment is a Right of Superiours over their In∣feriours,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. n. M.</HI></NOTE> yet so is not resistance; since every one knows that resistance; is exercised between equals, as I have already proved, Sons are to their Fathers in all the Rights of life and self-preservation: and conseqently to judge when their Lives and Estates are unjustly invaded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess I am in a great doubt which will most conduce to that great Law you mention, (which I grant to be the Sum of all the Laws of Na∣ture) <HI>viz.</HI> of preserving or prosecuting the common good of Mankind; that Fathers should have an absolute irre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istible Power over the Lives and Fortunes of their Children, let them use it how they will, or else that Children should have a Right to resist them in some cases, when they go about to take away either of them without any just Cause: for thô I own, that (if the former Prin∣ciple be true) Parents may be sometimes tempted to take away their Childrens Lives or Estates without any just Cause: so on the other side if Children shall assume such a Power to themselves of judging when their Fathers do thus go a∣bout, to invade either their Lives or Estates, it will (I doubt) lay a foundation for horrid confusions and divisions in Families, since if Children are under a constant subjection to their Fathers, they ought then to be absolutely Subject to them in the State of Nature, and therefore ought not to be resisted: For if all Fathers, and Masters of Families, are trusted by God with an absolute Power of Life and Death over the Wife, Children, and Servants of the Family, as your self cannot deny, then no resistance of this absolute Power can subsist with the peace and tranquility of that Family, without the diminution or total de∣struction, of that absolute Power, with which they are intrusted.</P>
<P>And thô I admit that Parents ought neither to use nor sell their Children for Slaves, not to take away either their Lives or Goods without great and sufficient Cause: yet of these Causes Fathers in the state of Nature must be the only and uncontrolable Judges; since if Children (whom I still consider as Subjects, thô not as Slaves in the State, as long as they continue members of their Fathers Family,) should once have a Right to resist, when they thought their Lives or Estates were unjustly invaded; they might also oftentimes through undutiful∣ness or false suggestions pretend or suppose that their Fathers were mad drunk
<PB N="50" REF="37"/>
or in a passion, and went about to take away their Lives, when really they in∣tend no such thing, but only to give them due correction: Which would give Children an unnatural power of resisting, or perhaps of killing their Fathers upon false surmises or flight occasions.</P>
<P>And as this would introduce great mischief and confusion in privte Fami∣lies, so would it likewise prove a Foundation of Rebellion against all Civil Powers whatsoever; if Subjects who are the same thing in a Kingdom, that Children are in a Family, (in the State of Nature) should take upon them to resist their Prince when ever they think he goeth about to invade either their Lives or Fortunes, which would likewise serve to justify all the most horrid Rebellions in the World; since all Rebels whatsoever may or do pretend, that their Lives, Liberties and Fortunes are unjustly invaded, when indeed they are not, and Likewise upon the least hardship or injustice in this kind inflict∣ed upon any private Subject, either by the Prince or his Ministers, (which abuses and violences do often happen even under the Best Governments,) any such private Person who shall think himself thus injured, may upon this prin∣ciple take up Arms, and endeavour to right or defend himself against such violence, by which means under pretence of securing a few Men in their Lives or Estates, whole Kingdoms (if such Persons can find follows enough) may be cast into all the mischiefs and confusions of a Civil War, till the Prince and Government be quite destroyed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, the Arguments you now bring are the best you have yet produced, since they are drawn from that great and certain Law of procuring the common good and peace of mankind. But, I hope I shall make it plain to you, that no such terrible consequences will follow from the Principles I have already laid down, and therefore I must first take notice that you have in your answer confounded two Powers together, which ought to be distingishued in the State of Nature. (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Power which Fathers, as Masters or Heads of Fa∣milies, may exercise over the Lives of their Children or Servants whilst they re∣main Members of their Family; and that reverence and duty which Children must always owe their Fathers as long as they live, even after they become Fathers or Masters of Families of their own. In the first State, I have already allowed, that such Fathers, as Masters of Families may Lawfully exercise a far greater Power over their Children, whilst they are members of their Family, than they can when they are seperated from it, yet is not this Power in all Ca∣ses absolute or irresistible, as I have already proved; and therefore I do in the first place restrain this Right of self-defence, only to such Cases, where a Father would take away a Sons life in a fit of drunkenness, madness or sudden passion, without any crime committed or just cause given: which I also limit to a bare self defence, without injuring or taking away the life of the Father if it can possi∣bly be avoided; and in this Case if the Son, who is like to suffer this violence, may not judge when his life is really in danger to be destroyed, because he may pretend so when really it is not. This is no just reason to overthrow so great a Right as self Preservation; since if this were a sufficient objection, it would have the same force against all self defence whatsoever: For it doth often happen that wicked and unreasonable Men will pretend that they were forced to take a∣way the lives of others only to preserve their own, when indeed it was altoge∣ther false and needless, and they only killed them to satisfy their own malice or passion, And therefore, as there is no reason that the abuse of this natural Right should be used as an Argument against the use of all self-defence by any Man
<PB N="57" REF="37"/>
whatsoever. So likewise neither ought the like abuse hereof by some wicked Children to be brought as an Argument against its being made use of at all by others, who are never so unjustly assaulted, and in danger of their Lives from their Fathers violence. If the first principle be true, (on which this is found∣ed) that a Son may excercise this Right of self-defence in such Cases, without any intrenchment upon his Fathers Paternal Authority, or that Filial duty and respect which he must always owe him when ever he returns to himself, and will behave himself towards him as becomes a Father, and not like an Enemy or Cut-throat.</P>
<P>And as for the quarrels and confusions, which you alledge may happen in Families between Fathers and Children, in case such a liberty should be allow∣ed, those inconveniencies will prove very inconsiderable if you please to take Notice, That first I do not allow this Right of resistance to be exercised by any Children before they attain to years of discretion. Secondly, that after they have attained to these years, no resistance ought to be made against a Father whilst they remain part of their Fathers Family, but only in defence of their own, their Mothers, Wives▪ and Childrens Lives; since I grant, that a Son as long as he continues a member of his Fathers. Family, ought to bestow all his own labour for his Fathers profit, and cannot acquire any property either in Lands or Goods without his Fathers consent: And since you conceive this Right of self-defence, if allowed to Children, would be the cause of so great mischiefs in Fami∣lies, if Children should have no Right to judge when their Fathers abused their power over them; let us a little consider on which side this abuse is most likely to happen, for if you please but to look into the World, and survey the Nature of Fathers and Children, and set the faults of the one against the other, you will find, (that as I confess,) it is the Nature of many Children to contradict and disobey their Fathers Commands, and that most young people hate restraint, and love too much liberty, and may oftentimes think their Fathers too harsh or severe to them, when really they are not; yet doth such false surmises and dis∣obedient actions seldom end, either in absolute resistance or taking away their Fathers lives by force, or if they do so, it is really done for their own defence, or whilst they are assaulted by them in their own Lives, or those of their Chil∣dren, but is commonly acted privately to satisfie their own revenge or malice, which I hold to be utterly unlawful, so likewise let us consider on the other side,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.n. M.p</HI> 41,</NOTE> those temptations that Fathers lye under of injuring their Children, or taking away their Lives, or u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing them like Slaves, without any just Cause; you'll find that they by reason of their age, natural temper or infirmities, may be easily transported to that degree of passion, that not considering the follies of Youth, they may oftentimes in their passion, either beat them so cruelly, as utterly to disable or maime them, or else take away their Lives for little or no Cause. And besides, Fathers being of∣ten covetous and ill-natured, (which are the vices of old age,) may (where there is no power over them to restrain them from it) either keep them as Slaves themselves, or else sell them to others for that purpose, (as I have already given you an example of the <HI>Negroes</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI>) and which of these two inconve∣niencies are most likely to happen between Children and Parents in the State of Nature; I should leave is to any indifferent Man to judge between us. And therefore I think, it more conduces to the good and peace of Families, and con∣sequently the happiness and preservation of Mankind, (which are the end of all Laws) that Children should be allowed these Rights (I have al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erdy laid down)
<PB N="58" REF="38"/>
of asserting this Natural Liberty from Slavery, and defending their Lives, and those of their Wives and Children from the unjust violence of their Fathers than that they should be left wholly at disposal to be maimed, killed or ruined, when over this coveteousness, passion or malice may prompt them to it: Sence if all Fathers were satisfied that their Children have a Right thus to defend themselves in these Cases against their unjust violence, it would be a means to make them act more catiously, and to behave themselves with great∣er tenderness and moderation towards them.</P>
<P>So than to conclude, I utterly deny that these Principles I have here laid down, do at all rend to countenance Rebellion, or raising disturbances in Civil Govern∣ments, since I cannot allow you have proved Parents to be Princes or Monarchs in the State of Nature, or that Families, and Kingdoms or Commonwealths are all one: Or if I should grant them to be so, yet would it not therefore follow, that every private Subject in a Civil State hath the same Right to de∣fend his life, or that of his Wife and Children, against the violence or injustice of the Supream Powers, as a Son may have in the State of Nature to defend his life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> against his Fathers rage or violence; since I grant no particular Subject can contradict or resist the Supream Power of the Lawfull Magistrate (however unjustly exercised) by force, without disturbing or at least endanger∣ing the quiet and happiness of the whole Community, and perhaps the disso∣lution of the Government it self, which is against the duty, not only of a good Subject, but also of an honest Moral Man, who will not disturb the publick tran∣quility for his own private security or revenge. But in private Families the Case is otherwise, and Children may resist their Father in the Cases already put, without introducing either Anarchy or Civil War in the Family; since it can scarce be presumed that either their Mother, Brothers or Sisters, will take part with a Son or Brother against their Husband and Father, unless it ware that they might thereby hinder him from committing murder, by defending their Son or Brothers life, when thus violently and without cause assaulted; and if it should sometimes happen otherwise, yet this would be a much less mischief, then that out of this fear the Lives and Liberties of an innocent Wife and Chil∣dren, should suffer without cause by his drunkenness or passion.</P>
<P>But as for the resistance which Sons may make in the State of Nature, and when separated from their Fathers Families, it is of a much larger extent since they may then not only defend their own Lives, but also those of their Wives and Children with their Estates against their Fathers unjust violence, Thò I do here likewise restrain this self-defence, only to cases of actual invasion or asault of such Fathers, upon the Lives and Estates of his Children, in which cases, I also absolutely condemn all actions and proceedings done by way of prevention, before such violence or assault is actually begun to be made upon them; much less do I allow of any revenge or return of evil for evil, by such Children, when the danger is over; since however such revenge may be Lawful between Per∣sons in the State of Nature, no ways related or oblieged to each other; yet do I by no means allow the same Priviledge to Children against their Parents, since I look upon the obligation they have to them to be of so high a Nature, that it can never totally be cancelled, thô in those cases of self-preservation and de∣fence they may be suspended for a time, As if I owed my life, and all that I have to some great Person, who hath either saved the one, or bestowed the other up∣on me, thô I should be very undutiful and ungratful too, if upon his be∣coming my Enemy thô without any just cause, I should go about to return his
<PB N="59" REF="38"/>
injuries in the same kind; yet were I not therefore obliged to give up that Life and Estate he had before bestowed upon me, when ever he thought fit, without any just occasion to take them away; and I am confident that Resistance in these cases, and with these restrictions, doth neither derogate from that Gratitude and Piety, which Children always ought to pay their Fathers, nor yet can tend to encourage either Anarchy or Rebellion; since such Sons when once married and are become Masters or Heads of Families themselves, they then cease to be under their Fathers Subjection as they were before, tho I confess they are always to honour and reverence him according to Gods Command in all cases, when they will deal with them as Fathers, and not as Enemies</P>

<P>I shall no longer dispute this Right of Resistance in Children in the Cases you have put, since I see it is to little purpose to argue longer with you about it; but this much I think is still true, that all Supream Powers whatever, cannot without Rebellion and absolute dissolution of the Government be risisted by the Subject; so that if the Government of Fathers or Heads of Families be Supream as you seem to grant, that cannot be resisted neither, without bringing all things therein to Anarchy and confusion.</P>

<P>Pray give me leave Sir to interrupt you a little; I desire you to remember that I do not allow the Power of Fathers or Masters of Families to be any more then Oeconomical and not Civil Power, and I have already shewed you how Resistance of such a Power, when violently and unjustly exercised, may be re∣sisted without any Anarchy or confusion in the Family; but as for Resistance of Civil Powers in some Cases, it is not the Subject of this discourse, and there∣fore I desire you would now mind the Subject in Hand, and not pass off to any other till we have dispatcht this, so that I would rather if you have any fresh objections to make, that you would now do it, because it groweth late.</P>

<P>I must confess ingeniously, your Arguments have much s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aggered me, since I see great inconveniencies may happen, on either side; for if the Father or Master may be the sole Judg, when and how he may exercise this absolute Power. I grant all those mischiefs may sometimes fall out, which you have here set forth, so on the other side if the Children may be Judges in their own case, those evils may often happen, which I have already alledged: And therefore pray pardon me, if I am not too hasty in altering my opinion in this point without better consideration; but methinks you have not yet fully answered one of my main Arguments, to prove the Power of Life and Death to proceed from God alone, and therefore must have been conferred as first on <HI>Adam,</HI> since no Man hath a Power over his own life, (as I said before) and therefore cannot have it over that of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought I had already as good as answered this doughty objection, when I had yielded to you, that neither private Men nor Masters of Families have any Right to defend their own lives, much less to take away those of others, but as it is granted them by God in the Law of Nature, in order to the procuring the great end of it, <HI>viz.</HI> the happiness and propagation of Mankind, which I own, could not in this lapsed and depraved State of Nature we now are in, long subsist without such a Power. Yet I think I have already sufficiently proved, that we have no need to recur to I know not what divine Charter granted by God to <HI>Adam</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> and from them derived to all Civil Magistrates that ever have been or shall be in the World, the consequence of which would be, that no Sentence of Death could be justly given against any Man, but in such King∣doms or Common-wealths, who own this Authority as conferred on them by
<PB N="60" REF="39"/>
God in <HI>Adam</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> from which they must deride their Title to it. Now I desire you would shew me how many Kingdoms or Common-wealths there are in the World, who ever heard of, much less owned this Divine Charter, this fine notion, yea scarce reaching farther, than some few Divines and high Roy∣alists of our own Island.</P>
<P>But be it as it will, the Antecedent, or first Proposition is not true, that no Man in any case whatsoever hath power over his own life, and therefore nei∣ther is your consequence; for I suppose, that for the same End for which the Civil Powers may take away another Man's life, <HI>viz.</HI> in order to the greater good of Mankind, (of which my Religion or Countrey is a part,) I am like∣wise Master of my own, and may lay it down or expose it, when I think it can conduce to a greater good than my single life can amount to. And there∣fore the Example of <HI>Codrus</HI> the <HI>Athenian</HI> King is highly celebrated by all an∣cient Authors, and is not condemned by any Christian Writer, that I know of, for Exposing himself to certain death to gain his Citizens the Victory, the loss of which would have been the ruin of the State. And in the first Book of <HI>Mac∣cabees,</HI> Chap. 6.43. (which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it be not Canonical Scripture, yet is allowed to be Read in our Churches, as containing Examples of good manners,) you may Read, that <HI>Eleazar</HI> the younger Brother of <HI>Iudas Maccabeus,</HI> is there high∣ly commended for his valour in killing the <HI>Elephant,</HI> on which the supposed King <HI>Antiochus</HI> was mounted, that he might thereby destroy him likewise, tho he might be assured of his own death by the <HI>Elephants</HI> falling upon him: And the zeal for the Christian Religion amongst the Primitive Christians was so great that we may read in <HI>Tertullian,</HI> and divers Ecclesiastical Historians, of whole Troops of Martyrs, who tho unaccused, yet offered up their lives at the Heathen Tribunals to a voluntary Martyrdom; and farther, <HI>Eusebius</HI> him∣self, doth not condemn,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb. l.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 12.</NOTE> but rather commends some Primitive Christians, that being like to be taken by their Heathen Persecu∣tors, cast themselves down head long from the top of their Houses, <HI>esteeming</HI> (as he their tells us) <HI>a certain Death as an advantage, because they thereby avoided the cruelty and malice of their Persecutors.</HI> I could likewise give you (if it were not two tedious) several other Examples of Ancient Martyrs, who have given up themselves to certain Death to save the Lives of some of their friends, or else of Christian Bishops, whom they lookt upon as more useful to the Church than themselves, and which St. <HI>Paul</HI> himself does likewise suppose to be Lawful, when he tells the Romans, <HI>That the scarce∣ly for a Righteous Man would one dye,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 5. <HI>v.</HI> 17.</NOTE> <HI>yet per adventure for a good Man som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would even dare to dye,</HI> that is a Man highly beneficial to others. And the same Apostle, in the last Chapter of this Epistle, returns thanks to <HI>Priscilla</HI> and <HI>Aquila,</HI> not only on his own behalf, but also for all the Churches of the Gentiles, <HI>because they had for his Life laid down their own Necks,</HI> that is, hazarded their lives to save his, and where ever they might have thus exposed them, surely they might have lost them too. And therefore I think, I may with reason affirm, that in most Cases, where a Prince or Commonwealth may command a Man to expose his Life to certain destruction for the publick good of his Religion or Countrey, he hath power likewise to do it of his own accord, without any such command, the Obligation proceeding not only from the orders of his Superiour, but from that zeal and affection, which by the Laws of God and Nature he ought to have for his Religion and Country, even beyond the preservation of his own Life.</P>

<P>Well, I confess, that this that you have now said carries, some colour of reason with it, and is more than I had considered before. But pray resolve me one difficulty more, which still lies upon my mind. By what Authority, less than a Divine Commission from God himself revealed in Scripture, do Supream Powers take upon them to make Law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? And that under no less penalty than Death it self, against such offences, as by the Laws of Nature do no ways de∣serve Death, such as Theft, Counterfiting the publick Coyn, with divers other offences, needless here to be reckoned up. And if a Father (as you will not allow him) hath no Right over the Lives or Persons of his Wife and Children, I cannot see how a Master of a separate Family can have any such Power, more than his Wife or any other of the Family; and the Scripture seems to countenance this Power of punishing for Murder, to be in any that will take it upon them, and therefore you see <HI>Cain,</HI> said, <HI>whoever meets me will slay me.</HI> And God tells <HI>Noah, whoever sheddeth Mans Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed,</HI> without restraining it to any Man particularly who is to do it.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Objection is easily answered, if you please to consider, what you your self did a good wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> since urge to me, that God endowed <HI>Adam</HI> with so much Authority, as should enable him to govern his own Family and Children as long as he lived; which I readily granted you, and I only differed in the manner of its derivation, you affirming it to proceed from a Divine Charter or Grant, by Revelation conferred upon him by God, and I maintaining, that both he and every other Master of a separate Family, derive it only from Gods Natural and not Revealed Law, which if it be well proved, such Masters of Families, as also all Civil Powers (whom I suppose to be endued with the Power of all such Masters of Families or Freemen taken together) may for the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me end, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the good Government, and Peace of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Families and Commonwealths, make Laws under no less a Penalty than Death it self, against such offences as by the Law of Nature do not deserve it, since without such a Power (the wickedness of Man being come to this height it is) no Family or Commonwealth, could be long preserved in Peace or safety. And therefore, I suppose you will not affirm, but that such a Master of a Family, may very well inflict any punishment less than Death for such offences, which if they find too gentle to amend those crimes, they may likewise for the same reason encrease the punishments ordain∣ed for it. And therefore, I yield, that tho Theft doth not in its own Nature deserve Death, yet if the Master of such a separate Family shall find his Chil∣dren or Servants to be so addicted to this vice, as not to be amended by any less punishments than Death, he may, for the quiet of his Family, make a general Law, that whosoever for the future shall commit Theft, shall suffer Death; and I doubt not, but such a Law when promulged, may be Lawfully Executed, since this Master of a Family is intrusted by God with the sole Power of judging, not only what are crimes, but also what are fit punishments for them, since both are alike necessary for the happiness and preservation of the Family. And I so far agree with you, that such Masters of Families, <HI>have as much Power over the Lives of their Children and Servants, as the most absolute Monarchs have over their Subjects,</HI> that is, for their common good, and no farther. And upon the same Principles, do all Kings and Common wealths inflict capital punishments for the Transgression of all such Laws, as do any way entrench upon the com∣mon interest and safety of their People, and upon this ground, they may just∣ly inflict no-less punishments than Death, for Coyning of false Money, which is but a sort of Theft from the publick Treasure of the Commonwealth. And
<PB N="62" REF="40"/>
the same may be said for all capital punishments ordained against other offences of the same Nature.</P>

<P>If Fathers or Masters of Families are endued by God, (as you your self now own,) not only with this Power of Life and Death, for enormous crimes against the Laws of Nature, but also to make new Laws, or ordain what punish∣ments they please for such offences, as they shall judg destructive to the quiet and happiness of their Families, I see no difference (notwithstanding what you have hitherto said to the contrary) between Oeconomical and Civil Power.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. P. c.</HI> 1. §. 10.</NOTE> For if we compare the Natural Rights of a Fa∣ther or Master, with those of a King or Monarch, we shall find them all one without any difference at all, but only in the latitude or extent of them. For as the Father or Master over one Family: So a King, as a Father or Master over many Families, extends his care to Preserve, Feed, Cloath, in∣struct, and Defend the whole Common-wealth; his War, his Peace, his Courts of justice, and all his Acts of Soveraignty, tend only to preserve and distribute to every Subordinate, and inferior Father and his Children, their Rights and Priviledges. Hath a Monarch Power to make new Laws, and ap∣point what punishments he will to enforce their Observation? So also hath a Father of a Family. Hath an absolute Prince Power to command or dispose of the Goods and Estates of his Subjects, for their common quiet and security? So also hath a Father or Master of a Family. So that all the Duties of a King, are summed up in this Universal Fatherly care of his People; and if the Sove∣raignty be the same, I cannot see and Reason, why the Rights and Prerogatives of it should not be so too. And therefore, if non resistance against their Au∣thority, be an unseparable Prerogative of Soveraign Power, then if a Father or Master of a Family be endued with it, he ought no more to be resisted, than the most absolute Monarch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive your Head is very full of this Notion of the idintity of Natu∣ral and Civil Power, or else you would never insist so long upon it as you do, after what I have proved to the contrary. And therefore, since I see you look upon this as your topping Argument; I shall do my endeavour to shew you more plainly the difference between them. For tho I grant, that such Fathers or Masters of Families, (as we here treat of,) are indued by God with divers Powers, which are <HI>Analogous,</HI> or perhaps the same with those of a King or Monarch, that is, of defending their Families as far as they are able from For∣reign force and Domestick injuries, and of revenging and punishing all offences that may prove prejudicial or destructive to the Peace and Happiness of their Families; yet doth it not therefore follow, that the Government of private Families and Kingdoms are all one, since they differ very much, not only in their Institution, but also in their End. For first, the Fatherly Power by the Law of Nature, is ordained only for the Generation and Education of the Children till they come to be grown up; and his Authority as a Father, is or∣dained by God only for those Ends; and therefore this Relation of a Father is so inherent in him, that it can never be parted with, or assigned over to any other, so as to make the Child or Son so Assigned, to owe the same duty to him, as he did to his Father.</P>
<P>There is also, besides the Power of a Father, that of a Master, or Head of a Family over his Children and Servants, whilst they continue Members or Subjects of it, which Power I grant may be assigned, or made over to one, or more Persons, when ever such Master shall think fit to institute a Kingdom or
<PB N="63" REF="40"/>
Commonwealth: Yet, as Dr. <HI>Sanderson</HI> very well observes, this Power of a Master differs very much from that of the Civil Powers of a Kingdom or Com∣monwealth, as well in the object as end of this Power. For <HI>first,</HI> the Power of a Father is only over one single Family, whereas that of a Commonwealth is over divers Families, united under one Civil Head. <HI>Secondly,</HI> in respect of the end, the Power of the Master is chiefly ordained for his own interest and advantage, but that of the Civil Power, chiefly respects the good of the whole People or Community. <HI>Lastly,</HI> the Power of the Master of the Family, is only for the maintaining his own Natural Property, in those things which he hath acquired in the State of Nature, whereas one great end of Civil Government, is to introduce and establish Civil Property in things, according to the Laws of the Commonwealth, and also to maintain it when so constituted. To conclude, Fathers beget their Children, and Masters acquire to themselves Slaves and Servants, but it is <HI>from the consent of Fathers or Masters of seperate Families, that any sort of Civil Government commenced at first, so that the People at first made Kings, and not the Kings the People</HI>: And further, it is the duty of Fathers and Masters to provide for their Children and Servants, but the People ought to provide for their Kings, not only for their necessities, but for their Magnificence and Grandure; so that the Power of Fathers and Masters is Natural, whereas that of Kings and Republicks is Political and Artificial, as proceeding from compacts or the consents of divers Heads of Families or other Free-men. And as Kingdoms and Families differ in the manner of their Intituti∣on, so do they likewise in their ends, which is of a far larger extent in the lat∣ter than in the former, the maine design of instituting Kingdoms and Common-wealths, before not only to defend their Subjects from such injuries or violence that they may do each other, but chiefly by their united Forces, to Guard them from the violence and invasion of Foreign Enemies.</P>
<P>For thô I grant, it may be sometimes happen, that a Family may consist of so great a number of Children, Servants or Slaves, as may make a little Army, such as <HI>Abraham</HI>'s was when he made War againk the four Kings, yet is this purely accidental, and not at all essential to the being of a Family, which is as perfect in all its constituted parts, if it consists of three or four Persons, as of three or four hundred. Whereas a Kingdom or Commonwealth cannot subsist, unless it can either by its own Power or united Forces, defend its Members from Foreign Force and Invasions: So also in private Families, in the State of Nature, there can be no property acquired in Lands or goods by any Members of it, without the Masters express will or permission. But in all Civil Governments, the very institution and preservation of Civil Proper∣ty was one of its chiefest ends, which may be easily proved by experience: Since in all Nations, where there is any property either in Lands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Goods, there is a necessity of some Civil Government to maintain i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Whereas in divers parts of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> where there is no distinct property in Land, and where there are no other Riches, than every Man's Cottage and Garden, with their Hunting and Fishing Instruments, there is no need of any Common or Civil Power over them, higher than that of Masters or Fathers of Families, who own no Superiority among themselves, unless it be when they go to War, and then they chuse out of their own numbers for their Captains or Leaders, those whom they know to be stoutest and most experienced, whose Power determines as soon as the War ceases.</P>
<P>But to make an end of this long Discourse, suppose, I should grant all you
<PB N="64" REF="41"/>
can desire, the Oeconomical and Civil Government do not differ in kind, but in largeness or extent, yet will it not follow, that therefore it must be in all Cases irresistable, since I think I am able to prove, that no Power whatever (except that of God himself, can be endued with this Prerogative) if once it goes about to frustrate, and destroy all the main ends of Government, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the happiness and safty of the Subjects, either by dowright destroying of them, or else by reducing them to a condition of Slavery and Misery, as the Great Turk uses his Christian Subjects. But to let you see, I would deal fairly with you, I will discourse this point of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Soveraignity no farther, but will at present take it as the Lawyers say, <HI>de bene esse,</HI> or for granted, and I desire you would shew me in the next place when <HI>Adam</HI> dyed, by what Law, either Divine or Natural, <HI>Cain</HI> or <HI>Seth</HI> (chose which you will) could command over all the rest of his Brethren and their Descendants. And then again, if you could do this, what benefit this Doctrine would yield to all Princes and States at this day, or how you intend to deduce a Title for them from <HI>Adam</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> or any of their Sons to their respective Kingdoms, and consequently to an absolute Subjection of their Subjects, without which all your Hypothesis will signifie nothing.</P>

<P>I must return you thanks Sir for your candid dealing, and for the great pains you have taken to enlighten my understanding in this important question. And thô I doubt, you have laid down Principles not so suitable to Gods Will revealed in the Holy Scripture, yet I will not imput it to any want of sincerity in your self, who I hope, are satisfied of the truth of what you have main∣tained; so on the other side, I desire you not to take it ill, if I cannot leave my own opinion, which I have always hitherto lookt upon, as most suitable to the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and to the Practice of the Primi∣tive Church, and to the Laws of the Land, and must continue therein, till I am convinc'd I am in an Error. But since I desire to have a further Con∣versation with you upon this important Subject, pray let me know, when we shall meet again, that I may prove to you, from Holy Scripture as well as those Authors, I have perused that there is <HI>a Divine Right of Blood instituted by God for the Succession of Kingdoms,</HI> which cannot without a kind of Sacri∣ledge, or the highest Injustice, be taken away from the Right Heir.</P>

<HEAD>Advertisement TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of these Discourses hopes you will be so cha∣ritable as to believe, that tho' he hath made one of his Disputants argue pretty stifly against the <HI>Divine Right of Monarchy, and Succession to Crowns,</HI> yet He is no <HI>Common-wealths-man,</HI> or one who hereby designs or desires Alterations in the Government of this Nation, either of Church, or State, since none can admire their Excellent Constitution more than himself; much less does he prefer an <HI>Elective,</HI> before an <HI>He∣reditary</HI> Succession to Crowns, since he justly esteems the latter, as being a most Excellent, if not (Only) Means to prevent all Disputes, and Civil Disturbances about <HI>Succession,</HI> and therefore is never to be departed from, unless when some <HI>Natural,</HI> or <HI>Moral</HI> Disability in the Person, or other <HI>unavoidable necessity</HI> renders it absolutely inconsistent with the Publick Peace, and Safety of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Therefore as a Man may be said to be truly devout without Su∣perstition (which is but the Corruption, or Abuse of Religion;) so the Author likewise thinks that a Subject may be truly Loyal, and Obedient to his Prince, tho' he hath never heard of, or does not believe any <HI>Divine Right of Monarchy</HI> derived from <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> or of <HI>Succession</HI> from God's Promise that <HI>Cain</HI> should Rule over <HI>Abel:</HI> Nor hath the Author an Aversion to <HI>Abso∣lute Monarchy</HI> as such, could he be assured that Princes would be always as wise, and good as they ought to be; nay, he owns, that divers Nations have never been more happy than under the Go∣vernment of such Monarchs. As the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire (For in∣stance)
<PB REF="43"/>
never arrived to a greater heighth of Riches, and Power, (if we may believe Historians) than under <HI>Nerva, Trajan,</HI> and the two <HI>Antonines</HI>: So that indeed the fault is not in <HI>Absolute Monarchy</HI> as such, but in the too general Corruption of Humane Nature, which rarely produces Persons of just Abilities, both as to Wisdom, and Goodness, fit for so great a Trust.</P>
<P>I confess Subjects may be sufficiently happy, and (if they please) contented under any Form of Government, where the Gover∣nours are of Equal Capacity and Honesty, and have a real hearty Love, and Concern for the Common Good of their People: But where these are wanting, it is not meer Forms, or empty Names can make them so; and therefore the Author very justly admires the Wisdom of the Antient <HI>German,</HI> and <HI>Gothick</HI> Nations, who preferred a <HI>Limited</HI> Monarchy to all other <HI>Forms</HI> of Government, as an Excellent <HI>Medium</HI> between the Mischiefs of <HI>Arbitrary Power,</HI> and those unhappy Inconveniences that attend <HI>Republicks,</HI> where either the Common People, or Nobility must govern.</P>
<P>But the Author farther hopes, that tho' he makes one of his Dis∣putants in this Dialogue to shew the absurdity, and fatal conse∣quences of Sir <HI>R. F</HI>'s Principles; yet the Reader will not from thence infer, that he passes an absolute Iudgment against them; much less hath He done this out of any prejudice to Sir <HI>R</HI>'s Person, which he never was acquainted with, since he hath rather an ho∣nour for his Memory, his Writings speaking him as a Person of Gentile Learning, and subtle Ingenuity: But whether his Tenets be destructive to the <HI>Fundamental</HI> Constitutions of this Govern∣ment, the Author submits to the Reader's considerate Iudg∣ment, which he hopes will be made without partiality, or any pre∣judicate Opinion proceeding from this, or that Party, or Faction, and will determine according to the Merits of the Cause; and therein observe the Apostles Rule, to <HI>try all things, and hold fast that which is good.</HI></P>
<P>The Author lastly desires the Reader not to think the worse of this performance, tho' all the <HI>Latine</HI> Quotations are not Englisht; for since these Discourses are supposed to be between Gentlemen, and Scholars, and principally intended for such, it would be thought needless to translate them.</P>

<HEAD>THE Second Dialogue BETWEEN Mr. <HI>FREEMAN</HI> a Gentleman AND Mr. <HI>MEANWELL</HI> a Civilian.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU are I see, Sir, a punctual man to your hour; Pray do me the favour to sit down by the Fire, I will but make an end of what I am writing, and wait on you pre∣sently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Servant Sir, take your own time, but pray remember the point you are now to satisfie me in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now Sir, I have done, and if I remember right, I am to derive a Title to all the Kings, and Monarchs that have ever been or shall be in the World from that Supream Fatherly Power conferred by God on <HI>Adam.</HI> But pray take notice I undertake this Task only for Monarchies, not Com∣mon-Wealths, whom I must own to be of meer Humane Invention; And tho' I will not say that they are absolutely unlawful, yet I think they are not the Powers ordained by God in Scripture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir, we will discourse farther of that anon: and therefore I do assure you, I do not desire any more of you now than that you should prove the Divine Institution of Monarchy, and I think that task sufficient if it can be made out in one or two meetings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may seem indeed somewhat absurd to maintain, that all Kings are now the Fathers of their People, since you'll say experi∣ence shews the contrary.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. P. Ch.</HI> 1. § 8.</NOTE> It is true all Kings are not now the Natural Parents of their Subjects, yet they all either are, or are to be reputed the next Heirs to those Primoge∣nitors, who were at the first the Natural Parents of the whole People, and do in their right succeed to the exercise of the Supream Jurisdiction, and such Heirs are not only Lords of their own Children, but also of their Brethren, and all others that were subject to their Fathers, and therefore
<PB N="66" REF="44"/>
I suppose, that God, when he conferred this Supream Power on <HI>Adam,</HI> did not intend it should die with him, but descend to his Heirs after his Decease.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I shall at present grant you all this likewise, tho' it might be questioned. But pray who were those Heirs? many, or but one Person?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you will also grant me at present, what we before dis∣puted, that the Power of Fathers over their Children, being the Fountain of all Regal Authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> by the Or∣dination of God himself, it follows that Civil Power, not only in General is by Divine Institution, but even the assignment of it specifically to the eldest Parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray whom do you mean by Eldest Parents, our Great Grand∣mother <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> if you mean by it one that had longest had Children, she must come in as next Heir by these words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Sir, you altogether misapprehend me, I mean the Eldest Son of <HI>Adam; Eve</HI> was his Wife, and could have nothing to do to inherit in an Hereditary Monarchy as this was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> your pardon Sir, if I misunderstood you, but you must thank the loosness or impropriety of your expression for it, for I suppose you cannot deny, but Eldest Parents commonly signifie either the Eldest men, or Women that have Children, or those who have longest had Issue and then in either of these senses, our Great Grand-Mother <HI>Eve,</HI> stood fairest to be Heir of this Divine Power of <HI>Adam</HI>; but this I am sure of, Parents can never signifie Heirs Male or Female, much less a Child who may some∣times (according to your hypothesis) happen to be Heir; but since I am gotten into this mistake, I shall not leave my hold, but shall make bold a little to argue our Great Grand Mother's Title, for indeed I cannot see any reason why her Eldest Son (for Example) should have any right to Govern his Mother, and all his Brothers and Sisters, whilst she was alive.</P>
<P>For first, if your Argument from Generation must be good, that every man that is born, becomes a subject to him that begets him, this Argu∣ment will serve for <HI>Eve</HI> as well as <HI>Adam</HI>; since (as I have already proved) the Mother hath as great (if not a greater) share, in the Generation of the Children, than the Father; Or secondly, if you insist upon the Divine grant you so much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lked of last time, of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Dominion over the Creatures, in which his Children were included; I then proved to you, that this Grant was made as well to <HI>Eve</HI> as <HI>Adam</HI>; And consequently th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> either she must have thereby an equal right with him, or at least after his Decease to this Dominion, as a Husband and Wife when joynt Purchasers have to an E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tate at Common Law. And lastly, If the Commandment of <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</HI> were then in Force by the Law of Na∣ture or by express Command from God, and that by <HI>Honouring,</HI> obeying must be meant (as most Commentators agree) then it will follow, that after <HI>Adams</HI> Decease, all <HI>Eves</HI> Sons and Descendants, tho' never so remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, were to have obeyed or been subject to her, and not to her Eldest Son, unless you can shew me that the Salique Law against the succession of Wo∣men was made by <HI>Adam</HI> the first Monarch, which I suppose you will not undertake to prove.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="67" REF="44"/>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, I did not consider this difficulty, for indeed it might never have happened, since <HI>Eve</HI> might have died before <HI>Adam,</HI> or if she did out-live him (which is uncertain) yet she was then very old, and consequently (besides the natural weakness of her Sex) uncapable, or un∣fit for Government, and so might very well leave it to <HI>Seth,</HI> since <HI>Cain</HI> the Eldest had by the Murder of his Brother, and his flying away into another Country, forfeited his Birth-right, and made himself uncapable of the Succession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then here is a Forfeiture, and an Abdication of this Divine Right of Succession in the very first Descent; whereas indeed I supposed, that this Divine Right had been at least as unforfeitable as the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> the very Descent of which, as our Lawyers tell us, purges all de∣fects in the next Heir, tho' he had murdered his Father and Elder Brother too. But I only shew you the absurdity of this Notion, and shall not longer insist upon it, therefore pray proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell what might have been said, if <HI>Cain</HI> had come to claim his Birth-Right, but this is certain, that he neither did or could come to do it, since God condemned him to live in a strange Country far from his Brethren,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P. c.</HI> 2. § 9. Gen. 4.16, 17.</NOTE> and we read <HI>That</HI> Cain <HI>went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the Land of</HI> Nod, <HI>on the East of</HI> Eden, <HI>and he built a City, and called the Name of it</HI> Enoch, <HI>after the Name of his Son</HI> Enoch. And there are four descents set down immediately of his Family, which could be no other than the Princes of that City of <HI>Cain</HI>'s Race. So that you see, even in <HI>Cain</HI>'s Line, the Principality descended to the Eldest Son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess <HI>Cain</HI>'s Children and Grand-Children are particularly set down in Scripture, but that they were Princes or Monarchs over their Posterity, or which way this City was Governed after <HI>Cain</HI>'s Death, whe∣ther by one, or by all the Sons of <HI>Cain</HI> is no where mentioned, but I see some Men can find even absolute Monarchy in a Text, where the Scrip∣ture mentions no such thing, and no wonder, for the <HI>Alchymists</HI> have found out likewise the invention of their Elixir, or Philosophers Stone, in such Texts as you or I can see no such thing. But to be more se∣rious;</P>
<P>That a Father should be Lord over his Children and Posterity. I con∣fess there may be some colour of reason, tho' none cogent enough to make it out: But that an Elder Brother hath any Natural or Divine Right, to be Lord over all the rest of his Brethren, I can find no ground for, in rea∣son, even upon your own Principles, for if every Man by his Birth become the subject of him that begets him, it will necessarily follow, that a Man by his Birth cannot become a subject to his Brother, who (sure) did not beget him.</P>
<P>Therefore I suppose you will still insist upon that place in the fourth of <HI>Genesis,</HI> which you cited at our last Meeting, <HI>when God told</HI> Cain <HI>(speaking as you suppose) of his Brother</HI> Abel, <HI>His desire shall be subject unto thee, and thou shalt Rule over him.</HI> From which words I then told you. I thought an absolute subjection of <HI>Abel,</HI> and of all younger Brothers whatsoever could not reasonably be inferred, for you may remember I shewed you, that
<PB N="68" REF="45"/>
this Promise by God to <HI>Cain</HI> concerning <HI>Abel</HI> might be only personal, and relate to <HI>Abel</HI> only, and not to the rest of his Brethren, much less, all other younger Brothers, that should be in the World; And in the next place this Ruling might only have been by advice and perswasion, and not by any Authority or Right of commanding him. So that if this be the place (as I suppose it is) from whence you would deduce your Divine Right of Elder Brothers being Monarc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s over the younger in all Heredi∣tary Monarchies, I must freely tell you I think it a very bold undertaking to found a Divine Right upon such doubtful expressions, as these of God to <HI>Cain.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, I was now about again to urge this place to you; for as I was not then well satisfied with your explanation of it, which you now again repeat, so upon second thoughts I am much more unsatisfied with your Paraphrase upon them. For you seem to me plain∣ly to pervert the sense of the words,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>BPP.</HI> § 64.</NOTE> and make them sig∣nifie just nothing. For sure when God spake the same Words to <HI>Eve</HI> concerning <HI>Adam,</HI> as he did to <HI>Cain</HI> concerning <HI>Abel,</HI> can you conceive they were meant personally to <HI>Eve</HI> only, and concerned no other Wife that should be after her? Or can you assign any Reason why these words should be rather meant personally in the last, and not in the first case? Unless you will do it out of pure Love to Anarchy and confu∣sion. And if you say these words do not signifie any despotick Power, but a Ruling or Governing by fair means or persuasion, this seemeth meer trifling with Gods Word, who says expresly, <HI>Thy Brothers desire shall be Subject to thee</HI>; That is (say you) as far as he thinks fit, <HI>and thou shalt rule over him,</HI> that is, if thou hast the knack to wheadle or persuade him. Would not this have been a mighty matter for God Almighty to have ap∣peared to <HI>Cain</HI> about, and an excellent Argument to com∣fort him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. c.</HI> 2. § 7.</NOTE> and to appease his Wrath against his Brother? So that it seems apparent by this Law given by God to <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel,</HI> that this Regal and Paternal Authority was not to dye with him, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be equally divided amongst all his Children at his Death, or that from thenceforth no man should have a Right by Birth of commanding another, for this command to <HI>Abel</HI> could not be supposed to take place in the Life of <HI>Adam,</HI> for then <HI>Adam</HI> was Lord over all his Children, and so none of them without his permission could rule over the rest, and if it were other∣wise by <HI>Adam</HI>'s appointment, then <HI>Adam</HI> was the Soveraign still, and the Son or Grand-Son so exercising this Power was but his Deputy: but after <HI>Adam</HI>'s decease then it became a real Soveraignty in his Eldest Son, as ha∣ving none but God Superior to it.</P>

<P>I hope you will judge more charitably of me▪ than to believe that the sense that I have put upon these words, tho' different from yours, is out of any love of Anarchy or confusion, much less out of any design to pervert or wrest this place of Scripture: and if I should be so severe as you are, perhaps I might with more reason lay this charge at your Door: for in the first place, I am not satisfied with your Argument, that these words could not be meant personally, or concerning <HI>Abel</HI> only, because the same words when spoken of <HI>Eve</HI> do likewise concern her Posterity,
<PB N="69" REF="45"/>
and therefore when spoken concerning <HI>Abel</HI> they must likewise relate to all Younger Brothers in Hereditary Monarchies: which consequence I may with very good reason deny, for whatsoever subjection may be due by vertue of the like words from <HI>Eve</HI> and her Posterity, to <HI>Adam</HI> and all other Husbands, is to be supposed to have been enjoyned, because all Wo∣men are descended from <HI>Eve,</HI> and so were represented by her as their first Parent. Thus St. <HI>Paul</HI> supposes all men to be in a state of Sin and Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 5. <HI>v.</HI> 12.</NOTE> as represented by <HI>Adam; their Ancestor, by whose disobedience all have sinned.</HI> But no man will affirm that all the Elder Brothers, or Monarchs in the World were represented by <HI>Cain,</HI> and all younger Brothers by <HI>Abel,</HI> no man at this day being (as appears in Scripture) descended from either of them: and I cannot but take notice that the better to strengthen your Notion you again foist in out of the margin of our English Bible, <HI>His desire shall be</HI> subject <HI>to thee,</HI> whereas in the Hebrew it is no more than, <HI>His or its desire shall be to thee.</HI></P>
<P>And that the words <HI>Rule over,</HI> are to be interpreted according to the subject, and do not always mean a <HI>ruling by force,</HI> or <HI>command</HI> appears by the same Hebrew words made use of in the first of <HI>Genesis</HI>▪ concerning the <HI>two great Lights that God set in the Firma∣ment,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>v.</HI> 17, 18.</NOTE> <HI>to give Light upon the Earth, to rule over the Day, and over the Night,</HI> which cannot signifie a ruling by force or command, but only by a natural influence, or preheminence of the Sun and Moon above the Stars or Planets. And tho' you are pleased to ridicule this explanation of mine, yet I think, I may with as much reason treat yours with the like contempt, for since your self grant that this Power of <HI>Cain</HI> over <HI>Abel,</HI> was not to commence till after the Death of <HI>Adam,</HI> and that this Murder of <HI>Abel</HI> was committed above a hundred years after <HI>Adams</HI> Creation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen</HI> 5. <HI>v.</HI> 3.</NOTE> appears by the time of the Birth of <HI>Seth,</HI> (who was born sometime after <HI>Abel</HI>'s Death) would not this thing have been a mighty comfort to <HI>Cain,</HI> when he was in his dogged humor, if God had bid him chear up, for the time should come that if he behaved himself well, about eight hundred years hence, when his Fa∣ther <HI>Adam</HI> should die, he should then Lord it over his Brother, and be revenged of him for the affront he had received in having his Sacrifice pre∣ferred before his own? So that this interpretation of yours is so absurd, that I do much rather agree with divers learned commentators as well Jews as Christians, who make not only a quite different interpretation, but also a different version of these words from the Hebrew Text, and if you have the Learned Jesuit <HI>Menochius</HI> his Notes upon the Bible, I pray let me see them. Here pray observe what he says upon this place. <HI>Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sub te erit appetitus ejus; in Hebraeo, &amp; apud</HI> LXX <HI>est, ad te conversio ejus: sensus est, Peccatum ejus{que} appe∣titus, &amp; concupiscentia te sollicitabit ad consensum▪ sed ita, ut ad te converti, &amp; a te conseusum petere, &amp; impetrare debeat; id noster interpres ad sensum clare vertit, sub te erit appetitus ejus</HI>; by all which he means no more, than that sin should tempt, or sollicit him to offend, but that he should rule over it, that is, had a power so to do if he would use it as he ought. So likewise Mr. <HI>Ains∣worth</HI> upon this place, (as you may see in <HI>Pool</HI>'s Criticks) puts a li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sense upon the following words, referring the whole sentence to
<PB N="70" REF="46"/>
the sin in these words, <HI>Peccatum ponitur pro poena Peccati; juxta Hebraeos ita accipitur,</HI> Gen. 19.15. Lev. 20. 9. 1 Rep. 7.9. <HI>sinsus est prope te punitio peccati &amp; ad te desiderum ejus,</HI> i. e. <HI><UNCLEAR>cupit te</UNCLEAR> poena peccati tui, ut solet post pecca∣tum admissum.

<P>Well Sir, since you are no better satisfied with this Testimony o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of <HI>Genesis,</HI> for the Divine Right of Primogeniture, I will no longer insist upon it, tho' I am not yet convinced, but that my Interpretation of this place is truer than yours, since I have likewise great Authorities on my side, both Antient and Modern, besides our common versions to authorize it, and therefore since I have many other examples out of Scripture of this kind, I shall the less insist upon it, but will now proceed to the examples before the Floud. First therefore, it seems highly probable if not certain, that whatever Civil Government there was in the World, before that period of time (as it is very rational to believe there necessarily m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st be some in so long a space as near two hundred years) it was chief<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y administred by those first Patriarchs, whose names you'l find particularly recited in the fifth of <HI>Genesis,</HI> and sure that long Chain we there have of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P></NOTE> and <HI>Iosephus</HI> is likewise of my opinion in the first Book of the Jewish Antiquities, where (as you may see) <HI>cap.</HI> 3. he expresly tells us, thus, <HI>Seth autem centesimo &amp; quinto anno genuit Eno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

And <HI>Noah,</HI> the last of the Ten Patriarchs, and the sur∣viving Patriarch of all Mankind, was declared by God the Universal Monarch of the World, as soon as he came out of the Ark, to whom he granted the Do∣minion over all things, as appears by those words of God to <HI>Noah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">V. 2▪ 3.

And when <HI>Noah</HI> was left the sole Heir of the World; why should it be thought that God would disinherit him of his Birth right and make him only Tenant in Common with his Children? And if the Blessing given to <HI>Adam, Gen.</HI> 1.128. be com∣pared to that given to <HI>Noah,</HI> and his Sons, <HI>Gen.</HI> 9.2. there will be found a considerable difference between these two Texts. In the Benediction of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m</HI> we find expressed a subduing of the Earth and a Dominion over the Creatures; neither of which are expressed in the Blessing of <HI>Noah,</HI> nor the Earth there once named: It is only said, <HI>The Fear of you shall be upon the Creatures,</HI> and into your hands are they delivered; then immediately it fol∣lows, <HI>Every moving thing shall be meat for you, as the green Herb, &amp;c.</HI> The first Blessing gave <HI>Adam</HI> Dominion over the Earth, and all Creatures; the latter allows <HI>Noah</HI> Liberty to use the Living Creatures for Food: Here is no al∣teration or diminishing of his Title to an absolute Propriety of all things, but only an Enlargement of his Commons.</P>

<P>As for the Government of the World before the Flood, I have al∣ready acknowledged, that the Scrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>res being silent in it, no man can affirm any thing positively concerning it, whether it was Regal, Aristocra∣tical, or Paternal, neither is it any Proof, that because God thought fit for our understanding the Age of the World, or the Genealogy of <HI>Noah,</HI> from whom all Mankind now takes its Original to set down a Series of the Pa∣triarchs from Father to Son, or that because they were no obscure, unre∣garded Men, that therefore they must all be absolute Princes, or Monarchs over their Families. This is, as a Father said long ago, <HI>Divinare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agis, quam scire.</HI> But I see, when Prejudice once blinds our Reasons, we easily make good that old saying, <HI>Facile credimus quod volumus.</HI> But as for your Quotation out of <HI>Iosephus,</HI> I grant indeed, that at the first sight it makes for you; but suppose it doth, I cannot see how a Man may can lay any stress upon it, since the Scripture, being silent of any such Monarchy, or Princi∣pality
<PB N="72" REF="47"/>
in these Patriarchs, since this Author writes his History above three sand years, after the time that these Patriarchs lived, which he there men∣tions; and that we are sure there were no Authors then extant, that writ of the <HI>Ante-Deluvian</HI> Patriarchs, but <HI>Moses</HI> only, <HI>Iosephus</HI> could speak no otherwise than by guess, or from some uncertain Tradi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions preserved amongst the Pharisees, of which Sect he was: To which Traditions, when not warranted by Scripture▪ how little Credit is to be given, our Saviour himself teaches us. And also the many futilous Traditions of the Rabbins at this day, do sufficiently shew us: But I suppose that by this word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, there used by <HI>Iosephus,</HI> (which is rendered by the Latine Version <HI>Principa∣tus</HI>) is not meant any Monarchical Power, but only that Principality or Eminency, or that Reverence, and Respect which their Posterity paid them, either in regard of their great Age and Experience, or of the Spirit of God, with which they might be supposed to be endued, sufficient to make them to be taken notice of, and reverenced above all other Men living in their time. I have likewise upon better consideration, two other Reasons to add, why by the <HI>curam rerum,</HI> mentioned in this place, cannot be meant a Regal Power, because <HI>Iosephus</HI> mentions no such thing of <HI>Adam</HI> the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst Father, and as you suppose Monarch of Mankind; which sure he would have done had he believed him endued by God with such a Power.</P>
<P>The second Reason is, that if you please to observe, he ascribes to <HI>Ma∣thuselab, Lamech,</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> as many years of Empire, as of Life: So that either this place of <HI>Iosephus</HI> signifies nothing at all, or else will make nothing to your purpose to prove these Antient Patriarchs to have been so many Monarchs.</P>
<P>I come now to the next Period of time after the Flood, and whereof I grant we may discourse with more certainty: But I could have wished you would have repeated more particularly the words, whereby you suppose God granted to <HI>Noah</HI> alone, an absolute Dominion over the whole Earth, and all the Creatures therein contained: But I perceive you thought the words not very favourable for you, or else you would have repeated, or read them to me, which since you omitted, I pray give me leave to do it for you, and then I will leave it to your self to judge whether there can be any thing drawn from this Text to countenance your Opinion;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 9.1, 2, 3.</NOTE> the words are these: <HI>And God blessed</HI> Noah, <HI>and his Sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and Replenish the Earth. And the fear of you, and the dread of you shall be upon every Beast of the Earth, and upon every Fowl of the Air, upon all that moveth upon the Earth, upon all the Fishes of the Sea, into your hand are they delivered. Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green Herb have I given you all things:</HI> Where you may plainly see, that <HI>Noah</HI> hath no Prehe∣minence in this Grant above his Children, who were (for as much as I can see) by this Text to be Tenants in Common with him of the Earth, and all its Creatures▪ Nor is there much difference between this Grant to <HI>Noah,</HI> and his Sons, and that made to <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> which I proved extended alike to all Mankind, more than that the Brute Animals are here granted to <HI>Noah,</HI> and his Sons for Food, which they were not before to <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>But I perceive you your self are sensible, that this is the most plain, and obvious sense of these words, and therefore you have thought good to
<PB N="73" REF="47"/>
wrest them so as may best serve your purpose; and indeed you deal very cunningly to say, that this Grant may be best under∣stood with a Subordination in Succession;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. T. G. c.</HI> 4. <HI>p.</HI> 41.</NOTE> 'Tis true indeed, it serves best for your purpose, that it should be so understood, but that will be best understood by any body else, which best agrees with the Plain, and obvious Sense of the Words. Nor will your reason signifie any thing, that the Blessing might be truly fulfilled if the Sons either under, or after their Father enjoyed a private Dominion: Since that were to say that a Grant whose express Words, give a joynt Title in present (for the Text saith, <HI>Into your hands they are delivered</HI>) may best be understood with a subordination, or in succession, because 'tis possible that in subordination, or succession it may be so enjoyed, is all one as to say, that a Grant of any thing in present Possession, may best be understood in Reversion, because 'tis possible one may live so to enjoy it. And as for the other parts of this Grant, they are so expressed, that they must needs be understood to belong to <HI>Noah</HI>'s Sons, not with a subordination, or in suc∣cession, but as full and equally as to <HI>Noah</HI> himself: <HI>The fear of you, and the dread of you</HI> (says God) <HI>shall be upon every Beast,</HI> &amp;c. Can any body in rea∣son say, that the Creatures were to fear, and stand in awe of <HI>Noah</HI> only, and not of his Sons without his leave, or till after his death? And are the following words, (<HI>into your hands they are delivered,</HI>) to be understood, (as you say) if your Father please, or they shall be delivered into your hands hereafter? You do also as wisely to say, that if <HI>Adam</HI> had a private Dominion given him by God, that he would not now abrogate it: For I grant, that if he had given <HI>Adam</HI> any such private Dominion, that there had been no reason for him now to have changed it. But I think I have suffi∣ciently proved at our last meeting, that he had no such private Dominion given him any more than <HI>Eve,</HI> and those Children that were to proceed from them. So that this supposition being false, there will be no such con∣siderable difference as you suppose, between these two Texts. For certainly, (tho' it be not here expressed) <HI>Noah</HI>'s Sons had as much Right to subdue or possess the Earth, as the Posterity of <HI>Adam</HI> had before the Flood, and like∣wise to enjoy, or eat the Products thereof; only here is granted to <HI>Noah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 47.</NOTE> and his Sons, a Power to kill the Crea∣tures for food, which was not granted to <HI>Adam,</HI> or those that lived before the Flood: And tho' you will have this Grant to be no diminishing of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Title to a sole Propriety in all things, but only an Enlargement of his Commons; yet methinks it is a considerable Priviledge not only to himself, but his Sons likewise, who are hereby impowered to use the Creatures for food, as well as their Father, or else their <UNCLEAR>Case</UNCLEAR> had been very hard, if when the Creatures were sufficiently multiplied, they might not have killed so much as a <HI>Hare,</HI> or a <HI>Partridge</HI> without his leave. And if they had a Right thus to use these Creatures, how this differs from an absolute Propriety in them when ever they are taken, my dull under∣standing is not able to comprehend.</P>

I will for the present admit, that <HI>Noah</HI> was a Prince or Monarch over all his Posterity; but then pray shew me to whom this Power descended after his Decease, for I can see nothing in Scripture, that favours your Divine Right of Primogeniture, but that every one of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Three Sons was a Prince alike over his own Family, and had an equal share in the Earth, and all its Products, the one as much as the other; so that here it is appa∣rent your sole Monarchy of the World dwindles into a sort of <HI>Gavel-kind</HI> where all the Sons inherit alike.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny the matter of Fact to be as you have laid down, but then there might be very good reason for it, which might render the sole Principality of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Eldest Son to be not only unlawful,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. O. G. p.</HI> 49.</NOTE> but unpracticable, for in the first place Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his <HI>Mare Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sum</HI> (in the place afore∣cited) tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 4.</NOTE> from the Antient Tradition of the Jewish Rabbins, <HI>That</HI> Noah <HI>himself, as Lord of all, was Author of the distribution of the World, and of private Dominion, and that by the appointment of an Oracle from God, be did confirm this distribution by his last Will, and Testament, which at his Death he lef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the hands of his Eldest Son</HI> Shem, <HI>and also warned all his Sons, that none of them should invade any of their Brothers Dominions, or injure one another, because from thence Discord, and Civil Wars would necessarily follow.</HI></P>
<P>Nor do I see any reason why <HI>Noah</HI> might not emancipate his two Youn∣ger Sons from the Dominion of the Elder, and likewise give them a sepa∣rate share of the Earth, and also an independent Power over their own Fa∣mily, and Posterity. In the second place, it might be impracticable for one Man to Govern all Mankind, when in a little time it became so multiplied and dispersed over the Face of the Earth, and the Languages so confounded by the Act, or Will of God, that it was impossible for the Three Elder Sons, of these three great Patriarchs, to govern them. But during the Life of <HI>Noah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P.</HI> § 10.</NOTE> we do not read that any of his Chil∣dren, or Descendants, withdrew themselves from him with∣out his leave,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 11.1, 2.</NOTE> but rather the contrary; for it is said, <HI>The whole Earth was of one Language, and of one Speech; and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East, that they found a Plain in the Land of</HI> Shi∣nar, &amp;c By which words it appears they kept well enough together; and the very reason why they began to build the Tower, was left, (said they) <HI>We should be scattered abroad upon the Face of the whole Earth</HI>: So that there was no disunion amongst them, nor so much as a desire of it, whilst <HI>Noah</HI> lived.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray give me leave to answer what you have said concerning this Distribution of the Earth by <HI>Noah</HI>'s last Will, and also his making all his Sons Lords, or Monarchs alike, both which favour so strong∣ly of the Rabbinical Liberty of Invention, that I wonder how any Learned Man can believe such idle Stories, especially when the Scripture, and the most Antient Histories, and Records that are extant in the World, mention no such thing; and tho' <HI>Ios<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phus</HI> may in the place you have cited suppose that every one of the Patriarchs he mentions, were Princes, or Monarchs, yet he doth not say any thing like it, concerning the Three Sons of <HI>Noah</HI>'s being Monarchs, or of this Partition of the Earth between them, but maketh
<PB N="75" REF="48"/>
them to live together in those Mountainous parts, till they descended from thence into the Plain; so that it was impossible for <HI>Noah</HI> to make a Distri∣bution of those parts of the Earth, which were not yet discovered; and it is apparent by the Scripture it self, that a considerable time after <HI>Noah</HI>'s Death all Mankind lived together, and therefore there was no impossibility (as you suppose) why <HI>Noah</HI>'s Eldest Son could not have commanded his Brethren, and their Descendants, they being not as yet dispersed, or sepa∣rated from each other, as you may see by the first Verses of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of <HI>Genesis,</HI> which you cited but now. So that if <HI>Noah</HI>'s Eldest Son was dis∣inherited of his Right of Governing his Brethren, and their Descendants, that could not be the cause of it, which you assign; and if <HI>Primogeniture</HI> be a <HI>Divine Right</HI> appointed by God himself, and unalterable by <HI>Humane Laws,</HI> as you suppose, I cannot see how the Will of a Father▪ which is but a <HI>Humane Institution,</HI> can ever alter it: For I remember you laid it down as a Maxim, at our last meeting, <HI>That the Divine Right of the Right Heir never dies, can be lost, or taken away; so that if there hath been any such thing as a Divine Right of Primogeniture</HI> belonging to the Eldest Son of <HI>Noah,</HI> it is not likely that he would have permitted his two Brothers to have usurped it from him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not insist longer on this Tradition, concerning the Distri∣bution of the Earth amongst the Sons of <HI>Noah</HI>; but certainly it is not a thing to be made so slight of as you do, since <HI>Cedrenus</HI> a Modern Greek Hi∣storian, is very particular in it; besides, so many other Learned Men (and the great <HI>Selden</HI> among the rest) have given countenance to it. And tho' I grant that Primogeniture is of Divine Right, yet that might very well be altered by <HI>Noah</HI>'s Will, especially, since his Children might be satisfied that he being a Prophet, and Preacher of Righteousness, might make this Di∣vision of his Paternal Power by a Divine Command.</P>
<P>But I shall not dwell longer upon this, but proceed to the next Period of Time; (<HI>viz.</HI>) that of the Confusion, and Dispersion of Tongues, in which there are more evident Footsteps of this Right of Primogeniture, as also of the Patriarchal Power I maintain: And therefore pray turn to the 10th of <HI>Genesis,</HI> and there you will find (after the Recital of the Genealogy of eve∣ry one of the Sons of <HI>Noah,</HI> whose Des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endants are there particularly set down) these words in the fifth verse; <HI>By these were the Isles of the Gentiles divided in their Lands;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F.

P.</HI> § 4.</NOTE> <HI>every one after his Tongue, after their Families in their Nations</HI>: And likewise in the 20th verse; <HI>These are the Sons of</HI> Ham, <HI>after their Families; after their Tongues in their Countreys, and in their Nations.</HI> And in the last verse; <HI>These are the Families of the Sons of</HI> Noah, <HI>and their Generations in their Nations; and by these were the Nations divided in the Earth after the Flood.</HI> So that if we consider the first Plantations of the World, which were after the Building of <HI>Babel,</HI> and the Confusion of Tongues, we may find the Division of the Earth into distinct Kingdoms, or Nations, by several Families and Languages,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. A. MM. p.</HI> 275.</NOTE> whereof the Sons, or Grand-children of <HI>Noah,</HI> were the Kings, or Gover∣nours, by a Fatherly Right: And for the preservation of this Power, and Right in these Fathers, God was pleased upon several Families to bestow a Language on each by it self, the better to unite it into a Nation or Kingdom.
<PB N="76" REF="49"/>
So that it becoming impossible (as I said before) for the Elder Sons or De∣scendants of these Three great Patriarchs to Govern all Mankind, who now no longer understood each other's Language, it was absolutely necessary that the Heads of the several Families should take that care upon them, and their Children submit to them; wherein they had the direction of God Almighty, who had commanded them to obey their Parents, and a mira∣culous declaration of his Will for their Dispersion, by the confounding of their Language, and that so ordered by God too, that the Descendants of the same Person, and Family, spoke one Tongue; was not this a declaring these Fathers Princes of these several Families, and Tongues by God him∣self, who by his Providence had thus confounded their Tongues, and dis∣persed them by Families, that they could no longer be governed by Three, or Four Patriarchs, but must have as many distinct Governments, as there were different Tongues, there being no means at present of any intercourse, or correspondence one with another, or with their former Governours? So that however in this Confusion of Tongues (by which, as <HI>Iosephus</HI> supposes, there were Seventy two distinct Nations erected) yet were they not con∣fused Multitudes without Heads, or Governours, and at liberty to chuse what Governours, or Government they pleased, but were so many distinct Families which had Fathers for Rulers over them of the same Speech:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P.</HI> § 10.</NOTE> Whereby it is manifest, that even in the Confusion, God was careful to preserve <HI>Fa∣therly Authority,</HI> and <HI>Monarchical Power entire,</HI> by distributing the di∣versity of Languages according to the diversity of Families; which shews that <HI>God</HI> was still for <HI>Government,</HI> and that <HI>Paternal</HI> too, since it is evi∣dent that every People followed their Ancestor, or Patriarch, as their Prince or Leader in this Dispersion, who had a <HI>Patriarchal Authority</HI> over their Posterity; for by what else can you suppose they could have made their Children, and Descendants, to have followed them as far as the ut∣most Isles of the Gentiles?</P>

<P>I confess there are many difficulties as well in the time, as manner of this Dispersion, according to our Common Chronology; for if you suppose, that the Building of the Tower of <HI>Babel,</HI> fell out within two hun∣dred years after the Flood, as most of our Chronologers, who follow the Hebrew account, do, then it is certain, that <HI>Noah,</HI> and his Sons, were still alive, who lived till above four hundred years after the Flood; so that either <HI>Noah,</HI> and his Sons, did not travel with the rest of their Descendants into the Plain of <HI>Shinar,</HI> where they built the Tower of <HI>Babel,</HI> which yet seems contrary to the Text, which says, <HI>All Mankind being of one Language, they travelled,</HI> &amp;c. And if these Children, and Grand-children left their An∣cestors at home, what become of their Monarchical Authority, when their Subjects were gone? &amp; you your self do assert, that none of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Posterity divided from him, as long as he lived; so on the other side, if you suppose, that <HI>Noah,</HI> and his Sons marched along with them in this Expedition, you must make them either to have quitted their Authority over their Descen∣dants, or else to have joyned with them in this wicked, and foolish Enter∣prize of Building a Tower, whose top should reach to Heaven, which is very hard to conceive of <HI>Noah,</HI> a Preacher of Righteousness, or his Sons, whom the Scripture no where mentions, or blames for having a hand in this Attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="49"/>But if you will lay the fault of Building this Tower upon <HI>Nimrod,</HI> as <HI>Iosephus</HI> doth, who makes him a great Tyrant, and a wicked Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 4.</NOTE> this will make against your own Hypo∣thesis, which supposes no Rebellion, or Usurpation to have been during the Life of <HI>Noah.</HI> So that to avoid these Absurdities, and Difficulties that will follow by the placing the Building of the Tower of <HI>Ba∣bel,</HI> within two hundred years after the Flood (as you must do if you fol∣low the present Hebrew Account) I think it were much better to embrace the Account of the LXX. which by adding a hundred years to the Lives of each Patriarch between <HI>Noah,</HI> and <HI>Abraham,</HI> makes the Confusion of Tongues to have happened not till about five hundred years after the Flood, which takes away those Absurdities I mentioned, of making <HI>Noah,</HI> and his Sons to have had a hand in the Building of the Tower of <HI>Babel,</HI> or else that <HI>Nimrod</HI> did it, whether they would or not; which is likewise as hard to suppose; all which Difficulties, according to this Account, may very well be taken away; since then, <HI>Noah,</HI> and his Sons were dead, before ever this Tower began to be built: And for the further proof of this, I refer you to the Learned <HI>Isaac Vossius</HI> his Vindication of the Translation of the LXX. and his Chronology accommodated to that account, as most agreeable to the Antient Hebrew Original; but this is only by the by.</P>

<P>I thank you, Sir, for your solution of this great Difficulty which I am satisfied cannot be better solved, than by this Account of the LXX Ver∣sion. But I pray answer my Argument, which in my Opinion clearly makes out the Divine Institution, as well as necessity of Patriarchal Power.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was just coming to it, and therefore in the first place I must tell you, that I cannot imagine how you can prove from this Text concerning the Dispersion of Nations, and their following certain Leaders of their own Family, and Language, when otherwise they could not have conversed to∣gether, that therefore God must be careful in all this transaction to pre∣serve your Imaginary Patriarchal Power entire; of which the Scripture is altogether silent;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. T. G. c.</HI> 11. <HI>p.</HI> 177.</NOTE> and you might as well tell me, that because in <HI>Hannibal</HI>'s, or <HI>Darius</HI>'s Army, there were whole Squadrons of different Languages, who were ranged under Captains of their own Language or Countrey, that therefore Fathers, or Grand-fathers were Leaders of each Squadron, or that <HI>Darius,</HI> or <HI>Hannibal,</HI> were careful to preserve Paternal Authority.</P>
<P>But suppose I grant you the utmost you can ask, yet, since God thought fit at this Confusion of Tongues, that all those of one Tribe should speak the same Language, which was not understood by any other, it is likewise very reasonable to suppose, that they could not travel so far as the utmost parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> without chusing, and following some Captain Leaders to be their Guides, and Commanders in so long a Journey; and whom could the People sooner chuse to follow for this purpose than their Fathers, or Grand-fathers, to whose natural Affection, Wisdom, and long Experience, they had from their very Infancy always paid a great respect, and submis∣sion: Yet doth it not therefore follow, that such Fathers, or Grand-fathers, thus led, or commanded their Children, and Posterity (now grown up to be Men and Women) by any Natural, or Divine Right, or that they
<PB N="78" REF="50"/>
followed them otherwise than as an Army of Volunteers, or than as a Caravan in the Desarts of <HI>Arabia</HI> doth a Captain of its own chusing. But if you will suppose any thing beyond this, you will find your self involved in greater Difficulties, and Absurdities. For pray tell me, what great Care was there to preserve a Patriarchal Authority in this Confusion and Dis∣persion, by breaking it into so many parts? Indeed I am so blind I cannot see it. For as I will not deny, but it was God's Will to confound the Lan∣guage, and disperse the Families of Mankind, both for a Punishment, and also for the better Peopling of the World: So am I not convinced, that God in acting thus, was at all careful to preserve the Patriarchal Authority, deriv'd from <HI>Adam.</HI> For you cannot deny but that at the same time he de∣stroyed the true Supreme Fatherhood of the Natural Monarch, or Heir of <HI>Adam,</HI> who could be but one Person, as you your self have already asserted; or, can it be any reason to say, that God for the preservation of Paternal Authority, let so many several new Governments, with their Governours start up, who must all enjoy this Authority? And is it not more reaso∣nable to say, that God was careful to destroy this Paternal Authority, when he suffered those of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Sons, or Descendants then actually in Possession of it, to have their Monarchy torn in pieces, and shared by so many of their Subjects? And would it not be an excellent Argument for Monar∣chical Government to say, when any Monarchy was shattered to pieces, and divided amongst many revolted Subjects, that God was only careful to preserve Monarchical Power, by rending a great settled Empire, into a multitude of little Governments. So that it is altogether irrational to con∣ceive, that if any three, or more Right Heirs of <HI>Noah</HI> had Paternal Autho∣rity, or Soveraignty by Right of Fatherhood over Mankind at <HI>Babel,</HI> that the next moment, (all they yet living) <HI>seventy two others</HI> should have a like Soveraignty by Right of Fatherhood over the same People, divided into so many distinct Governments; either then these <HI>seventy two</HI> Fathers were actually Rulers, just before the Confusion, and then they were not one People, but an <HI>Aristocratical Common-Wealth,</HI> and then where was your <HI>Monarchy</HI>? Or else these <HI>seventy two</HI> Fathers had <HI>Paternal Authority,</HI> but knew it not, which is hard to suppose. And if these seventy two Grand-children of the Sons of <HI>Noah,</HI> had a Right to divide this Supreme Pa∣ternal Authority of <HI>Adam</HI> into as many distinct Governments as there were Heads of Families, why might not their Sons have done so <HI>in infinitum</HI>? And then there could never be any Common Prince, or Monarch set over them all, but by <HI>Force,</HI> or <HI>Conquest,</HI> or else by <HI>Election</HI>: Either of which destroys your Notion of the <HI>Divine Right</HI> of <HI>Primogeniture.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a very pleasant Notion, methinks, this of yours, that the Po∣sterity of the first Planters of the World, should follow their Ancestors, not as Children, or Subjects, but as Volunteers, and from a Reverence (forsooth) and Affection to their Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P.</HI> § 60.</NOTE> Wisdom, and Experience. Indeed I am thus far of your mind, that these Children followed their Fathers freely, and were not driven afore them, nor dragged after them with Chains: But to infer from hence, that they owed their Father none of this Service, or Attendance, but out of meer good Nature and Gratitude, which are due to Strangers that have obliged us, by being our Benefactors, is a Notion
<PB N="79" REF="50"/>
that only becomes one, that owns no Right to be derived from Patriar∣chal, or Paternal Power; and since there was none of these Patriarchs, who were the Leaders of Mankind in this Dispersion, but might be one, or two hundred years old, if not more; can any thing in Nature look more ridi∣culous, than for the Children, and Descendants of these Old Men to elect them who begat them to be their Leaders, and Governours, at a hundred years of Age?</P>
<P>And to give you an Answer why Governments might not upon my Principles crumble into new ones,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> 63.</NOTE> <HI>in infinitum,</HI> I think it may be sufficient to tell you, that First, God prevented it, and that for the most part by Monarchs, ever since the Creation of the World; and altho' he was pleased to permit many Divisions after this time; yet he would ne∣ver suffer Mankind to be crumbled into such small Divisions as to make every distinct Houshold an Independent Government. Secondly, Those Monarchs prevented it, who would be sure to reduce to their Subjection, any person that should attempt to divide himself, or Family, from the rest, and set up for an Independant State without his leave, and liking. Thirdly, The necessity of Mankind prevented it, such small parcels of Men not being able to preserve themselves, but by uniting with the rest, for their Support and Protection: So that if you could never so clearly prove that here was no Subordination to the Eldest Son, or Heir of <HI>Noah,</HI> yet this sig∣nifieth nothing, for God ordered it so to be; and if these Grand sons of <HI>Noah</HI> were Independant Governours of their own Families, with any Sub∣ordination to the Eldest Son's Son or Heir of <HI>Noah</HI>; yet were they still So∣veraign Princes, and much less had any dependance upon their own Chil∣dren and Descendants. So that hitherto the Multitude were kept under Subjection, and could not set up a Common-wealth without rebelling against those Independant Governours.</P>
<P>Now if in this horrible Confusion of Tongues, the People by the Will of God still fell under the Monarchical Government of these Fathers of Fa∣milies, I desire to know when they could obtain their Freedom, and in what Age it began?</P>

<P>I must confess you had some Reasons to look upon my Notion of the Descendants of the Sons of <HI>Noah</HI> following their Ancestors in this Dis∣persion, not as Children, or Subjects, but as Volunteers, to be as ridiculous as you are pleased to make it, could you have any way proved at our last meeting, that the Power of Parents over their Children, and Grand-chil∣dren to all Generations, is as absolute, and perpetual, as that of a Master over his Slaves, and that a Son and a Servant were all one at the first; but since you failed in that Proposition, which is the ground-work of all the rest, I must beg your pardon, if I cannot found the Descendants of <HI>Noah,</HI> following their Fathers, or Ancestors in the Dispersion, upon any higher ground, than meer Gratitude and Esteem: I mean for all such of them, who were themselves at that time Masters, or Heads of separate Families; and I desire to know of you by what other Motive, or Obligation, a Great Grand-son (for Example) was obliged to follow his Great Grand father to the World's end, as his Prince, or Leader, when perhaps his own Father thought fit to lead him another way; and I desire you to shew me if they had (as they might very well have) commanded different things, which
<PB N="80" REF="51"/>
was to be obeyed? And how Disobedience to a Man's own Father in this case would have consisted with that Law of Nature, which you so much in∣sist upon, of honouring a Man's Father. But indeed all this mistake pro∣ceeds from your first false Notion, which I see you cannot yet be quit of, in still supposing the Obedience, and Subjection of Children to their Fa∣thers to be absolute, and perpetual: The contrary to which I have alrea∣dy made out at our last meeting: And therefore I must tell you again, that this Notion of these Grand-children, or Descendants following their Fa∣thers, or Ancestors, not out of Duty, but Choice, is not so ridiculous as you are pleased to make it; and tho' I do not suppose that they <HI>Elected</HI> these Ancestors of theirs for their Leaders by a <HI>Balotting-Box,</HI> yet this much I am sure of, that they might prefer, if they pleased, the following of their Father, or Grand-father, rather than their Great Grand-father, if they perceived that he had doted through Age, or else by Weakness, or Infirmities, was unable to lead them, or that his natural temper was so Imperious, and Tyrannical, that there was no living under his Government? Neither doth the Scripture it self any where declare the contrary, only says in general, that by these Grand-sons of <HI>Noah,</HI> the Isles, or Countreys of the Gentiles were divided, according to their Families, and Nations, without particularly telling us, who were the Princes, or Leaders of each Tribe, or Family. And to instance, if this Division happened in the time of <HI>Peleg,</HI> or <HI>Phaleg,</HI> as the Greek LXX. makes it, then not <HI>Arphaxad</HI> the Great Grand-father, or <HI>Selah</HI> the Grand-father, but <HI>Heber</HI> the Grand-son was the Prince or Leader of his Family at this Division: Since it is from him that <HI>Iosephus</HI> supposes the <HI>Hebrews</HI> not only to have descended,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 6.</NOTE> but to have taken their Names.</P>
<P>Nor do you any better answer the other Difficulty, how all these Seventy two Patriarchs, or Great Grand-fathers, could all of them claim alike Regal Power from <HI>Adam,</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> whose Right Heir could be but one Per∣son. Indeed you tell me, that God ordered it so, by appointing every Nation a distinct Language, and to be led by the Ancestor of their Family: This is altogether <HI>gratis dictum</HI>; for tho' it be true, that the Scripture says, That this Division of Tongues was made according to the different Tribes, or Families of these Descendants of <HI>Noah</HI>; yet doth it no where mention their being led or commanded by Seventy two Grand-fathers Patriarchs, and there might be, for ought that you or I know, not only Seventy two, but Seven-score such Captains, or Leaders of them, Nay, every distinct Father of a Family, when this Monarchical Power came to be crumbled into so many parts, might as well have claimed a share in this Regal Power, they being by this Confusion wholly reduced again into a State of Nature.</P>
<P>Nor are your Reasons sufficient to convince me of the contrary. As for your first Reason, that God hath not suffered it to be so, signifies little; for either he hath hindered it by an <HI>express Command,</HI> or by the <HI>Ordinary Course</HI> of his <HI>Providence</HI>: The former, I am sure, you can no where shew me; and as for the latter, when ever any Nation, or People, shall be pres∣sed with the like Necessity of separating themselves from the Government under which they were born, as the several Families of Mankind had at this Division of Tongues: I see no reason why they may not have a like Right of quitting their Countrey, and becoming Subjects to another
<PB N="81" REF="51"/>
Government; or else of setting up one of their own if they can.</P>
<P>As for your second Reason, that Monarchs would be sure to reduce to their Subjection any person that should offer to divide himself, and Fa∣mily from the rest, and set up for an Independant State without their good leave, and liking. This is a good Argument indeed, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they might not be able to do it, but none at all that they ought not to do it if they could, since this were but to exercise that Supreme Paternal Authority with which God hath invested them as much as ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e did any of those Seventy two Descendants of <HI>Noah,</HI> who set up so many New Governments without the Consent of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Heir.</P>
<P>Your third Reason, I confess, is somewhat better: That the Necessity of Mankind prevented it, but this also makes quite against you, and only proves, that the Heads or Masters of Families being sensible they could not preserve themselves, but by uniting with others for their mutual Safety, and Protectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, were fain to submit, (tho' b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their own Consents,) to some Common Power, for their own as well as their Families Preserva∣tion. So that I cannot see from any thing you have said, that God had that great care you suppose of maintaining your Patriarchal Power, much less this Divine Right of Primogeni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure.</P>

P. c.</HI> 1. § 8.</NOTE> in which, the first Instance I shall give you is, that of <HI>Iacob,</HI> who when he had bought his Brothers Birth-right,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 27.29.</NOTE> <HI>Isaac</HI> blessed him thus; <HI>Be Lord over thy Brethren, and let the Sons of thy Mother bow down before thee.</HI> By which is plainly denoted a Regal Power, or Dominion over <HI>Esau</HI> his Brother, and the rest of his Brethren, if he had had any. So likewise we find—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray give me leave to interrupt you alittle, for I have a great deal to say to this Instance you have now brought of <HI>Iacob,</HI> and <HI>Esau,</HI> and therefore I desire I may speak it before you proceed any further. And first by the way, I cannot but observe, that this Divine Right of Primogeni∣ture which you suppose here to be meant by the word <HI>Birth-right,</HI> was ca∣pable of being sold for a Mess of Pottage, and all <HI>Esau</HI>'s Heirs disinherited of their Right, because their Father preferred his Belly, before his Honour or Interest. But if your Principles are true, a Divine Right never dieth, nor can be lost or taken away.</P>
<P>The second thing I must take notice of,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T.T.G. c.</HI> 11. <HI>p.</HI> 145.</NOTE> is your un∣fair dealing, in making <HI>Isaac</HI> to have presently after this Sale of the Birth right, and as it were in confirmation of it, to have given <HI>Iacob</HI> his Blessing, whereas it is apparent by this story in <HI>Gen.</HI> 25. that many years past (perhaps twenty or thirty) between <HI>Iacob</HI>'s buying of this Birth-right, and <HI>Isaac</HI>'s conferring of the Blessing upon him, as any one that will but read the 26th of <HI>Genesis,</HI> may easily see. But if you had better observed this Text, you would have found that this Blessing was nor in∣tended for <HI>Iacob,</HI> but <HI>Esau</HI> for whom <HI>Isaac</HI> then mistook him; but be it as it will, whether the Blessing was given to <HI>Iacob,</HI> or <HI>Esau,</HI> it matters not;
<PB N="82" REF="52"/>
for from these words I can by no means gather, that any Government, or Superiority, was thereby conferred on <HI>Esau</HI> over <HI>Iacob,</HI> or <HI>Iacob</HI> over <HI>Esau.</HI> For first▪ as to <HI>Iacob</HI> this Blessing was never fulfilled, as to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord over <HI>Esau,</HI> who was Prince of Mount <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir</HI> in <HI>Iacob</HI>'s life time; and as for bow∣ing, or any other token of Superiority, we read indeed that <HI>Iacob</HI> at his meeting his Brother <HI>Esau,</HI> bowed seven times towards him to the ground, tho' he had before sold his Birth-right to <HI>Iacob</HI>; and therefore this Birth-right cannot mean any Ruling Power, or Lordship over his Brethren; since it is manifest from the Text, that <HI>Iacob</HI> had no more Brothers than <HI>Esau</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 146.</NOTE> nor had <HI>Isaac</HI> any consideration of <HI>Iacob</HI>'s having then bought this Birth-right; for when he thus blessed him, he took him not to be <HI>Iacob,</HI> but <HI>Esau</HI>; nor did <HI>Esau</HI> understand any connexion between the Birth-right, and the Blessing; for▪ says he to his Father, <HI>He hath supplanted me th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se two times, he took away my Birth right, and behold now he hath taken away my Blessing.</HI> Whereas, had this <HI>Blessing,</HI> to be <HI>Lord over his Brethren</HI> belonged to the Birth-right, <HI>Esau</HI> could not have complained of this second as a Cheat, <HI>Iacob</HI> having got no∣thing▪ but what <HI>Esau</HI> had sold him long before.</P>
<P>So that it is plain Dominion was not then understood to belong either to the Birth-right, or Blessing. And therefore it is more rational to suppose, that this word Birth right, only relates to the Right of Priesthood, which the Jews supposed always to descend to the Eldest Son, before the Law was given: And that by <HI>Blessing,</HI> is meant no more, than that double portion of Goods, which by the Jewish Law was due to the First-born; and that this is the true sense of this place, I desire you to look in <HI>Gen.</HI> 21.10. (if you please to give me your Bible I will shew you the place, and will read the words to you) where <HI>Sarah</HI> taking <HI>Isaac</HI> to be Heir, says, <HI>Cast out this Bond-woman and her Son, for the Son of this Bond-woman shall not be Heir with my Son:</HI> Whereby could be meant nothing, but that he should not have a Pretence to any equal share of his Fathers Estate after his Death, but should have his Portion presently, and be gone: And Farther we read,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T.T. G. p.</HI> 147.</NOTE> <HI>Gen.</HI> 25.5, 6. That <HI>Abraham</HI> gave all that he had unto <HI>Isaac,</HI> but unto the Sons of the Concubines which <HI>Abraham</HI> had, <HI>Abraham</HI> gave Gifts, and sent them away from <HI>Isaac</HI> his Son, while he yet lived; that is, <HI>Abraham</HI> having given Por∣tions to all his other Sons, and sent them away, that which he had reserved, being the greatest part of his Substance, <HI>Isaac</HI> as Heir possessed after his Death, but by being Heir he had no Right to be Lord over his Brethren: For if he had, why should <HI>Sarah</HI> desire to rob him of one of his Subjects, or Slaves, by desiring to have him sent away?</P>
<P>So likewise, if you look into the first of <HI>Chron. chap.</HI> 5. <HI>v.</HI> 12. you will find a place, that plainly confirms this Interpreta∣tion, where it is said;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 148.</NOTE> <HI>Reuben was the First-born, but for as much as he defiled his</HI> Fathers Bed, his Birth-right <HI>was given unto the Sons of</HI> Joseph, <HI>the Son of</HI> Israel, <HI>and the Genealogy is not to be reckoned after the Birth-right; for</HI> Judah <HI>prevailed above his Brethren, and of him came the Chief Ruler; but the Birth-right was</HI> Joseph's; tho' he was the Youngest Son; and that this Birth right was <HI>Iacob</HI>'s Blessing on <HI>Ioseph, Gen.</HI> 58.28. tells us in these words; <HI>Moreover I have given thee one Portion
<PB N="83" REF="52"/>
above thy Brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorites with my Sword' and with my Bow.</HI> Whereby it is not only plain, that the Birth-right was nothing but a double Portion; but the Text in <HI>Chronicles</HI> is expresly against your Opinion, and shews that Dominion was no part of the Birth-right; for it tells us, <HI>That</HI> Joseph <HI>had the Birth-right, but</HI> Judah <HI>the Domi∣nion.</HI> So that unless you were very fond of this word <HI>Birth-right,</HI> without considering in what sense it is to be taken, you would never bring this In∣stance of <HI>Iacob</HI> and <HI>Esau,</HI> to prove that Dominion belongs to the Eldest Son, over his Brethren: For if this Blessing of <HI>Isaac</HI> upon <HI>Iacob</HI> signifies any thing more than this, it could not relate to his own Person, who never Ruled over his Brother at all; and therefore it is at most no more, than a Prophecy, shewing that the Jews, as being descended from <HI>Iacob,</HI> should in after-times Rule over the <HI>Edomites,</HI> or Posterity of <HI>Esau,</HI> according to what <HI>Rebekah</HI> had been foretold from God. <HI>Two Nations are in thy Womb,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 25.23.</NOTE> <HI>and two manner of People shall be separa∣ted from thy Bowels, and the one People sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l be stronger than the other People, and the Elder shall serve the Younger.</HI> And so <HI>Iacob</HI> bles∣sed <HI>Iudah,</HI> and gave him (tho' not in his own Person, but in his Posterity) the Scepter, and Dominion: From whence you might have argued as well, that the Dominion belonged to the Third Son over his Brethren; as well as from this Blessing of <HI>Isaac,</HI> that it belonged to <HI>Iacob,</HI> they being both but Predictions of what should long after happen to their Posterities, and not declaring any Hereditary Right of Dominion in either <HI>Iacob,</HI> or <HI>Iudah.</HI></P>

And I have proofs enough of this in Scripture. Since thus we find it to have been among the Sons of <HI>Ishmael,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F.

And these are the Names of the Dukes that came of</HI> Esau, <HI>according to their Families, and their Places by their Nations.</HI> And hence it is, that in after Ages, Princes did often divide their Kingdoms amongst their Children, of which you may

see divers Examples in <HI>Grotius de I. B. L. II Cap.</HI> 7. which Di∣visions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">§ 12.</NOTE> when made and submitted to by the Eldest Son, I doubt not but were good. Yet I think it cannot be denied for all this, that by the Law of Nature, or Nations, where there is no Will of the Father de∣clared to the contrary, the Eldest Son ought to inherit. And this is the Judgment not only of Christian, but Heathen Writers. Thus <HI>Herodotus</HI> the most Antient Greek Historian,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Herod. Polym.</HI></NOTE> lays it down for a general <HI>Custom of all People, or Nations, that the Eldest Son should enjoy the Empire</HI>; and the <HI>Romans</HI> were likewise of this Opinion; and therefore <HI>Livy,</HI> when he speaks of two Brothers of the <HI>All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>broges,</HI> contending for the Kingdom, says, <HI>The Younger was more strong in Force, than Right.</HI> And in another place, <HI>he calls this Right of the Eldest Son, the Right of Age and Nature</HI>; as also doth <HI>Trogus Pompaeius</HI> in his Epitome of <HI>Iustine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iustin. L.XI.</HI></NOTE> when <HI>he calls it the Right of Nations</HI>; and in another place, <HI>a Right of Na∣ture,</HI> when he says,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iustin. L.II.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Artabazanes</HI> the Eldest Son of the <HI>King of</HI> Persia, <HI>challenged the Kingdom himself, which the Order of his Birth and Nature it self appointed amongst Nations.</HI> I could give you many other Authorities from more Modern Authors, but I rather chuse to give you these, because you cannot except against them, as Writers pre∣possest by either Jewish, or Christian Principles. So that if this <HI>Right of Primogeniture</HI> be not absolutely Divine, yet it is at least most Natural, and Reasonable.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you are convinced, that this <HI>Divine Right</HI> of <HI>Primogeniture,</HI> is not to be proved out of Scripture, and therefore you are contented to fall a Peg lower, and to take up with the Right of Eldership by the Law of Nature, or Nations, which howsoever you are pleased to confound them, are for all that two distinct things; for if the Succession of the Eldest Son were by the Law of Nature, it were no more to be altered by the Will of a Father, than the Law of God it self; and therefore notwithstanding all your Quotations, your <HI>Right of Primogeniture</HI> amounts to no more than this, that it hath been a Common, and received Custom in many King∣doms, or Nations to observe it; and therefore <HI>Herodotus,</HI> whom you have now quoted, calls it very rightly <HI>a Custom of Nations, that the Eldest Son should enjoy the Empire:</HI> Which yet is not true amongst all Nations, or People by your own confession: For then there would have been no difference be∣tween Hereditary, and Patrimonial Kingdoms; but the Eldest Son should have inherited alone in the one as well as in the other. Unless you can sup∣pose (as sure you will not) that some Kingdoms are to be disposed accord∣ing to the Law of Nature, and others not. But if you would have consider∣ed <HI>Grotius</HI> (whom you have now made use of) he would have instructed you better. For in the Chapter you have now cited, he makes the diffe∣rence between them to depend upon the manner of acquiring the Kingdoms he speaks of; if you please I will shew you the words; <HI>Sed in Regnorum Successione distingui debent Regna quae pleno modo possidentur,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. I. B. Lib. II. Cap.</HI> 7. § 12.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; in Patrimonio sunt, ab his quae modum habendi accipiunt ex populi consensu, de quo discri∣mine egimus supra.

<L>Reginam scit ferre Pharos,</L></Q>
<HI>ait Lucanus; de Britannis Tacitus, Neque enim Sexum in imperio discernunt.</HI> But look a little farther, and you will find the reason of the difference be∣between them: <HI>At ea Regna quae populi libero consensu facta sunt haereditaria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">§ 14.</NOTE> <HI>ex praesumbia populi voluntate deferuntur. Praesumitur autem populus id voluisse quod maxime expedit</HI>: And of this you may see he giveth divers Examples, which we need not particularly recite: But this much is apparent, that <HI>Patrimonial Kingdoms</HI> are divisible among all the Children, because they are supposed to be wholly in the Father's Power, either by <HI>Conquest,</HI> or the <HI>first Plantation</HI> of them: But Hereditary ones that descend to the Eldest Son, can only become so, by the free Con∣sent of the People by whom they were Instituted; and therefore both <HI>Ishmael,</HI> and <HI>Esau,</HI> whose Territories were wholly Patrimonial, might very well divide them alike, amongst all their Sons; but then your <HI>Natural Right</HI> of <HI>Primogeniture</HI> is quite destroyed. The like may be said of other Kingdoms, where this Custom took place: And therefore those places which you have cited out of the Greek and Roman Authors of the Succes∣sion of the Eldest Son to be by the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> is to be understood ac∣cording to the sense of those Authors, who often confounded the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> or <HI>Reason,</HI> properly so called, with those commonly used, or recei∣ved Customs among Civilized People; which they called the <HI>Law of Na∣tions,</HI> which yet were not Laws properly so called, since they may without any transgression of the <HI>Law of Nature</HI> be practised different ways.</P>
<P>And therefore, tho' I allow <HI>Primogeniture,</HI> as well in Families, as King∣doms, to have had a just Preheminence by the Practice of many Civilized Nations, and look upon it as an excellent sort of Natural Lot (where the Elder Brother is fit to Govern) that he should succeed before the Younger, to avoid Strife among such Relations, and Civil Wars in Kingdoms: Yet that this is still to be understood, according to the Custom of the Country, or Will of the People, that Instituted the Monarchy, I desire to go no farther, than that Example that you have but now brought of <HI>Artabazanes,</HI> who was the Eldest Son of <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> but born before he was King, and <HI>Xerxes</HI> his Younger Son, but born after his obtaining the Crown; the matter be∣ing referred to the People, they determined it in favour of <HI>Xerxes</HI>; as you will find in <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Iustin,</HI> whom you have but now quoted. And tho' I grant, that when afterwards in the same Kingdom the like Contro∣versie was started between <HI>Cyrus</HI> and <HI>Arsicas</HI> (who was afterwards called <HI>Artaxerxes Mnemon</HI>) i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was judged just the quite contrary way, whether by Right, or Favour, I will not determine; yet this may let you plainly see, that this Antient, and Wise Nation, had no settled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw, either Natural, or Municipal concerning this matter. I could give you several other Instances of the same kind, which you may consult at your leisure in <HI>Grotius,</HI> and other Authors; only this much may be certainly gathered from what your self, as well as I have said concerning it, that there is no certain Rule, or Law, either of Nature, or Nations concerning this matter: And therefore your Instances of the Sons of <HI>Esau,</HI> and <HI>Ishmael,</HI> are so far from making out your Hypothesis, that if their Fathers could divide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Kingdoms into as many parts as they had Sons, without any Subjection to the Elder Brother,
<PB N="86" REF="54"/>
I can see no reason why every one of their Children, or Descendants, might not have done the like if they had pleased, till their Principalities had be∣come as small, as those of the Princes <HI>Ashalt,</HI> or Dukes of <HI>Saxony</HI> are at this day; so that I cannot see, to what purpose you have brought these last In∣stances out of Scripture, unless it were to make against your self, and to prove, that there were then, as there are now in the World, a sort of Prin∣ces, who may be lawfully so, without claiming any Title from <HI>Adam,</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> much less by any <HI>Right of Primogeniture.</HI></P>

<P>It is sufficient for my purpose to be able to shew you from these Examples of the Sons of <HI>Esau,</HI> and <HI>Ishmael,</HI> that as well Hereditary as Testa∣mentary Kingdoms, did Antiently commence according to the Law, or received Custom amongst Nations without any consent of the People, or Descendants of those that were to be Governed by them, and as long as the Succession to such Kingdoms were by any certain, or known Rule constantly practised among Mankind, the matter is not much whether the Eldest Son succeed to his Father alone, or that his Brethren shared with him in the Inheritance. For since it was God's will to institute Civil Government amongst Mankind, it must be also his Will to make the Suc∣cession to it clear, and certain to all the Subjects that were to submit to it, as he hath done, whether one Brother or many succeed, since the Will of the Father is as certain a Rule of Succession, as that by Inheritance and therefore what you have said in answer to my last instances of the Sons of <HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Israel</HI> signifies not much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not then deny, but grant at your last meeting, that Fami∣lies might at first grow up into Kingdoms, but yet I do still (as I did then) assert that such Governments could not be instituted by any Father, or Grand-Father alone, without the express or tacit consent of his Children and Descendants, supposing them once Married and separated from their Fathers or Ancestors Families; but it is needless to repeat what I then said only, give me leave to mind you, that at the beginning of this Discourse, you maintain'd that not only Kingly Power in General, but also the suc∣cession to it by the Eldest Son, or his next Brother is of Divine Right or Institution, or else all that you urged concerning the Natural right of Do∣minion of <HI>Cain</HI> over <HI>Abel</HI> was to no purpose; But now you insist that succession by a Testament, or Will of the Father, is also as much by the Law of Nature as the other, in which I think you are very much mistaken, since the right of bequeathing Kingdoms, or any thing else by Testament is neither prescribed by the Revealed Will of God, nor the Laws of Nature, since all setled Property in Lands or Goods, before the institution of a Civil Government, proceeding only from occupancy or possession, must cease in the State of Nature, with the life of the occupant or possessor. Therefore in that state a Testament cannot take place by the Testators Death; since as soon as he Dyeth, his right in the thing bequeathed is quite lost and extinguished; so that the Dead not having an interest in any thing, the Legatee cannot sustain the person of the Testator, whose Right ceases before that of the Legate can take place? And there∣fore the Testament or Disposition of such things, may then without any Crime be neglected or altered by the Survivors, unless all those who pretend an interest in it do agree to it, or swear to see it fulfilled,
<PB N="87" REF="54"/>
during the Testators Life time: And for this cause we find <HI>Abraham</HI> binding his Servant that ruled over his House with an Oath not to take a Wife for his Son of the Daughters of the Land;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 24.2, 3.</NOTE> And <HI>Iacob</HI> taking an Oath of <HI>Ioseph,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 49.29.</NOTE> not to bury him in <HI>Egypt,</HI> because they doubted whether they could ob∣lige their Sons or Servants to do it by their Testaments; So that it appears evident to me that the Power of making Testaments, and bequeathing Lands or Goods, is but a consequence of that Propriety, in Lands, Goods, or Domi∣nions, which arises from compact or common consent in a Kingdom or Common-wealth, after it is instituted as I think I am able to prove whenever you please to discourse with me farther about it. But as for the Right of be∣queathing Crowns or Kingdoms by Testament, as I will not deny, but that some Kingdoms may have been bequeathable by their Original Constitution, and others become so by Custom, yet I cannot grant that this Right belonged to the Prince or Monarch by the Laws of God or Nature; but proceeded p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rely from the received Law or continued Custom of that Kingdom, so that you must either confess, that there is no such thing as a Divine Right of Succession, or else it is such a one as signifies as much as nothing, since hu∣mane Laws or Constitutions can alter it or take it away. So that after all this Pother about this Divine Right, it is not so good as an old Estate Tayle, which formerly no fine could bar; And I must farther tell you, that I can∣not assent to your opinion, that succession by a Will or a Testament is so certain as that by Inheritance, since all such Testaments must depend upon the Credit of the Witnesses, whose Credit may often be questioned by the Subjects, and who may very well for their own ends make a Younger Son to have the whole, or at least a share in the Kingdom to whom his Father never intended any; and which was likewise more easie to be done before such time as Written Wills or Testaments, solemnly published accord∣ing to forms of Law, came in use.</P>
<P>But because you suppose that the Natural Laws of Succession to King∣doms are so plain and certain, that I may a little convince you of your mistake in this matter, I shall for the present suppose that the Succession of an Elder Son or Brother is sufficiently easie to be known; Yet I doubt it will not prove so in many other Instances; And therefore to let you see, I do not make this Scruple without cause, suppose <HI>Abel</HI> (for example) to have left a Son or a Daughter behind him, when his Brother murdered him, pray tell me who was to succeed after the Death of <HI>Adam,</HI> this Son or Daughter of <HI>Abel,</HI> or <HI>Seth</HI> their Uncle?</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt the place of Scripture you have cited doth not reach this Case of Kingdoms, for first this being a Municipal Law of the <HI>Iews,</HI> could only concern that Common-Wealth; and secondly, it only relates to Private Inheritances: and that this is so, may be proved from the next verse, where it is said, that a Mans Brethren shall be his Heirs, that is, all of them were to be Heirs alike, only the Eldest was to have a double por∣tion; And if this Law concerning Daughters were to reach the Succession of Kingdoms at this day, the Laws of <HI>France</HI> and other Countries, where Women are barred from succeeding to the Crown, would be against the Laws of God and Nature: And the like may also be said concerning the Succession of the Nephews before their Uncles, or of Uncles rather than the Nephews, whose Fathers never injoyed the Crown; diverse Nati∣ons having different Customs, and that with a like appearance of reason concerning it. For on the one hand, if the Son of <HI>Abel</HI> might have plead∣ed, that he was the first born of the Eldest Son of <HI>Adam,</HI> and so ought to represent his Father; <HI>Seth</HI> the Uncle might likewise with as good reason urge, that he was more nearly related in Bloud to <HI>Adam,</HI> as being his Son, than the Son of <HI>Abel</HI> who was but his Grandson, and besides being older than he, was endued with more Wisdom and Experience, and consequent∣ly was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itter to Govern; But if <HI>Abel</HI> left only one Daughter or more, I doubt not, but the question would have been harder to be decided, since if Women are not permitted to Govern in Private Families, they will not (especially amongst Warlike Nations) be admitted to Govern Kingdoms, especially since it would be left in her Power, not only to govern her self, but by marrying to chuse a King for her Subjects, whom they do not ap∣prove of. And therefore we read that in diverse of the Antient Kingdoms of the World, Women were excluded from the Succession.</P>
<P>Nor are these the only questions, that either might then, or else have in latter Ages been started concerning Succession in Kingdoms,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>TT. G. c.</HI> 11. p. 157, 158.</NOTE> and Principalities, and have been the cause of great disputes between Pretenders to Crowns, where a King Dies without Lawful Issue, as whether a Grandson by a Younger Daugh∣ter, shall inherit before a Grand-daughter by an Elder Daughter? Whe∣ther the Elder Son by a Concubine before the Younger Son by a Wife? From whence also will arise many Questions concerning Legitimation, and what by the Laws of Nature is the difference betwixt a Wife and a Concubine? All which can no ways be decided but by the Municipal or Positive Laws of those Kingdoms or Principalities. It may further be en∣quired whether the eldest Son being a Fool or Madman, shall inherit this Paternal Power before the Younger a Wise Man? And what degree of
<PB N="89" REF="55"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olly or madness it must be, that shall exclude him? and who shall be the Judges of it? Also whether the Son of a Fool so excluded for his Folly shall succeed before the Son of his Wiser Brother who last Reigned? Who shall have the regal Power whilst a Widdow Queen is with Child by the Deceased King, until she be brought to Bed? These and many more such difficulties might be proposed about the Title of Succession, and the Right of Inheritance to Kingdoms, and that not as idle speculations, but such as in History we shall frequently find examples of, not only in our own, but likewise other Kingdoms. From all which we may gather, that if the Laws of God or Nature had prescribed any set rules of Succession, they would have gone farther than one or two cases; as concerning the Succession of Elder Sons or Brothers, where an Elder Son dies without Issue; and would also have given certain infallible rules in all other Cases of Succession, besides these, and not have left it to the Will, or particular Laws of diverse Nations, to have established the succession so many seve∣ral ways, as I am able to shew have been practised in the World.</P>

<P>I must confess you have taken a great deal of pains to perplex the Succession to <HI>Adam,</HI> which seems designed for nothing else, but to make me believe, that if <HI>Adam,</HI> or any of his Sons were Kings or Princes, it must have been by the <HI>Consent,</HI> or <HI>Election</HI> of their Children, or Descendants: which is all one as to say that those Antient Princes derived their Titles from the <HI>Iudgment</HI> or <HI>Consent</HI> of the People, the <HI>contrary</HI> to which is evident as well out of <HI>Sacred</HI> as <HI>Civil</HI> History.</P>

<P>Since you appeal to History, to History you shall go, and to let you see, that I have not invented these doubts about Succession of my own Head, and that there might have very well been a real dispute about the Succession to <HI>Adam</HI> in the Cases I have put, may appear by the many dis∣putes and quarrels, that have been in several Nations concerning the Right of Succession between the Uncle and the Nephew, of which <HI>Grotius</HI> is so sensible,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. I. P. L.</HI> 11. <HI>c.</HI> 7. § 30, 31.</NOTE> that he confesses in the latter end of the Chapter last cited, that where it could not be decided by the <HI>Peoples Iudgment,</HI> it was fain to be so by <HI>Civil Wars,</HI> as well as private Combats, and therefore he is forced inge∣nuously to confess, that this hath been practised divers ways according to the different Laws and Customs of Nations: and he gives us here a distin∣ction between a direct Lineal Succession and a transversed; and acknow∣ledges that amongst the <HI>Germans,</HI> as also the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandales,</HI> Nephews were not admitted to the Succession of the Crown before their Uncles; the like may be said of the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> and therefore we find in our Antient English History, that before the Conquest the Uncle, if he were Older, always enjoyed the Crown before the Nephew, which I can more particularly shew you if you think fit to question it. The like manner of succession was also amongst the <HI>Irish-Scotch</HI> for above 200 years after <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rgus</HI> their first King. The like Custom was also observed among the <HI>Irish</HI> as long as they had any Kings amongst them, and is called the Law of <HI>Tanistry.</HI> The same was also observed in the Kingdom of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astile,</HI> where after the death of <HI>Alphonso</HI> the fifth, the States of that Kingdom, admitted his Younger Son <HI>Sancho</HI> to be King, putting by <HI>Ferdinand de la Cerda</HI> the
<PB N="90" REF="56"/>
Grand-Son to the late King by his Eldest Son, tho' he had the Crown left him by his Grand-Father's Will. So likewise in <HI>Sicily</HI> upon the Death of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, who left a Grand Son behind him by his Eldest Son, as also a Younger Son named <HI>Robert</HI>▪ between whom a difference arising concerning the Succession, it being referred to Pope <HI>Clement</HI> V. He gave Judgment for <HI>Robert</HI> the Younger Son of <HI>Charles,</HI> who was thereupon Crowned King of <HI>Sicily</HI>; and for this reason it was that Earl <HI>Iohn</HI> Brother to King <HI>Richard</HI> the second was declared King of <HI>England</HI> by the Estates, be∣fore <HI>Arthur</HI> Earl of <HI>Brittain</HI> Son of <HI>Ieoffrey</HI> the Elder Brother, and <HI>Glanvil,</HI> who was Lord Chief Justice under <HI>Henry</HI> the second, in that little Treatise we have of his, makes it a great question who should be preferred to an Inheritance, the Uncle or Nephew.</P>
<P>But as for Daughters, whether they shall inherit at all or not, or at least be preferred before their Uncles is much more doubtfull, since not only <HI>France,</HI> but most of the Kingdoms of the East at this day, from <HI>Turkey</HI> to <HI>Iapan</HI> do exclude Women from the Throne: And it was likewise as much against the Grain of the Antient Northern Nations, and hence it is that we find no mention of any Queen to have reigned amongst the Antient <HI>Germans,</HI> or <HI>Irish-Scots,</HI> and never but two among the <HI>English-Saxons,</HI> and those by <HI>Murder</HI> or <HI>Usurpation,</HI> and not by <HI>Election</HI> as they ought to have done. And upon this Ground it was that the Nobility and People of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> put by <HI>Maud</HI> the Emperess, and preferred <HI>Stephen</HI> Earl of <HI>Blois</HI> to the Crown before her, for tho' he derived his affinity to the Crown by a Wo∣man; yet as being a Man he thought himself to be preferred before her. So likewise in the Kingdom of <HI>Aragon, Mariana</HI> in his History tells us that Antiently the Brother of the King was to inherit before the Daughter, ex∣amples may also be given of divers of the other instances, but these may suffice.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Pray give me leave to interrupt you a little, for by these ex∣amples you would seem to infer, that these Laws about setling the succes∣sion of Crowns in several Kingdoms depended upon the Will of the People, whereas I may with better reason suppose, that if such Laws and Altera∣tions have been in such successions they were made by the sole Will of the first Princes, in which the People had no hand, for in the most Antient Monarchies,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P.</HI> § 71.</NOTE> there was a time, when the People of all Countreys were Governed by the Sole Wills of their Princes, which by degrees came to be so well known in se∣veral instances, that inferior Magistrates needed not resort to them in those cases, and the People being for a considerable time accustomed to such Usages, they grew easie and Familiar to them, and so were retained, tho the Memory of those Princes, who first introduced them was lost, and after Kings, finding it better to continue what was so received, than to run the hazard and trouble of changing them, were for their own ease, and the good of their Subjects contented they should be still from Age to Age so continued. Which custom may hold as well in Laws about Successi∣on as other things: And therefore we find that even in those Monarchies, where the People have nothing to do in making Laws Women are exclud∣ed, which could proceed at first from nothing else, but the declared Will
<PB N="91" REF="56"/>
or Law of the first Monarchs. So likewise the Original of the <HI>Salique</HI> Law is wholly ascribed to <HI>Pharamond</HI> the first <HI>French</HI> King, and <HI>Mariana</HI> (whom you lately cited) tells us that <HI>Alphonso</HI> King of <HI>Arragon</HI> made a Law, that where Heirs Male were wanting, the Sons of a Daughter should be pre∣ferred before the Aunt, which Law is wholly attributed to the King, for he adds presently after, <HI>Sic saepe ad Regum arbitrium jura regnandi commu∣tantur.</HI></P>

<P>Granting all this true that you have said, you cannot but confess that the Laws of God and Nature have established nothing in this matter, or else it could not be in the Power of Kings to make or alter Laws concern∣ing the succession, as your last Quotation intimates they may; yet even in the most absolute Monarchies, the <HI>Laws</HI> about the <HI>Succession</HI> of the Crown, must wholly depend upon the <HI>Consent</HI> of the People, who are to see them observed, or else every Monarch might alter these Laws of Succession at his pleasure, and the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> or King of <HI>France</HI> (now the Assembly of Estates is lost) might leave the Crown to a Daughter if either of them pleased, and disinherit the next Heir Male.</P>
<P>But as for the Original of this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alique</HI> Law in <HI>France,</HI> you'l find your self much mistaken if you suppose that that Law was made by the Sole Authority of <HI>Pharamond,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Hotoman Franco-Gallia. cap.</HI> 1.</NOTE> for the An∣tient <HI>French</HI> Histories tell us that the Body of <HI>Salique Laws</HI> which are now extant, were made by the <HI>Common Consent</HI> of the whole Nation of the <HI>Francs,</HI> who commit∣ted the drawing of them up to three Judges or Commissioners, and which Laws <HI>Pharamond</HI> did only confirm; and any one that will but consult those Histories may see, that Kings were so far from having the <HI>Sole Legislative</HI> Power in their own hand, that they were frequently <HI>Elected</HI> by the <HI>Estates,</HI> nor is it truer that you suppose from <HI>Mariana,</HI> that the Kings of <HI>Arragon</HI> had <HI>Power alone</HI> to make Laws, it appears quite contrary from the Con∣stitutions of that Kingdom▪ where the King could do nothing of this kind without the <HI>Consent</HI> of the <HI>Estates,</HI> and was not admitted to the Crown without taking an Oath to the Chief Justice in the <HI>name</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> that he would observe the Laws and Constitutions of the Kingdom, otherwise that they would not be <HI>obliged</HI> to obey him.</P>
<P>But at once to let you see, that about the Succession of the Sons or Descen∣dants by Daughters, the Cases are much more nice and intri∣cate, and that when such Cases happen in <HI>limited Monar∣chies</HI> where there is an <HI>Assembly</HI> of <HI>Estates,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.

<PB N="92" REF="57"/>
being deposed, <HI>Bruce</HI> revived his Title, and the States of <HI>Scotland</HI> de∣clared him King, whose Posterity enjoy it at this day.</P>
<P>A like Case happened in the last Age in <HI>Portugal,</HI> after the Death of <HI>Henry,</HI> surnamed the <HI>Cardinal</HI> without Issue, when no less than four Eminent Competitors, put in their Claim; some claiming from the Daughters of <HI>Don Durate,</HI> youngest Brother to the last King <HI>Henry</HI>: But the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and other Princes as Sons to the Sisters of the said King; <HI>Henry</HI> dying without Issue,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Marian Hist. Hisp.</HI></NOTE> left ten Governours over the Kingdom to decide together with the Estates the Diffe∣rences about the Succession, who quarrelling among themselves, as also with the Estates before it was decided, <HI>Philip</HI> the second King of <HI>Spain</HI> raised an Army, and soon conquered <HI>Portugal</HI>: And yet we have seen in his Grand son's time, that the Estates of <HI>Portugal</HI> de∣clared this Title void, and the Crown was settled in the Posterity of the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> who still enjoy it.</P>
<P>And how much even Kings themselves have attributed to the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Estates</HI> in this matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.N.M.

<P>I shall not trouble my self to determine how far Princes may tye up their own hands in this matter of the Succession, and leave it to the <HI>States</HI> of the Kingdom to <HI>limit,</HI> or determine of it, but from the begin∣ning it was not so; and therefore give me leave to trace this Paternal Government a little farther:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F.

<P>I pray give me leave to interrupt you a little, for I have a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal to say against your Notion of the Government of the <HI>Israelites</HI> before they had Kings actually nominated by God; for notwithstanding all you have said, it doth not appear to me that either <HI>Moses, Ioshuah,</HI> or the Judges, were any more than figuratively, or in a larger sense to be stiled Kings: For as for <HI>Moses</HI> his being called King in <HI>Ieshurun,</HI> he only calls himself so Poetically, in that excellent Hymn of Blessing, which he bestoweth upon the Twelve Tribes: For certainly God did not suppose him to have been a King, when in <HI>Deut.</HI> 17.14. he speaks of the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> setting a King over them, as a thing that was to happen many years after, and there lays down Rules how he should Govern himself, which had been needless if they had had a King already: And that <HI>Moses</HI> was not a King, <HI>Iosephus</HI> himself shews us in his Antiquities, <HI>Lib.</HI> 4. where he makes <HI>Moses</HI> to have instructed the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> at the time of his Death to this purpose; <HI>Aristocracy is the best Form of Government, and the life that is led under it the most happy, and therefore let not the desire of any other sort of Government take Possession of you, owning no other</HI> Master <HI>than the</HI> Laws, <HI>and doing every thing according to it.</HI> For God is your King, and that is sufficient for you; and if <HI>Moses</HI> was no King, then certainly <HI>Ioshua</HI> was none neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray give me leave to answer, what you have now said against the Kingly Power of <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Ioshua</HI>; for if you will please to remember,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P.</HI> § 36.</NOTE> that tho' the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> had been constituted before this time, yet <HI>Moses</HI> esteemed them as Sheep without a Shepherd, if a Man was not set over them which might go out before them, and which might lead them out, and bring them in; and God approved his desires, and appointed <HI>Ioshua</HI> to succeed him, and the People received him accordingly, and told him; <HI>All that thou commandest us we will do and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iosh.</HI> 1.16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>according as we hearkened unto</HI> Moses <HI>in all things, so will we hearken unto thee.</HI> If this were not Kingly Power, then is there no such thing. So that this Discourse which <HI>Iosephus</HI> puts into <HI>Moses</HI> his Mouth, seems directly contrary to <HI>Moses</HI> his Thoughts, and Pra∣ctice. And whereas he makes <HI>Moses</HI> to have opposed Obedience to the Laws to Kingly Government, it is a pure <HI>Greek Notion</HI>: For whilst the <HI>Grecians</HI> lived under Kings, they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew, or no Laws; but when they set up Common-Wealths, they then found the necessity of having Laws, and then the <HI>Dominion</HI> of <HI>Laws</HI> was opposed to the <HI>Government</HI> of Princes: But this was contrary to the Practice of <HI>Israel</HI>; for they were to live ac∣cording to their Laws as well under Kings as without them, in all Estates and Conditions; and their <HI>Kings</HI> were <HI>bound</HI> to Govern them by the <HI>Law,</HI> and not by their <HI>Wills contrary</HI> to the <HI>Law.</HI> So that in this <HI>Iosephus</HI> clearly made the Antient Customs of his Country to comply with a Greek Notion that had no being for some hundreds of years after <HI>Moses</HI> was dead.</P>
<P>And as for the time of the Judges, even in the Intervals between them,
<PB N="94" REF="58"/>
when every one did that which was right in his own Eyes, even then the <HI>Israelites</HI> were under the Kingly Government of the Fathers of the particu∣lar Families over whom the Prince, or Head of it had likewise a Supreme Power.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray give me leave to speak a little farther; Let me ask you, what is an <HI>Aristocrac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> if this be not? (<HI>viz.</HI>) an Assembly of the Elders, or Chief Fathers of Families of each Tribe meeting, consulting, and resolving of the Publick Affairs of the Common-Wealth, under their Head or President the Chief of the Tribe; and this is the Government for which <HI>Iosephus</HI> makes <HI>Samuel</HI> so much afflicted, when the People would quit it for a Monarchy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you are much mistaken in this Point, for it is no where de∣clared that these Fathers of Families Governed their own Families inde∣pendently; for then there would have been no Publick Government at all: Nor yet is it said, that these Fathers Governed by Majo∣rity of Voices chosen out of themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P.</HI> § 31.</NOTE> for then I grant it would have been a <HI>Democracy</HI>; nor yet doth it appear, that a few of the better sort of Fathers of every Tribe Governed it by a Counsel, and Magistrates, or that there was such Counsel of the several Tribes; but on the contrary, every Tribe was Governed by the Prince, or Head of it; and these Princes <HI>Moses</HI> calls <HI>the Heads of the House of their Fa∣thers,</HI> in <HI>Numb.</HI> 7.2. and who were over those that were numbered and made their Offerings. And <HI>Moses</HI> tells us particularly what every Man's Name was;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V.</HI> 12.18.</NOTE> as Nashon <HI>the Son of</HI> Ami∣nadab <HI>of the Tribe of</HI> Judah, <HI>and</HI> Nathaniel <HI>the Son of</HI> Zuar, <HI>Prince of</HI> Issachar, &amp;c. Now if there was in those days any Government at all in <HI>Israel,</HI> then were these Princes the Governours of the several Tribes, and so every Tribe was under a Monarch, tho' the whole State of <HI>Israel</HI> was not under any one Person, or constant standing Council, and consequently was a System of little Monarchies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not at all better satisfied with your last Reply; For in the first place I have <HI>Iosephus</HI> on my side, who must needs know what the Go∣vernment of his Country had been, better than you or <HI>I</HI>; and he expresly calls it an <HI>Aristocracy,</HI> in which the Judge (when there was one) was only in the nature of a General, or Statholder, to whom the last Appeal was to be made in all Causes; and it is also as plain, that neither <HI>Moses, Ioshua,</HI> nor the Judges had <HI>Monarchical Authority</HI>: F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r tho' it be true, the two first could make <HI>War,</HI> and <HI>Peace,</HI> yet this was also with the <HI>Consent</HI> of the <HI>Princes</HI> of the Congregation, as plainly appears by the Story of the Peace made with the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> which <HI>the Princes of the Congregation con∣firmed by an Oath:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iosh.</HI> 9.</NOTE> Neither could they raise <HI>Taxes</HI> upon the People, or take any thing from them <HI>without their Consent</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.3.</NOTE> and therefore <HI>Samuel</HI> appeals to them how little he had opprest them, whose Ox or whose Ass have I taken? whom have I defrauded? whom have I opprest? Neither could they, nor the Judges their Successors, make any <HI>new Laws</HI> for the People; God himself being their King, and Legislator; and therefore what you urge as to the Regal Power of <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Ioshua,</HI> after the <HI>Sanhedrin</HI> had been constituted, amounts to no more, but that both of them were Heads, or
<PB N="95" REF="58"/>
Captains of the People, to lead them out to War, and bring them back again, which is exprest by going in and out before them, and their Obedience to their Military Orders, as also to such things, which God hath expresly com∣manded, is understood by these words; <HI>All that thou commandest us, we will do; and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go:</HI> Yet still this was with respect to their obtaining the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> for otherwise if either <HI>Moses,</HI> or <HI>Ioshua</HI> should have gone about of their own Heads to have Led them again into <HI>Egypt,</HI> I suppose you will not say, the <HI>Israelites</HI> were bound either to have followed them, or submitted to them; but rather might have resisted them in such cases.</P>
<P>And therefore <HI>Iosephus</HI> his Speech which he makes <HI>Moses</HI> to deliver, is not so ridiculous as you are pleased to make it; for the Laws here mentioned by him, and here set in opposition to Monarchy, were not such Laws, as were made by the <HI>Greek</HI> Common-Wealth, as you suppose, but the Law given from God by his hand, and these he might well think were sufficient with such Power, as he and <HI>Ioshua</HI> enjoyed, without having any recourse to a Human Monarchical Government, since God himself was their King; and as for the Judges that succeeded them, they had much less Power, than ei∣ther <HI>Moses,</HI> or <HI>Ioshua:</HI> Since it is apparent by the Story of <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Ba∣rak, Iudges</HI> the 4th, who were the Princes or Generals of the Tribes of <HI>Ze∣bulun,</HI> and <HI>Naphtali,</HI> that they had no power to force the People to go out to fight against the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> whether they would, or no. And therefore you will find in the next Chapter, in the Song of Victory, which they sung, that many of the Tribes came not in to their Assistance; therefore it is there said, <HI>That for the Divisions of</HI> Reuben <HI>there were great thoughts of heart</HI>; therefore they ask, <HI>Why abidest thou among the Sheepfolds,</HI> &amp;c. And presently after it is said, Gilead <HI>abode beyond</HI> Jordan: <HI>and why did</HI> Dan <HI>remain in the Ships</HI>? Asher <HI>continued on the Seashore, and abode in his breaches.</HI> And so they conclude with <HI>Curse ye</HI> Meroz, <HI>curse ye bitterly the Inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the help of the Lord against the Mighty.</HI> So that I am perswaded, it was the want of this Power in the Judges of making Laws, of imposing Tributes, or Taxes, and of forcing Men to serve in the Wars against their Enemies, (which they did before only as Volunteers,) that made the <HI>Israe∣lites</HI> the more desirous to have a King over them, like those of other Na∣tions, who were endued with these Prerogatives. And therefore the best Commentators do interpret the Prediction of <HI>Samuel</HI> con∣cerning <HI>the manner of the King,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 8 11, 12.</NOTE> <HI>that should Reign over them, and would take their Sons for his Chariots, and his Horse men, and to be Captains over thousands,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to relate to his Royal Power of enrolling, and making them serve in his Army,</HI> either as Officers, or Souldiers, and the taking of their Fields and their Vineyards, and the Tenth of their Seeds <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to give his Officers, and Servants; to signifie no more than his Power of imposing Publick Tribute, and Impositions on the People, to maintain his Royal Splendor, &amp; the Necessities of the State, as other Neighbouring-Kings were wont to do; all which they not being used to before, they should cry unto the Lord by reason of them as a great oppression: And that <HI>Saul,</HI> when he came to be King used this Prerogative of forcing the People to come, and serve in the War, in a higher manner than <HI>Samuel,</HI> or the Judges had done before, appears by the 11th Chapter of this Book, when <HI>Nahash</HI> the Ammo∣nite
<PB N="96" REF="59"/>
came to make War against <HI>Iabesh,</HI> Saul <HI>took a Yoke of Oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the Coasts of</HI> Israel <HI>by the hands of Messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after</HI> Saul, <HI>and after</HI> Samuel, <HI>so shall it be done unto his Oxen</HI>; and the fear of the Lord fell on the People, and they came out with one Consent.</P>
<P>And it seems evident to me that the <HI>Power</HI> which <HI>Samuel</HI>▪ had before the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> desired a King was not <HI>Monarchical,</HI> but mixt of <HI>Aristocracy</HI> and <HI>Monarchy</HI> together, in which <HI>Samuel</HI> as Judge had a Judi∣cial Authority, and likewise a Supream Military Power of leading them out to War against the Philistines and other Enemies, and yet notwith∣standing, the <HI>Supreme Power</HI> in all other things remained wholly in the <HI>Principal Heads</HI> or Fathers of the Tribes, which whether they were cho∣sen by the People, or enjoyed it by Right of Inheritance, I confess the Scripture is silent, and therefore I am not at all satisfied with your No∣tion, that the Government of these People when they had no Judges, con∣sisted of Twelve petty Monarchies, under the Heads or Princes of the Tribes, for there is no Authority in Scripture to countenance any such opinion, the place you bring for it out of the 1st and 7th of <HI>Numbers,</HI> not at all proving it. For tho' I grant, there were twelve Princes of the Tribes whose names are there set down, and who are called Heads of the Houses of their Fathers, yet is it no where said, that these were endued with Ci∣vil Power, or were Chief Rulers over the Tribes: for it is apparent all Civil Power remained then in <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> who under him decided all controversies: So that it is most natural to suppose that these Heads of the Tribes were not Civil Magistrates, but the Military Leaders or Captains of each Tribe, when they went out to War, and are the same who in this Chapter, are called the renowned of the Congregation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Heads of the Thousands of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>Nor doth it follow, that because there were such Officers in <HI>Moses</HI> his time, that they must continue the same after, under the Judges, so many Slaveries and oppressions that this People had undergone, or that if they did still continue, that their Power was Monarchical; or that they could do any thing without the consent of the Heads, or Fathers of Families, of each Tribe, in whom I suppose the Supream Authority was in the In∣tervals of the Judges; and therefore we find in the ninth of <HI>Iudges, that the men of</HI> Shechem, <HI>and all the House of</HI> Millo <HI>made</HI> Abimelech <HI>King,</HI> that is, not over all the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> but over <HI>Ephraim</HI> and half <HI>Manasses</HI> only, which is to be understood by <HI>Israel</HI> in this Chapter, where it is said <HI>v.</HI> 18. by <HI>Iotham</HI> the Son of <HI>Gideon</HI> speaking to the Men of <HI>Shechem, that they had made</HI> Abimelech <HI>the Son of a Maid Servant,</HI> King over the Men of <HI>Shechem,</HI> because he is your Brother.</P>
<P>So likewise after <HI>Abimelech</HI> was Dead, the Children of <HI>Ammon</HI> made War against the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> as appears by the 10th of Judges, and they encamped in <HI>Gilead,</HI> which was a Country on the other side of <HI>Iordan,</HI> which was inhabited by the <HI>Reubenites,</HI> the <HI>Gadites,</HI> and the other half of <HI>Manasses,</HI> who by themselves consulted for their own safety; for it is said in the last verse of this Chapter, <HI>And the People and Princes of</HI> Gilead <HI>said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the Children of</HI> Ammon? <HI>He shall be Head over all the Inhabitants of</HI> Gilead. From which
<PB N="97" REF="59"/>
assembly and consultation, it plainly appears that they looked upon them∣selves to have a Right of setting a Prince or Head over them, distinct from the rest of the Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI>; And in the next Chapter you will find that <HI>Iephtha</HI> was made Prince, or Judge by the Elders of <HI>Gilead,</HI> and tho' it is said that <HI>Iephtha</HI> went with the Elders of <HI>Gilead,</HI> and that the People made him Head and Captain over them, yet that cannot be meant of all <HI>Israel,</HI> but only of the two Tribes, and a half, which inhabited the Land of <HI>Gilead,</HI> for we find chapter the 12. the Men of <HI>Ephraim</HI> making War upon <HI>Iephtha,</HI> because he had not called them out to sight against the <HI>Am∣monites,</HI> and you will find verse the 4th. that <HI>Iephtha gathered together the Men of</HI> Gilead, <HI>and fought with</HI> Ephraim, <HI>and that the Men of</HI> Gilead <HI>smote</HI> Ephraim. In all which story it appears, there was none concerned in this War but the <HI>Gileadites</HI> only: that is, those Tribes that inhabited that Re∣gion.</P>
<P>I have likewise another Authority for this separate Power of each Tribe, when there was no common Judge over them, as may appear from the Story of the <HI>Danites</HI> in the 18th chapter, who wanting a Country to dwell in, <HI>it is there said the Children of</HI> Dan, <HI>sent five men of their Family to Spy out a Country for them</HI>; which thing could not be done, without an Assembly of the Chief of the whole Tribe: Neither is there any mention in all this Story of any such Chief or Prince of the Tribe, as you suppose, only that six hundred men went by common consent, who made War, and Conquered the City and Country of <HI>Laish,</HI> which they called <HI>Dan.</HI></P>
<P>But that all the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> during the Intervals of the Judges, did meet in one Common Council or Assembly, upon any great accident or emergency, appears by the twentieth Chapter of this Book of <HI>Iudges</HI>▪ where after the Rape and Murder committed upon the <HI>Levite</HI>'s Wife, it is said in the two first verses, <HI>Then all the Children of</HI> Israel <HI>went out, and the Congregation was gathered together as one man from</HI> Dan <HI>even to</HI> Beershebah, <HI>with the Land of</HI> Gilead, <HI>unto the Lord in</HI> Mizpeh. <HI>And the Chief of all the People, even of all the Tribes of</HI> Israel, <HI>presented themselves in the Assembly of the People of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew Sword</HI>: Who being thus met, the <HI>Levite, the Husband of the Woman that was slain,</HI> having told them the Story, <HI>concludes thus, Behold ye are all Children of</HI> Israel, <HI>give here your Advice and Counsel,</HI> and the result is, <HI>All the People arose as one Man, saying, We will not any of us go to his Tent, neither will we any of us turn into his House,</HI> &amp;c. Now if this were not as Democratical an Assembly, as you can any where meet with in either the <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> Hist. I leave it to you your self to Judge: tho' I grant the chief of the People, or Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> might preside in it. To conclude, I think I may with very great reason maintain with <HI>Iosephus,</HI> that the Government of the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> was Aristocratical before their setting a King over them: for had <HI>Samuel</HI> been endued with an absolute Monarchical power (as you suppose) it had been a very needless request of the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> to ask him to make them a King, to Judge them, as other Nations.</P>

<P>But I am less edified with your Notion, in making any of the Tribes to have set a Judge or Captain over themselves distinct from the rest of the Tribes of <HI>Israel.</HI> For the example you quote of <HI>Abimelech</HI> makes directly against you, it being said, verse the 22d of that Chapter, that <HI>Abi∣melech Reigned three Years over</HI> Israel, and in the next chapter it is said, there arose to defend <HI>Israel, Tola</HI> the Son of <HI>Puah,</HI> and that he Judged <HI>Israel,</HI> that is, all the twelve Tribes, twenty years; and if <HI>Gideon</HI> the Father of <HI>Abi∣melech</HI> was Judge over all <HI>Israel,</HI> as it appears by the Story he was, it will likewise follow, that <HI>Abimelech</HI> his Son succeeded (tho by Force and Mur∣der) into the same power. It is likewise as plain (notwithstanding what you have said to the contrary) that the Elders of <HI>Gilead</HI> did not alone make <HI>Iephtha</HI> their Head or Captain: For tho' I grant <HI>Jephthah</HI> tells them, that if he fought, and delivered them from the Children of <HI>Ammon,</HI> that he would be their Head; Yet it is plain by the 11th verse of that Chapter, that <HI>Jephthah went with the Elders of</HI> Gilead, <HI>and it was the People</HI> (viz. <HI>of all</HI> Israel) <HI>made him Head and Captain over them:</HI> and it appears that <HI>Jephthah uttered all these words before the Lord in</HI> Mizpeh, where it appears by the se∣venteenth verse of the former chapter, the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were then assembled and incamped.</P>
<P>Nor am I yet satisfied, but that tho' God out of a special love, and care to the House of <HI>Israel,</HI> did chuse to be their King himself, yet did he Go∣vern them at that time, by his Vice-Roy <HI>Samuel,</HI> and his Sons; And there∣fore God tells <HI>Samuel, They have not rejected thee, but me, that I should not reign over them</HI>; It seems they did not like a King by Deputation, but desired one by Succession, like all the Nations. All Nations belike had Kings then, and those by <HI>Inheritance,</HI> not by <HI>Election,</HI> for we do not find the Israelites Prayed that they themselves might chuse their own King; they dreamt of no such Liberty, and yet they were the Elders of <HI>Israel</HI> gathered together: If other Nations had elected their own Kings, no doubt but they would have been as desirous to have imitated other Nations as well in the electing, as in the having a King: And therefore I am sure there is nothing to be found in Scripture that Countenances your <HI>Notion</HI> of the Peoples having a <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>Elect</HI> their own King. But this only by the by.</P>

<P>I shall not dispute any farther with you (since I see it is to no pur∣pose) concerning the Government of the Israelites, whether it was Monar∣chical or Aristocratical before the Reign of <HI>Saul</HI>; nor yet shall I positively assert, that <HI>Abimelech</HI> or <HI>Jephthah</HI> and other of the Judges were Rulers of some particular Tribes only. Yet <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an. Marshami Chron. Can. Sect. XI. p.</HI> 291, 292, <HI>&amp;</HI> 293.</NOTE> very Learned Men are of this Opinion, since they can find no other way, but by a Synchronism in the times of the Judges, as also of the years of Rest, and Servitude, as may appear from <HI>Iudg.</HI> 10. <HI>v.</HI> 6, 8. compared with <HI>Iudg.</HI> 13.1. to reconcile that great Difference that will be found in the Sacred Chronology, from the time of the Children of <HI>Israel</HI>'s coming out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> to the fourth year of <HI>Solomon,</HI> in which the Temple was begun to be built, which doth amount to four hundred and eighty years;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Kings</HI> 6.1.</NOTE> whereas if you please to take the pains to cast up the years from the Children of <HI>Israel</HI>'s coming out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> to the beginning of <HI>Saul</HI>'s Reign, according to the common Account of the years of the Judges, reckoned with the Reigns of <HI>Saul,</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> to that time, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it will amount to 600 years, which is more by 120 years than all the time from the said <HI>Epocha</HI> to the fourth year of <HI>Solomon</HI> taken altogether.</P>
<P>But as for the several Tribes alone consulting and ordering their own af∣fairs, it is so plain from the Examples of the People, and Princes of <HI>Gilead,</HI> as also from that of the <HI>Danites,</HI> that you have nothing to object against it: And so likewise in the Instance of all the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> meeting, and consulting, what to do with the <HI>Benjamites,</HI> where since you cannot de∣ny the matter of Fact, you have no way to evade it, but by supposing I know not what Kingly Authority in the Fathers of particular Families, whom you do suppose to have then bore the only sway, because it is said in that Chapter you quoted, that in the consultation after this War, the Elders of the Congregation proposed it to them, saying; <HI>How shall we do for Wives for them that remain, seeing the Women, are destroyed out of</HI> Benjamin? And then follows the result of the Congregation in the next verse; And they said, <HI>(viz. all the Congregation agreed) that there must be an Inheritance for them that be escaped out of</HI> Benjamin, &amp;c. all which amounts to no more, than what I granted at first, that the Heads, or Elders of the Tribes presided in this Assembly, and put the question to them: Which is so necessary in all great Assemblies, that without such Officers they cannot come to any reso∣lution; and therefore you should do well to prove the Monarchical Power of these Elders by some better Authority than this Text.</P>
<P>But if the Judges had Monarchical Power as you suppose, notwithstanding
<PB N="100" REF="61"/>
all you have said, against the Peoples Electing them, it plainly appears by the Examples of <HI>Abimelech,</HI> and <HI>Iephthah,</HI> that the People did often Elect a Judge, or Captain over them, without any Nomination by, or Inspira∣tion from God.</P>
<P>But to return to that which is most material, your supposed Restauration of <HI>Patriarchal Government</HI> under <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Ioshua,</HI> after the <HI>Israelites</HI> re∣turned from the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Bondage, I cannot but here by the way take no∣tice, that the Truth will sometimes slip from you before you are aware; for if it be true what you at first asserted, at our last meeting, <HI>That a Ser∣vant, or Slave, and a Subject, were all one at the first; and also that all Monarchs are endued with Fatherly Power,</HI> then if <HI>Pharaoh</HI> was a Monarch, the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were not, according to your Principle, brought into Bondage by <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> but they <HI>were only Adopted into another Fatherly Power.</HI> But you should have done well to have shewn more clearly than you have hitherto done, that this <HI>Patriarchal Iurisdiction</HI> was exercised by <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> or <HI>Iacob</HI> before the Descent into <HI>Egypt,</HI> since all the Instances you have yet given of such a Power, have proved very unlucky: For tho' I read in St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Speech in the <HI>Acts,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts VII.</HI> 9.</NOTE> that <HI>the Patriarchs moved with Envy sold</HI> Joseph <HI>into</HI> Egypt; yet is it no where mentioned, (nor I believe will you your self affirm) that these Patriarchs ever had a <HI>Monarchical Power.</HI> For till <HI>Iacob</HI> went into <HI>Egypt,</HI> that Power was solely in him, according to your Principles, and after that in <HI>Pharaoh</HI> as King of <HI>Egypt</HI>: So that tho' I can find the word <HI>Patriarch</HI> (but once) in Scripture, yet I can see no ground for your <HI>Patriarchal Authority,</HI> or <HI>Iurisdiction</HI>; and therefore that could suffer no intermission, which never had any beginning in Nature.</P>
<P>But after this you tell me, that God chose <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Ioshua</HI> successively to Govern as Princes, in the place of those Supreme Fathers, or Patriarchs; which is easily, I confess, affirmed, only it wants proof. For tho' you endea∣vour to prove that all <HI>Paternal Power</HI> was Regal, yet it still remains unpro∣ved that all <HI>Regal Power</HI> is Paternal. It is true that God did appoint <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Ioshua,</HI> to be the Rulers of his People under him, but that doth not at all make out that they succeeded in the stead of Supreme Fathers, much less that they succeeded, as Heirs, or Successors to the <HI>Patriarchal Power</HI> of <HI>Adam.</HI> For <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Ioshua,</HI> being chosen by God to be Rulers of his People,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>TT. G. p.</HI> 201.</NOTE> will no more prove that Government be∣longed to <HI>Adam</HI>'s Heir, as to his Fatherhood, than God's chusing <HI>Aaron</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> to be Priest, will prove that the Priest∣hood belonged to <HI>Adam</HI>'s Heir, or the Prime Fathers, since God could chuse <HI>Aaron</HI> to be Priest, and <HI>Moses</HI> Ruler over <HI>Israel,</HI> tho' neither of those Offices, were settled on <HI>Adam</HI>'s Heir, or the first Patriarchs. So likewise for what you say concerning God's raising up the Judges to defend his People, proves <HI>Fatherly Authority</HI> to be the Original of Government just after the same rate; and cannot God raise up such men unless <HI>Paternal Power</HI> give a Title to the Government?</P>
<P>But to come to your darling Instance, the giving of the <HI>Israelites</HI> Kings, <HI>whereby you suppose God re establisht the Antient Prime Right of Lineal Succession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Paternal Government.</HI> This I can by no means understand; for if by Li∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l Succession you mean to <HI>Adam,</HI> I desire to know how you will make it
<PB N="101" REF="61"/>
out that either <HI>Saul,</HI> or <HI>David</HI> could be Heirs of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Power? or how the Power that those Kings were endued with by God, was the same Power, which <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob</HI> enjoyed before. For if you please to con∣sider it, your Hypothesis consists of two Propositions; the first is, that all <HI>Paternal Power</HI> is the same with <HI>Regal Power</HI>; which if it be proved not to be true, the other convertible Proposition (which is but the Conversion of this) will likewise be as false; <HI>viz.</HI> that all <HI>Regal Power</HI> is Paternal. Nor is what you said last of all any truer than the rest, that whensoever God made choice of any person to be King, he intended that the Issue (I suppose you mean his Issue) should have the benefit thereof: For either <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Io∣shua,</HI> and the Judges, were no Kings, (tho' you have asserted the former to be so) or else they had not the benefit of this Grant: But certainly <HI>Saul</HI> was a King, and yet his Issue never succeeded; but you speak very warily to sup∣pose this Grant to be made to the Issue in general, without specifying in particular, who should enjoy it, because I suppose you are sensible, that <HI>So∣lomon,</HI> whom God expresly appointed to be <HI>David</HI>'s Suc∣cessor, and <HI>Iehoahaz,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26.1.</NOTE> whom the People of the Land made King in the room of <HI>Iosiah,</HI> were neither of them Eldest Sons of the Kings their Fathers. To conclude, I desire you would shew me, what Relation or Title all Kings, or Princes now-a-days have, or can claim as Heirs to <HI>Adam,</HI> or <HI>Noah</HI>; or how that Power with which God endued those Fathers of Mankind, is the same which you say all Princes, or Monarchs, may now claim to be given them by God: For I confess I can see no likeness, or Relation at all between them.</P>

<P>It may indeed seem absurd to maintain, that Kings now are the Fathers of their People, since Experience shews the con∣trary. It is true,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F.</HI> P. § 8.</NOTE> all Kings are not the Natural Parents of their Subjects, yet they all either are, or are to be reputed the next Heirs to those first Progenitors, who were at first the Natural Pa∣rents of the whole People, and in their Right succeed to the exercise of Su∣preme Jurisdiction; and such Heirs are not only Lords of their own Chil∣dren, but also of their Brethren, and all others that were subject to their Fathers. And tho' I have all along supposed, that <HI>Paternal Government</HI> was at first <HI>Monarchical</HI>; yet I must likewise grant, that when the World was replenished with People, that this <HI>Paternal Government</HI> by <HI>Succession</HI> ceased,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. D. O. p.</HI> 67.</NOTE> and a new kind of it started up either by <HI>Election Conquest,</HI> or <HI>Usurpation</HI>; yet this was still <HI>Paternal Power,</HI> which can never be lost, or cease, tho' it may be transferred, or usurped; or it may be ordained a new in a person who otherwise had no Right to it before. Thus God, who is the Giver of all Power, may transfer it from the Father to the Son, as he gave <HI>Saul</HI> a Fatherly Power over his Father <HI>Kish.</HI></P>
<P>So that all Power on Earth is either derived,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 70.</NOTE> or usurped from the Fatherly Power, there being no Original to be found of any Power whatsoever; for if there should be granted two sorts of Power without any subordination of one to the other, they would be in perpetual strife, which should be Supreme for two Supremes cannot agree; if the Fatherly Power be Supreme, then the Power of the People must be subordinate, and depend on it; if the Power of the People be Supreme, then
<PB N="102" REF="62"/>
the Fatherly Power must submit to it, and cannot be exercised without the Licence of the People, which must quite destroy the frame and course of Nature.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this be all you have to say for the proof of so weighty an Hypo∣thesis, I confess I wonder how you, or any rational Man can lay so great stress upon it: For tho' I should grant you, that some Fathers of Families at first became by the tacit, or express <HI>Consent</HI> of their Children, and Descen∣dants, to be Kings, or Princes over them; doth it therefore follow that all Kings Govern by <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Fatherhood</HI> at this day?</P>
<P>'Tis true you tell me, that all Kings, <HI>tho they are not now the Natural Fathers of their People, Yet are still to be esteemed as such by them, as Succeeding either as Heirs, or Successors to those that were so.</HI> I grant indeed if any Kings now adays could prove themselves right Heirs to <HI>Adam,</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> this were somewhat to the purpose, but to talk of a Paternal Power proceeding from Election, Conquest, or Usurpation, is perfect <HI>Iargon</HI> to me; for pray tell me, can a Man become endued with Paternal Power over me, by my Electing him to be my King? or can a Man by Conquest, or Usurpation oblige me to yield him a Filial Duty, and Obedience? for if this were so, if a Father of a se∣parate Family (such as <HI>Abraham</HI> was) should be conquered by the head of another separate Family, nay tho he were a Thief, or a Robber, if once the true Father were Killed, or destroyed, all the Children, and Descendants of the Family must pay the same Duty, and Obedience, to this unjust Conquerour, or Robber, as to their true Father; and the same may be said in Usurpations, in case, after the death of such a Father of a Family, a Younger Brother or Nephew, should get possession of the House, and Estate, and force all his Brethren, and Kinsmen to Submit to him, they must then all own him to be endued by God with the same Paternal Power, which their Father, or Grand-father had; and consequently must Honour and Obey him as their true Father: Both which examples, being contrary to the Common sense, and reason of Mankind, may shew you, how absurd this <HI>Hypothesis</HI> is; whereas indeed Fatherhood being a Relation of Blood, and the Duty and Respect we owe to him, that is our Father, pro∣ceeding from that Piety, and Gratitude we owe him both for our <HI>Generation,</HI> and <HI>Education</HI>; how can this Relation, or these Obligations be ever trans∣ferred to, or usurped by any other, so that any other man can become my Father, or I owe him that Filial Duty, and Respect, as to him that begot me and brought me up?</P>
<P>And tho' I grant that God may confer a <HI>Regal Power</HI> on whom he pleases, either by his express Will, or the ordinary course of his Providence; yet when such a person who was not a King before, doth become so, I utterly deny that the Power he hath then conferred upon him, is a <HI>Paternal Power</HI> in relation to his Subjects; which is evident from your own Instance of <HI>Saul</HI>'s becoming a King over his Father <HI>Kish.</HI> For tho' you say <HI>that God then con∣ferred a Fatherly Power</HI> on <HI>Saul</HI> over his own Father, this is a great mistake: For then <HI>Saul</HI> would have been immediately discharged from all the Duties of Piety, and Gratitude, which he owed his Father; and they were all trans∣ferred from <HI>Kish</HI> to <HI>Saul</HI>; so that after he became King, he might have treat∣ed his Father with no more Respect, or Deference, than any other Subject; which is contrary to God's Commandment, that bids all Men, <HI>Honour their
<PB N="103" REF="62"/>
Father, and Mother.</HI> And I know not how Kings can be excepted out of this Precept. So that your mistake arises from this preposterous confound∣ing of <HI>Paternal Authority</HI> with <HI>Regal Power</HI>: And because <HI>Adam, Noah,</HI> or any other Father of a separate Family may be a Prince over it in the State of Nature, that therefore every Monarch in the World is also endued with this <HI>Paternal Power</HI>: Which that they are distinct may farther appear from your own supposed <HI>Monarchical Power</HI> of <HI>Adam,</HI> who tho' granting him to have been a Prince over his Posterity, yet did not this discharge any of his Descendants from their Duty and Obedience to their own Father: And tho' I confess you talked at our last meeting of a <HI>Fatherly Power</HI> to be exercised in subordination to the <HI>Supreme Fatherly Power</HI> of <HI>Adam</HI>; yet this is a meer <HI>Chimera</HI>: for <HI>Filial Honour,</HI> and <HI>Obedience,</HI> being due by the Commandment only to a Man's own Natural Father, can never be due to two different persons at once, since they may command contradictory things, and then the Commandment of <HI>Honour</HI> (that is, obey) <HI>thy Father,</HI> cannot be observed in respect of both of them; and therefore granting <HI>Adam,</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> to have exer∣cised a <HI>Monarchical Power</HI> over their Children, and Descendants, it could not be as they were Fathers, or Grand-fathers, when their Sons, or Grand-chil∣dren were separated from them, and were Heads of Families of their own, for the reasons already given; so that if they were Princes in their own Fa∣milies, whilst their Sons, or Grand-children continued part of them, it was only as Heads, or Masters of their own Families, but not by any such <HI>Patriar∣chal,</HI> or <HI>Paternal Authority</HI> as you suppose. But as for the Conclusion of your Discourse, it being all built upon this false Foundation, that all Power on Earth is derived, or usurped from the <HI>Fatherly Power</HI>; I need say no more to it: For if that be false, all that you argue from thence concerning the sub∣ordination of all other Powers to this, will signifie nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I can yet make out my <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> notwithstanding all you have said against it: For tho' I grant the <HI>Paternal Relation</HI> it self can never be usurped, or transferred; yet you may remember, I at first affirmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F.</HI> P. <HI>A.</HI> P.</NOTE> that <HI>Adam</HI> was not only a Father, but a King and Lord over his Family, and a Son, a Subject, a Servant, or a Slave, were one and the same thing at first; and the Father▪ had power to dispose of, sell, or Alien his Children to any other; whence we find the Sale, and Gift of Children, to have been much in use in the begin∣ning of the World, when Men had their Servants for a Possession, and an In∣heritance, as well as other goods; whereupon we find the Power of Ca∣strating or making <HI>Eunuchs</HI> much in use in old times. And as the Power of the Father may be lawfully transferred, or aliened; so it may be unjustly usurped. And tho' I confess no Father, or Master of a Family, ought to use his Children thus Cruelly, and Severely, and that he sins mortally if he doth so; yet neither they, nor any Power under Heaven can call such an <HI>Indepen∣dant Father,</HI> or <HI>Monarch</HI> to an account, or punish him for so doing.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad at last we are come to an Issue of this doughty con∣troversie, and tho I forced you at our last meeting to confess, that Fatherly Power was not despotical, nor that Fathers upon any <HI>account Whatsoever,</HI> were absolute Lords, over their Children and all their Descendants in the State of Nature: Yet now I see to preserve your <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> You are fain
<PB N="104" REF="63"/>
to recur to this Despotical Power of Fathers in the State of Nature: Because without supposing it, and that it may be transferred, or usurped, Princes at this day (whom without any cause you suppose to be endued with this Paternal, Despotick Power) could never claim any Title to their Subjects Allegiance. And then much good may do you with your, and Sr. <HI>R, F</HI>'s excellent discovery: For if, as you your self acknowledge, Princes are no longer related in Blood to their Subjects, any nearer than as we all proceed from <HI>Adam</HI> our Common Ancestor, that relation being now so remote, signifies little or nothing, so that the true Paternal Authority being lost (as you confess) the Despotick Power of a Lord over his Servants, or his Slaves only remains; since therefore you make no difference in Nature, between Subjects, and Slaves, then all Subjects Lye at the mercy of their Kings to be treated in all things like Slaves, when ever they please; And they may exercise an absolute Despotick Power over their Lives, and Estates as they think fit: So that I can see nothing that can hinder them from sel∣ling their Subjects, or castrating them as the King of <HI>Mingr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lia,</HI> doth his Subjects at this day; and as the <HI>Great Turk,</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> Monarchs do use those Christian Children whom they take away from their Parents to make <HI>Eunuchs</HI> for their <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raglio's,</HI> and then I think you have brought Mankind to a very fine pass to be all created for the <HI>Will,</HI> and <HI>Lust</HI> of so many <HI>single</HI> Men, which if it ever could be the <HI>Ordinance of God,</HI> I leave it to your self to judge.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was prepared for this objection before, and therefore I think it will make nothing against this <HI>Absolute Power,</HI> with which I suppose God to have endued <HI>Adam,</HI> and all other Monarchs at the first: So that I am so far from thinking that this Doctrine, will teach Princes Cruelty towards their Subjects, that on the contrary nothing can better incul∣cate their Duty towards them:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. C.</HI> P. § 3.</NOTE> For as God is the Au∣thor of a <HI>Paternal Monarchy</HI>; so he is the Author of no other. He introduced all but the first Man into the World, under the Subjection of a <HI>Supream Father,</HI> and by so doing hath shewn that he never intended there should be any other Power in the World, and whatever <HI>Authority</HI> shall be extended beyond this is accountable to him alone, so that Princes are bound to treat their Subjects as their Children with Mercy, and Lenity as far as they are capable of it, and not as their Brutes. And granting that Subjects and Servants or Slaves were at first all one, yet I think even they ought to be treated only as Younger Children, yet as Chil∣dren still: Nay even conquered People that are in some Countries treated as Slaves, and but a little better than brutes, have certainly a very good appeal to the Tribunal of God against their Princes, who will undoubt∣edly right them in another World if they suffer patiently in this. If it be the Character of a good Man that he is merciful to his Beast, I doubt not but the very Brutes have a Right to be Governed with mercy and Justice, and that God who is their Creator as well as ours will punish cruel men if they Tyrannize over them, and much more if any man shall exercise Cru∣elty on another man who is of the same, not only Nature, but Blood.</P>
<P>Whereas all other <HI>Hypotheses</HI> leave the Prince at Liberty to make his Bar∣gain with his Subjects, as well as he can; and if they be brought by force, or fraud, to an entire Submission at Discretion, they may then be treated
<PB N="105" REF="63"/>
accordingly, and must stand to their Compact, be the terms never so un∣equal, and then the Case of a Man, and a Brute, may differ very little; and if the Subject may resist, the Prince may take care to prevent it, and the War may be just on both sides, which is impossible.</P>
<P>I could likewise shew you many other Benefits that would accrew both to Princes, and Subjects, were this <HI>Hypothesis</HI> but once generally taught, and believed by both of them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray Sir, spare the giving your self that trouble, for I will not dispute how honestly this <HI>Hypothesis</HI> may be designed, or what mighty Fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s it might do, were it once universally received. But this neither you, nor I can ever expect will come to pass▪ because neither Princes, nor People will ever believe it to be true: For in the first place, the People will never be convinced of it, it being above a vulgar understanding, that their Princes whom they are very well assured are not their Fathers, nor yet right Heirs to <HI>Adam,</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> should notwithstanding lay claim to a <HI>Paternal Authority</HI> over them. In the next place, Princes can never believe that they are Fa∣thers of their People for the same Reason: I grant indeed, that they may be very willing to believe one half of your <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> that they are Absolute Lords, and Masters over them, and so would be willing upon that account, to use their Subjects like Slaves, but that they should look upon themselves as Fathers of their People, and the Heirs or Assigns of <HI>Adam,</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> I think no Prince in Christendom can be so vain to believe. So that what∣ever Power <HI>Adam,</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> or any other Father might be intrusted with by God, because of that Natural Affection which they were supposed to bear toward their Children; yet sure Princes at this day, can lay no claim to it, since none but true Fathers can be endued with this <HI>Paternal Affection.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas you suppose, that Princes ought to treat their Subjects, nay even those that are conquered like Children, and not like Slaves, or Brutes: This can have very little effect upon them, who can as little believe it, as the People, for if Monarchical Power is not Paternal (as I think I have clear∣ly made out) then there can lye no obligation upon Monarchs, to treat their Subjects like Children, and therefore Since the <HI>Despotical</HI> or <HI>Masterly Power</HI> only remains, which is ordained Principally for the good, and Be∣nefit of the Master, and not of the Servant, or Slave: Who can blame Princes, if they exact the utmost of their due Prerogatives, and so treat their Subjects like Slaves, whenever it serves their humour, or interest so to do; nor are they any more to be blamed for thus exerting their Power, than a Master of <HI>Negroes</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> is for making the best of the Service of those Slaves whom he hath bought with his Mony, or are born in his House: Whom tho I grant he is not to use like Brute Beasts, for the Reasons you have given: Yet doth it not therefore follow, that he is obliged to use them like his Younger Children; for then sure he could not have a Right to keep them for Slaves as long as they lived, &amp; to let them enjoy nothing but a bare miserable Subsistance; and there is very good reason for this, for almost every Planter in <HI>Barbadoes</HI> knows very well, the difference between the Rela∣tions of a Father, a Master, and a Prince, and that the one is not the other; and it is from your jumbling together these three different Relations of a Son, a Slave, and a Subject, that hath led you into all these mistakes. For tho' it should be granted, that the right of a Master over his Slaves, may
<PB N="106" REF="64"/>
be acquired by Conquest, or assigned to, or usurped by another; yet cer∣tainly the Authority, or Relation of a Father, and the Monarchical, or Civil Power of a Monarch can never be acquired by Conquest, nor yet usurped without the Consent, and Submission of the Children, and Subjects.</P>
<P>And therefore to conclude, I do not think your <HI>Hypothesis</HI> one jot the better, by your founding it upon an <HI>Imaginary Paternal Power,</HI> rather than upon <HI>Compact,</HI> which I am sure can never be made upon so unequal term<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as to render the Case of a Man, and a Brute, very little different; since it would be to no purpose for any Subject to make a Bargain with their Monarch, or Conqueror; and yet to leave themselves in as bad, or worse condition than they were in the State of Nature: So that however conve∣nient your <HI>Hypothesis</HI> may be either for Prince, or People, it signifies no more than the Popish <HI>Hypothesis</HI> of the <HI>Infallibility of the Pope,</HI> and <HI>General Council,</HI> which because they suppose necessary, and is indeed very beneficial for the Church; therefore God hath conferred it upon them: But how false a way of reasoning this is, hath been sufficiently demonstrated. The Application of this Comparison is so obvious, that I leave it to you to make.</P>

<P>I cannot but think, for all you have yet said, that God hath endued all Princes with a <HI>Paternal Authority,</HI> and for this, I have the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> on my side, which in its Catechism, in the Explanation of the Duties contained in the 5th Commandment, <HI>Honour thy Fa∣ther,</HI> &amp;c. doth comprehend under that Head,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. P.</HI> § 10. <HI>F. O. G. p</HI> 254.</NOTE> not only to <HI>Honour, and Succour our Fathers and Mothers, but also to Honour, and Obey the King, and all them that are put in Au∣thority under him</HI>; as if all Power were originally in the Father: So that this Command gives him the Right to Govern, and makes the Form of Go∣vernment Monarchical. And if Obedience to Parents be immediately due by a Natural Law; and Subjection to Princes but by the Mediation of an Human Ordinance, what reason is there, that the Laws of Nature should give place to the Laws of Men? As we see the Power of the Father over his Child, gives place, and is subordinate to the Power of the Magistrate. And that this is not the Doctrine of Christianity alone, but was also believed by the best Moralists amongst the Heathen, may appear by this remarkable passage out of <HI>Seneca de Clementia,</HI> which is so put to this purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>Cap.</HI> 14.</NOTE> that I took the pains to translate it into English in my Common-place-book: Some of which I will now read to you. <HI>What is the Duty of a Prince? That of kind Parents, who use to chide their Children sometimes sweetly, and at other times with more sharpness, and sometimes correct them with blows. And after having shewn that a good Father will not proceed to disinherit his Son, or inflict any more severe punishments upon him till he is past all hopes of amendment</HI>; He proceeds thus. <HI>No Parent proceeds to Extir∣pation, till he hath in vain spent all other Remedies. That which becomes a Parent, becomes a Prince who is stiled without flattery,</HI> The Father of his Country; <HI>in all our other Titles we consult their</HI> (i. e. the Emperours) <HI>Honour. We have called them the Great, the Happy, the August, and heaped upon ambitious Majesty, all the Titles we could invent, in giving th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se to them: But we have stiled him,</HI> The Fa∣ther of his Country, <HI>that the Prince might consider the Power of a Father, was given him: Which is the most temperate of all Powers, consulting the Welfare of the Children, and preferring their Good before its own.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="64"/>And as for your Objection, why Princes should not be loved, and reveren∣ced, as if they were our Fathers, because not being our Natural Fathers, they may possibly want that Natural, and Fatherly Affection to their Subjects, and consequently may Tyrannize over them; I think this is easily answered: For</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> God, who is, and ever was the True Disposer of Kingdoms, hath in his hands the hearts of all Princes, and endows them with such Affections, as he thinks fit not only towards the People in general, but towards each particular person: And therefore as he was the Author of all Government, and is still the Preserver of it; so no inconvenience can happen, but he is able to redress it.</P>
<P N="2">2. That there was as great, or rather greater Inconveniencies which sprung at first from the too great Lenity of these Natural Princes, for want of Power, or Will to punish the Disorders of their Subject Children, as have ever sprung since, from the Tyranny, and Cruelty of the worst Princes: And I believe to this was owing that excessive wickedness, which forced as it were God Almighty, to put an end to the first World, by that time it had stood about 1600 years. And we see afterwards <HI>Eli,</HI> and <HI>Samuel,</HI> good men, and severe Judges towards others, were yet too indulgent to their own Children; which shews the weakness of your Reasons, and the greatness of the Wis∣dom of God, in making all Government to spring from <HI>Paternal Power,</HI> which is the mildest of all Powers, and to descend by degrees to <HI>Hereditary Monarchies,</HI> which are the <HI>Divinest,</HI> the most <HI>Natural,</HI> and the best of all Go∣vernments, and in which the People have the least hand.</P>

<P>I see plainly that you think the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> or <HI>Reason</HI> are not on your side and therefore you are forced to recur not to the express words of Scripture, but to the Paraphrase, or Explanation of them in our Church Catechism, which certainly never was intended to have that consequence drawn from it, which you have made, for tho you are pleased to omit one part of the Commandment, with an, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet the Words are as you your self must acknowledge. <HI>Honour thy Father, and thy Mother</HI>; and if from <HI>Hon∣our thy Father,</HI> you will gather that all Power was <HI>Originally</HI> in the Father, it will follow by the same Argument, that it must have been as <HI>Originally</HI> in the Mother too: <HI>Father, and Mother, or Parents,</HI> being mentioned toge∣ther, in all Precepts in the Old, and New Testament, where Honour, or Obedience is enjoyned on Children; And if these Words, <HI>Honour thy Father,</HI> must give a right to Government, and make the form also Monarchical, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, if by these Words must be meant Obedience to the <HI>Political Power</HI> of the <HI>Supream Magistrate,</HI> it concerns not any Duty we owe to our Natural Fa∣thers, who are Subjects: Because they by your Doctrine are divested of all that <HI>Power,</HI> it being placed wholy in the Prince, and so being equally Subjects, and Slaves with their Children, can have no Right by that Title to any such Honour, or Obedience, as contains in it <HI>Civil Subjection.</HI> But if <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</HI> Signifies the Duty we owe our Natural Parents. (as by our Saviours interpretation <HI>Matth.</HI> 15.4. and all the other places 'tis plain it doth,) then it cannot concern <HI>Political Ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> but a Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y that is owing to Persons who have no Title to Soveraignty, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any <HI>Political Authority</HI> as Monarchs over Subjects. For Obedience to a Private Father, and that <HI>Civil Obedience</HI> which is due to a Monarch, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> quite different, and many times contradictory, and inconsistent with each
<PB N="108" REF="65"/>
other. And therefore, this Command, which necessarily comprehends the persons of our Natural Fathers and Mothers, must mean a Duty we owe them distinct from our Obedience to the Magistrate, and from which the most absolute Power of Princes cannot absolve us. And to make this yet plainer, suppose upon your <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> that <HI>Seth,</HI> as Eldest Son of <HI>Adam,</HI> was Heir of all his <HI>Patriarchal Power,</HI> how could all his Brethren, and Sisters Honour, that is, Obey <HI>Eve</HI> their Mother at the same time, supposing <HI>Seth,</HI> and <HI>her</HI> to have commanded them things contradictory at the same time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>So that, tho' I grant the Compilers of our Church Catechism, did intend in this Explanation to comprehend all the great Duties towards our Govern∣ours: Yet it is plain, they never dreamed of this far-fetched inference, that you have drawn from their Explanation of it, for tho under this Com∣mand of <HI>Honour thy Father, and thy Mother,</HI> they do indeed comprehend Obe∣dience, and Honour to be due to the King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this no more proves that they believed all <HI>Kingly Power</HI> to be <HI>Paternal,</HI> than that because they likewise there Infer from this Command, a Submission to be due to all <HI>Gover∣nours, Teachers, Spiritual Pastors, and Masters,</HI> that therefore all these Par∣ties, here named, do likewise derive their Authority from <HI>Adam</HI>'s Father∣hood, or that because under the Command against bearing <HI>False-Witness</HI> we are taught to refrain our Tongues from <HI>Evil Speaking, Lying, and Slan∣dering,</HI> that therefore all Lyes, and Evil Speaking whatsoever is down-right bearing False-Witness against our Neighbour, Since nothing is more certain than that a man may commit either of the formerr without being guilty of the latter. And to Answer your Query, if <HI>Obedience</HI> to Parents be imme∣diately due by a <HI>Natural Law,</HI> and <HI>Subjection</HI> to Princes but by a <HI>Humane Or∣dinance,</HI> what reason is there that the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> should give place to those of <HI>Men</HI>? I can easily reply, that the <HI>Power</HI> of a Father over his Child gives place, and is Subordinate to the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> because they are both ordained so by God, in the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> it being highly reasonable, that the good of a private Family should give place to the common good of the Common-Wealth, which is a sufficient reason, and extends to all Nations, which never so much as heard of the Ten Commandments.</P>
<P>But to come to your Quotation out of <HI>Seneca,</HI> I think this hath a great deal less weight in it, than your Argument from the Fifth Commandment: For tho' this Philosopher writ to the Emperour, to perswade him to Clemency; yet this I am sure of, that as he never dreamt of this Notion of <HI>Adam</HI>'s <HI>Soveraignty,</HI> or believed that every Prince was endued with <HI>Paternal Autho∣rity,</HI> because amongst other Titles, he was stiled <HI>Pater Patriae.</HI> And there∣fore what this Author here says, is to be looked upon, only as a Rhetorical flourish, or at the most, to be understood but in a Metaphorical sense, the Arguments of this Author not being to be always taken strictly <HI>as a Logician, but only as an Orator,</HI> who was to make use of all appearances of Reason to perswade a young Prince to Mercy, and Clemency; and yet all this was not sufficient, as <HI>Seneca</HI> himself found before he died, by woful expe∣rience. And <HI>Seneca</HI> very well knew, that <HI>Tully</HI> was stiled <HI>Pater Patriae</HI> by the Senate, tho' he was never endued with your <HI>Imperial,</HI> or <HI>Paternal Authority.</HI></P>
<P>But, to reply a little to your Answer, against my last Argument, that Prin∣ces not being our <HI>Natural Fathers,</HI> must often want that <HI>Natural,</HI> and <HI>Fa∣therly Affection</HI> towards their Subjects, and therefore may <HI>Tyrannize</HI> ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="109" REF="65"/>
them: I think the first part of your Reply will make nothing in confutation of what I have said: For tho' I will not deny, but God, <HI>who hath the hearts of Princes in his hands,</HI> may sometimes endue them with such Affections, as he thinks fit, not only towards the People in general, but towards each particu∣lar person; yet this may be as well evil as good Affections: As God is said in <HI>Iudg.</HI> 9. <HI>To have sent an evil Spirit between</HI> Abimelech, (one of your usurping Monarchs) <HI>and the Men of</HI> Sichem, his Subjects: And therefore God may as well send the one for the punishment, as the other for the benefit of a Na∣tion: And that God is more likely to incline the hearts of Princes to such evil, than good Affections towards their Subjects, may appear from Man∣kinds more often deserving God's Anger, for their evil deeds, than Favours for their good ones.</P>
<P>And I desire you would shew me in how many <HI>Absolute Monarchies</HI> now in the World, God Almighty is pleased to declare this wonderful Operation of these <HI>Fatherly Affections</HI> towards their People. I pray deal ingenuously, and tell me, is it to be found in our <HI>European Monarchies,</HI> where most Princes do not only miserably harass, and oppress their Subjects, by intolerable Taxes, and standing Armies, till they reduce them to the Lowest condition of Beg∣gary, and Desperation; and where for the least differences in Religion they take away their Subjects lives by that Cruel Tribunal of the Inquisition, without any Fair, or Legal Tryal, or else where notwithstanding all Edicts, Oaths, and Vows to the contrary, they seize upon, and spoil their Subjects of their Estates, and imprison, and torment their persons by those Booted Apostles the <HI>Dragoons</HI>; because Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks; or else in another Country, where the Prince took upon him a Prerogative to dispense with all Laws at his pleasure, and to imprison, and turn men out of their Freeholds, contrary to the known Laws of the Kingdom? Or to con∣clude, must we look for these <HI>Divine Operations</HI> amongst the <HI>Eastern Monarchy,</HI> where they treat their Subjects like Slaves, and allow them no Property ei∣ther in Lands, or Goods, farther than they think sit, and to have their persons, and lives wholy at their mercy to be castrated, made Slaves of, or killed, as often as it shall please their humour, or passion? And I doubt, if you will but read Antient, as well as Modern Histories, and also survey the State of Man∣kind in all the <HI>Absolute Monarchies</HI> between <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Iapan</HI>; you will find more frequent Examples of the evil, than good Affections of these your Ar∣tificial Fathers towards their Adopted Children.</P>

<P>I cannot deny, but you have given a very Tragical Account of the <HI>Tyranny,</HI> and <HI>Oppressions</HI> under divers <HI>Absolute Monarchies</HI> now in the World; yet this is not the fault of the Government, but of the Evil Principles, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Education, or Temper of those Monarchs, as also often times from the un∣quiet, and rebellious disposition of their Subjects, from the distrusting of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<PB N="110" REF="66"/>
their Subjects as their Children, and that it is contrary to the Nature of Man∣kind, to make their Off-spring Slaves; and that all Kings, (nay Conquerors too) are bound to preserve the Lands, Goods, Liberties, and Lives of all their Subjects not by any <HI>Municipal Law,</HI> but by the <HI>Natural Law</HI> of a Father, which binds them to ratifie the Acts of their Fore fathers, and Predecessors in things necessary for the publick good of their Subjects: But yet you have not done fairly, not to take notice of the great Oppressions, that are exer∣cised in some <HI>Common-wealths</HI> likewise, towards their Subjects, which if you would please to consider, and weigh the fewness of these against the great number of Monarchies now in the World, I believe you will have good cause to confess, that there are many more <HI>good Monarchs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

And it is very remarkable, that when <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> set up the most <HI>Absolute,</HI> and <HI>Tyrannical Government,</HI> that ever was in this Island, there was yet no noise of any Fears, or Jealousies of it in all his times.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very well pleased to find you so heartily agree with me, in condemning of Tyranny, and oppression in <HI>all sorts</HI> of Governments whatever, and I do assure you, I do as little approve of it, if it be any where exercised in <HI>Common-Wealths,</HI> as you can do in <HI>Monarchies,</HI> only I must needs tell you, I am not at all of your Opinion, that the Oppressions, or abuses committed by the Magistrates in <HI>Common-Wealths,</HI> are to be com∣pared with the Tyrannies, and Cruelties exercised by <HI>absolute Monarchs,</HI> and their Subordinate Ministers. For tho' I grant they often lay very severe Taxes, and impositions, upon their Subjects, especially such as they have acquired by Conquest, and so act like <HI>absolute Monarchs</HI> over them, Yet are these oppressions not at all to be compared to those under <HI>Arbitrary Mon∣archies</HI>; for tho' perhaps divers <HI>Common-Wealths</HI> may impose greater Taxes upon their Subjects than some Neighbouring Monarchs; yet doth it not fol∣low that their Government is more severe for all that; since the People ha∣ving an opportunity by free Trade &amp; Liberty of Conscience in such <HI>Common-Wealths,</HI> to acquire a greater share of Riches, are also thereby enabled to Con∣tribute more to the maintenance of the Government, by which they reap so great Benefits. Thus we see a Citizen of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> is able to pay six times the Taxes of one of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and Therefore I dare for all that, appeal to any Common Subject (tho' a <HI>Papist</HI>) of the United Provinces, whether he had not rather live under the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> than under the <HI>French</HI> King, or to any Subject of the <HI>Common Wealths</HI> of <HI>Venice, Genoa,</HI> or <HI>Luca</HI> whether he doth not prefer his Condition, as bad as it is, to that of any of the Sub∣jects of the Pope, Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> or any other <HI>Italian</HI> Prince, not to go over into <HI>Turkey,</HI> and those other <HI>Eastern Monarchies,</HI> where the Yoke of Slavery lyes yet more heavy upon the Subjects, than in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>And as for what you say in the comparing of those <HI>Illegal Arbitrary Pro∣ceedings,</HI> that were exercised in <HI>England,</HI> during the late <HI>Civil Wars,</HI> and after∣wards till the Kings coming in, I must beg your pardon if (besides the great Hyperbole in your expressions on that occasion, which I am sure are very far
<PB N="111" REF="66"/>
from Truth) I impute those Miscarriages not as the fault of this or that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort of Government, but rather to a <HI>Powerful Faction</HI> Backt by a <HI>Standing Army,</HI> which was more like a Tyranny or corrupt Oligarchy, than any Settled Government. Nor is what you say concerning <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Govern∣ment more true than the former, for all men except his own Faction, were not only afraid, but really sensible of the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of their Liberties under his Tyrannical Usurpation: Tho' indeed there was a very good reason, why there should be fewer fears, or Jealousies of it than in his late Majesties time, when his Government began to grow uneasie through the Peoples fear of Popery, and <HI>Arbitrary Government,</HI> which the former People had no Jealousie of in <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s time, and as for the latter they had no occasion to fear that which was already happened.</P>
<P>But that you may not mistake me for a <HI>Common-Wealths</HI> Man, I must so far agree with you, that to condemn Monarchy as such, were to re∣pine at the Government of God himself, so that I also grant that the fault lies not in the form of Government but in the Frail Nature of Men, which can rarely administer that great Trust committed unto them, as be∣comes what they take upon them to be, <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Vicegerents upon Earth,</HI> And I must own, that I esteem <HI>Monarchy limited by known Laws, as the best, and most Equal Government in the World</HI>; and under which both Prince, and People may live most happily, and easily, if each of them will be but contented with their due share.</P>
<P>But I beg your pardon for this digression; and to come to a conclusion, I must freely tell you, it is not a Straw matter, what yours or Sr <HI>R. F</HI>'s Principles are concerning the Fatherly Power of Princes, for as long as there is no ground for it in Scripture, or Nature, you cannot expect that either Princes or People will ever believe you; neither is it true that Princes as Fathers are bound to treat their Subjects in all things like their Children, for then Princes ought to maintain their Subjects, and not Sub∣jects their Princes; since it is the Apostles Rule, <HI>That Children ought not to lay up for the Parents, but the Parents for the Children</HI>: And tho' you pretend not to plead for Tyranny,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Corinth.</HI> 12.14.</NOTE> or <HI>Ar∣bitrary Government,</HI> yet I cannot at all understand, why if it were not for this end, you should assert not long since, in your answer to me, that God thought fit to change <HI>Paternal Government,</HI> into <HI>Hereditary Monarchy,</HI> because of the excessive Wickedness of Mankind before the Flood proceeding from tho too great Lenity of those <HI>Patriarchal Prin∣ces,</HI> in not punishing the disorders of their Subject Children, which is a very bold assertion; Since you know no more than I, what that wicked∣ness was in particular for which God drowned the World, much less what was the occasion of it. And therefore if God thought fit to change <HI>Paternal Power</HI> into <HI>Hereditary Monarchies</HI> which (as I have proved) do not at all pro∣ceed from <HI>Paternal Power,</HI> it will also follow that the Government of your Patriarchs was not sufficient for the well-being, and happiness of Mankind, or else God would never have thought fit to have altered it, for a more Cruel and severe way of Government.</P>
<P>But as for what you say, concerning those Princes that place all their security in Guards, and Armies too strong for the Subjects, that they are uneasie, and degenerate into <HI>Despotick Monarchies,</HI> (you might better have
<PB N="112" REF="67"/>
said Tyrannies) and that they are unsafe both for Prince and People, is very true, and I altogether agree with you in it. But those of your Principles have no reason to find fault with Princes for so doing; for since they do but use their just Prerogative over their Slaves, or Vassals, it is but fit that they should be made to undergo that Yoke, whether they will or no, which they would not bear willingly, and as long as Princes look upon themselves to be (what they really are upon your Principles) the Masters and not the Fathers of their People, as they suppose the Goods, and Estates of their Subjects to be wholly at their disposal, So can they never command them as they please, without the Assistance of <HI>Standing Armies</HI>; nor have you any reason to complain of those Princes for keeping them too strong for the Subjects, since upon your Principles be they Strong, or Weak, the Subjects are not to resist them; but if Princes, without your extraordinary fondness of using their People like Children, would but always use them like Subjects, with ordinary Justice, and Moderation; and not oppress them with excessive Taxes, and unnecessary <HI>Penal Laws</HI> about Religion, you would find there would be no need of <HI>Standing Armies</HI> to keep the People in awe, who would themselves be the best defence not only against Dome∣stick, but Forreign Enemies, and this I'll assure you is a much better re∣ceipt against <HI>Rebellion,</HI> than all your <HI>new Recipe</HI>'s of <HI>Paternal Power</HI> in Mon∣archs, which is not only without all ground of reason but above common apprehensions.</P>

<P>You have made a long Speech in answer to my <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> which since you are not satisfied with, I can likewise shew you another very good reason, why the People should love, and reverence their Princes, and that is those great <HI>Liberties,</HI> and <HI>Concessions,</HI> that all the <HI>Monarchs of Europe</HI> have granted their Subjects, which are now past into the settled Laws and Cu∣stoms of those Kingdoms with which the People ought to be very well con∣tented; nor ought they to rebel or resist, tho' they may sometimes out of wantonness, and necessity, infringe, or intrench upon those Priviledges which they or their Ancestors have conferred upon them; since they can <HI>never forseit</HI> that Power they have <HI>originally</HI> over them.</P>

in his Line for some Ages, till at last their Relation by Blood to their Subjects was removed at so great a distance, that the Account of their Kindred, or Relation to each other, was scarce remembred, whereby they who had the</HI> Soveraign Power, <HI>still exprest less</HI> Paternal Affection <HI>in their Government, looking upon those they Governed as meer Subjects, and not as their Kinsmen or Allies, till by degrees, ac∣cording to the Custom of</HI> Exorbitant Power, <HI>they (considering only the extent of their own Iurisdiction, and what they might, rather than what they should do) treated them who were under them, not as Subjects, but as Slaves, who having no Right to any thing, but what they permitted them, they would allow them to possess nothing, but what they had no occasion to take away; Estates they had none, that they could call their own, because when their Prince called for them, they were his; their Persons were at his command, when he had either occasion, or appetite to make use of them; and their Children inherited nothing but their Fathers Subjection; so that they were happy, or miserable, as he who had the Power over them pleased to exercise it with more, or less Rigour, or Indulgence; yet they submitted alike to both; acknowledging his Dominion to be naturally as absolute as their Subjection, and Obedience.</HI></P>
<P><HI>These Princes might for some Ages have pleased themselves with this Exorbitant Exercise of their Power, which tho' it had been always the same, yet the exercise of it had been very moderate, whilst there remained the tenderness, or memory of any Relation. But these Princes began at lest to discern, and be convinced that the great strength they seemed to be possest of, would in a short time degenerate into weakness, and the Riches they seemed to enjoy, would end in want, and necessity, as well in themselves, as in their Subjects; since no Man would build a good House, that his Children could not inherit, nor cultivate their Land, with any good hus∣bandry, and expence, since the profit thereof might be given to another Man; And that if the Subjects did not enjoy the Conveniences of Life, they could not be sure of their help, and affection, whenever they should have War with another Prince, as absolute as themselves; but they would rather chuse to be subject to him under whose Government they might live with greater Liberty, and Satisfaction. And lastly, That if they ingrost all the Wealth, and Power into their own hands, they should find none who would defend them in the possession of it: And that there was a great difference between that Subjection, which Love and Duty pays, and that which results only from Fear, and Force, since Despair often puts an End to that Duty, which Reason, and it may be, Conscience, would otherwise have perswaded them still to continue: And therefore, that it was necessary that their Subjects should find ease, and profit in Obeying, as well as Kings pleasure in Commanding; these wise, and wholesom Reflections might prevail with Princes, for their own, as well as Subjects benefit, to restrain their Power, and to make it less absolute, that it might be more useful, and, to give their Subjects such a Property in their Goods, and Lands, as should not be invaded, but in such cases, and on such occasions as the necessities of the Government really required. But as they found the benefit arising from these Condescensions, highly tend to the Improvement of the Riches, and Civi∣llity of their Subjects, with all those additions of pleasure, and industry, which ren∣der Man's Life, as well as the Government easie, and pleasant, they still in seve∣ral Generations enlarged these Graces, and Concessions to their Subjects, yet re∣serving all in themselves that they did not part with by their voluntary Grants or Concessions. And if we take a View of the</HI> several Kingdoms <HI>of the World, we shall see another face of things, both of</HI> Power, <HI>and</HI> Riches <HI>in those Governments,
<PB N="114" REF="68"/>
where these Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scensions and Concessions have been best observed; than in those Kingdoms where the Soveraigns either retain, or resume to themselves all those Rights, or Prerogatives, which are invested in them from the</HI> Original Nature <HI>of Government; so that there still remains enough in the Princes hands to be made use of, for the preservation of his own Power, and the defence of his Subjects, for whose benefit it was intrusted with him by God.</HI> So far the late great Chan∣cellor.</P>
<P>And these Priviledges, and Condescensions, being once past into constant, and standing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aws, by the Princes that gave them, and also solemnly sworn to by their Coronation Oaths, do for the future bind, not only those Prin∣ces that granted them, but also their Successors, to their observation: And I then look upon them bound, under pain of Damnation, not to break, or infringe them, without very great necessity.</P>
<P>But however, if they shall happen so to do, since they were matters of meer Grace, and Favour at the first, and not of Right, the Princes that thus transgress them, are only accountable to God, and punishable by him, and not by their Subjects, for any Breaches, or Infringements of such Liberties, and Immunities: And this may serve against the Fancies of all those who think Princes have nothing, but what the People have given them; and likewise against such as Mr. <HI>Hobbs,</HI> who maintain so much is conferred on them, that they have a Right to leave no body else any thing to enjoy, that they have a mind to take from them. And this I take to be a much better Security for the Peoples Liberties, to leave it to the Honour, and Consci∣ence of their Princes, and that Fear they ought to have of the Divine Ven∣geance, in case they oppress their Subjects contrary to Law, than your heady, and violent Methods of Resistance for the Oppression, or Tyranny of Prin∣ces, which would but give the common people a pretence of taking Arms, and Rebelling against their Princes upon every slight provocation.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have made a very plausible Discourse, whether of your own, or from the Author you quote, is not much material; for I doubt when it comes to be examined, it will appear much more like a Romance than a true History: And therefore granting at present your Principles to be true, (tho' they are not) I desire you to shew me, how you can make it out, ei∣ther from Sacred, or Prophane History, that any <HI>Limited Kingdom</HI> now in the World, ever had its <HI>Original</HI> from those gracious Condescensions, or Concessions of Princes, as you here mention: For by all that ever I can read, or observe, either from our own, or Foreign History, all the Liberties, and Priviledges which Subjects enjoy at this day, proceeded at first, either from the Original Contracts, Customs, or Constitutions of those Kingdoms, or Nations, at the <HI>first Institution</HI> of their Government; or else were for∣ced from Princes by their Subjects, who would no longer endure the seve∣rity of their Yoke, or else were granted by some of them, who believing they had <HI>worse Titles</HI> than their Competitors to the Crown, were willing to▪ engage the <HI>People</HI> to their side, by granting them <HI>greater Priviledges,</HI> than they before enjoyed.</P>
<P>And tho' I grant the Reflections you make upon the exercise of Arbitrary Power, and the Miseries it brings both upon the Prince, and People, are very true: Yet I am sure the practice of most Absolute Monarchs through∣out the whole World, hath run quite contrary to your suppositions. For
<PB N="115" REF="68"/>
Princes are so far (by what I ever read, or observed) from being willing to <HI>part</HI> with any of their Power, that they have still endeavoured by de∣grees to enlarge it, and render it <HI>more absolute</HI> than it was left them; as you may observe in the Government of <HI>France, Spain, Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Swe∣den</HI> in this last Age; and what <HI>Encroachments</HI> were made in this Kingdom by the Prerogative upon the Peoples Liberties, during the Reigns of our last Princes, he is a stranger to the History of the Country, that hath not read of, if he do not remember them. And how much higher they would have been carried, if this strange, and sudden Revolution had not put a stop to it, I had rather you and I should understand in Idea than by Experience.</P>
<P>But if such grave Reflections as these of yours, were able to work upon the first Monarchs, I desire to know the reason why those of <HI>Turkey, Persia, Russia,</HI> and the <HI>African</HI> Emperors of <HI>Morocco,</HI> and of the <HI>Abissines</HI> (who sure have been as wise as any you can name) should not in so many Ages as they have Governed, see these Inconveniences you mention, and restrain their Exorbitant Power within some moderate Limits: Nay, to the contrary, one of the most ambitious and aspiring Monarchs in <HI>Europe,</HI> is making what haste he can to reduce his Kingdom into the same Model. And what do you think would the Princes, and Councellors of these Empires say to such a one as you, or I, who should offer to preach this strange Doctrine to them, That they ought under pain of Damnation to use their Subjects as their Children, and not as Slaves, or meer Vassals? I doubt they would make us pay dear for publishing such false Doctrine in their Dominions, or at least would despise us for half-witted fellows, without any true Notions in Po∣liticks, since they believe, that the true Security, and Glory of a King, con∣sists in vast Standing Armies, Great Fleets, and a power to take from their Subjects, and Neighbours, whatever they please, thereby to enjoy their own pleasures and humours in all their hearts can desire, and to extend their Empires <HI>(per fas &amp; nefas)</HI> as far as ever their Conquering Swords will give them leave. And if you should tell them, that their Subjects could not love them, nor live happily, nor contentedly under such a Govern∣ment; I suppose their Answer would be (if they could speak Latine) <HI>Ode∣rint dum metuant,</HI> or in the Language of their own Country, that they would rather trust a Standing Army, than the Affections of their People; and that it is better to take from their Subjects what they have a mind to▪ than to leave it to their good will what they will give them. These are all the Antient, and Modern Politicks that I can observe in most Absolute Mo∣narchies, or in those Kingdoms, where Kings have taken upon them so to Govern their Subjects, at this day: But I defie you to shew me any one Kingdom in the World, where the People owe all their Liberties, and Pri∣viledges meerly to the good will, and favour of their Princes▪ who granted them only out of those wise considerations you have now mentioned.</P>
<P>But as for the Expedient at the latter end of your Speech, that these Pri∣viledges, and Condescensions, when once granted by Kings to their Subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts, and past into constant, and standing Laws, and also solemnly sworn to by Princes at their Coronation, do not only bind those Princes that granted them, but also their Successors under pain of Damnation; I so far agree with you, tho' I must beg your pardon if I cannot think this a sufficient Security, for several Reasons I can give you at a more convenient time when I shall, when you please, more fully discuss this point.</P>

<PB N="116" REF="69"/>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must freely tell you Sir, I am not yet satisfied neither with the Instances you have brought, nor yet with your replies to my answers, and I think I can shew you as to this Kingdom, that they are false in mat∣ter of Fact. For if that the first and most ancient Kingdoms and Monar∣chies began by <HI>Conquest</HI> at first, and that perhaps for the most part by Wars unjustly made, as I may also Instance in <HI>England,</HI> if this were a proper season for it, so that indeed the greatest Liberty in the World, (if it be duely considered) is for a People to live under a <HI>Paternal Monar∣chy.</HI> It is the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of this Kingdom, all other shews, or Pretexts of Liberty are but several degrees of Slavery, and a Liberty only to destroy Liberty.</P>
<P>So that I think I may very well keep my first opinion, that <HI>Paternal Government</HI> is the <HI>Foundation</HI> of all other, and I have ever thought God's Love, and Kindness to Mankind did never appear in any thing more, (ex∣cept in Man's Redemption) than in Creating only one Man, and out of him only one Woman: So that <HI>Adam</HI> was a kind of a Father to his Wife▪ That Marital as well as all other Power might be founded in <HI>Paternal Iuris∣diction.</HI> That all Princes might look upon the meanest of their Subjects, as their Children: And all Subjects upon their Prince as their Common Fa∣ther: And upon each other as the Children of one Man; that Mankind might not only be United in one common Nature, but also be of one Blood, of one Family and be habituated to the best of Governments from the very Infancy of the World.</P>
<P>Were this well considered as there could be no <HI>Tyrants,</HI> so neither would there be any <HI>Traitors</HI>; and Rebels: But both Prince and People would strive to outdo each other in the offices of Love, and Duty: And now do you, or any Man living read Sir <HI>R. F</HI>'s <HI>Patriarcha</HI> or other works, and see if either he, or I have ascribed one Dram of Power to Princes which will not Naturally Spring from this <HI>Supream-Paternal Power.</HI></P>
<P>So that upon the whole, I think reason it self would conclude, that this way of Solving the <HI>first Rise</HI> of Government is true, and that it is the Du∣ty of all, who by the Blessing of God are under <HI>Paternal Monarchies,</HI> to be very thankful for the favour, and to do the utmost that in them lies to pre∣serve, and transmit that best form of Government to their Children after them. And surely there is no Nation under Heaven hath more reason for this than the <HI>English,</HI> who are under a <HI>Paternal Monarchy,</HI> which has taken the best care, that can be to secure them not only from oppression, and wrong, but from the very fear of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you lay the chief stress of your assertion, upon the Original of most of the Kingdoms and Monarchies now in the World, and of our own in particular, I think I may safely joyn issue with you on both points, and in the first place affirm that an <HI>unjust Conquest</HI> gives the Con∣querour no right to the Subjects Obedience much less over their Lives, or Estates, and if our <HI>Norman William</HI> and his Successours had no more right to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> than meer conquest, I doubt whether they might have been driven out, after the same manner they came in: But I believe you will find upon second thoughts that Unjust Conquests and Usurpations of Crowns be no firm Titles for Princes to relye on; lest the Old <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="69"/>
Proverb be turned upon you, <HI>viz. That which is Sauce for a Goose, is Sauce for a Gander</HI>; but I Shall defer this discourse concerning Titles by Conquest, and in particular that of our Kings to this Kingdom to some other time when I doubt not but to shew, that it is not only false in matter of fact, but also that it will not prove that for which it is brought.</P>
<P>And therefore what you say in your conclusion in exaltation of God's Love, and Kindness to Mankind, in Creating one Man, and out of him on∣ly one Woman; that <HI>Adam</HI> might be a kind of Father to his Wife, is a very pretty and indeed singular Notion, and you would do very well to move the <HI>Convocation</HI> next time it sits, that this explanation may be add∣ed to the <HI>fifth Commandment,</HI> that Women may be taught in the Cate∣chism that Obedience to Husbands, is due by the Precept, of <HI>Honour thy Fa∣ther and thy Mother.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore I need give no other Answer to all the rest you have said however Specious the <HI>Hypothesis</HI> may seem (as you have drest it up,) for Princes, and People; yet till you have proved that all <HI>Paternal Power</HI> is Monarchical; and that all <HI>Monarchical Power</HI> is derived from Father∣hood, it signifies nothing.</P>
<P>Nor can these <HI>Piae Fraudes</HI> do any more good in Politicks than Religion: For as Superstition can never serve to advance the True Worship of God, but by creating false Notions of the <HI>Divine Nature</HI> in Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Minds, which doth not render it, as it ought to be, the Object of their Love, and Reverence, but Servile Fear: So I suppose this asserting of such an unlimited <HI>Despotical Power</HI> in all Monarchs, and such an entire Subjection as Sir <HI>R. F.</HI> and you, your self exact from Subjects, can produce nothing but a flavish Dread without that esteem, and affection for their Prince's Person, and Govern∣ment; which is so necessary for the quiet of Princes, and which they may always have, whilst they think themselves obliged in Conscience, and Ho∣nour, to protect their Lives and Fortunes from Slavery, and Oppression, according to the just and known Laws of the Kingdom, and not to dispense with them in great, and Essential Points, without the Consent of those who have a hand in the making of them: And all false Notions of this <HI>Supreme Power</HI> as derived from I know not what <HI>Fatherly,</HI> (but indeed <HI>Despotick</HI>) <HI>Power</HI> are so far from settling in Peoples Minds, a sober and rational Obe∣dience to Government, that they rather make them desperate; and care∣less, who is their Master, since, let what Change will come, they can expect no better than to be Slaves.</P>
<P>Nor are Subjects put in a better condition by this Doctrine of <HI>Absolute Non Resistance,</HI> since all Princes are not of so generous a Nature, as not to Tyrannize, and Insult the more over those whom they suppose will not, or else dare not resist them; and therefore I cannot see how such a submis∣sion can soften the hearts of the most Cruel Princes in the World, as you suppose, much less how Resistance in some cases can inrage the mildest Princes to their Peoples Ruine, since all Resistance of such mild, and mer∣ciful Princes I grant to be utterly unlawful; nor do I hold Resistance ever to be practised, but where the People are already ruined in their Liberties and Fortunes; or are just at the brink of it, and have no other means left but that to avoid it.</P>
<P>To conclude, I so far agree with you, that I think it is the Duty of
<PB N="118" REF="70"/>
all that are born under a Kingly Government <HI>Limited by Laws,</HI> to be very thankful to God for the Favour, and to do the utmost that in them lies to preserve and transmit this best Form of Government to their Children after them, without maintaining such unintelligible Fictions as a <HI>Paternal Monarchy</HI> derived from <HI>Adam,</HI> or <HI>Noah.</HI> And tho' I own that some of our former Kings have taken the best care they could, to secure this Nation from <HI>Popery,</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Power</HI>; yet whether the Method of our three last Kings have been the readiest way to secure us from the fears of it, I leave it to your own Conscience (if you are a Protestant) to judge.</P>
<P>But since you defie me to shew you out of Sir <HI>R. F</HI>'s <HI>Patriarcha,</HI> that he hath ascribed one Dram of Power to Princes, which doth not naturally arise from a <HI>Supreme Paternal Power,</HI> and that this is no Exorbitant heighth; I think I am able to prove from many passages in his <HI>Patriarcha,</HI> as well as other Works, that no Author hath made bolder Assertions to render all Mankind <HI>Slaves,</HI> instead of Subjects, and all Princes <HI>Tyrants,</HI> instead of Kings; and that his Principles are so far from being safe, that if they are duly lookt into and weighed, they will prove destructive as well to the Rights of Princes, as to the Liberties of the People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be very glad to see that proved, for I must always be∣lieve till you shew me to the contrary, that this Excellent Author lays it down for a Ground, that Princes being as Fathers to their People, are bound to treat their Subjects as Children, and not as Slaves; and therefore waving this last Controversie, which we have argued as far as it will go; pray make out what you say from his own words, and I will give up the Cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder how you can be so partially blind, as not to see this, since you your self have already made use not only of a great deal of his Doctrins, but also of his very words: And therefore pray see his Obedience to Government in doubtful times, as also in his Preface to the Observa∣tions upon <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Politicks, where you will find he asserts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>page</HI> 4th.</NOTE> <HI>That</HI> Adam <HI>was the Father, King and Lord over his Family; a Son, a Subject and a Servant, or a Slave were one, and the same thing at first: The Father had power to dispose of, or sell his Children, or Servants:</HI> Whence we find, that at the first reckoning of Goods in Scrip∣ture, the Man-servant, and the Maid-servant are number'd among the Pos∣sessions, and Substance of the Owner, as other Goods were. So that then, if the Power of a Father, and of a Monarch be all one, and that all <HI>Monarchi∣cal Power</HI> is <HI>Despotical,</HI> the Consequence is also as evident, that all Subjects are also naturally Slaves, unless their Princes shall please to lay an easier Yoke upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps Sir <HI>R. F.</HI> may have carried this matter a little too far; yet if you please to look into his <HI>Patriarcha, Chap.</HI> 3. <HI>Par.</HI> 1. you will find, that he hath this passage, which plainly speaks the contrary: <HI>The Father of a Fa∣mily Governs by no other Law, than by his own Will, not by the Laws and Wills of his Sons, and Servants. There is no Nation that allows Children any Action, or Remedy for being unjustly Governed; and yet for all this, every Father is bound by the Law of Nature to do his best for the preservation of his Family; but much more is a King always tyed by the same Law of Nature, to keep this general Ground, That
<PB N="119" REF="70"/>
the Safety of his Kingdom be his Chief Law.</HI> Whence you may observe, that tho' he takes away all Remedy from Children against their Parents, for be∣ing ill Governed, yet doth he not set the Father free from all Obligation to preserve the Good of his Family, of which sure a Man's Children are a principal part.</P>
<P>And if you please to look back to the second Chapter, <HI>Par.</HI> 3. you will find these words. <HI>To answer in particular to the first Text, it may be said the sense of these words, By the Law of Nature all Men are born free, must needs mean a Freedom only, that is opposite to such a Subjection as is between Father, and Son. This is made manifest by the Text of the Law: For</HI> Ulpian <HI>in this place speaketh only of</HI> Manumission, <HI>which is a setting at Liberty of Servants from Servitude, and not of</HI> Emancipation, <HI>which is the freeing of Children from the Fathers Tuition. Servitude, as the Law teacheth, is a Constitution of the Law of Nations, by which a Man is subject to the Dominion of any other Man against Nature. So not every Subjection is Servitude, but Subjection contrary to the Law of Nature. Yet every Man is born subject to the Power of a Father.</HI> This the Law it self saith; <HI>In Potestate nostra Liberi nostri sunt. So that you see here be maketh a difference between Servitude, and that Subjection that is due to Fathers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me leave to answer these two Instances before you proceed any farther, and I shall in the first place make bold to answer your last In∣stance first, because I shall be much shorter upon it. But pray take notice by the way, that this Author is very high, and rigorous for the <HI>Absolute Power</HI> of Life, and Death in all Fathers, over their Children in the State of Nature, and that they may exercise it for very slight Offences; and there∣fore in this Chapter you have last quoted, he seems very well satisfied with the Example of <HI>Cassius▪ who threw his Son out of the Consistory for publishing the</HI> Agrarian Law, <HI>for the Division of Lands</HI>; and I think this was no such great Crime, for which a Father might justifie the putting his Son to Death. And in the Section before this, he justifieth the Power of Fathers amongst the <HI>Romans, as being ratified, and amplified by the Laws of the XII Tables, en∣abling Parents to sell their Children two or three times over.</HI> So that these things considered, I cannot see, how this Distinction of Sir <HI>R. F.</HI> out of the <HI>Civil Law,</HI> will do him any service. For tho' I grant indeed that <HI>Manumission,</HI> and <HI>Emancipation</HI> are two different words, yet do they both signifie the same thing; and tho' for the greater respect which they would shew to the Con∣dition of Children, above that of Slaves, they were pleased to make use of different expressions; yet, whoever will look more closely into the Nature of the Subjection, that Children were in, under their Parents, by the <HI>Roman</HI> Law, will find, that the Condition of Children, was no better than that of Slaves. For <HI>First,</HI> The Father had such an <HI>Absolute Power</HI> over the Person of the Son, that he could sell him three times, whereas he could sell a Slave but once. <HI>Secondly,</HI> He had such an <HI>Absolute Power</HI> over his Life, that he could take it away whenever he pleased. <HI>Lastly,</HI> A Son could have no Pro∣perty in any Goods without his <HI>Fathers Consent,</HI> till he was emancipated, or made free: So that if his Father were harsh, and ill natured, the Condition of a Son was worse than that of a Slave, as long as his Father lived.</P>
<P>And therefore I am still of the Opinion of the Antient Civil Lawyers, which assert the Natural Freedom of Mankind, according to the Maxim you have now cited. And they acknowledge that the <HI>Servitude,</HI> or <HI>Absolute-Subjection
<PB N="120" REF="71"/>
of Children to their Fathers,</HI> was not by the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> but by the <HI>Civil</HI> or <HI>Roman Law,</HI> peculiar to themselves; as I have already proved at our last meeting.</P>
<P>But to come to your first Quotation, whereby you would justifie Sir <HI>R. F.</HI> for maintaining any unjust Severity in Fathers, or Tyranny in Princes, be∣cause they are both to endeavour the Common Good of the Family, and Kingdom, tis very true he says so; but of this <HI>Common Good</HI> they themselves are the <HI>sole Iudges</HI>: So that if the Father please to sell one or two of his Children, whom he least loveth, to provide Portions for the rest, he may lawfully do it for any thing I see to the contrary. So likewise imme∣diately after he asserts the Superiority of all Princes above Laws, because there were Kings long before there were any Laws. And all the next Pa∣ragraph is wholy spent, in proving the <HI>Unlimited Iurisdiction of Kings above Laws,</HI> as it is described by <HI>Samuel,</HI> when the <HI>Israelites</HI> desired a King: So that it signifies little what Laws Princes make, or what Priviledges they grant their Subjects, since they may alter them, or abrogate them when ever they please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray take along with you, what he says in the next Paragraph you quote; where you may see these words; <HI>It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here evidently shewed, that the scope of</HI> Samuel, <HI>was to teach the People a dutiful Obedience to their King, even in those things which themselves did esteem Mischievous and Inconvenient: For by telling them what a King would do, he indeed instructs them what a Subject must suffer; yet not so, as that it is Right for Kings to do Injury, but it is Right for them to go unpunished by the People if they do it: So that in this point it is all one, whether</HI> Samuel <HI>describe a King, or a Tyrant; for patient Obedience is due to both: No Remedy in the Text against Tyrants, but in crying, and pray∣ing unto God in that day.</HI> And that Sir <HI>R. F.</HI> is very far from justifying Kings in the unnecessary Breach of their Laws, may farther appear by what he says, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. <HI>Par.</HI> 6. of this Treatise, where pray see this passage. <HI>Now albeit Kings who make the Laws, be (as King</HI> James <HI>teacheth us) above the Laws; yet will they Rule their Subjects by the Law; and a King Governing in a</HI> Settled Kingdom, <HI>leaves to be a King, and degenerateth into a Tyrant, so soon as he leaves to Rule according to his Laws; yet where he sees the Laws rigo∣rous, or doubtful, be may mitigate and interpret them.</HI> So that you see here he leaves the King no Power or Prerogative above the Laws, but what shall be directed, and employed for the general Good of the Kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, Sir, read on a little farther, and see if he doth not again undo all that he hath before so speciously laid down, and if you will not read it, I will: <HI>General Laws made in Parliament, may upon known respects to the King, by his</HI> Authority, <HI>be mitigated, or suspended upon Causes only known to him. And altho' a King do frame all his Action to be according to the Laws, yet he is not bound thereto, but at his good Will, and for good Example: Or so far forth as the General Law of the Safety of the Common-Weal doth naturally bind him; for in such sort only, Positively Laws may be said to bind the King, not by being Positive, but as they are naturally the best, or only means for the preserva∣tion of the Common-Wealth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>So that if the King have this Prerogative</HI> of mitigating, interpreting, and suspending all Laws, in Cases only known to himself, and that he is not bound
<PB N="121" REF="71"/>
to the Laws but at his own good will, and for good example. I desire to know what <HI>greater Prerogative</HI> a King can desire, than to <HI>suspend</HI> the Exe∣cution of any Law, as often as he shall think fit. For tho' I grant the <HI>Suspen∣sion</HI> of a Law differs from the <HI>Abrogation</HI> of it, because the former only takes away the force of it in this or that particular case, whereas the latter wholy annuls the Law; yet if this Suspension be general, and in every case, where the Law is to take effect, it amounts to the same thing with an Abro∣gation of it; as may be plainly seen in the late King's <HI>Dispersing Power.</HI> For tho' it be true he pretended to no more, than to dispense with this, or that Person, who should undertake a publick Employment, either <HI>Military,</HI> or <HI>Ci∣vil,</HI> without taking the <HI>Oaths,</HI> and <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st</HI>; yet since he granted this Dispensa∣tion generally to all Papists, and others, that would transgress this law, it amounted to the same thing during his pleasure, as an <HI>Absolute Abrogation</HI> of it. And therefore I do very much wonder why divers who are very zea∣lous for the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and the <HI>King's Prerogative,</HI> should be so angry with him for erecting that <HI>Power,</HI> which not only this Author, but all others of his Principles have placed in him: And if the King may suspend this, and all other Laws, upon Causes <HI>only known</HI> to him, I do not see how he differs from being as Absolute and Arbitrary a Monarch, as the <HI>Great Turk</HI> himself, and may when he pleases, notwithstanding all Laws to the contrary, take away Men's Lives without any due Forms of Law, and raise <HI>Taxes</HI> with∣out <HI>Consent of Parliament.</HI></P>

<P>But pray read on a little farther, and you will find that he very much restrains this <HI>Absolute Power,</HI> in these words: <HI>By this mean, are all Kings, even Tyrants and Conquerors, bound to preserve the Laws, Goods, Liberties and Lives of all their Subjects, not by any</HI> Municipal Law <HI>of the Land, but by the</HI> Na∣tural Law <HI>of a Father, which binds them to ratifie the Acts of their Fore-fathers and Predecessors in things necessary for the publick good of their Subjects.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were I a Monarch limited by Laws, I would desire no greater a Power over them, than this you have here brought out of this Author. For he says▪ <HI>Positive Laws do not bind the King, but as they are the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st or only means for the preservation of the Common Wealth.</HI> In the next place you see that all Kings are bound to preserve the Lives and Estates of their Subjects, not by any <HI>Municipal Law</HI> of the Land, but by the <HI>Natural Law</HI> of a Father, which binds them to ratifie the Acts of their Predecessors in things necessary for the publick good of their Subjects. Now this <HI>Paternal Power</HI> is large enough of all Conscience to discharge Princes from any Obligation to the Laws far∣ther than they please. For it before appears that the Father of a Family go∣verns by no other Law than by his own Will, and not by the Laws and Wills of his Sons or Servants; therefore if the Power of the King be wholy Paternal, he may alter this Will of his as often as he please: Nor can his Sub∣jects, who are all one with Sons and Servants, have any reason to find fault with it For he says, <HI>There is no Nation that allows Children any Remedy for being</HI> unjustly Governed. And tho' it be true, that he restrains this Prerogative both in Fathers and Kings to the publick good of their Children and Subjects; yet as long as he is left the sole and uncontroulable Judge of what is for the publick good, all these fine Pretences will signifie nothing. For he is bound to observe or ratifie no Laws or Acts of his Predecessors, but what <HI>he is sa∣tisfied</HI> tend to this End: So that if he thinks fit to Judge, that <HI>Magna Charta,</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="72"/>
for example, for the Statute <HI>de Tallagio non concedendo,</HI> or any Liberty we enjoy, are not necessary, or contrary to the common good, he is not tied to observe them: And upon this Principle it was that the Judges in the Reign of King <HI>Charles the First</HI> founded the <HI>King's Prerogative</HI> for <HI>Ship money:</HI> For they supposed that the King in case of necessity (that is, for the publick good of the Subjects) might lay a <HI>Tax</HI> upon the Kingdom, tho' without <HI>Consent</HI> of Parliament. So that upon this pretence▪ the King being the <HI>sole Iudge</HI> of the <HI>Necessity,</HI> he might quickly have raised what <HI>Taxes,</HI> and as often as he had pleased</P>
<P>But, lest our Kings should think themselves too strictly bound by their <HI>Coronation Oaths,</HI> to observe the Laws, pray see in the next Paragraph, how this Author endeavours to help the King to creep out of that Obligation too. Therefore pray read on. <HI>Others there be that affirm, that altho' Laws of themselves do not bind Kings, yet the Oaths of Kings at their Coronations tye them, to keep all the Laws of their Kingdoms: How far this is true, let us but examine the Oaths of the Kings of</HI> England <HI>at their Coronation, the words whereof are these</HI>: Art thou pleased to cause to be administred in all thy Judgments indifferent, and upright Justice, and to use Discretion with Mercy, and Verity? Art thou pleased, that our <HI>upright</HI> Laws, and Customs be observed; and doest thou promise, that those shall be protected and maintained by thee? <HI>These two are the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rticles of the King's Oath, which concern the Laity, or Subjects in ge∣neral; to which the King answers affirmatively; being first demanded by the Arch-bishop of</HI> Canterbury: Pleaseth it you to confirm, and observe the Laws, and Customs of Antient Times granted from God, by just and devout Kings unto the <HI>English</HI> Nation, by Oath unto the said People, especially the Laws, Liberties and Customs granted unto the Clergy and Laity, by the Fa∣mous King <HI>Edward? We may observe in these words of the Articles of the Oath, that the King is required to observe, not all the Laws, but only the</HI> upright, <HI>and that with Discretion and Mercy.</HI> The word <HI>upright</HI> cannot mean all Laws, because in the Oath of <HI>Richard the Second, I</HI> find Evil, and Unjust Laws mentioned, which the King swears to abolish; and in the Old Abridgment of Statutes set forth in King <HI>Henry the Eighths</HI> days▪ the King is to swear wholy to put out Evil Laws, which he cannot do, if he be bound to all Laws.</P>
<P>Now what Laws are <HI>Upright,</HI> and what <HI>Evil,</HI> who shall judge but the King? since he swears to administer <HI>Upright Iustice</HI> with Discretion, and Mercy; (or as <HI>Bracton</HI> hath it) <HI>aequitatem praecipiat, &amp; Misericordiam. So that in effect the King doth swear to keep no Laws but such as in his Iudgment are Up∣right, and those not literally always, but according to the Equity of his Conscience, joyned with Mercy, which is properly the Office of a Chancellor rather than of a Iudge: And if a King did strictly swear to observe all the Laws he could not with∣out Perjury give his Consent to the Repealing, or Abrogating of any Statute by Act of Parliament, which would be very mischievous to the State.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But let it be supposed for truth, that Kings do swear to observe all the Laws of their Kingdoms; yet no man can think it reason, that Kings should be more bound by their voluntary Oaths, than common persons are by theirs. Now if a private person make a Contract, either with Oath, or without Oath, he is no farther bound than the Equity, and Iustice of the Contract tyes him; for a Man may have Relief against an unrea∣sonable, and unjust Promise, if either Deceit, or Error, Force, or Fear induced him thereunto; or if it be hurtfuls or grievous in the performance; since the Laws in
<PB N="123" REF="72"/>
many Cases give the King a Prerogative above common persons, I see no reason why he should be denied the Priviledge which the meanest of his Subjects doth enjoy.</HI></P>
<P>I need not make any long Paraphrase upon these words; it is sufficient that the King is here left <HI>sole Iudge</HI> of what Laws are <HI>Upright,</HI> and what <HI>Un∣just,</HI> and consequently what Laws he pleases shall be observed, and what not▪ So that no Laws, tho' thought never so just, and necessary by the Parliament at the time of making of them, shall signifie any thing, if he thinks sit af∣terwards to judge otherwise. And lest this should not be sufficient, he hath found out another way whereby Princes may absolve themselves of this troublesom Obligation of Oaths; and therefore he would have them no more bound up than common persons, who because they may have Relief in Publick Courts of Justice, against an unjust Promise, <HI>if either Errour, De∣ceit, Force, or Fear, induced them thereunto; nay more, if it be hurtful or grievous in the performance,</HI> Kings who have a Prerogative above common persons, and who acknowledge no Tribunal above themselves, may absolve them∣selves of their Oaths whenever they think good; by saying it was extorted from them by <HI>Deceit Force,</HI> or <HI>Fear</HI>; or if they cannot satisfie themselves with∣out it, they might have had formerly the Pope's Dispensation for Money, which we read King <HI>Iohn,</HI> and <HI>Henry the Third</HI> obtained to be ab∣solved of the Oaths they had taken to observe <HI>Magna Charta</HI>; but this Author hath found out a shorter cut, and hath made Kings both Judges, and Parties, and to <HI>ab∣solve</HI> themselves by a <HI>Fundamental Right</HI> of Government. And what hath proved the Conclusion of such Princes who have taken this Authors Liberty of breaking their <HI>Coronation Oath</HI> at their pleasure? it hath only taught their Subjects to imitate their Example, and to make as light of their <HI>Oath of Al∣legiance.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not deny but perhaps Sir <HI>R F.</HI> may have carried the Pre∣rogative in this point a little too far; yet that he meant honestly towards the Common weal, in all this, I pray see the 8th Section of this Chapter, where you'll find these words: <HI>Many will be ready to say, It is a slavish, and dangerous Condition to be subject to the Will of any one M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, who is not subject to the Laws But such Men consider not,</HI> 1. <HI>That the</HI> Prerogative <HI>of a King is to be</HI> above all Laws, <HI>for the good only of them, who are</HI> under <HI>the Laws, and to defend the Peoples Liberties, as His Majesty graciously affirmed in his Speech after his last Answer to the</HI> Petition of Right; <HI>howsoever some are afraid of the name of Pre∣rogative, yet they may assure themselves the Case of Subjects would be desperately mi∣serable without it.</HI> So that you see here he asserts no Prerogative in the King to be above all Laws, but only for the good of the people, and to de∣fend their Liberties, which I think is a <HI>sufficient restraint</HI> of Prerogative.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>But read a little lower, and the People will have no such great cause to thank him, as you may see by these words: <HI>In all Aristocracies the Nobles are above the Laws; and in all Democracies the People. By the like reason in a Mo∣narchy the King must of necessity be above the Laws; there can be no Soveraign Ma∣jesty in him that is under them. That which gives the very being to a King, is the Power to give Laws; without this Power he is but an</HI> Equivocal King.</P>
<P>And most part of what follows in this Treatise is only to prove▪ that the <HI>Parliament,</HI> or Assembly of Estates was a Creature wholy of the <HI>King's Crea∣tion,</HI> and consequently that he <HI>alone</HI> makes the Laws in it. And he hath also written a whole Treatise called, <HI>The Free-holders Grand Inquest,</HI> to prove that
<PB N="124" REF="73"/>
it is the King's Authority alone, that makes the Laws, and therefore that he can interpret, and dispense with them at his pleasure. So that <HI>Richard the Second,</HI> had this Author lived in his time, might have made him a Judge as we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l as <HI>Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illian</HI> and <HI>Belknap,</HI> since they all maintained the same Principles. But, lest we should mistake him, see what he says at the conclusion of this Treatise: <HI>For the confirmation of this Point,</HI> Aristotle <HI>saith, That a perfect King∣dom is that wherein the King Rules all things according to his own Will; for he that is called a King according to the Law, makes no kind of Kingdom at all. This it s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ems also the</HI> Romans <HI>well understood to be most necessary in a Monarchy; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y were a People most greedy of Liberty, yet the Senate did free</HI> Augustus <HI>from all necessary of Laws, that he might be free of his own Authority, and of absolute Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r over himself, and over the Laws to do what he pleased, and leave undone what he li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and this Decree was made while</HI> Augustus <HI>was yet absent.</HI> Accord∣ingly we find that <HI>Ulpian</HI> the great Lawyer delivers it for a Rule of the Civil Law; <HI>Princeps Legibus solutus est</HI>▪ The Prince is not bound by the Laws.</P>
<P>So that upon these Principles all Kings are not only discharged from the <HI>Penalty,</HI> but also the very <HI>Obligation</HI> of observing Laws farther than they shall think sit. And indeed this Author carries this Prerogative beyond what the most moderate <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours ever pretended to, as I can ea∣sily shew you from your own <HI>Civil Law-Books</HI>; and therefore pray reach me down your Volume of the <HI>Code,</HI> and fee here what the Emperour declares on this matter <HI>de Testamentis.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 3. <HI>Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>T.</HI> 23.</NOTE> <HI>Ex imperfecto Testamento nec Imperatorem haereditatem vindicare posse, sape constitutum est, licet enim Lex Imperii Solennibus juris Imperatorem sol∣verit; Nihil tamen tam proprium Imperii est, quàm Legibus vivere.</HI> See likewise in the <HI>Theodosian Code,</HI> these words; <HI>Digna vox est Maje∣state Regnantis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>C. de Legibus l.</HI> 4. <HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>T.</HI> 14.</NOTE> <HI>Legibus alligatum se Principis prositeri, aded de Authoritate juris, nosira pendet Authoritas, &amp; re vera ma∣jus Imperio est submittere Legibus Principatum, &amp; oraculo praesentis Edicti quod nobis licere non patimur, aliis indicamu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, (viz.

<P>So that you may here see, that even the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours were more modest than to declare themselves discharged by their Prerogative, or thought of any of these subtile distinctions of this Author from their obliga∣tion to the Laws, however they were from the Penalty; which is the true sense of this phrase of being <HI>Legibus solutus.</HI></P>
<P>But God be thanked, most of our own Kings have been more conscien∣tious than to maintain that they were not bound by their <HI>Coronation Oath</HI> farther than they pleased. For you may see in the Pre∣amble to the <HI>Statute of Provisours</HI> made in the 25th of <HI>Ed.</HI> 3d.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rastal, s.</HI> 99.</NOTE> where it is declared and acknowledged by the King himself, and both Houses of Parliament, that the <HI>Right</HI> of the <HI>Crown of England,</HI> and the <HI>Law of the Realm</HI> is such, that upon the <HI>Mischiefs</HI> and <HI>Da∣mages</HI> which happen to the Realm, he <HI>ought,</HI> and was <HI>bound</HI> of his said People in his Parliament thereof to make Remedy, and Law, in voiding the <HI>Mischiefs</HI> which come thereof: And the King seeing the <HI>Mischiefs,</HI> and <HI>Damage</HI> aforesaid, and having regard to the said Statute (<HI>scil.</HI> the former <HI>Statute of Provisours</HI>) he here farther acknowledges, <HI>that he is bound by his Oath</HI> to do the same to be kept, as the <HI>Law of his Realm,</HI> tho' by sufferance and negligence it hath been hitherto attempted to the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="73"/>So likewise King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth declares in full Parlia∣ment, (as appears by the Parliament Roll) that whereas the Commons in Parliament had granted,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot.

<P>I will not affirm, but Sir <HI>R F.</HI> observing how much the Kings Pre∣rogative was run down by the long Parliament and how the least Slips, and Miscarriages in Government were aggravated by the Demogogues that then Domineered, as open and violent breaches of his Coronation Oath, might be willing to make the best defence he could for such Miscarriages, and this Treatise of <HI>Patriarcha</HI> being a Posthumous piece, perhaps he would have al∣tered many things in it, had he lived to publish it himself; but I doubt not, but he was a very honest Man, and meant well to the Kingdom for all that.

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll assure you Sir, I shall not, because he hath been dead many years, and therefore I had much rather censure his Writings, than his Person, which I never knew. But, if I may Judge from his Works, he was certainly no Friend to Parliaments, or the Power of the Laws above the Prerogative: But that I may also shew you how dangerous, and Derogatory his Opinions like∣wise are to the Titles of all Soveraign Princes, and Monarchs, now in the World, however he may seem to write in their defence; pray turn to his <HI>Patr. Chap.</HI> 1. Par. 9. and to a Question, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> becomes of the Right of Fatherhood in case the Crown escheat for want of an H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir</HI>; he thus replies, which pray read. It is but the Negligence, or Ignorance of the People <HI>to lose the Knowledge of the true Heir: For an Heir there always is; If</HI> Adam <HI>himself were still living, and now ready to dye, it is certain there is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Man, and but one in the World, who is next. Heir, altho' the Knowledge who should be that one man be quite lost.</HI> The which he likewise repeats to the same Effect, in his Treatise of the Anarchy of a limi∣ted, or mixed Monarchy. Pray see the place, and read these words. <HI>It is a truth undeniable,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Miscel. p. 273.</NOTE> <HI>that there cannot be a Multitude of Men whatso∣ever, either great or small, tho' gathered together from the several Cor∣ners, and remotest Regions in the World; but that in the same Multi∣tude considered by it self, there is one Man amongst them, that in Nature hath a Right to be the King of all the rest, as being the next Heir to</HI> Adam, <HI>and the other Subject unto him; every Man by Nature is a King, or a Subject.</HI> So that I think no Kings in the World being able to deduce their Pedigree from <HI>Adam</HI> (of whom there can be but one Right Heir) they all (or at least all but one) are only Kings <HI>de Facto,</HI> and not <HI>de Iure,</HI> and Usurpers upon this Heir of <HI>Adam.</HI> So that, if God would but be pleased to reveal, who this next Heir is, all the Kings of the Earth were bound in Conscience to lay their Crowns at his Feet: tho' he were but a Cobler, or a Link-boy. How ridiculous a Notion this is I leave it to any indifferent Man to Judge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope this opinion is like to have no very ill effect, unless any
<PB N="126" REF="74"/>
Prince by vertue of this Title of <HI>Adams</HI> Right Heir should pretend a Right to an Universal Monarchy, and then I think it were but reasonable, he should be put to make out his Title; but seeing no body doth so, to the best of my Knowledge, it is but reasonable that all Princes should in the mean time enjoy what they are in lawful Possession of, till this Heir of <HI>Noah</HI> hath made out his Title, and then they may consider farther of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it is very well, that this Right Heir is not to be found, for if he were, all Princes would be Usurpers, who did not immediately resign to him. But this Doctrine is of more fatal consequence than you imagine: For it doth not only concern Princes in respect of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Right Heir only, but also of any other Right Heirs to Princes, who have lost their Right to a Crown, never so many Ages ago: For look into his Directions for Obedience in doubtful times, and read this Passage: <HI>By humane Positive Laws, a Possession time out of Mind takes away, or Bars a former Right, to avoid a general Mischief of bringing all Right into a Disputation not decideable by proof, and consequently to the overthrow of all Civil Government in Grants, Gifts, and Contracts between Man and Man; but in Grants, and Gifts that have their Original from God, or Nature (as the Power of a Father hath) no Inferiour Power of Man can limit, nor make any Law of Prescription against them. Upon this ground is built that</HI> Nullum tempus occurrit Regi, <HI>no time Barrs a King.</HI> And a little before, he gives us this reason of it. For tho' by humane Laws a long Prescription may take away Right; yet a Divine Right never dies, nor can be lost or taken away. By which Principle, he renders the Titles of most (if not all) of the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> at this day very weak and disputable; whenever any other Person shall set up a Title against them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Sir <HI>R. F.</HI> hath found a very good Expedient for this, for he tells us, in the last cited Discourse <HI>that the Paternal Power cannot be lost, tho' it may ei∣ther be transferred, or usurped</HI>; and in his Anarchy of a limited Monarchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>pag.</HI> 273.</NOTE> he thus more at large expresses it. <HI>Many times by the Act either of an Usurper himself, or of those that set him up, the true Heir of a Crown is dispossessed, God using the Ministry of the wickedest Man for the removing, and setting up of Kings, in such Cases, the Subjects Obedience to the Father∣ly Power must go along, and wait upon Gods Providence, who only hath right to give and take away Kingdoms, and thereby to adopt Subjects into the Obedience of another Fatherly Power. And Lastly in his Discourse of Obedience,</HI> &amp;c. he more clearly f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tleth this Point in answer to an Objection there made, that most Kings now in the World have no other Titles to their Crowns but Conquest, or Usurpation; he replieth, <HI>That tho' all Kings were Usurpers, yet still the first Usur∣per hath the best Tale, being in Possession by the Permission of God; and where an Usurper hath continued so long, that the Knowledge of the Right Heir is lost by the Subjects; in such case the Usurper in Possession is to be taken and reputed by such Subjects for the true Heir, and is to be obey'd by them as their Father.</HI> And I think you your self will not deny, but that Kingdoms may be transferred from one Prince to another by Conquest, or a long Usurpation; and that when there is no other, better Title extant, the King in Possession, or his Heirs may have a good Title by a long Possession, tho' it began by Usurpation at first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not now time to answer all that your Author hath as falsly, as incoherently said concerning this Subject of Usurpation; and I should be glad to hear you, or any man else that will undertake to defend him, make
<PB N="127" REF="74"/>
him consistent, not only with reason, but with himself in this Discourse you quote, concerning Obedience to Government in doubtful times. For to pass by his unintelligible Notion of supposing two supream Paternal Powers sub∣sisting at once, and each of them laying claim to the Obedience, and Submis∣sion of the Subjects, the former that of the Usurper, <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o being in Possession of the Crown by the permissive Will of God, who hath thought fit to adopt the Subjects into a Fatherly Power,</HI> and the latter, that Paternal Right which he supposes still to remain in the expulsed Prince, and his Heirs for ever. By which means the Allegiance of the Subjects is so divided and perplext, that they can never be able to tell, when the Allegiance to the Right Heir is to take place before that of the Usurper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if you had been pleased better to observe this Discourse, you would find that Sir <HI>R. F.</HI> hath very well obviated this Objecti∣on, as appears by these Words.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. p. 68.</NOTE> <HI>The Right of Fatherly Govern∣ment was ordained by God for the Preservation of Mankind; if it be usurped, the Usurper may be so far obeyed as may tend to the Preservation of the Sub∣jects, who may thereby be enabled to perform their Duty, to the true and right Sove∣reign when time shall serve, in such cases to obey an Usurper is properly to obey the first and Right Governour, who must be presumed to desire the safety of his Subjects. The Command of an Usurper is not to be obeyed in any thing tending to the Destructi∣on of the Governour, whose Being in the first place is to be looked after.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is I confess a very pretty distinction to make the Usurper, who governs, whether the right Heir will or no, yet to do it by his Consent, and that the Subjects when they Act thus do but still obey their rightful Gover∣nour, which supposition would be contradictory to what your Author hath already laid down of the Subjects being adopted into the Obedience of ano∣ther <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atherly. Power by the Usurpa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion; for if it be as he now makes it, they still remain under the Paternal Power of the former Prince and the U∣surper governs only as his Deputy w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich is a very choice refined Notion: By which all men had been obliged in Conscience to yield as full an Obedience to <HI>Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mwell</HI> and the <HI>Rump in all things that did not tend to the Destruction of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Kings Person,</HI> as to him himself, which I suppose you high Royalists will by no means admit of.</P>
<P>But this is not the main matter, that I have to except against, for if the Principles I have read out of that Treatise be true, <HI>That the Right of a Lawful Monarch, and his Right Heirs is a Divine Right, and that no length of time or Pre∣scription can bar it, because a Divine Right never dyes, can be lost, or taken away; till the Knowledge of the Right Heir be lost by all the Subjects</HI>; and till when U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urpers and their Heirs can never acquire an absolute, and indefeasible Right in the Kingdoms they possess; it will certainly follow that the Title that most Princes of Christen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om have to their Crowns, will be hereby rendred dispu∣table, and uncertain, for since this Author acknowledges, that the Titles of most Kings at this day begun by unjust Conquests or Usurpations at first: The Right Heirs of many of which expulsed or deposed Princes are still, or wore lately in being, they might upon this pretence make War upon the Prince in Possession, and his Heirs, to the Worlds end; and tho' I grant, he says, that an Usurper is to be fully obeyed when the Knowledge of the Right Heir is lost by all the Subjects, it is extreamly uncertain, and doubtful, what he means by it: For if he means a personal Knowledge, few ordinary Subjects, but those that have personally known all the Royal Family, can thus know who was

the Right Heir; and so consequently, as soon as ever his Father, or Ancestor that held the Throne, is turned out, or dead, few private Subjects can have any personal knowledge of this Heir. But if he means a Moral, or Traditio∣nal Knowledge, such as is conveyed down to Posterity by History, Authen∣tick Records, or Genealogies; I know not how such a knowledge can ever be said to be lost, as long as such Histories or Memorials remain in being: And that this is so, is apparent, many Princes in <HI>Europe</HI> having upon this ground better Right to the Crowns of some Neighbouring Kingdoms, than those that wear them: And we know that by vertue of such an old Title from <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> the King of <HI>France</HI> looks upon himself to have a good Title to <HI>Alsatia, Flanders,</HI> and all the Low Countries, and as much of <HI>Ger∣many</HI> as he can get: So that I will leave it to your self to judge whether these Principles do not only render the Titles of most Princes doubtful, and un∣certain, but the Subjects Allegiance too.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny but Sir <HI>R. F.</HI> may have carried this Point of Obedi∣ence, and Submission to Usurpers, and of a concurrent Right in the Lawful Monarch, and his Heirs, a little too far. For I think it were much better to suppose with <HI>Grotius,</HI> and other Writers, that after the third Generation, or Succession of the Crown in the Family of the Usurper, they may have a good and perfect Title to their Crowns against the Right Heirs of the Lawful Monarch;) and this I take to be highly reasonable for the Peace, and Wel∣fare of Mankind (than that they should not be always divided in their Al∣legiance between two opposite Princes; but till then I suppose the Subjects are bound to assist, and stand for the Lawful Heir, and his Posterity, as far as is possible, without their own apparent Destruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess this supposition is much more reasonable, than the former, but I should be glad to know by what Law of God, or Nature, the peace∣able possession of a Crown by an Usurper, and his Heirs, just for three Gene∣rations, or Successions, should give a Prince a better Title than Three, or Four years Possession; for God may have declared his Will as sufficiently in that time, as in three or four hundred: And if your reason be good, that it is for the Peace, and Safety of Mankind, that the Title of the Right Heir, should be lost, and extinct after such a time; I cannot see why it should not be more for the Good of Mankind, that their Allegiance should be settled, and ascertained in a far less space, that is, as soon as the Con∣queror, or Usurper is quietly settled in the Throne, and hath received the Consent or Submission of all the Subjects. But I do not desire at present to enter any farther into this knotty Dispute, about <HI>Conquest,</HI> or <HI>Usurpations,</HI> but I rather desire to refer it to our next meeting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, since you will have it so, I yield to it, but in the mean time, I cannot but smile at your great partiality to the People, who upon your Principles, if they have but once given their <HI>Consent</HI> to the <HI>Usurper,</HI> he shall presently have as good a Title as the most Rightful Monarch in the World: So that <HI>Cromwell</HI> having had this <HI>Consent of the People</HI> in his <HI>Mock-Parliament,</HI> had as good a Title as King <HI>Charles II.</HI> So that notwithstanding whatever you may pretend to the contrary, you are no such Enemy to <HI>Usurpers,</HI> as you would make your self: But however, you have no reason in the World (even by your own Principles) to except against this Author's Hypothesis of transferring the Subjects Allegiance by a Conquest, or Usurpation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not deny what you say, but then the Conquest must be in a Just,
<PB N="129" REF="75"/>
or Lawful War, or else if the <HI>Great Turk,</HI> or <HI>French King,</HI> should without any provocation given, make War upon, and Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quer this Kingdom, and use the People with the highest Tyranny, and Cruelty, they must be all bound, in Conscience, not only to become, but continue absolute Subjects, nay Slaves to such a Conqueror, without any Resistance. But let the <HI>Power of Usurpers,</HI> or <HI>Conquerors,</HI> be what it will, I am sure it cannot be that of <HI>Paternal Authori∣ty,</HI> for the reasons already given, nor can it be the <HI>Usurpa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion,</HI> or <HI>Acquisition</HI> of the Power of a Master of a Family, for then the Subjects not being the Chil∣dren of the Conqueror, or Usurper, must be all Slaves instead of Subjects: So that I must again tell you, that it is from your want of distinguishing be∣tween <HI>Paternal, Masterly,</HI> and <HI>Rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Authority,</HI> which hath led you into all these mistakes in this matter: For the Relations of a Father, a Master, and a King, are all really distinct, and different, so that one of them is not the other, as any Man may easily perceive that doth but hear the three names pronounced to him, and consider their signification: And therefore quitting this Subject for the present, if you have any better Arguments to prove your <HI>Divine Institution</HI> of <HI>Monarchy,</HI> pray produce them, for it grows late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall readily obey your Commands, but pray Sir, in the mean time remember, that we reassume this Question the next time we meet. But to come to the matter in hand, I think there are yet some material Arguments behind, to prove <HI>Monarchical Government</HI> of <HI>Divine Institution.</HI> For in the first place you may please to remember, that you your self have acknowledged, that all <HI>Civil Government</HI> proceeds from God. Secondly, You have likewise admitted, that the <HI>Government of Fathers,</HI> or <HI>Heads of Families,</HI> was the <HI>first and most Antient Government</HI> of any in the World after the Fall; when some Go∣vernment became necessary for the punishment of offences, and the re∣straining of the inordinate Appetites, and Passions of Mankind. And lastly, That this Government having absolute Power of Life, and Death, in some cases over the Wife, Children and Servants of the Family; and that if this Power is conferred upon them by God (which you likewise granted) and doth not depend upon the consent, or compact of the Wife, Children, and Servants: If these things were so, I leave it to your self to consider, from the Premises, whether this Power in Heads, or Fathers of Families (call them which you please) is not a <HI>Monarchical Power,</HI> or the Government of one Man, and that ordained by God; and that this was the only Government in the World, before the <HI>Institution of Common-Wealths,</HI> you your self cannot deny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall shew you plainly, that you would impose a Fallacy either up∣on your self, or me in this Argument, and such a one which I have likewise already answered at our last meeting. For I then told you, that the Govern∣ment of such Heads or Fathers of Families, was only an <HI>Oeconomical,</HI> and not a <HI>Civil Power</HI>; and this I proved by divers Arguments against what you then argued to the contrary; and therefore I think I may yet safely affirm, that <HI>Kingly,</HI> or <HI>Monarchical Power,</HI> cannot be proved to be of <HI>Divine Institution,</HI> by this Argument: And I have a greater Man than Sir <HI>R. F. viz.</HI> the Judicious Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> on my side, who makes a plain distinction between such a Head, or Master of a Family, and a King, as appears by these words in his Ecclesi∣astical Policy, which I desire you would read with me; <HI>It is no improbable Opinion therefore,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hooker's Eccl. Pol. lib.</HI> 1. § 10.</NOTE> <HI>which the Arch-Philosopher was of, That the Chief person in every Houshold was always as it were a King; so when numbers of Housholds joyned themselves in Civil
<PB N="130" REF="76"/>
Societies together, Kings were the first kind of Governours amongst them; which is also as it seems the reason why the name of Fathers continued still in them, who of Fathers were made Rulers; as also the Antient Customs of Governours to do as</HI> Mel∣chisedeck, <HI>as being Kings to exercise the Office of Priests, (which Fathers did at the first) gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, perhaps by the same occasion. Howbeit this is not the only kind of Regiment, that hath been received in the World; the inconveniences of one kind have caused sundry others to be divised. So that in a word all</HI> Civil Regiment, <HI>of what kind soever, seems evidently to have risen from the deliberate Advice, Consul∣tation, and Composition, between Men judging it convenient, and helpful, there being no impossibility in Nature considered by it self, but that Man might have lived with∣out any</HI> Publick Regiment. So that you may see, that tho he places the Ori∣ginal of all Governments in the Heads, or Fathers of Families (which Opi∣nion I shall not oppose;) yet it is plain▪ that he makes a clear distinction between <HI>Oeconomical Government,</HI> and that <HI>Politique</HI> or <HI>Civil Power</HI> which arises from Compact <HI>between Men.</HI> So that this will not serve the purpose you bring it for. You may now proceed to what other Arguments, and In∣stances you please; but pray do not make use any more of the Examples of the Patriarchs either before, or after the Flood; since they are either altoge∣ther uncertain, or else as to those after the Flood▪ I have proved them to have been not Kings, but only Masters of separate Families. And you may likewise omit <HI>Moses, Ioshuah,</HI> and the Judges, as Instances of <HI>Monarchical Power</HI> by <HI>Divine Institution</HI>; since I have so lately proved their Authority, not to have been at all Absolute, or Regal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not any longer insist upon them, since you will not admit of those Instances, tho' I think there may be a great deal of weight in them. But this much I suppose you cannot deny, as well from the Testimony of Sacred, as Prophane History, that <HI>Monarchy</HI> is the first and most antient Govern∣ment in the World, as appears by those remains we have left concerning the <HI>Egyptian,</HI> and <HI>Assyrian Monarchies.</HI> And as for the Government of Gods own People the Jews, he was pleased to be King over them himself, tho' to Go∣vern by his Viceroys, till such time as he was pleased to make <HI>Saul,</HI> and <HI>Da∣vid</HI> Kings over them. Now what can be a greater argument than this for the <HI>Divine Institution</HI> of <HI>Monarchical Government.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you will not urge the Antiquity of a Government to be a mark of its <HI>Divine Institution</HI>; it may indeed be an argument to prove that <HI>Monarchy</HI> was the most <HI>Natural Government,</HI> because the most simple, and easie for Men to light on; and so no doubt it was, in the first Ages of the World, before <HI>Ambition, Avarice,</HI> and <HI>Luxury</HI> had debauched the Minds of Monarchs, the best sort of Government. And so on the other side, there is this to be objected against it, that the setting up of so many Common-wealths upon the Ruines of Monarchies, shewed that Men found great Mischiefs, and Inconve∣niences in that sort of Government when once it grew <HI>Tyrannical,</HI> or else they had never departed from it. And this made them, as <HI>Brutus</HI> said, at the beginning of the <HI>Roman</HI> Common-Wealth, to invent other sorts of Govern∣ment which might partake of all the Benefits without the Inconveniences of <HI>Absolute Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>But as for your Instance of God's being himself King over the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> this touches not the Question in hand, since that being a <HI>Theocratical,</HI> and not a <HI>Civil Common-Wealth,</HI> could concern no other Nation but them∣selves. And as for your other Instance of God's making <HI>Saul</HI> King, I hope you
<PB N="131" REF="76"/>
will not bring that for an Argument of his Approbation, which it appears he was so angry with the <HI>Israelites</HI> for desiring. And though it is true, he did, at their Request, make them a <HI>King</HI>; yet it is apparent, God would have been much better pleased, had they still continued without one. So that I think there can no Conclusive Argument be drawn from any Exam∣ples in the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> to prove <HI>Monarchical Government</HI> to be of <HI>Divine Institution.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; However slight you make of my Authorities out of the <HI>Old Testament</HI>; yet I hope I shall be able to shew more cogent ones out of the <HI>New,</HI> to prove, that <HI>Monarchy</HI> is the only Power Instituted; or so much as taken Notice of by our Saviour <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles.</HI> And therefore when he would Command the <HI>Pharisees</HI> to yield Obedience to the Supreme Power then in Being, He bids them, upon their shewing him a Piece of Mony, <HI>To render to</HI> Caesar <HI>the things that are</HI> Caesar'<HI>s.</HI> Not taking any notice of the <HI>Senate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matt.</HI> 22.21. <HI>F. P. O.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>People,</HI> whose Authority these <HI>Caesars</HI> had Usurped. And if St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in his <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> had only said, <HI>Let every Soul be subject to the Higher Powers,</HI> and said no more; then Men might indeed have disputed, whether St. <HI>Paul,</HI> by <HI>Higher Powers,</HI> had not meant as well other Governours, as <HI>Kings,</HI> or other Forms of <HI>Government,</HI> as <HI>Monarchy.</HI> But the good luck is, St. <HI>Paul</HI> hath been his own Interpreter; for, after the General Doctrin of <HI>Obedience</HI> to be given by all Men to the <HI>Higher Powers,</HI> he proceeds next to charge it home upon each particular Man's Conscience, under pain of Damnation, saying, <HI>Wilt thou not be afraid of the Power?</HI> which Power he expounds in the Singular number, restraining it to one Person; <HI>He is the Minister of God to thee,</HI> &amp;c. It is not, <HI>They are the Ministers:</HI> And then again▪ <HI>He beareth not the Sword in vain</HI>; And a third time, in the same <HI>Verse,</HI> lest we should forget it, he says, <HI>for he is the Minister of God,</HI> &amp;c. So St. <HI>Peter</HI> also doth the like; for the self-same word that St. <HI>Paul</HI> useth for higher, in St. <HI>Peter</HI> is Translated Supream: So that though in our <HI>English</HI> Bibles the words differ, yet in the Original they are both the same; And St. <HI>Paul</HI> might have been <HI>Englished, Let every Soul be subject to the Supreme Powers</HI>; or St. <HI>Paul</HI> might have been also Translated, <HI>whether to the King as to the Higher.</HI> Yet there is this difference; That where∣as St. <HI>Paul</HI> useth the word in the Plural number, St. <HI>Peter</HI> hath it in the Sin∣gular, and with Application to the <HI>King</HI> only, without taking any notice of any Governours but Kings, and those sent by them. And it is farther to be noted, that St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> Wrote their <HI>Epistles</HI> at a time when the <HI>Ro∣man Senate</HI> had some share in the Government; and that it was (in appear∣ance at least) a <HI>Common-wealth.</HI> So that some Authors suppose, that not∣withstanding the Emperors, by strong hand, had Usurped a Military Power, yet a great share of the <HI>Government</HI> was, for a long time, nay even then in the <HI>Senate</HI> and <HI>People.</HI> But for all this, neither of the two <HI>Apostles</HI> take any Notice of any such <HI>Popular Government.</HI> No nor our <HI>Saviour</HI> himself, who divideth all between <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Casar,</HI> and allows nothing, that we can find, for the <HI>People,</HI> or <HI>Common-wealth.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think your Quotations out of the <HI>New Testament</HI> will prove of no more weight than those from the <HI>Old,</HI> and that they will not make out <HI>Mo∣narchy</HI> to be of <HI>Divine Institution,</HI> any more than the former. For our <HI>Savi∣our</HI>'s Answer to the <HI>Iews</HI> signifieth no more, than that <HI>Tribute,</HI> and all <HI>Law∣ful Dues</HI> were to be pay'd to <HI>Caesar,</HI> as the <HI>Supreme Power</HI> then in being; to
<PB N="132" REF="77"/>
Answer those <HI>Iews,</HI> who doubted, whether any Obedience were to be given to a Forreign Prince of another Religion than their own. The like Answer may be given to what St. <HI>Paul</HI> says in the <HI>Romans Let every Soul be subject to the Highest Power</HI>; which was chiefly directed to the Newly-converted <HI>Iews,</HI> who might doubt as well as their Country-men in <HI>Iudea,</HI> whether they were bound in Conscience to be subject to Heathen Magistrates; As also against the Sect of the <HI>Gnosticks</HI> (then newly sprung up) who, though they called themselves <HI>Christians,</HI> yet looked upon themselves to be thereby discharged from all Subjection or Obedience to Civil Powers; being those whom St. <HI>Iude</HI> expresly speaks against,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iude</HI> 8.</NOTE> <HI>Who despise Dominion, and speak evil of Dignities.</HI> And therefore when St. <HI>Paul</HI> speaks of such <HI>Higher Powers,</HI> it is not in the Plural, but Singular Number; Terming him, <HI>the Minister of God</HI>; because, that at that time, there was no such thing as a <HI>Common wealth</HI> (as he knew of in the World) the two greatest Empires, the <HI>Roman,</HI> and the <HI>Parthian,</HI> being then Govern'd by <HI>Monarchs.</HI> The like I may say to that other Text you have quoted out of St. <HI>Peter</HI>; which may very well be reconciled with that place of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> though the one called the Higher Powers, <HI>the Powers ordained of God</HI>; and the other calls them, <HI>an Humane Ordinance,</HI> or Creature (as it is in the Ori∣ginal) since they certainly derive their Authority from God, though by the Mediation, or Consent of Men.</P>
<P>And I believe you will prove mistaken, in affirming, that the Senate, or People had any Power when St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> Wrote these <HI>Epistles.</HI> For it plainly appears that whether these <HI>Epistles</HI> were Written in the Reigns of <HI>Claudius</HI> or <HI>Nero</HI> the Government was then wholly in the <HI>Roman Emperours</HI>; For though I grant, that during the time of <HI>Augustus,</HI> the Senate had some shadow of Power, and that divers Provinces were under their Government; yet by that time <HI>Tiberius</HI> had Reigned but a few years, he quite took away all Power from the Senate, and made them no more, than what the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> are to the <HI>French</HI> King, meer Ministers of his Tyranny, and oblig'd to verify all his Edicts; and the Compliance and Flattery of these Senators was so servile, that they passed whatsoever Decrees he sent them, without the least Hesitation; till it became so fulsome even to himself, that it made him cry out, <HI>O Gens in servitute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> natapunc;</HI> So that all you have said on this Sub∣ject, signifies no more, than that our Saviour and his Apostles did not come into the World to dissolve, or alter the Civil Governments, or the Policies of Kingdoms, but to Command Obedience to them▪ as they found them setled in the World, as the Moderate <HI>Mela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cthon</HI> very well observes, <HI>Christus non venit mutaré Politias.</HI></P>
<P>And I doubt not, but if our blessed Saviour had thought sit to come into the World about half an Age sooner, and to have been Born, and Preached the Gospel in the time of the <HI>Roman Common-wealth,</HI> but he would have com∣manded the <HI>Iews</HI> to have paid Tribute to the <HI>Senate,</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> as well as he did to <HI>Caesar.</HI> And S. <HI>Peter</HI> would have enjoyned all Subjection, and Obedience to be given them; and might have said with greater Reason of them, than of those Subordinate Magistrates they sent to Govern their Pro∣vinces, <HI>that they were the Ministers of God▪</HI> And if your Arguments for the <HI>Divine Right</HI> of Kings be true, it would be no Rebellion at this day for Sub∣jects to rise up, and destroy the Supreme Powers in all <HI>Common-wealths,</HI> be∣cause they are not <HI>Monarchical</HI>; And consequently those in Relation to whom
<PB N="133" REF="77"/>
God hath left us no Rules of Obedience. Which Doctrine, if any Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> offer to Preach in the Territories of <HI>Venic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI>; I think, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Preacher might very deservedly be sent to the Gallies: and, in the lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, they would, at least, send him a pair of Shoes. But if you have any thing fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ther to urge for the <HI>Iure Divinoship</HI> of <HI>Monarchy,</HI> pray will you let me hear it, for I am weary with Answering such <UNCLEAR>Trifles</UNCLEAR>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess I have not much to object against what you have now reply∣ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> therefore I shall insist no farther upon it; only thus much I am satisfi∣ed of; That God, by his own Example, as well as Institution among the <HI>Iews,</HI> seems more particularly to have approved of Kingly Government (and that ab∣solute too) than any other; not that I will condemn all <HI>Common wealths,</HI> as un∣law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> but that as being <HI>Soveraign Powers,</HI> they may be also Ordained of God.</P>
<P>But I have another Objection to make against your <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> and that is, you have in your former Conversation supposed a Natural Property in things, Pre∣cedent to Civil Government, which can scarce be understood. For by what Rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t can any Man lay claim to any Property, but by the Laws of the Govern∣ment in which he lives?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. P. P.</HI></NOTE> And how can there be any such Laws before there was some Supreme Legislator to make them? So that the only way (I know of) to solve this difficulty, is to suppose. That the Sole Dominion of things was in <HI>No∣ah</HI> after the Floud; And that whatsoever Property, in any thing, his Posterity possest in Several, they enjoyed it by his Grant and Allotment; and, in vertue thereof, Transmitted the same to their Posterity, without waiting for the Electi∣on, or Consent of the People, or entring into any Articles of Capitulation with them, whom they were to Govern; as you suppose was necessary for the Insti∣tution of <HI>Civil Government.</HI> And the Texts, in the Tenth of <HI>Genesis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vers.</HI> 5.32.</NOTE> seem to import as much. <HI>By these were the Isles of the Gentiles divided in their Lands, every one after his Tongue, after their F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ilies in their Nations. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ese <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Families of the Sons of</HI> Noah,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vers.</HI> 32.</NOTE> <HI>after their Generations in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Nations; and by these were the Nations divided in the Earth after the Floud.</HI> That is, not only the Nations themselves, but the <HI>Isles</HI> or <HI><UNCLEAR>Countries</UNCLEAR></HI> of the Earth were divided by these <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> amongst their Posterities, into particular <UNCLEAR>States</UNCLEAR> and Territories.</P>
<P>And so likewise in all the Absolute Monarchies in the World; all the Pro∣perty that Men enjoy either in Goods or Lands, is either Actually in the Prince, or else was at first derived from him; though I do not deny, but when such a distinct Propriety in Goods, or Lands, is once Instituted by the <HI>Monarch</HI> in any Kingdom, that he cannot again alter it, or take it away without manifest Violence and Injustice.</P>
<P>And hence it is that our Common <HI>Lawyers</HI> maintain, That all the Lands in <HI>England</HI> are held of the King, either mediately, or immediately. For upon the Conquest by <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, all Mens Estates were thereby Vested in him: So that there is no way so natural, and easie to solve all those Difficulties that do arise concerning the Original of <HI>Civil Government</HI> and <HI>Property,</HI> than to make them begin together in the Persons of <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> and thence de∣riv'd to all their Posterity. So that whatsoever absolute Dominion <HI>Princes</HI> or <HI>States</HI> have claimed in those Countries, and Places which they have either seiz'd upon themselves, as the first Occupants, or else have Conquer'd from o∣thers, they enjoy'd them meerly as they represented <HI>Adam</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> the First Mo∣narchs of the World. Nor can we other way avoid these several other intole∣rable
<PB N="134" REF="78"/>
Inconveniences, and Absurdities that will follow from supposing an Ori∣ginal Community of things, or that every Man at first might take what quantity of Land he pleas'd, without the Authority or Assignment of any Supreme Power.</P>
<P>As to what you say, concerning God's approving Monarchy above all other Governments, by his Instituting it among the <HI>Iews</HI>; that way of Arguing is ve∣ry uncertain and fallacious; since one may, by the same reason argue, That the <HI>Ceremonial</HI> part of the <HI>Mosaical Law</HI> was the best that God could have contrived, because he was pleased to prescribe it to the <HI>Iews,</HI> during the time they should be under the Government of it: no doubt God prescribed them such a Govern∣ment both in Church and State, as he thought fit for their present occasion, and Inclinations; but whether that were the best, or of perpetual Institution, is no where said. But as for the other part of your Argument;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought you had been very well satisfied by what I said at our first Meeting, That neither <HI>Adam,</HI> nor <HI>Noah,</HI> had by Grant or Donation from God, a Sole right to the Earth and all things therein. But since you are not yet satisfied with what I there said, I shall Answer this Objection more particularly, and I doubt not but I shall make it so plain to you, that you your self shall confess, That there is no such great Mystery, or Difficulty in the Tracing of <HI>Property,</HI> as also <HI>Civil Government</HI> to their first Origina's, without supposing any such Absolute Dominion, or Property in <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> or in any other Supreme Power, as their Successors. I shall therefore first of all remove the main Obstacle you have laid in the way, and shew you, that the places of Scripture you have cited to this purpose, do not prove the thing you intend them for: I did before shew you, That there was no manner of Ground for Sir <HI>R. F</HI>'s. Opinion, That none of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sons could have a Property in any thing, without <HI>Adam</HI>'s Assignment; nor that any of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Sons, when separated from their Fathers Family, could have any <HI>Property</HI> in any thing but by their Fathers Donation; <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>An∣tient History</HI> being altogether silent in these matters. And therefore you are fain to lay hold of the first place of <HI>Scripture</HI> that you think might serve your turn, which will not do the Business neither.</P>
<P>For supposing I should grant you, that in the Dispersion, or Division, that was made of Mankind after the Floud, over a great part of the World, the <HI>Peo∣ple</HI> that then followed their Ancestors, or Leaders, after this Dispersion (though the Text doth not mention any such thing) followed them as <HI>Princes</HI> or <HI>Mo∣narchs.</HI> Yet this will not prove what you would have, That these Fathers of <HI>Nations</HI> made this Division of the Earth, in Right of that Dominion, which God conferred at first on <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah.</HI> Since (as I have already proved) if this Division had been made in Right of the Dominion that descended upon <HI>Noah,</HI> it ought to have been performed by the Authority of only one Man, and him the Eldest Descendant of the Eldest Son of <HI>Noah</HI>: And I have also sufficiently shewed you the absurdity of this Fancy of such a <HI>Divine Right.</HI> And besides, it plainly contradicts its self; for either this Division you talk of, was made in the days of <HI>Noah,</HI> or it was not; if the latter, then it is apparent, that from the time of <HI>Noah</HI> to that of <HI>Heber,</HI> there was a Community of things, and <HI>Pro∣perties</HI>; though you have asserted the contrary: If the former, and that the Earth was divided before, Then to what purpose was this Division in the days of <HI>Peleg</HI>▪ And though I grant, that about that time, every Language, or Na∣tion, might, under the Conduct of their <HI>Prince,</HI> or <HI>Leader,</HI> seize upon some Territory, or Island, sufficient for them to Inhabit in; Yet doth not the Text tell us, whether the Countrey they lived in was by them divided into particu∣lar
<PB N="135" REF="78"/>
shares, or whether they made use of it in common, as the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> do at this day, where the Quantity of Land doth far exceed that of the Inhabitants that live in it.</P>
<P>Nor lastly, Supposing that a Division was made of these Countries, they then in∣habited, doth it tell us, whether it was done by the <HI>Sole Authority</HI> of their Prince, or Leader, claiming as his own the whole Dominion of it; so that no Man could have Right to a foot of Ground in it, but himself; or whether this Division was made by the Joynt Consent and Agreement of all the rest of the Heads of Families, and other Freemen that went along with him. The Scripture is silent in these Circum∣stances, that only telling us that the Great Grand-sons of <HI>Noah</HI> mentioned, <HI>Gen.</HI> 10. <HI>The Isles of the Gentiles were divided in their Lands, every one after his Tongue, after their Families in their Nations.</HI> And that this Division was in the days of <HI>Peleg,</HI> but no where declares whether every particular Region, or Countrey was then divided in∣to distinct Shires, or not.</P>
<P>And as for what you say, that all Princes and Conquerors of Territories, and Countries, have the like Absolute Dominion and Property in them as <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI> had over the whole World, if it were no more than that, I doubt it would be very little, since I have already proved, and I think you must grant, that no Monarch at this day can claim his Crown as the Right Heir of <HI>Adam,</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> or as their Representatives, and it will, I think, be much harder to prove, that the <HI>Sole Property</HI> of an acquired Country, or Kingdom, must be in them by vertue of any such Right: But as for your Instance of <HI>William the Conqueror</HI>'s having a Right to all the Lands in <HI>England</HI> by Conquest; since it requires somewhat a longer Answer, than the time will now afford, I shall refer speaking farther of it, till another oppor∣tunity: But pray Sir, at present, make me see a little plainer what those Inconve∣niences, and Absurdities are, that will follow from my Hypothesis, that God at first gave the World, and all Creatures therein to Mankind, to be used and enjoyed in common if they thought fit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall shew you some farther Absurdities that will follow from it, than I have done already; For tho' <HI>Grotius</HI> and <HI>Selden</HI> indeed maintain, that a Community of things was by the Law of Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. O. G. p.</HI> 48.</NOTE> of which God is the Author, and yet that such a Community should not be able to continue, seems to derogate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the <HI>Providence of God,</HI> to ordain a Com∣munity of things, which could not continue. And it seems also an Act of high pre∣sumption in the Descendants of <HI>Noah,</HI> to abrogate the <HI>Natural Law of Community</HI> by introducing that of a Propriety in things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray give me leave to interrupt you, that you may not run on in a mistake; for let <HI>Grotius,</HI> or <HI>Selden</HI> assert what they please, I am not tied to submit to it; and therefore when I say, that God gave the World, and all the Creatures therein to Men to be used in common if they please, I thereby understood, that God hath by the <HI>Laws of Nature</HI> commanded nothing in this matter, but hath left the Earth, and all things therein, to be used in common, or in several, as may best consist with the Convenience, Necessity, or Customs and Laws of each particular Nation, or Com∣mon-Wealth, who God designs should live peaceably together, and make the best use of the Country where they inhabit, and the things therein contained, for their own common maintenance, and safety; according to the expression of the Royal <HI>Psalmist; But the Earth hath God given to the Children of Men, i. e.</HI> all the Descendants of <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, suppose it were so, the prime Duties of the <HI>Second Table</HI> are chiefly
<PB N="136" REF="79"/>
conversant about this <HI>Right of Propriety,</HI> but if this <HI>Propriety</HI> were introduced by <HI>Human Laws,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Agreements,</HI> as <HI>Grotius,</HI> and you your self suppose, then both the <HI>Moral,</HI> and <HI>Divine Law</HI> would depend upon the <HI>Will of Men,</HI> so that there could be no <HI>Law of Nature</HI> against <HI>Adultery,</HI> or <HI>Theft,</HI> if Women, and all things else had been in common.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Objection wholy proceeds from your not having any distinct, or true Notions of the Nature and true Original of Propriety; and therefore if you please to hear my Account of it, I hope you will grant (when I have done) that your Objection against the Community or things, will be to no purpose; I do therefore in the first place distinguish between a <HI>Natural</HI> and a <HI>Civil Propriety</HI>: By the former M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n might be guilty of <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> before <HI>Civil Propriety</HI> was instituted; But as for <HI>Adultery</HI>▪ that was always unlawful both by the Laws of God, and Nature, which abh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs Community of Women, and Promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uous Copulations; and God hath particularly, ordained that <HI>the Man and his Wife should be one Hesh,</HI> and no Man that maintains a Natural Community of things, ever supposed that Women were amongst those things that were to be in common, or that a Man had the same kind of Propriety in his Wife, as in his Horse, so that the Command against <HI>Adultery</HI> might very well consist with the Community of things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose I grant this, I do not understand how there can be a Natural Propriety, and yet a Community in things as you suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder you should not be able to apprehend this, and have been so often at an Ordi∣nary, and a Play-house▪ at the former you know, tho' a Man hath a Right to his Dinner, yet all the Meat at the Table being in common▪ he cannot call any part of it his own, till he hath cut it, or di∣vided it from the rest. And at the latter, a Man hath a Right to a Place, either in the Box, or in the Pit, and yet he cannot tell where it is, till he hath placed himself in it, or sent some body to keep it for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do apprehend what you mean, but pray explain to me the manner of this <HI>Natural Pro∣priety,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little more at large.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would readily do it, since if that were well done, I grant it would be a great step to the clearing of the Original, and Nature of all <HI>Civil Power.</HI> I would readily do it, were it not now too late to enter upon so long a Subject, and therefore I think we may both be sufficiently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Talk, so as to put it off until another opportunity, when I shall give you my thoughts of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Original of <HI>Civil Government,</HI> in what sense it proceeds from God, and yet how far the <HI>Consentus the People</HI> is necessary to make it obligatory on the Consciences of the Subjects; which when it is once well setled, I hope there will be little need of disputing farther whether this <HI>great Alteration</HI> hath been brought about by Lawful means or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for the pains you have taken to inform my understanding in this matter: And therefore since 'tis now very late, I desire we may Adjourn our conversation to another time: And then I desire that you would prepare your self to discourse with me of the second important Question▪ we agreed on, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>irresistibility if all Supreme Powers by their Subjects,</HI> not only be∣cause Resistance in any case whatsoever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inconsistent with Supreme Power, and destructive to the <HI>Peace of Civil Society,</HI> but chiefly as they derive their Authority immediately from God, and are only to render an Account to him of their Actions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not deny but what you have said is true in some sense, <HI>That all Soveraign Power is derived from God, and is also as such irresistible by Subjects.</HI> But to affirm generally and abso∣lutely (as most of your Opinion do) that all Commands and Acts of Men end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d with this Su∣preme Authority, whether good, or bad, lawful or unlawful, are part of that Authority derived from God, and therefore irresistible in any cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or upon any necessity whatsoever, is so dange∣rous a Proposition, that I know none that hath contributed more to the encouragement of the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng and the Popish Faction we favoured, to make all those Breaches upon our Laws▪ Religion and Liberties which we have suffered since the beginning of his Reign.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am so well pleased with the Freeness▪ and Ingenuity of your Conversation, that I de∣sire nothing more than to discuss this important Question with you at our next meeting: But I beg your pardon, if being taken up by Come Business to morrow▪ I adjourn our next meeting to the Day after, when, if you please to come at the same hour at you did to night, you shall here find me ready to wait on you. In the mean time I must bid you good night.</P>

<HEAD>Advertisement to the <HI>READER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Author in relation to this, as well as the subsequent Dialogue, desires you to be so Candid as to believe, that tho' under the Name, of <HI>Free-man,</HI> he hath argued against an Opinion, now, or lately much in vogue, viz. <HI>That an absolute Irresistibility, is an insepable Pre∣rogative of all Soveraign Powers,</HI> as well Monarchies, as Common-Wealths. Yet no man more abhors all unnecessary Resistance, or Rebellion against Supream Civil Magistrates, and is more for an Absolute Sub∣mission by all particular Persons, whether Private, or Publick in case of the highest Injuries and Oppressions done to themselves alone, and where the Common Good of the Community is not immediately concerned, than himself: And this he owns to be their duty, not only out of a generous re∣gard to the Peace, &amp; Tranquillity of the Common-Wealth, whereof they are Members, (&amp; which ought not to be disturbed to revenge, or redress a few Private Injuries,) but also from the express Command of Gods Will Reveal'd in the Holy SS. expresly forbidding, not only all Re∣venge, but self-defence too, whilst the Supream Powers act legally, tho' perhaps contrary to the Strict Rules of Justice, and Equity, in such Particular cases. Yet for all this, the Author must still declare, he doubts whether those Precepts do extend to all Resistance whatever, <HI>viz</HI> of any whole Nation, or great Body of Men, whose Preservation or Freedom from an intolerable slavery, and Oppression may render it necessary for the good of the Common Wealth, and is no other way to be procured but by a Vigorous Resistance, or else joyning with some power∣ful Neighbour Prince, or State, who shall interpose for their deliverance; So that if such a Resistance be ever Lawful, it can be upon no less mo∣mentous an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> account, than that of a <HI>General Invasion,</HI> either of the Lives, Liberties, Religion, or Properties of a whole, or major part of a Nation, as they are established by the Law of Nature, or the Funda∣mental Constitutions, and municpial Laws of those particular Kingdoms, and Common-Wealths, where such an Insupportable Tyranny and Op∣pressions are then exercised: And if this be not Lawful in such extra∣ordinary cases, it would seem as if God had preferred the <HI>unjust Po∣wer,</HI> or Force, and the <HI>outward Grandeur</HI> of the <HI>Governours</HI> before the <HI>good</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> of the <HI>Governed,</HI> which is contrary to the main ends of all Civil Government, <HI>viz.</HI> the common good &amp; Happiness of Mankind, even as those who are most against all Resistance what∣ever must allow.</P>
<P>But whether such Resistance be not in these Cases a Lawful (nay only means) for the safeguard; and deliverance of such assaulted, or Oppressed Nations, the Author leaves it to the Iudgment of the Im∣partial Reader to determine, upon the perusal of this, and the subsequent Discourse (since all that could be urged on both sides in this important
<PB REF="81"/>
Question, could not be comprised, within the limits of one Evenin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> conversation which the Author had prescribed to himself) yet will he not be much concerned on which side you give your sentence.</P>
<P>Since however Criminal some Men have endeavoured to render the Doctrine of Resistance even in the cases proposed; yet the Author must believe (till he is better convinced to the contrary) that the Que∣stion being only Moral, or Political, and not about any point of Faith, or Law, may be safely maintained by either party, without any guilt, either of Heresie, or Treason.</P>
<P>The Author farther desires you to take notice, that tho' he hath in both these subsequent Dialogues, made one of his Disputants to make use, not only of the Arguments, but the very expressions of two Learned, and Reverend Divines, in some late Treatises on this Subject, yet that he hath not acted thus, out of any design of Writing against them, or those Opinions there laid down, as they are theirs, (since it is well known the same Arguments, and Texts of Scripture have been made use of by other Writers on this Subject long before). But as it must be confessed that none have managed this controversie with better Reason, and greater Eloquence, so he hopes that neither they, nor any friend of theirs, will take it amiss, if out of a just value of their Learned Wri∣tings, he hath put that part of the Controversy in their Works, as the best be could meet with, and which he dares not pretend to alter, and as for the Answers, he hath put them, either in his own, or else in the ex∣pressions of one or two late Writers, who have undertaken to answer what they formerly had Written on this Question.</P>
<P>To conclude, since the Author does not take all that those have lay∣ed down on either side, for clear, and unquestionable demonstrations, (for then there would be no need of publishing any more than the Ar∣guments of one side) he hopes neither party will take it ill, if he hath here fairly represented the strongest and most plausible Arguments, that are brought on both sides for what Doctrine soever is true, such Truth will not look the worse, or lose ground if it appears in its true natural dress) tho' set against its opposite Errour: But if a great deal of what hath been layed down by Persons too Violent on either side, appear upon a strict examination to be meer Precarious Opinions; whose best Authority is the great Names of some that have broacht them; He hopes no indif∣ferent Person can take it ill, if he endeavours to discover these mis∣takes, since all men are liable to Errours, and as none can be more sensible of this, than himself, so whenever either of those Learned, and Reverend Persons, or any other shall convince him of any weak or false reasonings in this discourse, he promises to retract them, with he first Opportunity.</P>

<P>You are welcome, Sir, I see you are a punctual Man to your Word. Will you be pleased to sit down by the fire, and drink a dish of <HI>Tea.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, Sir, I assure you, I love to be punctual in small things, as well as in great ones, when I am not hindred, or prevented by business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before we come to the Question, we the last time resolved to make the Subject of our present Entertainment, it will, I think, be convenient for me to look back, and see what I have already proved, at our two former Conferences, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That <HI>Adam</HI> had not, either by <HI>Natural</HI> Right of <HI>Fatherhood,</HI> or by <HI>Positive</HI> Donation from <HI>God,</HI> any such Authority over his Children, or Dominion over the World, as you pretended.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That if he had, yet his Sons, or Heirs, had no Right to it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That if his Heirs had, there being no Law of Nature, nor Positive Law of God, that determines who is the Right Heir in all Cases that may arise, the <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Succession,</HI> and consequently of bearing Rule, could not have been certainly determined, without the Judgment of the rest of the Children, or Descendants of <HI>Adam.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That the knowledge of the <HI>Right Heir</HI> of <HI>Adam,</HI> (supposing still there was one,) being now long since lost, no Prince or Monarch in the World can graft any Title upon this <HI>Paternal</HI> Dominion of <HI>Adam</HI> or <HI>Noah.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That all Authority of inflicting Punishments of Life and Death, or other less Penalties for the Breach of the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> or the Transgressi∣on of the <HI>Civil Laws</HI> of the <HI>Common-wealth</HI> is <HI>originally</HI> derived from God, as being that Power with which God in the State of Nature hath intrusted, all Masters, or Heads of separate Families, and this not as Fathers, but as Masters.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That since all <HI>Kingdoms</HI> and <HI>Commonwealths</HI> at this day do owe their <HI>Ori∣ginal</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="82"/>
either to the <HI>Election</HI> of the People, or to <HI>Usurpation,</HI> or <HI>Conquest</HI>; God doth not <HI>now</HI> by the ordinary Course of his Providence confer this <HI>Divine Au∣thority</HI> on any Persons whatsoever, so as to give them a <HI>Right</HI> to the <HI>People's Allegiance</HI> without the <HI>People's Consent</HI> first had, or else an <HI>Owning</HI> of their Ti∣tles by a Subsequent <HI>voluntary Submission</HI> to them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant indeed, that you have with great labour, and some appea∣rance of reason too, endeavoured to prove those Principles you have here laid down; yet however, tho' the <HI>five first</HI> of them should be true, I have a great deal still to except against the <HI>last,</HI> if you please to hear me. For I think, I can shew you a great many <HI>evil Consequences,</HI> that will follow from this Principle of making the <HI>Consent,</HI> or <HI>Submission</HI> of the People at all neces∣sary to the <HI>Conveying</HI> of a <HI>Supream Power,</HI> or of that <HI>Divine Authority</HI> which you grant to be derived from <HI>God</HI> himself on all Monarchs, and Supream Magistrates in Commonwealths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray give me leave a little to interrupt you. I know very well what this <HI>evil Consequence</HI> is, of supposing the <HI>Consent</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> as a means at all necessary, for the <HI>Conveying</HI> of this <HI>Divine Authority,</HI> that is, in plain English, because it will destroy your <HI>darling Doctrine</HI> of PASSIVE OBEDI∣ENCE and NON-RESISTANCE; therefore if it be so, pray let us rather fall presently to the <HI>Question</HI> it self, than argue by <HI>Consequences,</HI> which if we should go that way to work, I have <HI>my Consequences</HI> likewise to urge; some of which I have given you already. Therefore, if you please, let us begin a fairer way, and hear me propose those <HI>Heads,</HI> in which I doubt not but we do both <HI>agree,</HI> and then I will bring it to the <HI>main Case</HI> or Question, in which perhaps we <HI>differ.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, I had somewhat more to say, which would have tended to prove this Doctrine of <HI>Non-resistance,</HI> but since you are pleased to propose another Method, which you better approve of; I am ready to comply with you. Therefore, <HI>Sir,</HI> go on, in what way you think fit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall then in the <HI>first place</HI> lay it down for a <HI>Principle,</HI> (which I suppose you will not deny) that all <HI>Civil Power</HI> being from <HI>God,</HI> it was <HI>prin∣cipally</HI> instituted by him, for the <HI>Peace, Happiness and Safety of Mankind</HI>; that is, of all the Subjects who are to live together in a Commonwealth, or Civil Society.</P>
<P N="2">2: That all Kings, or <HI>Supream Magistrates,</HI> are likewise secured by <HI>Gods Au∣thority</HI> in those due <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Prerogatives</HI> which are necessary, for their well discharging this great Trust or Duty which God requires of them, and in Consideration of which the <HI>People</HI> at first <HI>Elected,</HI> or <HI>Submitted</HI> themselves to them.</P>
<P>If therefore you grant, as I suppose you will, these two reasonable Propo∣sitions, the Question will amount to no more than this, whether, if the Supream Power in any Kingdom, or Commonwealth, so far abuses <HI>this Trust,</HI> which <HI>God</HI> by the <HI>People</HI> hath committed to them, and instead of pre∣serving and defending the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of their Subjects, they manifestly go about to destroy, or grievously to oppress them, by ma∣king them, instead of Subjects, meer Slaves, and Vassals; the Question, I say then, is, whether, if such violence or oppressions be committed upon the <HI>whole People,</HI> or so <HI>considerable</HI> a part of it, as that the <HI>safety</HI> and <HI>well-being</HI> of
<PB N="147" REF="82"/>
the <HI>whole Commonwealth</HI> cannot in any likelihood subsist without it, the <HI>Peo∣ple,</HI> or such a <HI>considerable</HI> part of them, may not, (in Case their Lives, Li∣berties and Persons are unjustly assaulted, and oppress't by the Officers or <HI>standing Armies</HI> of the Prince, or other <HI>Supream Powers</HI>) for their own de∣fence take up Arms to defend their Lives, Liberties and Estates against such an armed force, and violence. Where, by the way, I desire you to take no∣tice, that I do here asolutely disclaim <HI>all Resistance</HI> of, or Self defence against Civil Authority, or the Officers Commissioned by it, by any <HI>private single</HI> Person, whether such Power be exerted according to Law or not, or else abused in some cases to the hurt or destruction of such single Person only: So that I suppose this <HI>Resistance</HI> to be lawful only in case of a <HI>general Destructi∣on,</HI> or intolerable oppression of the <HI>whole People,</HI> or at least a very considerable part of them, and those that are in the chiefest places of the Administration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess the Doctrine of <HI>Resistance,</HI> as you have put it; seems at first somewhat plausible, and to tend to the <HI>Common Good,</HI> and preservation of the <HI>People,</HI> or <HI>Civil Society.</HI> But let me tell you, I am of opinion, that when ever it comes to be put in practice, it proves (like the other <HI>Speculations</HI> of <HI>Commonwealths-men</HI>) more hurtful than beneficial to the <HI>Common Safety,</HI> and Preservation of the <HI>People</HI>; and consequently more destructive to the <HI>main ends</HI> of Government, than conducive to the <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> of Mankind; and last of all, that such <HI>Resistance</HI> cannot well be maintained, or executed without the <HI>deposing,</HI> or absolute Destruction of the <HI>Prince,</HI> or other Supream Magistrates, whatever may be pretended to the contrary. And indeed it is almost impossible to suppose, that any Monarch or Supream Magistrates, should ever (unless they were stark mad) purposely go about to kill or de∣stroy their Subjects, in the Multitude and Safety of whom, consists his chief Strength, and Riches. And you may as well tell me, that a Shepherd, whilst he is in his right Wits, should go about to kill, or destroy his Flock, as that a Monarch should wilfully intend to kill, or destroy his People.</P>
<P>To conclude, since the People must be in all Cases of <HI>Tyranny,</HI> or <HI>Oppressi∣on</HI> their own <HI>Iudges,</HI> and <HI>Executioners</HI> too, there is <HI>no Rebellion</HI> so rank, and wicked, that this pretence of a <HI>Self-defence</HI> of Men's Lives, Estates, and Liber∣ties may not justifie; whereas indeed, it is contrary to all Natural, and Ci∣vil Justice, for the injured party to be his own Judge, and Executioner too. For then the other side may pretend to the like Right, and the Tryal must be referred to Force, and Arms, in which Contention, if the People are over∣come they are certainly reduced to a worse Condition, than they were be∣fore: But if the Prince, or Supream Magistrates have the worst on't, the Ci∣vil Power then in being is absolutely ruined: So that whether the People, or Magistrate overcome, the state of both of them is very deplorable; besides divers other evil Consequences of this Doctrine, which I shall defer, till I hear what you can say, to what I have now urged against your Opinion.</P>

<P>You have made a very plausible Speech, in setting forth the dread∣ful Consequence of this Doctrine of Resistance in any Case whatsoever; and I confess, if what you lay down be true, <HI>viz.,</HI> that such Resistance always brings along with it greater Misery upon a People, than what the utmost Violence and Oppression of Princes can produce, then your Consequence would be also true, that such Resistance is never to be practised upon any ac∣count whatsoever. So on the other side, if that be not true, neither will your consequence signifie anything.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="83"/>I suppose you will not deny, but that there may be such a thing as a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> and that <HI>that part</HI> of Mankind who live under him may be <HI>sensible</HI> of his <HI>Tyran∣ny,</HI> or else the <HI>Definition</HI> which King <HI>Iames</HI> I▪ gives us of a <HI>Tyrant</HI> in a Speech which he made to the Parliament in 1603, would be altogether in vain. But the words are so fit for this purpose, that I will read them to you out of his Works. <HI>I do acknowledge, that the special, and greatest point of difference that is between a Rightful King, and an Usurping Tyrant, is this: That whereas the Proud, and Ambitious Tyrant doth think his Kingdom, and People are only ordained for the satisfaction of his desires, and unreasonable Appetites, the Righteous and Iust King doth by the contrary acknowledge himself to be ordained for the procuring of the Wealth and Prosperity of his People.</HI> And so likewise in another Speech he made to the Parliament, he hath this memorable passage, <HI>That a King go∣verning in a settled Kingdom, leaves to be a King, and degenerates into a Tyrant, so soon as he ceases to rule according to the Law.</HI> So that since it is plain, that the People may judge, when they have a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> instead of a <HI>King</HI> to rule over them; and that under such a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> the <HI>Condition</HI> of the People may be very <HI>deplorable</HI>; the Question still remains, what is best for them to do in this Case: Whether it be better for them, or they be obliged, by the Laws of Reason, and Nature, patiently to submit to it, or else, if they can, either by their own force, or the Assistance of a Forreign Prince, to cast off the Yoke. And I think I may still maintain, that they may do it, notwithstan∣ding what you have yet urged to the contrary.</P>
<P>In the first place therefore, tho' you count it an almost impossible thing to suppose, that a Prince or Monarch would ever go about to murder, or de∣stroy his Subjects, yet as incredible as it is, I can give you several examples out of <HI>History</HI> both <HI>Ancient,</HI> and <HI>Modern,</HI> that some <HI>Tyrants</HI> have been so brui∣tish as not only to endeavour it, but actually to put it in practice. Of the first kind is that of <HI>Caligula,</HI> whom <HI>Suetonius</HI> mentions, to have wisht, that all the People of <HI>Rome</HI> had but one Neck, that he might cut it off at once. The other is of <HI>Nero,</HI> (in the same Author, as also in <HI>Tacitus</HI>) who set the City of <HI>Rome</HI> on fire, and consequently would have burnt all the People in it to please his humour, and that he might sing his <HI>Ballad</HI> of the Destruction of <HI>Troy</HI> the more naturally whilst it burnt. A third example, I find related in <HI>Mocquet's</HI> Travels into the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> of a certain King of <HI>Pegu,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Moc∣quets <HI>Travels,</HI> Lib. 4. <HI>p.</HI> 333.</NOTE> about an hundred years ago, who, by the perswasion of some of his <HI>Diabolical Priests,</HI> or <HI>Magicians,</HI> took such an aversion to his Subjects, that he was resolved to destroy them, and therefore forbid them to sow their Lands for two, or three Years, by which means a great part of them died of Famine, or were forced to devour each other. And in such Cases as these, I suppose, the Laws of Nature, and Reason will justifie <HI>Self-defence</HI> in the <HI>People,</HI> and sure it had been Lawful for the People of <HI>Rome</HI> to have resisted <HI>Caligula's</HI> Guards, if he had gone about to put his wicked Wish into Execution, or likewise to have resisted, or put to death those <HI>Incendiaries</HI> they found <HI>firing the City,</HI> tho' they might have had the Emperour <HI>Nero's</HI> Commission for it. So likewise sure it would have been as lawful for the People of <HI>Pegu,</HI> to have resisted those whom the Emperour might have sent to hinder them from Ploughing, and Sowing their Lands. And that I am not the only Man of this Opinion, I de∣sire you to consult what <HI>Barclay</HI> hath in his Treatise, <HI>contra Monarchomachos</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="83"/>
which he writ against <HI>Buchanan, de Iure Regni apud Scotos,</HI> and the Author of <HI>Vindiciae contra Tyrannos</HI>; where, tho'he be a most Zealous assertor of the <HI>un∣limited,</HI> and <HI>irresistible Power of Prince<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Yet in his third Book <HI>chap.</HI> 8. he speak∣eth to this effect, the sense of whose words, as near as I can, I will give you in <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Now if any one should say, But must the <HI>People</HI> always yield their Throats to the Fury, and Cruelty of <HI>Tyranty</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Must they patiently permit their Ci∣ties to be destroyed by Hunger, F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e or Sword, and their Wives and Chil∣dren to be exposed to the <HI>lust</HI> of a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> and also themselves to be brought into the <HI>utmost dangers,</HI> and Miseries of Life? Must <HI>that</HI> be denyed to them which is the <HI>Right of all Animals</HI> by Nature, that is, that they may repel force with force, and defend themselves from Injury? To this it may easily be answered, that <HI>Self-defence,</HI> which is of <HI>Natural Right,</HI> ought not to be denyed to the People: And therefore if the King doth not only exert his hatred against some Single persons, but also shall go about to destroy the bo∣dy of the <HI>Common-Wealth,</HI> of which he is <HI>Head,</HI> that is, shall exert his Hatred a∣gainst the whole People, or some considerable part of them by an horrid, and in∣tolerable Cruelty, or Tyranny, <HI>There is a Power in the People in this Case,</HI> only of <HI>De∣fending</HI> it self, but <HI>not</HI> of <HI>Invading</HI> the Prince, or of <HI>Revenging</HI> the Injury given, neither of departing from their due Reverence, because of the Injury receiv∣ed; in short it hath <HI>Right</HI> only of <HI>repelling</HI> a Present force, but not of <HI>re∣venging</HI> a past injury, for one of them indeed is from Nature, that we should defend our lives, and Persons from injury, and therefore the <HI>People</HI> may be able to prevent an Evil before it be done, but <HI>cannot revenge it upon the King after it is done.</HI> Therefore the <HI>People</HI> hath this Right more than a <HI>Private Man,</HI> that he hath no other Remedy left him but <HI>Pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence</HI>; Whereas the <HI>People,</HI> if the <HI>Tyranny</HI> be intolerable, may still resist, tho' with Respect.</Q></P>
<P>In all which this Author hath there said we may easily understand his meaning, unless it be in this of resisting force with <HI>Respect, and Reverence.</HI> For I cannot understand how a Man may <HI>sight</HI> against his Prince with <HI>Reverence,</HI> or give his <HI>Guard,</HI> a Knock over the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, or a Cut in the Face, with <HI>Respect</HI> to the Prin∣ce's Authority. But the reason is plain why the <HI>people</HI> may act thus, because when a <HI>Prince</HI> once Goeth about to <HI>destroy,</HI> and make War upon his <HI>People,</HI> he doth not act then, as a <HI>Monarch,</HI> but like a <HI>Cut-throat,</HI> and <HI>Enemy</HI> to the <HI>Common-Wealth</HI>; And no man can imagine, a Will to destroy, and to protect the people, can at once subsist in the same Person.</P>

<P>But pray give me leave to interrupt you a little, I grant indeed that by the <HI>Political Laws</HI> of any Government, which are made to Secure the Rights of the Subjects in their Lives, and Fortunes, No Prince, can,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. I. chap.</HI> 10. <HI>p.</HI> 203.</NOTE> or ought to, take away his Subjects Lives, or Es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates con∣trary to Law; Yet by the IMPERIAL LAWS in every Govern∣ment, and by the <HI>Laws</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which (As I shall hereaf∣ter shew) establish <HI>those Laws</HI> in all <HI>perfect</HI> Governments (and particularly in the <HI>English,</HI>) all these Rights <HI>Legally</HI> belong to the civil Soveraign especially to be <HI>accountable</HI> to none, but <HI>God,</HI> to have the <HI>Sole Power,</HI> and disposal of the <HI>Sword,</HI> and to be <HI>free</HI> from all <HI>Coercive,</HI> and <HI>Vindicative Power,</HI> and from all Resistance by force. It is by these <HI>Common Laws</HI> of <HI>Soveraignty,</HI> that the Gospel requires <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> which is but another name for <HI>Non-Resistance,</HI> these Laws are in <HI>eternal force</HI> against the <HI>Subjects</HI> in defence of the <HI>Soveraign,</HI> be he
<PB N="150" REF="84"/>
Good, or Evil, Just, or Unjust, <HI>Christian,</HI> or <HI>Pagan,</HI> be he what he will, no Subject<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or number of Subjects whatsoever, can lift up his or their hands against the So∣veraign, and be Guiltless by these Laws. Therefore for the <HI>Subjects</HI> to bear the <HI>Sword</HI> against their <HI>Soveraign,</HI> or to <HI>defend</HI> themselves by force against <HI>him,</HI> or his <HI>Forces,</HI> is against the <HI>Common Laws</HI> of <HI>Soveraignty,</HI> and by consequence <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> even unto <HI>Death,</HI> becomes a duty in <HI>Soveraign Governments,</HI> by vertue of those Laws, and we are not to <HI>resist them upon any pretence whatsoever,</HI> but therefore all Subjects are bound to <HI>Suffer Death wrongfully,</HI> rather than to <HI>re∣sist</HI> them upon <HI>any pretence</HI> or account whatsoever. So that let <HI>Popish</HI> Writers (though never so moderate) say what they please, concerning the <HI>Lawfulness</HI> of <HI>Resistance</HI> in some Cases, Yet <HI>We of the Church of England</HI> have learned bet∣ter things from the <HI>Scripture</HI> and the Examples of the <HI>Primitive Christians,</HI> which we think our selves obliged most strictly to observe. And therefore in relation to our <HI>own Government,</HI> and the <HI>present State</HI> of Affairs, I shall reduce all that I have to say against <HI>Resistance</HI> of the King, or those <HI>commissioned</HI> by him into this <HI>Syllogisme. Not</HI> to be <HI>resisted</HI> by the Subjects is an <HI>Inseparable Right</HI> of all <HI>Soveraign Power.</HI> But the <HI>King</HI> is here the <HI>only Soveraign Power. Ergo</HI> the <HI>King</HI> is upon <HI>no pretence</HI> whatsoever to be <HI>resisted</HI> by his Subjects. So that not to quarrel any longer about words, <HI>Non-resistance</HI> is the same thing with <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> and Submission, and by consequence these are required by the IM∣PERIAL LAWS of the Government. Therefore, Whatsoever the <HI>Imperial Laws</HI> of the Government require of its Subjects, if it be not contrary to <HI>God's</HI> Laws, they are bound to perform it. But <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> or Patient Suffering of Injuries from the Soveraign, is <HI>not forbid</HI> by God's Laws, And therefore Subjects are bound to perform it, where it is required by the <HI>Im∣perial Laws.</HI></P>

<P>I Shall forbear to say any thing, as yet, concerning what Doctrines the <HI>Scriptures</HI> teach, or the <HI>Primitive Christians</HI> practised concerning this mat∣ter, because I desire to discourse that Question apart from this of the Laws of Nature, or Reason, which We are now upon, Therefore I must tell you, that tho' this new Fingle-fangle Term of <HI>Imperial Law</HI> of <HI>Non-resistance</HI> may sound very prettily to their Ears who mind words more than sense, Yet I must free∣ly confess, that I am altogether a Stranger to this <HI>Notion</HI> of <HI>Imperial Laws,</HI> as also of the distinction you make between the <HI>Imperial</HI> and <HI>Political Laws</HI> of this Kingdom; and if by <HI>Imperial Laws</HI> you mean those of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire: I never knew that those Laws had any thing to do in <HI>England</HI> before, but al∣ways supposed the <HI>Politick Laws</HI> of our Country to be the only measure of the <HI>King's Prerogative,</HI> as also of the <HI>Subject's Obedience</HI> and Subjection. Nor do your own <HI>Civil Laws,</HI> by as much as I know of them, make any <HI>difference</HI> be∣tween the <HI>Imperial</HI> and <HI>Political</HI> Laws of the Empire, for by the one, as well as the Other, the <HI>Civilians</HI> understand such <HI>Laws,</HI> or <HI>Edi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts,</HI> of the <HI>Emperours</HI> which with the <HI>Approbation</HI> of the <HI>Senate</HI> were made for the Peace and Well government of the Common-Wealth, but I never yet heard of any <HI>Imperial Laws</HI> whereby the Emperour declared, that he had a <HI>Right</HI> to plunder, or murder all the Citizens of <HI>Rome,</HI> or that they believed they were obliged to <HI>Suffer</HI> by your <HI>Imperial Laws</HI> without any <HI>Resistance.</HI> I am sure, the <HI>Senate</HI> and <HI>People</HI> did not believe, that the <HI>Emperour</HI> had any such Authority, when they declared <HI>Nero,</HI> and <HI>Maximin,</HI> for their intolerable Cruelty, not only <HI>Enemies</HI> of the <HI>Common-Wealth,</HI> but of <HI>Mankind.</HI> But if by these <HI>Imperial Laws</HI> of
<PB N="151" REF="84"/>
<HI>Non-resistance</HI> you mean no more than what you laid down in your <HI>Syllogism,</HI> That it is an <HI>inseparable Right</HI> or <HI>Prerogative</HI> of <HI>Soveraign Powers,</HI> not to be re∣sisted by their Subjects, when you have proved this Proposition, by the Laws of Nature and Reason, I shall then believe it. But as for your Conclusion, it being founded upon these Premises, it needs no Confutation, for if the <HI>Im∣perial Laws</HI> of Government do <HI>not</HI> require your <HI>Passive Obedience</HI>; then <HI>Subjects</HI> are <HI>not</HI> bound to perform it. And to shew you the Falseness and ab∣surdity of this Assertion that Whatsoever the <HI>Imperial Laws</HI> of any Govern∣ment require of its <HI>Subjects,</HI> if it be not contrary to God's Laws, they are bound to <HI>perform</HI> it. In stead of <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> or Patient Suffering of In∣juries, let us insert, <HI>to give up to the Soveraign all our Civil Properties and Estates, if demanded by him, is not</HI> forbid by <HI>God's Laws, and therefore Subjects are bound to perform it when ever it is required by the Imperial Laws:</HI> For certainly the <HI>abso∣lute disposal</HI> of the Estates of the Subjects is as <HI>unseparable</HI> a <HI>Prerogative</HI> of So∣veraign Power as <HI>Irresistibility</HI> it self, as I think I am able to prove, if you think fit to dispute that Question.</P>
<P>But at present I shall only confine my self to confute the <HI>Major</HI> in your <HI>Syllogism.</HI> In the first place therefore, tho' I do grant what you lay down for a Ground to be true, That it belongs to <HI>Soveraign Powers</HI> to be <HI>accountable</HI> to, or <HI>punishable</HI> by, none but God, Yet, I suppose, <HI>Resistance</HI> of their Violence and <HI>Tyranny</HI> may very well be perform'd by the <HI>People,</HI> without calling them to a <HI>Iudicial Account</HI> or erecting a <HI>Tribunal</HI> for that purpose; Calling to an Ac∣count, and Punishment are acts of Authority of Superiours over Inferiours, But <HI>Resistance</HI> for self-defence is a <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> and which no Man, by entering into <HI>Civil Government,</HI> ever parted withal, but out of Considerati∣on of a Greater Good to be obtained thereby, (<HI>viz.</HI>) his own greater Secu∣rity together with the Common Good of that Civil Society, whereof he is a Member; which, when by the Prince's violence it is once like to be wholly lost, his <HI>Natural Right</HI> of <HI>Self-defence</HI> for the Preservation of him∣self, and Family again takes place; Nor doth he then resist the Supreme Pow∣ers as such, but as Murderers, and Cut-throats, who by going about to de∣stroy the People have already loft all that Right, they formerly had: And of this opinion is that moderate <HI>Romish</HI> Author, <HI>Barclay</HI> before cited, Who in the 16 <HI>Chap.</HI> of the Book last quoted, hath this Remarkable passage.</P>
<P><Q>What then? Can there <HI>no Cases</HI> happen in which it may be lawful for the <HI>People</HI> by their <HI>own Authority,</HI> to rise up, and <HI>resist</HI> a King governing <HI>Tyrannical∣ly?</HI> His Answer to this Question is, there are certainly <HI>none</HI> as long as he con∣tinues <HI>King</HI>: for the Scriptures forbid it; which say, <HI>Honour the King,</HI> and <HI>he who resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God</HI>; Therefore the Peo∣ple can have no Power against him, unless he committeth something, by which he may <HI>cease</HI> to be <HI>King</HI>; for then he himself <HI>abdicates</HI> his Kingship, and becomes a <HI>private Man,</HI> and by this means the <HI>People</HI> being made <HI>Free,</HI> that Right returns to them, which they had before the King was made; But there are but few Facts of that Nature, which can produce Such effects; And I cannot, when I think of it, find more than <HI>two Cases,</HI> in which a King doth <HI>ipso facto</HI> make himself <HI>no King,</HI> and thereby depriveth himself of all Honour, Regal Dignity, and Power, (which also <HI>Winzerus</HI> takes notice of.)</Q>
One of these is, if he <HI>destroys</HI> his <HI>Kingdom</HI>; and then gives us the Examples of <HI>Nero,</HI> and <HI>Caligula</HI> as I have already done;
<Q>And next proceeds to this purpose that
<PB N="152" REF="85"/>
when any King designs, and doth seriously endeavour, to put this in pra∣ctice, he casts off all care, and desire of Governing; And therefore thereby loses his Empire over his Subjects, as a Lord of a Servant loses his Dominion over him, by giving up all Care, and Government of him.</Q>
And of this Opinion likewise are <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 4. §. 7.11.</NOTE> <HI>Grotius,</HI> and <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffendorf</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib. vii cap.</HI> 8 §. 6 7.</NOTE> the two best, and most learned Writers on this Subject.
<Q>Who do not think it inconsistent with the Rules of the Gospel, for Subjects to resist the King, if with a <HI>Hostile mind,</HI> He seeks the <HI>Destruction</HI> of his <HI>People,</HI> for, says the former, the Will of commanding and destroying cannot consist together; And therefore he who professes himself an <HI>Enemy</HI> of the <HI>whole People,</HI> does there∣by <HI>abdicate</HI> the Kingdom, but that can Scarce seem to happen in a King in his right Witts, and who commands only one Kingdom. But if he commands more Kingdoms, it may so happen, that he would destroy the People of one Nation, to gratifie the other, that he may <HI>there make Colonies of them.</HI></Q>
And this, I suppose, <HI>Grotius</HI> spoke in relation to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> who (they say) had declared, that if he overcame the <HI>Dutch,</HI> then in Arms against him, he would fell the People for Slaves into <HI>America,</HI> and people the Coun∣try with <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You very much mistake me, if you think, by <HI>Imperial, I</HI> meant the <HI>Roman</HI> Laws, but only the <HI>Common Laws</HI> of <HI>Soveraignty,</HI> which, tho' they destroy no Man's Natural,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. I. Ib.</HI></NOTE> or Civil Rights, Yet both grant, and confirm unto the Legal Soveraign in every Government the <HI>Es∣sential Rights</HI> of Soveraignty, of which I take <HI>Non-resistance,</HI> not only for Wrath, but Conscience lake, to be one of the <HI>Chief.</HI> And therefore it were much better to venture the <HI>utmost</HI> that a <HI>Tyrant</HI> can do towards his <HI>People</HI> by de∣stroying them, than to give the least <HI>inlet</HI> to Rebellion, by Supposing the <HI>Peo∣ple</HI> may in <HI>any</HI> case whatsoever <HI>resist</HI> their Prince; For granting the worst that may happen, that a Prince once in 1000 years to be so wicked and Malicious, as to go about to destroy his People, yet he could scarce find means and hands enough to bring it about; and admit he should destroy by his <HI>Mercenary forces,</HI> 30, or 40000, of them, it were better <HI>all these</HI> should perish, than that the <HI>Nation</HI> should be involved in <HI>Civil War,</HI> and the <HI>Prince</HI>'s <HI>Person</HI> and Govern∣ment destroyed by <HI>Resistance</HI>; And therefore in all Governments whatsoever, whether <HI>Monarchies</HI> or <HI>Common-Wealths,</HI> there must be an <HI>absolute Trust</HI> placed by the People in one, or more persons, which Trust they can neither recall when they will, nor yet resist upon the Non-performance of it. And there∣fore it is a mistake, when you affirm with those Authors you have quoted, that a King, or other Supream Powers can ever lose their Right, by going a∣bout to destroy the People, much less when they only think their Liberties, in danger; and I have several reasons to give you for my Assertion.</P>
<P>As first from the <HI>Common Notion</HI> of a <HI>Trust,</HI> For what is more generally understood by trusting another,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V. I. R. p.</HI> 6.</NOTE> than that we lodge our concerns with him, and put them out of our disposal? When I trust a Man with my life, or Fortune, all men agree, that I put it in his Power to deprive me of both, For to deliver any Property to another with a Power of Revocation is to trust him (as we say) no farther than we can see him. He that can recover a Sum of money he hath deposited, when he plea∣ses, to speak Properly, hath it still, in his Custody, and trusts his Friend no
<PB N="153" REF="85"/>
more, than he doth his own Coffers, and therefore if we consule our own Thoughts, we shall find, that a <HI>Trust</HI> Naturally Implies an <HI>Entire Reliance</HI> up∣on the Conduct, and Integrity of another, which makes us resign up our Liberty, or Estate to his Management, imagining them Safer in his hands, than in our own. In short, a Trust, where there is no Third person to Judge of the performance, (as in these Pacts between Subjects, and Soveraign, there is not,) I say, such a trust includes a <HI>Translation</HI> of <HI>Right,</HI> and in respect of the irrevocableness of it, is in the Nature of a Gift. So that there seems on∣ly to be this difference between them, that a <HI>Gift</HI> ought to respect the <HI>Benefit</HI> of the <HI>Receiver,</HI> whereas a <HI>Trust</HI> is generally made, for the <HI>advantage</HI> of him who <HI>Conveyed</HI> it.</P>
<P>And in every Civil Society or Government under Heaven that doth not depend upon another,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. D. F. p.</HI> 8.</NOTE> there must be an <HI>absolute,</HI> and <HI>unco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>troulable Power</HI> fixed <HI>somewhere,</HI> which may <HI>irresistibly</HI> dispose of the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves, Estates, and Persons of the Subjects within that Civil Society, or Government; For if every Man be left at Liberty to dispose of his own Estate, and person, as he pleases himself, then can he promise himself no Protection, but what his own natural force will afford him, and that will certainly be over powered at one time, or other, by others. Without this Trust, there can be no Justice administred within the Civil Society, For if every particular man may be Judge in his own Case, the Right will certainly be asserted on both sides, tho' it really can be but in one, No Malefactor will ever condemn himself, nor Submit to Justice if he can, and may resist; and if a War happen, every man will be for saving his own Goods, from the ex∣pence, as his own person from the Danger of it, and the Consequence must be, that that <HI>Civil Society</HI> must perish either by <HI>internal</HI> disorders, or <HI>internal</HI> Force.</P>
<P>Therefore this Power is, and must be in one Person, or body of men in every Civil Society,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id. pag.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and is also <HI>indivisible</HI>; For sup∣posing that it should be divided to the same Civil Society into two, or more Parts, as between two men, and two Senates, or Councils, without any dependance upon each other, or any Third power, the Conse∣quence must needs be, that they differing, and opposing one another, and having no Lawful Power fixed in either of them to oblige the other to submit, must have recourse to Force, and Arms; So that this Civil Society can never rest, till this Supreme Soveraign Power be reduced again into one. And if you suppose this <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Iudging,</HI> and Resisting in the <HI>People,</HI> or Multitude▪ the matter is <HI>ten times worse,</HI> that being a blind, and heady Monster, easily provoked upon flight occasions, commonly judging false, even in its own Concerns, and as impl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cable in its Rage, as un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atiable in its Re∣venge.</P>
<P>To conclude, whether this Supream Power be in a Single person, or in a few, or in all, where ever it is lodged, none must oppose, none must resist it, nor can any Man assure himself of more Justice, or better usage from a <HI>Senate,</HI> or a <HI>Multitude,</HI> than from a <HI>Prince,</HI> or <HI>Single Person.</HI> So that this inconvenience of being liable to have our Lives sometimes taken away, our persons injured, and our Estates opprest, by the Evil management of our Go∣vernours, is one of those humane miseries that by the Corruption of Men's nature from the Fall took possession of the World, and can never be purged

out of it till the Final Conflagration.
<Q>And therefore the Advice of <HI>Cerialis</HI> in <HI>Ta∣citus</HI> is always to be remembred, that Tyrants, and evil Princes are to be born with, as Immoderate Rains, and unkind Seasons, and amends may be made by a better Successor: Since Resistance will not Cure, but only en∣flame the Distemper.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have made a long Speech, wherein I see you have heared toge∣ther, all that <HI>Wit,</HI> or <HI>Interest</HI> can produce on the behalf of <HI>Tyranny,</HI> tho' I must confess, I did not expect to find you of any Man, so Zealous an Advo∣cate for it. But I forgive it, as long as I really believe, that only a mistaken <HI>Conscience,</HI> and not any Private Interest prompts you to it. But that I may take your Speech to pieces in order to answer it: In the <HI>first place,</HI> as to what you say concerning a Trust, I think you are under a very great mistake. For no Man, either in a Civil State, or in that of Nature, ever yet so trusted a∣nother, as that, if he abused his Trust, he had not reserved to himself a <HI>Right of Appeal</HI>; Under all Civil Governments this is Notorious, since it is one of the main Businesses of <HI>Supream Courts</HI> of Justice, upon <HI>Complaints,</HI> or Appeals, of <HI>Breaches</HI> of Trust, to call the <HI>Trustees</HI> to an <HI>Account,</HI> and force them to make <HI>Restitution</HI> for the wrongs they have done: And whereas you say, that in the State of Nature, where there is no third person to judge of the Performance, such a Trust includes a Translation of a Right (as in these Pacts between Subjects, and Soveraigns:) This is likewise a mistake, tho' it be true, that in that State, if I trust a Man with my Life, and Fortune. I put it in his Power to deprive me of both, and that this Trust naturally im∣plies a Reliance upon the Conduct, and Integrity of another; which makes me resign my Liberty, or Estate to his Management; Yet doth it not there∣fore follow, but that upon the abuse of this Trust, I may have a Remedy a∣gainst him, who thus breaks this Trust I have so reposed in him. And when there is <HI>no third Person</HI> to <HI>Iudge</HI> between me, and my <HI>Trustee.</HI> I my self am the <HI>Sole Iudge</HI> of the Wrong he doth me, and may not only <HI>turn him out of his Trust,</HI> if I find he abuses it; but may also force him to make me <HI>Satisfaction</HI> for the Wrong he hath done: So that, if in the <HI>State of Nature</HI> I trust a Man with a <HI>Bag of Silver</HI> to keep for me: If he either <HI>Imbezels,</HI> or runs away with it, I may certainly force him to make me <HI>Restitution</HI>▪ or else enter into a <HI>State of War</HI> with him, till he do; And where there is no <HI>Common Power</HI> over us to whom we can <HI>Appeal,</HI> this <HI>Difference</HI> can no way be <HI>Decided</HI> but by the <HI>Sword.</HI> And therefore <HI>no Trust</HI> (as in those mutual Pacts between Subjects, and Sove∣raigns) can be <HI>Irrevocable,</HI> or include a <HI>perfect Translation</HI> of a <HI>Right,</HI> and <HI>no Trust</HI> can ever be supposed to be given but with this <HI>tacit Condition,</HI> that the Trustee doth not <HI>abuse</HI> it: And you your self have made a sufficient <HI>Difference</HI> between a <HI>Trust,</HI> and an <HI>Absolute Gift,</HI> but granting that a Gift respects, the benefit of the Receiver, whereas a Trust is for the Advantage of him who convey's it; From whence it must necessarily follow, that if this Trust be for his Advantage; he hath still an <HI>Interest</HI> in the thing <HI>Trusted,</HI> and consequently may call the <HI>Trustee</HI> to an <HI>Account</HI> in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> and upon Satisfaction denyed, <HI>Appeal</HI> to God himself by <HI>Battle,</HI> or <HI>Combat.</HI> So that if the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> are but <HI>Trustees</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> they may be <HI>Resisted,</HI> when by going about to <HI>Destroy</HI> them they <HI>break their Trust.</HI></P>
<P>But as for the <HI>Second part</HI> of your Argument, that in all <HI>Civil Governments</HI> under Heaven, there must be an <HI>absolute and uncontroulable Power</HI> fixed <HI>some
<PB N="155" REF="86"/>
where,</HI> that may <HI>irresistibly</HI> dispose of the Lives, Persons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Subjects. This, tho' it seems a better Argument than the former, yet is all one in Effect, for the Question is still, <HI>Whether the People ever reposed such an absolute Power in their Supream Magistrates, or not.</HI> I grant indeed, that as far as they act, as the <HI>nature</HI> of Civil Power, requires, they are <HI>not by any means to be resisted,</HI> but the Question still is, whether, when a Prince makes <HI>War</HI> upon the <HI>People,</HI> or goeth about to <HI>destroy</HI> them, there is then any <HI>Civil Power</HI> in being; and whether the <HI>Government</HI> be not already <HI>dissolved,</HI> since the <HI>main Ends</HI> of Government, viz. the Good and Preservation of the Subjects, are quite destroyed. And now pray tell me, which is most suitable to that <HI>prime Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> the endeavour of the good, and happiness of mankind, that a <HI>whole Nation</HI> should be enslaved, or destroyed by the <HI>boundless Will</HI> of a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> or that <HI>Rulers</HI> should be sometimes resisted, when they grow <HI>intolerably Tyrannical,</HI> &amp; abuse their Power to the <HI>total destruction</HI> of the Lives, and Properties of their Sub∣jects. So then, if such an <HI>absolute Arbitrary Power,</HI> in Princes, or States, can never consist with the <HI>main Ends</HI> of Civil Society, the Peace &amp; Happiness of the Subjects, it is plain that when ever they are reduced to such a State, they will look upon themselves, as again in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> nor would they have ever quitted their <HI>Natural Freedom,</HI> &amp; tyed themselves up from providing for the security of their Lives, and Properties by such means as they might before have justly exercised, had it not been to obtain these Ends with much greater certainty by entring into <HI>Civil Society,</HI> and by <HI>Stated Rules</HI> of Right, and Wrong to secure their Lives and Properties, with their future peace, and Quiet, by surer means, than they could hope for in the <HI>meer State of Nature.</HI></P>
<P>For it cannot be supposed that the People would ever confer such an <HI>Arbitrary unlimited Power</HI> on one Man, or many, over their Lives, and Estates that they might take them away without any just cause. For this were to put themselves into a worse Condition, than the <HI>meer State of Nature,</HI> wherein they had a Liberty to defend their Just Right against the Injuries of others, and were upon equal Terms of Force to maintain it, whether invaded by a single Man, or many in a Combination.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. T. G. part</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 359.</NOTE> Whereas, by supposing they have thus given up themselves to the absolute Arbitrary Power, and Will of a Single Person. They have <HI>wholly disarmed</HI> themselves, and only <HI>armed</HI> him to make a Prey of them, whenever he pleases. He being in a much worse Condi∣tion, that is exposed to the Arbitrary Power of one Man, who hath the Command of 100000 Men than he that is expos'd to the Arbitrary Power of 100000 single Men, no body being secure that his Will who hath such Command is better, than that of other Men, tho' his force be 100000 times stronger.</P>
<P>To conclude, granting a Supreme Power to be plac'd somewhere, either in a Single Person, or in many, yet it can by no means be absolutely Arbitrary and Irresi∣stible over the lives, and Fortunes of the People. For their Authority being (as I have already proved in the former Conference) no more than that Power which God hath granted to every particular head of a Family, and other Freemen at his own dispose, for the security of their own Persons, and the Common Good of those whom God hath intrusted to their Charge, they cannot confer upon the supreme Magistrate any more Power, than what God hath conferred upon them before, and so can be no more than <HI>those Persons</HI> had in the <HI>State of Nature</HI>; before they enter'd into Society, and before they gave up their Power to these Supream Magistrates; viz. that only what God had before trusted them withal. Now (accord∣ing to your own Principles) <HI>no Man</HI> is trusted by God in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> with an <HI>absolute Power</HI> over his own life, much less to <HI>destroy,</HI> or take a∣way the life,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id. p.</HI> 355.</NOTE> or Property of <HI>another,</HI> and therefore cannot convey
<PB N="156" REF="87"/>
any such Power to those he would intrust with it. So then if a Man can∣not <HI>Subject</HI> himself to the <HI>Arbitrary Power</HI> of another, neither hath he in the <HI>State of Nature</HI> such an <HI>Arbitrary Power</HI> over the life, Liberty or Possessions of ano∣ther, but only as much as the Law of Nature gave him for the <HI>Preservation</HI> of him∣self, and the <HI>Common Good</HI> of Mankind; This is all he doth, or can give up to the <HI>Common-Wealth,</HI> so that if it can have no more than this. Its <HI>Power</HI> in the utmost bounds of it is still <HI>limited</HI> to the <HI>publick good</HI> of the <HI>Civil Society.</HI></P>
<P>All which if duly considered, the rest of your weaker Arguments are easily an∣swered. For supposing but one <HI>Prince</HI> in a 1000 years so <HI>wicked</HI> as to go about to <HI>destroy</HI> his <HI>People,</HI> it will then, whenever it happens, be as much their <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>de∣fend</HI> themselves, as if it were to happen <HI>every year.</HI> And tho' you assert he could scarce find means, or hands to bring it about. Yet that makes nothing to the Pur∣pose, for if he hath <HI>no Right</HI> to <HI>destroy</HI> 30, or 40000 of the Subjects, as you suppose he may, by his <HI>Mercenary forces,</HI> then that 30, or 40000 may <HI>defend</HI> themselves if they can: For when once a Prince hath thus enter'd into a <HI>State of War</HI> with his People; who can tell when or where it will end, or can assure himself, that he shall not be the next man that shall be <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stroyed,</HI> and it is very pleasant, that you allow the Prince this Power of <HI>murdering to avoid Civil War,</HI> as if there could be no War begun, unless there be fighting on both Sides; Whereas Mr. <HI>Hobbs</HI> himself acknowledges, the very assaulting, or setting upon any Man, to be entring in∣to a State of War with him; And sure I think to fall upon the People without Cause, and Killing 30, or 40000 of them is entring into a State of War, or else no∣thing is. And therefore you <HI>mistake</HI> the question, when you argue, from the <HI>In∣divisibility</HI> of the <HI>Supreme Power,</HI> that it must not be <HI>resisted.</HI> For the Question is not here, whether it be <HI>divisible</HI> or not, but whether it be not <HI>absolutely dissolved</HI> by thus entering into a <HI>State of War</HI> with the <HI>People,</HI> whom all Civil Magistrates are supposed to protect when they assume the Government. Nor doth this give any countenance to Male factors, or other single Persons to rise in Arms, and defend themselves against the supreme Powers when they have offended against the Laws, or that they think themselves injured by the undile execution of them; Since <HI>such abuses of Power</HI> cannot suddenly, or upon every slight occasion <HI>disturb</HI> the <HI>Government.</HI> And in the Case of Malefactors, the Supream Power is still sure to have all the People on its side, for their own Security, and in case of <HI>some Murders,</HI> or <HI>oppressions</HI> committed by such <HI>Supream Magistrates,</HI> on the Lives or Estates of some <HI>Private Persons,</HI> tho' I suppose that even such <HI>private Men</HI> have a <HI>Right</HI> in the <HI>state of Nature</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> their Lives, and to recover by <HI>Force,</HI> what by <HI>unjust Force</HI> is taken from them, yet this <HI>Right</HI> must still give place to the <HI>Publick Place,</HI> and Safety of the <HI>Common-Wealth</HI> whereof they are members, which must not be <HI>disturb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> for the sake of a <HI>few,</HI> and of this the People themselves are so sensible that it is almost as <HI>impossible,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> 429.</NOTE> for a <HI>few oppressed</HI> men to <HI>disturb</HI> the Government, where the <HI>Body of the People</HI> do not think themselves <HI>concerned</HI> to it, as for a Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Mad-man or <HI>Heady Malecontent</HI> to overturn a <HI>well setled Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> the People being as little a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to follow the one, as the other. So on the other side, when over the <HI>People</HI> are once convinced that their <HI>Governours,</HI> instead of <HI>Protecting,</HI> go about to <HI>destroy</HI> them, it is as <HI>impossible</HI> for any Man to persuade them <HI>not</HI> to take up <HI>Arms,</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> themselves against them, if they are able to make <HI>Sufficient Resi∣stances.</HI> And therefore tho' I so far agree with you, that some oppressions, and vi∣olences may be practised in all Civil Governments whatsoever, since such abuses will continue as long as Men are Men, yet doth it not therefore follow that the
<PB N="157" REF="87"/>
<HI>Supream Powers,</HI> must <HI>always</HI> be born withal, and <HI>never</HI> resisted, no not when they go about to <HI>destroy</HI> the <HI>whole Body</HI> of the People.</P>

<P>But pray tell me, is it not a very mischievous, and unjust thing, that <HI>Subjects</HI> should be both <HI>Iudges</HI> and <HI>Parties</HI> too in their own Case. Since they may pretend, that the King goeth about to destroy them, when really he does not de∣sign any such thing; and would not this bring all things into Anarchy and Confusi∣on? I shewed you the fatal consequences of this at the Beginning, but you have not yet thought fit to answer them.</P>

<P>I begg your pardon, Sir, I have been so taken up with answering the <HI>main Arguments,</HI> that you have proposed against this <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Resistance,</HI> that I have not had time to consider this <HI>Objection,</HI> which is but a <HI>Consequence</HI> thereof. And therefore in the first place give me leave to ask you this Question. Suppose you were Master of a separate Family in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and a Neighbouring Prince, or Cacich of the <HI>Indians,</HI> should come to Kill you, or to drive you out of your <HI>Plantati∣on,</HI> might you not <HI>defend</HI> your self, because you are both <HI>Iudge</HI> and <HI>Party</HI> too in your own Case? or suppose you should so far <HI>abuse</HI> this Power of <HI>self defence,</HI> as to pre∣tend this Neighbouring Prince was coming to assault you, when he realy was nor, and should therefore (to prevent it) set upon him first, and Murder him, and his Followers, must your <HI>abuse</HI> of this <HI>Right</HI> which you have by the <HI>Law of Nature</HI> be a sufficient Argument, that neither you, nor any Man else in the <HI>State of Na∣tio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> should ever for the future <HI>exercise</HI> this <HI>Right</HI>? no more will the <HI>abuse</HI> of either of these be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sufficient Argument against the <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Self-defence</HI> against the <HI>supream Powers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant indeed they are not in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> but it is much other∣wise after <HI>People</HI> are entered into a <HI>Civil Society,</HI> or <HI>Common-Wealth</HI> and that upon your own Principles. For then they have given up <HI>all</HI> that <HI>Equality</HI> which you suppose between men, in the <HI>State of Nature.</HI> For supposing what you affirm should be true, That <HI>Civil Government</HI> at first began from the <HI>whole Body,</HI> or major part of the Peoples making over <HI>all their Right</HI> of Governing themselves to one Person, or more, upon <HI>Conditions</HI> of being <HI>Protected</HI> in their Lives, and Estates, they must likewise make over <HI>all their Right</HI> of <HI>Iudging</HI> for themselves, what <HI>means</HI> are neces∣sary for their <HI>Common Good,</HI> and Preservation; after which <HI>transferring</HI> of their Po∣wer, they can never have <HI>any Right</HI> to meet again in a body either by <HI>themselves,</HI> or their <HI>Representatives</HI> to Judge of these <HI>Breaches,</HI> or the Transgressions of those <HI>Conditions</HI> which they at first Proposed, and <HI>agreed upon</HI> with such Princes, or Go∣vernours. And when the <HI>People</HI> come once to multiply into a <HI>Nation,</HI> it in abso∣lutely Impossible for them ever to <HI>meet</HI> altogether again, and give their <HI>Iudg∣ment</HI> of the Good or Evil Consequence of the Monarchs actions, or to come to any <HI>resolution</HI> upon them; So that their opinion can never afterwards be known other∣wise, than by the <HI>Murmurs</HI> of <HI>particular Persons,</HI> which none can certainly know neither, unless they could speak with every <HI>Individual Person</HI> of that Kingdom, which is impossible. But if you will say, this <HI>oppression</HI> needs not to be known by Words, or <HI>Votes,</HI> but <HI>actions,</HI> viz. by the Peoples actual taking up Arm', this must either be by the <HI>whole People</HI> altogether at once, or at least the <HI>major part</HI> of them, or else of some particular Bodies of Men much less than the whole, or major part. Now the <HI>whole,</HI> or <HI>major part</HI> of a People of a Nation to rise and <HI>take up Arms</HI> all at <HI>once</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one Man, is <HI>morally impossible.</HI> And if any part less than this <HI>whole,</HI> or <HI>Major part</HI> (as suppose a <HI>whole Province,</HI> or <HI>City</HI>) every such party or Body of Men so rising, must be guilty of <HI>Rebellion</HI> and disturbing the <HI>Publick Peace</HI> of the Common-Wealth
<PB N="158" REF="88"/>
as being but private single Persons, which you your self granted, and condemned as <HI>unlawful.</HI> And therefore I desire to know, who shall Judge when this Body, or Major part of the People, are thus assaulted, so that they may just∣ly defend themselves? But indeed this Licence of taking up Arms is not only un∣practicable, but unreasonable too: For it supposes, that after the <HI>People</HI> have gi∣ven up all the <HI>Power</HI> they had of <HI>Iudging</HI> what was bad or good for the Publick, they have this Power still left in them, which would make them at once both <HI>Sub∣jects</HI> and <HI>Soveraigns,</HI> which is a <HI>Contradiction.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had you been pleased but better to have observed what I said the last time I spoke, a great part of this Objection had been saved. For I there expresly assert∣ed, that the <HI>Security</HI> of mens Lives, Liberties and Estates, being the <HI>Main Ends</HI> for which men entered at first into <HI>Civil Society,</HI> and likewise desired to continue in it, as being the only means why <HI>Civil Government</HI> is to be preferred before the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> the <HI>People</HI> neither <HI>did</HI> nor <HI>can</HI> give up their <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Iudging,</HI> when these are invaded, or taken from them. And therefore you are very much mistaken to believe, that at the <HI>Institution</HI> of <HI>Civil Society,</HI> Men must have given up their <HI>Common senses,</HI> and reason too of <HI>Iudging,</HI> when they are like to be <HI>murdered,</HI> or made <HI>Slaves</HI> of, or their Fortunes unjustly taken from them, by those, whom they have <HI>ordained</HI> to be their Governours; and I suppose you will not say, that they thereby acquire a Power of <HI>altering</HI> the <HI>Nature</HI> of things, or of making War, Slavery or Beggery the means of procuring the Welfare, and Happiness of the People, <HI>any more</HI> than they can <HI>enact,</HI> that hunger, or diseases should conduce to the preservation of any mans life; And therefore as the Judgment of these things was obvious, and natural to every mans senses, and understanding in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> so it is as plain, they never intended wholly to give up all their Right of Judg∣ing concerning their own Preservation and Happiness, and all means necessarily tending thereunto, but only in such Cases, and concerning such matters as are <HI>beyond</HI> the Power, or above the Knowledge of every <HI>ordinary private subject</HI>: thus in a disease, tho' I give up my self to the skill, and Judgment of a <HI>Physician,</HI> yet I do it not so <HI>absolutely,</HI> but that I still reserve to my self a <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Iudging,</HI> whether he gives me <HI>Poyson,</HI> instead of a <HI>Purge.</HI> and if <HI>Princes</HI> or Supream Magistrates were thus <HI>absolutely invested</HI> with an <HI>Arbitrary Power</HI> of doing whatsoever they pleased with the Lives, Liberties and Estates of the <HI>People,</HI> they would then be in a much <HI>worse</HI> con∣dition under <HI>Civil Government,</HI> than they were in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> as I have alrea∣dy proved, And therefore there is no need of any such <HI>general</HI> Meetings, or Assem∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies of <HI>the whole Body,</HI> or <HI>Representatives</HI> of the People, to <HI>Iudge</HI> when these <HI>Fun∣damental Conditions</HI> of all Government are notoriously violated and broken: Since it will be apparent to every mans sense and reason that is thus assaulted or injured.</P>
<P>And as for the other part of your <HI>Objection,</HI> how the People can know, when the <HI>whole Body,</HI> or <HI>Major part,</HI> of them, is thus assaulted, or opprest, and being so assaul∣ted, or opprest, <HI>what number</HI> are necessary to justifie this <HI>Resistance</HI>? To this im∣portant Question, I thus answer; that if such a War, or assault be made upon such a <HI>considerable part</HI> of the People, as may <HI>justifie</HI> their <HI>Resistance</HI> to be <HI>much better</HI> for the Good of the Common-VVealth, than that <HI>so many</HI> People should be destroyed, <HI>Resistance</HI> certainly is then Lawful; And the reason why every <HI>particular person,</HI> when unjustly assaulted by his Princes <HI>Order,</HI> or his <HI>Estate</HI> taken a∣way by his <HI>unjust Edicts,</HI> or Decrees, ought not to make any <HI>publick disturbance</HI> only to <HI>save</HI> the one, or <HI>recover</HI> the other, I have given you before, <HI>viz.</HI> because the <HI>pub∣lick peace</HI> is to be preferred, before that of any <HI>private Person</HI>: Yet even then such a <HI>private Person</HI> may very well <HI>defend</HI> himself, if <HI>unjustly</HI> assaulted by <HI>Assassinates,</HI> whom
<PB N="159" REF="88"/>
the Prince, or other Supream Magistrates shall send to <HI>take away</HI> his Life without any just Cause, or <HI>Legal Tryal</HI>▪ tho' I grant he may not sollicit others to rise with him, and take his part or help him to <HI>defend</HI> his Life, or Estate. Yet (as a Reverend Dignitary of our Church very well observed.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. R. p.</HI> 59.</NOTE>) <HI>No Man can want Authority to defend his Life against him, who hath no Authority to take it away.</HI> But much more when this assault, or oppression is either made upon the <HI>whole People</HI> in general, or upon so <HI>considerable</HI> a Part, or Member thereof, as the <HI>Common-Wealth</HI> could not well <HI>subsist</HI> without, if it were <HI>destroyed,</HI> in all such cases, I suppose the <HI>People</HI> thus assaulted, or opprest have a <HI>sufficient Right</HI> to defend their Lives, and <HI>free</HI> themselves from that <HI>slavery,</HI> and oppression they lye under; and thus the People of <HI>Rome</HI> might very well have justified their <HI>Resistance</HI> of <HI>Nero</HI>'s Incendiaries, when he sent to Burn the City, tho' they had been his <HI>own Guards.</HI> We read likewise in the <HI>Hist. August.</HI> that the Emperour <HI>Caracalla,</HI> the People happening to laugh at him (for his <HI>Folly</HI>) in playing the Gladiator in his <HI>Circus Maximus,</HI> sent his Guards to kill them; So likewise in <HI>Herodian,</HI> that, upon another supposed affront, he sent his <HI>Pretorian</HI> Bands to Murder most of the Inha∣bitants of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> who came out to meet him with a <HI>Solemn Procession.</HI> And, I suppose, no rational Man will deny, but that, if the Citizens of <HI>Rome,</HI> or <HI>Alexan∣dria,</HI> had had Arms in their hands, they might have <HI>Lawfully defended</HI> their Lives against these <HI>Murdering Guards.</HI> For I think it was much better that those should be <HI>destroyed</HI> who were the <HI>Aggressors,</HI> than that so <HI>vast</HI> a Body of <HI>Innocent People,</HI> should be made <HI>Sacrifices</HI> to the undreasonable Passion, or Revenge of a <HI>Cruel Tyrant.</HI> So that when the <HI>oppression,</HI> or Violence to Mens Liberties and Properties is <HI>general,</HI> and notorious, and affect the <HI>whole Body</HI> of the People, I do then suppose that <HI>any Part</HI> of them, that are sufficient to <HI>defend</HI> themselves, may do it, till they can find <HI>Assistance</HI> either from the <HI>rest</HI> of the People, or else from some <HI>Forreign Prince,</HI> or State, who will <HI>vindicate</HI> their cause, and come in to their Assistance. And thus we read the Town of <HI>Brill</HI> in <HI>Zealand,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.

<P>I shall not now dispute with you what <HI>Right</HI> the States of the <HI>Vnited Provin∣ces,</HI> might have to <HI>resist</HI> the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> then Governour for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> since <HI>Grotius,</HI> and most Writers which are not of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Faction, sup∣pose, that King to have had a <HI>Conditional Right</HI> of Governing those <HI>Provinces</HI> accord∣ing to their own Laws, and Priviledges from the very <HI>first Institution</HI> of the Go∣vernment; And therefore not being an <HI>absolute Monarch</HI> over them, he might well be <HI>resisted</HI> upon the <HI>Breach</HI> of those <HI>Condition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:</HI> But this is not the Case now in hand: since we are now discoursing of <HI>absolute</HI> Monarchies, or Common-Wealths, who being invested with the <HI>Supream Power</HI> by the <HI>Consent</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> (as you suppose:) And therefore may have by their Consents (whether forced or Volunta∣ry it matters not) according to your own Principles a <HI>Supream Vnaccountable</HI> Power over them; And in the first place I can shew you, how a Man may <HI>make over</HI> all the Power he hath in his own Person <HI>irrevocably</HI> to another; As when a Man sells, or
<PB N="160" REF="89"/>
grants himself for a <HI>Slave</HI> to another by his <HI>own Consent</HI>; who when he hath once put himself into this Condition, his Master hath an <HI>absolute Property</HI> in his Person, and an <HI>indefesible Right</HI> for ever to his Service. So that notwith∣standing all the Cruel, Harsh, and unreasonable Usage, he may meet with from his Master, he can never <HI>regain</HI> his Freedom without the <HI>Consent</HI> of his <HI>Lord.</HI> And this I take to be an <HI>uncontested Truth</HI> agreed on by the <HI>Law</HI>; of <HI>Na∣tions,</HI> and established by the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> Thus St. <HI>Peter</HI> chargeth those, who are in this State of Servitude: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Pet. <HI>Ep.</HI> 1. ch. 2. <HI>v.</HI> 18.</NOTE> <HI>To be subject to their Masters with all Fear, not only to the Good, and Gentle, but also to the Froward.</HI> So likewise St. <HI>Paul</HI> in both his Epistles to the <HI>Ephe∣sians,</HI> and <HI>Colossians,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Eph. 6. <HI>v.</HI> 5. Col. 3.22.</NOTE> <HI>Commands Servants to be obedient to them that are their Masters according to the Flesh,</HI> &amp;c. And that this particularly respects <HI>Slaves,</HI> appears by the 8. verse of the 6. Chapter of the former of these Epistles.</P>
<P>So that if a Man may thus make himself a <HI>Slave,</HI> or <HI>perpetual Servant</HI> to another by his <HI>own consent,</HI> I cannot see any Reason why a <HI>whole Nation</HI> may not do the same, and deliver themselves up to one Man, or more to be Go∣verned, and treated both for their Lives, Liberties, and Fortunes, at his or their Discretion. So that, tho' he may perhaps <HI>abuse</HI> this Power to the <HI>seve∣rest Tyranny,</HI> or Oppression: Yet have they <HI>no Right</HI> to shake off this Yoak, or to <HI>resist</HI> him; since their Lives, and Fortunes are <HI>wholly</HI> at his disposal, by their <HI>own Act,</HI> and <HI>Consent.</HI> And that <HI>whole Nations</HI> may justly surrender them∣selves for <HI>Slaves</HI> or <HI>absolute Subjects,</HI> I can give you two Examples approved of by God in the <HI>Scriptures:</HI> The <HI>first</HI> is, that of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who, when they had sold all their Goods and Lands to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> for Bread, to keep them∣selves alive in the seven years of Famine we read of in <HI>Genesis.</HI> You'll find they were afterwards such absolute Servants or Slaves to <HI>Pha∣raoh.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 47.21, 22.</NOTE> <HI>That as for the People he removed them to Cities, from one end of the Borders of</HI> Egypt <HI>even to the other end thereof, only the Land of the Priests bought he not,</HI> &amp;c. The other is, that of the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> of whom we read, that they accepted of their Lives from <HI>Ioshua,</HI> and the Elders of <HI>Israel:</HI> Tho' on the Condition of the greatest slavery, ra∣ther than they would venture to be destroyed. So that if <HI>absolute Monarchy</HI> were <HI>not Lawful,</HI> but <HI>contrary</HI> to God's Will and <HI>Institution,</HI> most of the great∣est Kingdoms in the World would be governed <HI>contrary</HI> to the <HI>Laws of God</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI>; and the <HI>Subjects</HI> of all the Kingdoms from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>China,</HI> (not reckoning those of <HI>Africa</HI>) might immediately, if they were able, <HI>rebel</HI> against their Monarchs, and set up what sort of Government they thought fit: Since none of the Subjects in those Kingdoms hold their Lives, Liberties or Estates by any other Tenure, than the Good Will or Pleasure of the Monarch, who may take away all or any of them as often as he pleases to do it, and that without <HI>any right</HI> of <HI>Resistance</HI> in all, or any of their <HI>Subjects,</HI> let them use them never so <HI>severely.</HI></P>

<P>I cannot deny, but what you say is so far true, that <HI>one</HI> Man, or <HI>ma∣ny</HI> together may grant, or <HI>sell</HI> themselves for <HI>Slaves</HI> by their <HI>own Consent</HI>; and that the Persons who thus make over themselves, have afterwards <HI>no Right,</HI> or Property in any thing, more than a <HI>bare Subsistence,</HI> yet that <HI>servitude</HI> is not by the Law of <HI>Nature,</HI> but only brought in by <HI>Custom</HI>▪ or the Law of <HI>Nations,</HI> as all Writers agree, and is so far lawful, because it tends to the Good, and Pre∣servation
<PB N="161" REF="89"/>
of Mankind, that <HI>Prisoners</HI> taken in <HI>War</HI> should rather be kept as <HI>Slaves,</HI> than immediately slain, or that Men compelled by <HI>extream necessity,</HI> should sell themselves, or their Children, rather than both should perish; and therefore it is no wonder, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> who were not sent to <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter</HI> the State of things in the World, or to <HI>entrench</HI> upon any Man's <HI>civil Righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> should command Servants, or <HI>Slaves,</HI> to be <HI>Subject</HI> to their Masters, tho' <HI>un∣believers:</HI> Yet doth it not therefore follow, that when men are <HI>forced</HI> to give themselves thus up to the Power of another, they likewise give him an <HI>abso∣lute Right</HI> over their Lives, so as that their Masters may take them away, whenever they please; for that was more than they ever had over themselves. Nor doth God confer any such Power upon Masters, and therefore, if the Ma∣ster hath no such <HI>absolute Right,</HI> or Property in the Persons of his <HI>Slaves,</HI> as he hath in his Sheep, or Cattle; I see no reason, why even <HI>Slaves,</HI> if their Masters go about to take away their Lives for no other Cause, but to satisfie their own humour, or passion, may not, (if they cannot otherwise escape) <HI>resist</HI> their <HI>Masters,</HI> and save their Lives if they can. For all Writers agree, that if a Master doth so <HI>inhumanely</HI> abuse his <HI>Slave</HI>; that he can no longer en∣dure it without <HI>danger</HI> of his Life, he may in that Case Lawfully <HI>run away,</HI> and escape from him; and why he may not as well <HI>resist</HI> him to save his Life, when his Master goeth about thus <HI>unjustly,</HI> and without any Cause to take it away; I can see no reason to the contrary: Since it was only for the <HI>saving</HI> his Life, that such a Man could ever be supposed to yield himself a <HI>Slave</HI> to another; and which <HI>Condition</HI> being broken on the <HI>Masters</HI> part, the <HI>Servant</HI> is again in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> and the <HI>relation</HI> of <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Servant</HI> so far <HI>ceases</HI>; or is at least <HI>suspended,</HI> during that Violence.</P>
<P>This being the state of <HI>particular Men,</HI> I cannot think that God hath put <HI>whole Nations</HI> in a <HI>worse Condition</HI>; nor can I ever imagine, that any <HI>whole Na∣tion,</HI> unless urged by some <HI>extream necessity,</HI> would ever give up themselves so <HI>absolutely</HI> for <HI>Slaves,</HI> as not to have <HI>any</HI> Right to <HI>defend</HI> their own Lives, or a Property in any thing they can enjoy; and if ever they could be supposed to have done so, I think I may boldly affirm, that <HI>such</HI> a Nation are not <HI>Subjects,</HI> but <HI>Slaves,</HI> and the <HI>Prince</HI> not a <HI>Monarch</HI> or Civil Governour, but only a <HI>Lord</HI> of a <HI>Great Family,</HI> or <HI>Master</HI> of a publick <HI>Work-house.</HI></P>
<P>For I take the <HI>difference</HI> betwixt <HI>Subjects,</HI> or <HI>Slaves,</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Masters</HI> of Families to consist in this, that the <HI>Power</HI> of a <HI>Prince,</HI> is <HI>chiefly ordained</HI> for the <HI>Good,</HI> and Preservation of his <HI>Subjects,</HI> tho' I grant <HI>his own</HI> may likewise be included in it, as an Encouragement, and <HI>Reward</HI> for his <HI>Labour</HI>; yet not as the <HI>principal End</HI> of his <HI>Institution:</HI> Whereas in a Family of <HI>Slaves,</HI> they are chiefly <HI>ordained</HI> for his profit, or Benefit that <HI>maintains</HI> them; but their Happiness, and Preservation is only accidental, and as it may conduce to that. The <HI>main End</HI> also of Civil Government is to institute and maintain a <HI>distinct Property</HI> in men's Estates, and which the Prince, or Common-wealth can have <HI>no Right</HI> to take away. And therefore, tho' I grant that in those <HI>Despoti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k Monarchies</HI> you mention, the Monarchs do exercise an <HI>Absolute, Arbitrary Power</HI> over the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of their Subjects: Yet that this is by <HI>Divine Right,</HI> or <HI>Institution</HI> I utterly deny, or that it was always so in all of them from the beginning; for most of those <HI>Empires</HI> you mention can <HI>no otherwise</HI> subsist than by a Constant maintaining vast <HI>standing Armies,</HI> or Guards to keep their Sub∣jects in Obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="90"/>Nor can any Governments be of <HI>Divine Institution,</HI> which are exercised with a <HI>sole Respect</HI> to the personal Power, and Grandeur of the <HI>Prince,</HI> rather than the <HI>Good</HI> and Preservation of the <HI>People.</HI> So that if you will but survey the accounts that Travellers give us of those <HI>Eastern</HI> Parts of the World, you will find, that there are no known <HI>setled Laws</HI> or <HI>Properties</HI> in those Countries, except at the <HI>Arbitrary Will</HI> of the Monarch, or his Viceroys; and thus all those rich, and <HI>fruitful Countries</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> which formerly flourished in all Arts, Knowledge and Civility, and abounded in Multitudes of People, are now in most places reduced to <HI>meer Deserts,</HI> and do not breed a <HI>Tenth part</HI> of that number of People, as they did in former Ages: Which proceeds from no other cause but the <HI>Cruelty,</HI> and <HI>Injustice</HI> of the Government, quite diffe∣rent from what it was in the time of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours, who tho', I con∣fess, they were in some sence <HI>absolute</HI> too, yet governed by, and were obliged to observe <HI>Known Laws</HI>▪ and the People had a <HI>settled Property</HI> in their Estates, which the <HI>Prince</HI> had <HI>no Right</HI> to take away. I shall not enquire how all these <HI>Monarchs</HI> came to be so <HI>Arbitrary</HI> at first, and thus to <HI>abuse</HI> their <HI>Power.</HI> But the <HI>Generality,</HI> or <HI>Antiquity</HI> of this <HI>abuse</HI> can be no more a <HI>Plea</HI> for its <HI>Right,</HI> than that because <HI>Idolatry</HI> was generally practised throughout the World within three or four hundred Years after the <HI>Flood,</HI> till three or above four hundred Years after <HI>Christ,</HI> therefore, <HI>Idolatry</HI> was the <HI>True</HI> and <HI>Ancient Reli∣gion</HI> of the World.</P>
<P>Now, tho' I will not condemn this <HI>sort</HI> of <HI>Government</HI>▪ where the Subjects enjoy no <HI>setled Property</HI> in Lands, or Goods, as <HI>absolutely unlawful,</HI> and direct∣ly <HI>contrary</HI> to the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> or <HI>Nature:</HI> Yet in those Kingdoms and Com∣mon-wealths, where <HI>Civil,</HI> or <HI>Hereditary Property</HI> is once introduced, I think it is <HI>not Lawful,</HI> nor indeed in the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Prince</HI> or Common-wealth to <HI>destroy,</HI> or take it away. And therefore if the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours should have endeavoured by any Laws, or Edicts of their own making to have <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stroyed</HI> all <HI>Civil,</HI> or <HI>Hereditary Property</HI> in Lands and Goods, and to have <HI>reduced</HI> all the Estates of their Subjects into their <HI>own Possession:</HI> I think they might have been <HI>Lawfully</HI> disobeyed, and <HI>resisted</HI> by the <HI>People,</HI> since they went about to destroy <HI>one great End</HI> of Civil Government, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Instituting,</HI> and Maintaining of <HI>Civil Property.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, I freely grant that in <HI>all Countries</HI> which are governed, either by <HI>absolute Monarchies,</HI> or <HI>Common-wealths,</HI> the <HI>Soveraignty,</HI> is so fully in one Per∣son, or Body of Men, that it hath <HI>no other Bounds</HI> or <HI>Limits</HI> under God; but its <HI>own Will,</HI> or <HI>Commands:</HI> Provided they do not <HI>apparently</HI> tend to the <HI>absolute Ruine,</HI> and Destruction of the <HI>People</HI>; for that being <HI>inconsistent</HI> with the <HI>Noti∣on,</HI> or <HI>End</HI> of governing them, they are, and ever will be <HI>Iudges</HI> of it. And therefore even amongst the <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> themselves, if they should once find their <HI>Prince</HI> go about <HI>wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ully</HI> to destroy them, or sell them for <HI>Slaves</HI>; you would soon find (notwithstanding this <HI>servile Subjection,</HI>) That they would quickly be rid of them, as the <HI>Ianisaries</HI> have served their <HI>Emperours</HI> of late Years, for far less faults.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny but you have spoken reasonably enough on this Sub∣ject, and perhaps if you had <HI>restrained</HI> this <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Resistance</HI> only to such Ca∣ses, where the Prince, or Monarch makes <HI>open War</HI> upon his People, or doth otherwise <HI>actually</HI> go about to <HI>destroy</HI> them, it might have been a tolerable do∣ctrine that they may <HI>lawfully resist</HI> the <HI>Forces</HI> he shall send against them, but
<PB N="163" REF="90"/>
this is a Case that so seldom happens (if ever at all) that it can never be sup∣posed, and <HI>no Prince, unless he were Mad,</HI> can be guilty of it; and therefore when ever he Acts thus, I think he may <HI>not only</HI> be <HI>Lawfully resisted,</HI> but <HI>tyed up for a Madman.</HI> But this is seldom, or never the Case between <HI>Monarchs,</HI> and their <HI>People,</HI> for most of the <HI>Rebellions,</HI> and <HI>Insurrections</HI> that I have ever read of, or observed in the World, have not proceeded from any <HI>necessity</HI> that the Peo∣ple had <HI>to rise up in Arms,</HI> and Rebel against their <HI>Supream Magistrates,</HI> because their Lives, or Estates were assaulted, or in danger to be taken away, but for the most part they arose either from the <HI>too Great Cruelty,</HI> or severity of the <HI>Supream Power</HI> towards some <HI>particular Private</HI> Men, who by themselves, and their Friends and Relations have gone about to <HI>revenge</HI> those Injuries, that they supposed had been done them. And of this, all <HI>Histories</HI> are to full, that I need give no particular Instances of them; all which <HI>abuses</HI> may be reduced to these Heads. <HI>First,</HI> when a Prince doth commonly himself violate the <HI>Cha∣stities</HI> of the Wives, or Daughters of the Subjects, which tho' it hath been the <HI>ruine</HI> of <HI>divers Princes,</HI> yet is he able to do this only to some <HI>few particu∣lar</HI> Persons, and tho' if he should permit his <HI>Soldiers,</HI> or <HI>Officers</HI> generally to do this, without <HI>any Punishment</HI>; yet even this, can hardly, if ever, extend to all the Wives, Daughters, or Women in a whole Countrey: And there∣fore both these Cases are to be born withal, according to your own Principles, since it doth not tend to the <HI>Slavery,</HI> or Destruction of the <HI>People,</HI> I mean, as to their <HI>whole complexed Body.</HI> A <HI>Second</HI> is, when an <HI>absolute Prince</HI> or Monarch goeth about to <HI>alter</HI> the <HI>established Religion</HI> of his Countrey, and to introduce a <HI>different one</HI> by his own <HI>sole Authority,</HI> whilst the <HI>Major part</HI> of the People con∣tinue of <HI>another Opinion.</HI> In this Case, I suppose you will not affirm, that the <HI>Subjects</HI> have a <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>resist</HI> their Prince for so doing. For then the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> might justly have <HI>rebelled</HI> against <HI>Constantine,</HI> when he shut up the <HI>Hea∣then</HI> Temples, and forbad all <HI>publick Sacrifices</HI> to their Gods, and thereby made the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion the <HI>established Profession</HI> of the <HI>Empire.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray Sir, give me leave to interrupt you a little, might not <HI>Con∣stantine</HI> have a <HI>Right</HI> to do this, because the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> is the only true one; and that the <HI>Idolatry</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> then practised, was against the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever weight there may be in this answer, yet you have no rea∣son to put this Question now; since you have already, <HI>viz.</HI> at our first Confe∣rence asserted, that, an <HI>Erroneous Conscience</HI> gives men a <HI>Right</HI> to follow it, during the time they are under this <HI>Ignorance</HI> of the <HI>Truth:</HI> And therefore if the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours had <HI>not a Right</HI> to do this by their <HI>own Authority</HI> with∣out any <HI>resistance,</HI> the <HI>Subjects,</HI> whilst they believed the Worship of their God to be thereby destroyed, <HI>might,</HI> nay, ought to have <HI>resisted</HI> the <HI>Emperour,</HI> rather than to have suffered him to have <HI>altered</HI> the <HI>antient Religion</HI> of the Empire, and to have brought in another, which they look't upon as an <HI>upstart</HI>; and it is very natural for Men to do so, since nothing ought to be <HI>more dear</HI> to them, than the <HI>Worship</HI> and <HI>honour</HI> of <HI>God.</HI></P>

<P>I do not desire at present to Embark my self in this tedious, and trou∣blesome dispute about the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> in matters of <HI>Reli∣gion</HI>; and therefore I shall say no more to it at present, but if your Assertion be true, that an <HI>absolute Monarch</HI> may set up <HI>what Religion</HI> he pleases, without
<PB N="164" REF="91"/>
being <HI>resisted</HI> by the <HI>Subjects,</HI> whom I suppose to be of <HI>another perswasion,</HI> it will then follow, that if the <HI>French</HI> King, or Emperour of <HI>Musc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vy,</HI> should turn <HI>Mahometan,</HI> and should set up that Superstition <HI>by force,</HI> for the Publick, and <HI>National Religion</HI> of the Countrey, tho' with the <HI>Destruction</HI> of all that should <HI>oppose</HI> it, <HI>none</HI> of their Subjects might <HI>resist</HI> them in so doing; and if so, I desire you to consider, what you have gained to Religion by thus asserting such an <HI>unlimited Prerogative</HI> to all Monarchs. But laying aside this Dispute till another time, I pray go on to the rest of those Cases in which the <HI>People</HI> do take upon them to <HI>resist</HI> the <HI>Supream Powers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall comply with your desires, and therefore a <HI>Third</HI> Pretence of Subjects to <HI>rebel,</HI> is, when the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> shall think it necessary to <HI>levy</HI> upon their <HI>People</HI> more heavy and grievous <HI>Taxes,</HI> and <HI>Impositions,</HI> than the <HI>People</HI> are willing, or, it may be, able to <HI>pay.</HI> Now, if your Principle be true, that they may <HI>rise in Arms,</HI> and <HI>resist</HI> the Supream Powers, whenever they think themselves thus <HI>intolerably oppressed,</HI> and if they shall be <HI>sole Iudges</HI> of this oppression, then all the <HI>Rebellions</HI> that ever were made in <HI>England,</HI> or elsewhere, by reason of such excessive Tributes, or Taxes, whould be <HI>Lawful.</HI> Which would be a perpetual Ground of <HI>Anarchy,</HI> and <HI>Confusion:</HI> For <HI>private Subjects,</HI> not being admitted into the Privy Councils of Princes, or States, can never be supposed to understand, whether the <HI>necessities</HI> of the <HI>Common-wealth</HI> may require them, or not. And indeed the <HI>People</HI> do so often <HI>repine</HI> and mur∣mur at the Government, when the <HI>Publick Necessities</HI> require to impose great∣er <HI>Taxes,</HI> or <HI>Gabels</HI> than they think they can well bear, that the <HI>Mobile</HI> of any <HI>great City</HI> or <HI>Province</HI> for Example, who think themselves thus oppressed, beyond what they are able, or perhaps willing to bear; may rise in <HI>Rebellion</HI> and throw off all <HI>Obedience</HI> to <HI>Civil Authority,</HI> and they may have a very good Pretence for it, according to your Principle, because they may look upon them∣selves as a <HI>very considerable,</HI> nay, <HI>necessary</HI> part of the <HI>Common-wealth.</HI> And thus the <HI>Common People</HI> of <HI>Kent</HI> might have justified their <HI>Rebellion</HI> in <HI>Richard</HI> the seconds time under <HI>Wat Tyler,</HI> and <HI>Iack Straw</HI>; and the People of <HI>Devon∣shire,</HI> and <HI>Somerset-shire</HI> might likewise have justified their <HI>Insurrection</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> the sevenths Reign under <HI>Flammock</HI> the <HI>Black smith.</HI> And I could mention others of the like Nature, but I forbear, because you may say they were upon <HI>account of Religion.</HI> And lastly, <HI>this Principle</HI> might very well justifie the <HI>In∣surrection</HI> of the People of <HI>Naples</HI> under <HI>Massaniello,</HI> which besides the vast spoil it made upon the Goods and Palaces of the Nobility, ended at last (whatso∣ever they pretended at first to the contrary) in delivering up themselves to the King of <HI>France,</HI> who refusing to protect them they were soon reduced to their <HI>former Obedience</HI> to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>In short, if the <HI>People</HI> should take upon them to <HI>Resist,</HI> or <HI>Rebel,</HI> whenever they thought themselves <HI>intolerably injured,</HI> and <HI>oppressed</HI> in their Estates by <HI>im∣moderate Taxes,</HI> there would be <HI>no End</HI> of such Rebellions, especially conside∣ring the advantage which Wicked, Crafty, and Ambitious men would there∣by take to excite the People to <HI>rise</HI> and <HI>depose</HI> their <HI>Lawful Governours,</HI> and set up themselves in their Room upon Pretence of better Government, and greater Liberty. And how prone the <HI>Common People</HI> have been to receive such <HI>Impressions,</HI> He is but meanly a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in <HI>Antient,</HI> and <HI>Modern</HI> History, who is not convinced of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>To answer this Objection, before you proceed farther, my opinion in
<PB N="165" REF="91"/>
short is, that tho' such <HI>Taxes</HI> may often prove an <HI>Universal Dammage,</HI> and a great impoverishment to the <HI>Subjects</HI>; yet if they are such as may be born with <HI>less trouble,</HI> than can follow from a <HI>Civil War,</HI> or the <HI>change</HI> of the <HI>Go∣vernment,</HI> there is no <HI>just</HI> or <HI>sufficient cause</HI> of <HI>Resistance</HI> of the Soveraign Magi∣strates commands, or Edicts concerning them. As for Example, such great <HI>Taxes</HI> as the Subjects pay, and perhaps may bear it well enough in <HI>Holland</HI> and other Countries; since there may be a <HI>necessity</HI> for such <HI>Taxes,</HI> and of this I grant the <HI>Supream Authority</HI> of the Nation can be the <HI>only Iudges.</HI> And how far this may extend, I cannot positively determine. For suppose you should ask me, if the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> should borrow all the <HI>Ready Money</HI> the Subjects had, for the <HI>necessary uses</HI> of the State, so that they would give them <HI>Leather,</HI> or <HI>Brass</HI> Money instead of it, to go at the <HI>same value,</HI> for the <HI>necessary uses</HI> of <HI>Commerce,</HI> yet if they did not take away their <HI>Property</HI> in their Lands, Corn, or Living Stock; which are the <HI>necessary means</HI> of their Subsistance, I do not think it were a <HI>sufficient Cause,</HI> to take up Arms against their Governours for so doing; be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause the <HI>Subjects</HI> cannot tell, but that the <HI>necessities</HI> of the <HI>State,</HI> (for their <HI>necessary defence</HI> against a <HI>Potent Forreign</HI> Enemy) may require it. And sure, it is a much <HI>greater Evil</HI> to fall into a <HI>Civil War,</HI> or to be subdued by <HI>Strangers,</HI> than to part with their <HI>Money</HI>; since by such a <HI>War,</HI> or <HI>Conquest</HI> they might not only lose that <HI>Money,</HI> but also their <HI>Liberties,</HI> and <HI>Estates.</HI></P>
<P>Yet, on the other side, I would not be understood to give the <HI>Supream Ma∣gistrates,</HI> a Power to <HI>invade</HI> the Properties, and Estates of their Subjects to <HI>what degree</HI> they thought fit. For then they might <HI>Tax</HI> them to that extremi∣ty as might <HI>force</HI> them to <HI>sell</HI> themselves, and their Wives and Children for <HI>Slaves,</HI> or else being unable to pay, must be <HI>forced</HI> to run away and leave <HI>their</HI> Habitations, (as the <HI>Peasants</HI> often do in <HI>France</HI>;) whereby <HI>whole Villa∣ges,</HI> nay <HI>Towns,</HI> may become <HI>depopulated,</HI> as they are in divers parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> and <HI>Turkey,</HI> by such <HI>extraordinary Severitles,</HI> and therefore in <HI>absolute Monarchies,</HI> where there is no Nobility, Gentry, nor Yeomen, who can claim any Pro∣perty in their Estates, which with us make up the <HI>best</HI> and <HI>most considerable part</HI> of the <HI>People</HI>; and where the <HI>Government</HI> being <HI>wholy Military,</HI> and is ex∣ercised, over the People, only by <HI>force of Arms</HI>; I doubt not but such a <HI>People</HI> reduced to this <HI>extremity,</HI> may not only quit the <HI>Countrey,</HI> where they are thus <HI>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olerably oppress't,</HI> but that, if they are not of themselves <HI>strong enough</HI> to make <HI>Resistance</HI> and cast off this <HI>intolerable Yoke</HI> by force, they may (if an occasion be offered) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyn with any <HI>Neighbour</HI> Prince, or State, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will under∣take their <HI>Quarrel,</HI> and upon this account, I think▪ we may very well justifie the <HI>Revolt</HI> of the <HI>Greek</HI> Christians from the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Yoke, and putting them∣selves under the <HI>Protection</HI> of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> both in the <HI>Morea,</HI> and other pla∣ces; and also upon the same Principles, I conceive, the <HI>Common People</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> who are reduced to the <HI>like extremities,</HI> might also with a <HI>safe Consci∣ence</HI> revolt from the <HI>Present King,</HI> and put themselves under the <HI>Protection</HI> of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> our now present Soveraign, or the States of <HI>Hotland</HI>▪ if ever they should be <HI>successful enough</HI> to make any considerable <HI>Invasion</HI> upon that Kingdom.</P>
<P>And therefore I must confess, that there can be no <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>stated Rule</HI> set down to what Proportion <HI>absolute Princes</HI> or Commonwealths may <HI>Tax</HI> their Subjects, since in some Countreys the <HI>People</HI> can better part with a <HI>Shil∣ling,</HI> than in others they can pay a <HI>Peny.</HI> And as I grant it must be left to
<PB N="166" REF="92"/>
the <HI>Mercy,</HI> and Discretion of the <HI>Governours</HI> what <HI>Taxes</HI> to impose without thus ruining and destroying their <HI>People,</HI> as it is left to the Judgment of the owner of the Beast, how much burden it is able to bear. So if he, by laying too great a weight, breaks the Back of his Horse or Beast, he not only hath the <HI>Loss,</HI> but makes himself the <HI>Laughing-stock</HI> of all his Neighbours: So that, tho' I confess the <HI>People</HI> ought to have <HI>Patience,</HI> and rather to suffer <HI>many Oppres∣sions,</HI> and hardships, than to put themselves in this miserable <HI>State of War</HI>; Yet there is a <HI>midst</HI> in all things, and the <HI>People</HI> may be so <HI>Cruelly Oppressed</HI> by <HI>Taxes,</HI> and other <HI>Impositions,</HI> as it is <HI>impossible</HI> for them longer to <HI>Subsist</HI> or provide <HI>Necessaries</HI> for themselves, and their Families: And since you have already granted, that the People may <HI>Iudge</HI> when their <HI>Prince</HI> makes <HI>War</HI> up∣on them, and goeth <HI>actually</HI> about to <HI>destroy</HI> them by the Sword, I cannot see, why they may not have the <HI>same Right</HI> of <HI>Iudging</HI> when they are like to be <HI>destroyed</HI> by Famine too. And who can be <HI>Iudge</HI> of this, but those who feel it?</P>
<P>But indeed it is <HI>Morally impossible</HI> for the <HI>People</HI> to be <HI>mistaken</HI> in so plain a Case. For, tho' this many-headed beast (as you commonly call them,) the People can∣not argue very Subtilly of the future <HI>Consequences</HI> of things, yet they have a very <HI>Nice and Tender Sense</HI> of feeling, and can very well tell, when they are so in∣jured, and oppressed: that they can bear it no longer, for then sure, they may be allowed to have as much Care, and Sense of their own Preservation, as <HI>Camels,</HI> and <HI>Dromedaries,</HI> which (as Travellers Relate) tho' they are taught by their Masters to Kneel down, and to receive their Loads, which they will patiently endure as long as they are able to bear them, Yet when once their Masters do over-exceed that weight, neither fair means nor foul, can pre∣vail upon them to rise, or they will throw off those Loads if risen, that they feel will otherwise break their Backs. But I have Discoursed long enough on this Head, and therefore if you have nothing more material to except against it, I pray proceed to the rest of the <HI>Causes,</HI> that Subjects may, as you think, pretend to have, to <HI>take up Arms</HI> against the <HI>Supream Powers.</HI></P>

<P>I have somewhat more to urge, towards proving that this <HI>Liberty</HI> which you allow the <HI>Subjects,</HI> wholy tends to <HI>Anarchy,</HI> and <HI>Confusion</HI>; but I shall reserve it to the last, when I shall Sum up all that I have farther to urge upon this Subject, and therefore I shall proceed to the <HI>other Pretences</HI> that <HI>Sub∣jects</HI> in <HI>absolute Monarchies</HI> may make to <HI>Rebel</HI>; and the next may be, that the <HI>Monarch</HI> looking upon his <HI>Subjects</HI> as his <HI>Slaves,</HI> may either <HI>use</HI> them so himself, or <HI>Sell</HI> them to other Nations for that purpose, as <HI>Mon∣fieur Chardin</HI> tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Sir</HI> Jo. Chardins <HI>Travels L.</HI> 1.</NOTE> the King of <HI>Mingrelia</HI> often doth diverse of his People to <HI>Raise Money,</HI> And tho' I will not be so Ridiculous as to suppose That such a Monarch can <HI>Sell</HI> away <HI>all</HI> his People at once; for then he should be left <HI>alone</HI> without any Subjects, and Consequently become <HI>no King.</HI> Yet in such Monarchies as diverse of the <HI>Ea∣stern,</HI> and <HI>African</HI> are at this day, where (as you your self own) the <HI>People</HI> having no <HI>Setled</HI> or <HI>Hereditary Property</HI> in their Estates, the Monarch may dis∣pose of their <HI>Particular Persons</HI> as he thinks fit; I cannot see any reason, why, the <HI>Monarch</HI> may not in these Countries without any blame exert his <HI>Preroga∣tive</HI> if he pleases, and take as many of his <HI>Subjects,</HI> or their Children to serve him as <HI>Slaves,</HI> as he thinks necessary for his Service.</P>
<P>And therefore <HI>whatsoever People</HI> or <HI>Nation</HI> have thus Subjected themselves to
<PB N="167" REF="92"/>
the <HI>Absolute Power,</HI> or Dominion of <HI>one Man,</HI> they have no more Right to <HI>Regain</HI> their <HI>Natural Liberty,</HI> than I should have of taking away any thing by <HI>Force</HI> which I had before given or granted to <HI>another</HI>: For this Sort of <HI>Civil Servitude,</HI> is not so <HI>Repugnant</HI> to Nature as some Imagine, or that because Subjects were <HI>forced</HI> to consent to it for the avoiding of some <HI>Greater Evil,</HI> they can afterwards have <HI>any Right</HI> to shake it off again when ever they will. For, tho' I grant, that God hath not <HI>Instituted</HI> any such Servitude, yet when once it is introduced in any Country, Men are not at Liberty to cast off the Yoke when ever they please, but to observe St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Rule, <HI>If thou art a Servant, care not for it, but if thou are free, chuse it rather,</HI> That is, <HI>Freedom</HI> is to be preferred before <HI>Servitude</HI> or <HI>Subjection.</HI> But where <HI>Providence</HI> hath made Men <HI>Absolute S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvants,</HI> or <HI>Subjects</HI>; they are bound to continue in that State, unless the Supream Powers, they are under, think fit to Release them from it. And therefore this can be no <HI>good Pretence</HI> under <HI>Absolute Monarchies</HI> for Subjects to <HI>take up Arms</HI> against their Prince, for such a State of Liberty which they never enjoyed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not trouble my self to Dispute, what Right an <HI>Absolute Mo∣narch</HI> may have over the <HI>Persons</HI> of his People in a Country, where they have <HI>no Property,</HI> nor <HI>Written Laws,</HI> and where they look upon themselves as no bet∣ter than <HI>Slaves</HI> to their <HI>Prince,</HI> and perhaps may take a Pride in it, (as I have read the <HI>Russians</HI> do.) And therefore if they have so <HI>wholy Submitted</HI> themselves, I grant what you assert, is true, and that they have <HI>no Right</HI> to <HI>Resist,</HI> according to the Old saying, <HI>Volenti non fit Injuri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> And yet even in these <HI>Despotick Mo∣narchies,</HI> tho' the Prince may pick out here and there some of his Subjects to sell for <HI>Slaves,</HI> or else to use them as <HI>such</HI> himself; yet I do much question, if he should go about to make any <HI>Considerable Number,</HI> (as suppose to take 20, or 30000 all at once for <HI>Slaves,</HI>) I say, I do much question whether these People would be so <HI>Convinced</HI> of your <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Non-Re∣sistance,</HI> as to let their <HI>Monarch's Guards</HI> drive them into <HI>Slavery,</HI> like Sheep to the Market, but would, if they were <HI>able,</HI> make a <HI>Vigorous Resistance,</HI> and knock their <HI>Drivers</HI> on the Head. Whether <HI>Iure, vel injuria,</HI> I shall not dis∣pute.</P>
<P>But for all this, even in <HI>Absolute Monarchies,</HI> where the People have a <HI>Set∣led Legal Property</HI> in their Lands, and Estates, and consequently where their Persons are free, I doubt not, if their <HI>Princes</HI> should go about to make <HI>all</HI> his Subjects <HI>Slaves</HI>; but that they might <HI>Lawfully Resist</HI> him, or those he im∣ploys in so doing. And tho' it be true, he could not make all his People <HI>Slaves at once,</HI> Yet if he asserted it as a part of his <HI>Royal Prerogative,</HI> and also exerci∣sed it on particular Persons, as often as he thought sit, or could, I doubt not but the People might make it a <HI>common cause</HI>; Since none can know whose turn it may be next: For sure <HI>Liberty from Servitude is as necessary to Man's Happiness and Well-being, as Life is to his Existence:</HI> Which would seem no great Benefit to those.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Martial.</HI></NOTE> who being <HI>Born Free,</HI> were reduced to <HI>Sla∣very</HI>; it being well said by the Poet, <HI>Non est vivere, Sed-valere vita.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors did exercise an <HI>Absolute Power</HI> over their <HI>Sub∣jects,</HI> yet I never read, that they durst presume to make <HI>Slaves</HI> of <HI>Free∣born Romans,</HI> nor indeed of any of those <HI>Nations</HI> they <HI>Subdued</HI>; For they had too great a Sense, and Love of <HI>Liberty</HI> themselves, ever to <HI>Impose</HI> such a Yoke
<PB N="168" REF="93"/>
upon the People they <HI>Conquered,</HI> which was so <HI>Destructive</HI> to the <HI>Common Hap∣piness</HI> and <HI>Preservation</HI> of Mankind. And suppose if the <HI>French Grand Seig∣ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur,</HI> as absolute as he is, or pretends to be, should go about to <HI>Sell</HI> his <HI>Sub∣jects,</HI> (especially the <HI>Nobility</HI>) for <HI>Slaves,</HI> all that the <HI>Iesuites</HI> (those Instru∣ments of Slavery) could do, would not, I believe, be able to Keep <HI>that People</HI> from <HI>Rising</HI> against him. But if you have nothing farther to object against what I have now said; I pray proceed to the next Flead, if you have any more Instances to make.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am now come to the last <HI>Pretence,</HI> that Subjects may make to <HI>Re∣bell.</HI> And that is, Supposing the <HI>Monarch,</HI> should at once, or by <HI>Degrees</HI> turn the <HI>Subjects</HI> out of their <HI>Legal Hereditary Properties</HI> in their <HI>Estates</HI>; And of this you your self grant, there can be no Dispute in those <HI>Despotick Monarchies,</HI> where there is no <HI>Hereditary Property</HI> allowed; And as for all other Govern∣ments, since you do own that all <HI>Legal,</HI> and <HI>Civil Property</HI> in Lands did <HI>chiefly proceed,</HI> or at least is <HI>Established</HI> by the <HI>Civil Power,</HI> I cannot see, why, those Powers in any Kingdom (if they think it would conduce to the Good of the Common-Wealth,) may not <HI>Destroy</HI> this <HI>Civil Property,</HI> and either make all Estates equal, or else ordain, that they shall be <HI>enjoyed</HI> (as in all <HI>absolute Mo∣narchies</HI>) at the <HI>Will</HI> of the <HI>Prince</HI>; since, if the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> are the <HI>Au∣thor</HI> of this <HI>Property,</HI> sure they may <HI>alter,</HI> and <HI>Abrogate</HI> it again as often as they think fit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not Dispute with you concerning <HI>such Kingdoms,</HI> where there is no <HI>Civil Property</HI> yet <HI>Instituted,</HI> or where the <HI>People</HI> do own themselves <HI>Slaves</HI> to the <HI>Prince</HI>: But if such a Monarch, hath <HI>remitted</HI> any thing of this <HI>Right</HI>; and hath <HI>Instituted</HI> a <HI>Legal Hereditary Property</HI> in Estates; such a Law being once made, <HI>I do not think it is in the Prince's Power to revoke it,</HI> any more than it is for a <HI>Master</HI> to <HI>Reduce</HI> his <HI>Slaves</HI> again to <HI>Servitude</HI> after he hath once set them free; Since both Men's Liberties, or a Setled or Hereditary Property an Estates do equally conduce to the Happiness and Propagation of Mankind, and the Good of that People, or Nation, wherein it is introduced. And I doubt not, but <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> tho' he was Lord of all the Lands of <HI>Egypt,</HI> by the Grant of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> yet might lawfully have been <HI>Resisted</HI> by them, if he had gone to take away those <HI>Four Fifth</HI> parts of the profit of the Lands, which he had left thern <HI>free</HI> by his <HI>own Concession.</HI></P>
<P>So that even in such <HI>Absolute Empires,</HI> the Monarchs have <HI>Power</HI> to <HI>Dispose</HI> of the <HI>Estates</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> only as far as the <HI>Compact</HI>▪ or <HI>Concession</HI> at first made by them or their <HI>Predecessors</HI> do allow: But it is also not much otherwise where the <HI>Subjects</HI> do not acknowledge their Estates as the <HI>Gift,</HI> or Benefit of the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> and that may happen chiefly two ways, Either 1. When any <HI>Free People,</HI> under the Conduct of a Captain or Leader, Created by themselves, have Conquered any <HI>New Territory,</HI> and Habitation; or else, 2. When Diverse Fathers, or Masters of a Family, who had Estates of their own before have agreed for their <HI>Mutual Security,</HI> and the quiet Enjoyment of what they were already possess of, to joyn together into <HI>one Common-Wealth,</HI> under the Com∣mand of one, or more Men, or else of others that will bring their Estates, and joyn themselves to such a Government already Constituted, and will <HI>Sub∣iect</HI> themselves to this <HI>Supream Power,</HI> according to the <HI>Conditions</HI> already agreed on amongst them. A <HI>third</HI> Case may be, when an <HI>Hereditary Property</HI> in Land was <HI>Establisht</HI> before the <HI>Monarchy</HI> began, as in the <HI>Roman</HI> Common-Wealth,
<PB N="169" REF="93"/>
this Property was Establish't before the Government was changed from a <HI>Re∣publick</HI> to a <HI>Monarchy,</HI> so that the People did not owe their <HI>Property</HI> to the <HI>Em∣perors</HI> Grant, or Donation.</P>
<P>In the former case, if such a Free People <HI>Conquer</HI> a Country under the Con∣duct of a <HI>Captain</HI> or Leader, tho', I grant, such a Country may be <HI>Assigned</HI> by him to <HI>all the People by Lot,</HI> or in Proportion to the <HI>greater Merit,</HI> or Service of his <HI>Fellow Adventurers,</HI> or Soldiers, (tho' it may seem that the Property of Particular Men, may have proceeded, not from their own Right, or Pos∣session, but from the Assignment of their Chief Captain or Leader,) Yet are not the <HI>Estates</HI> which such <HI>particular Men</HI> enjoy, to be look't upon only, as the <HI>meer Grace,</HI> or <HI>Favour</HI> of such a Prince, since most of those who followed him in this <HI>Conquest,</HI> or <HI>Expedition,</HI> did it not, as <HI>Subjects,</HI> but as <HI>Volunteers,</HI> and without whose <HI>Assistance,</HI> he could never have <HI>Conquered</HI> at all: So that they have thereby <HI>acquired</HI> to themselves a <HI>certain Portion,</HI> or <HI>Share</HI> in the Land so Conquered, tho' for avoiding <HI>Dissentions,</HI> and <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrels</HI> amongst them, it was left to the <HI>Disposal</HI> of this <HI>New Prince,</HI> as a <HI>publick Trustee,</HI> to Distribute to each person what share he should have. But in the other Case, when <HI>Fathers,</HI> or <HI>Masters</HI> of Families, before Free, and Possest of Hereditary Estates, do submit themselves to the <HI>Command</HI> of one Man <HI>Voluntarily,</HI> or by <HI>Election.</HI> Those Estates do <HI>much less</HI> depend upon the <HI>Will</HI> or <HI>Favour</HI> of that <HI>Prince.</HI> And therefore, if such a Prince should <HI>without their consents</HI> go about to <HI>take away</HI> their <HI>Property</HI> in their Estates, he might very <HI>Iustly</HI> be <HI>Resisted</HI> by them, since a <HI>quiet enjoyment</HI> of these in Peace, and Safety, was one of the <HI>chief rea∣sons,</HI> that made them <HI>chuse</HI> him for their <HI>Prince,</HI> and was certainly one of the <HI>Original Compacts</HI> of the <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P>And that in <HI>Absolute Monarchies,</HI> where the <HI>Subjects</HI> were not <HI>Slaves,</HI> they look't upon themselves to have such a <HI>settled Property</HI> in their Persons, and Estates, by <HI>Compact,</HI> That <HI>Seneca</HI> boldly pronounced, <HI>Errat, siquis existimat sutum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse ibi R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gem, ubi nihil à Regetutum est; Securitas Securitate mutua pa∣ciscenda est.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Hobbs</HI> himself, as much a Friend as he was to the <HI>Ar∣bitrary Power</HI> of <HI>Monarchs,</HI> and an Enemy to the <HI>Natural Rights</HI> of <HI>Subjects,</HI> yet is forced in his <HI>Leviathan</HI> to confess, <HI>that the Riches, Power, and Honour of a Monarch, arises only from the Riches, Strength, and Reputation of his Sub∣jects, for no King can be Rich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 96.</NOTE> <HI>nor Glorious, nor Secure, whose Subjects are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>her poor, or contemptible.</HI> Tho' how this Riches, and Strength of Sub∣jects can consist with that <HI>Absolute Power</HI> which he gives his <HI>Sovereign</HI> over the Persons, and Estates of his <HI>Subjects,</HI> I cannot understand; since he will not allow of <HI>any Compacts,</HI> or <HI>Conditions</HI> between him and them. But that their <HI>Propriety</HI> may very well consist with the <HI>Power</HI> of the Prince; <HI>Seneca</HI> shews us; <HI>Iure Civili</HI> (says he) <HI>omni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gis sunt, &amp; tamen illa quorum ad Regem pertinet universa pos∣sessio in singulos Dominos descripta sunt, &amp; unaquaeque res habet possessorem suum. Itaque dare Regi, &amp; donum, &amp; mancipium &amp; pecuniam possumus, nec donare illi de suo dicimur. Ad Reges enim Potestas omnium pertinet, ad singulos Proprietas.</HI> And the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> in his Survey of the <HI>Leviathan</HI> makes this excellent remark upon this Passage of <HI>Seneca:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>cap.</HI> 24.</NOTE> <HI>And that Prince who thinks his Power so Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that his Subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts have nothing to give him, will be very unhappy, if he hath evern n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed of their Hands, or their Hearts.</HI> So that notwithstanding this <HI>Universal Power,</HI> or Supereminent Dominion of the <HI>Emperour</HI> over all things, which <HI>Seneca</HI> there supposes, yet, if he should
<PB N="170" REF="94"/>
have gone about to have <HI>Invaded all Men's Properties,</HI> and reduced all Men's Estates into the <HI>Publick Treasury,</HI> I doubt not but he would soon have had not only his <HI>own Legions,</HI> but the <HI>whole Empire</HI> about his Ears. And tho' I have heard that the <HI>French</HI> King, doth by his <HI>Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roitant Taxes,</HI> and <HI>Gabels</HI> raise more M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ney out of the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>Territories</HI> annexed to it, than the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperour doth out of that <HI>vast Empire</HI> (of which he hath the <HI>Sole Propriety</HI> of the Lands in himself) Yet if the <HI>French</HI> King should indeavour by the Power of his <HI>Standing Army</HI> to take away <HI>all Men's Hereditary Properties</HI> in their Estates, and make them all to be holden at <HI>Will,</HI> I doubt not, but he would not only be <HI>Opposed</HI> by his <HI>Subjects,</HI> and perhaps <HI>ruined</HI> in the <HI>Attempt</HI>; but also, if he should Succeed in it, would be so far from being the Richer, or more Powerful, that he would become the Poorer, and Weaker, when he had done: Since no Man would take the Pains to build, till, or improve their Estates, any more than they do in <HI>Turkey,</HI> when they were not sure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> soon they might be turned out of them; or at least could hold them no longer, than for their Lives, or a few years. So prevalent a thing is this <HI>empty shadow,</HI> and <HI>bare Name</HI> of Property that is now left in <HI>France</HI> (being often charged with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to above half the value of the Estates) to encourage the People to beautifie, cultivate, and improve a Country abounding with all those Riches, that Nature, or Art can produce.</P>
<P>And to let you see, I am not at all partial, I think I may safely affirm the same of the <HI>Legislative Power</HI> in this Kingdom, so that, if it should happen (which tho' highly improbable, yet it is not impossible) that the Lords and Commons Assembled in Parliament should so far abuse the Trust reposed in them, as to give up all their <HI>Civil Properties</HI> in their Estates into the Kings F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands, to be disposed of as he should think fit, and that the King should thereupon go about to turn all the People out of their Estates, I doubt not, but they might in that case <HI>resist</HI> the <HI>King</HI> if he went to do it by <HI>force, Notwithstanding this Act of Parliament,</HI> and my reason it, that a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hereditary Property</HI> in Estates, being an <HI>Antient,</HI> if not more, than <HI>Parliament</HI> themselves in this Nation, must consequently be a <HI>Fundamental Law</HI> of the Govern∣ment, and so cannot be <HI>altered</HI> by its <HI>Representatives.</HI> For tho' it be true, the <HI>People</HI> have given them a <HI>Power</HI> to <HI>dispose</HI> of what <HI>part</HI> of their <HI>Estates</HI> they should think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, yet did they not make it <HI>absolute,</HI> to extend either to their Liberties (I mean in respect of <HI>Slavery</HI>) or their <HI>whole Properties</HI> in their Estates. And if the <HI>King</HI> may be <HI>resisted,</HI> if he <HI>invade</HI> them by his own <HI>Sole Authority,</HI> the reason would be the same why he might be also <HI>resisted,</HI> tho' back't by an <HI>Act of Parliament</HI>: Since the ta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing away of <HI>Civil Property</HI> would prove as <HI>dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uctive</HI> to the People<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Liberties and Happiness in the one case, as in the other, and as <HI>great</HI> an <HI>abuse</HI> of the <HI>Trust</HI> reposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them; that were designed to protect it.</P>

<P>I cannot except against your distinction between those Governments where a <HI>Property</HI> in Estates, did <HI>precede</HI> the <HI>Institution</HI> of the Government it sell; for there, I grant, that such a Property may be a <HI>Fundamental Law</HI> of the Govern∣ment, but in those <HI>Monarchies</HI> that have begun by <HI>Conquest,</HI> under the Command of a King; or <HI>absolute Prince,</HI> over an <HI>Army</HI> of his <HI>own Subjects,</HI> in that case upon the <HI>Conquest</HI> of a Kingdom, or forreign Nation, not only the <HI>Prey,</HI> or Goods of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but also their <HI>Estates</HI> were <HI>forfeited</HI> to the <HI>Conquerour,</HI> who had a <HI>Right</HI> either to <HI>retain</HI> them for <HI>himself,</HI> or else to <HI>distribute</HI> them as <HI>Rewards</HI> amongst his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and <HI>Soldiers</HI>: And that this is the <HI>Right</HI> of all <HI>Conquerors,</HI> whether Common-Wealth, or Monarchs, by the <HI>Law of Nations,</HI> and was exercised amongst the <HI>An∣tient
<PB N="171" REF="94"/>
Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> as well as other Nations, I referr you to your own Au∣thors <HI>Grotius,</HI> and <HI>Pufendors.</HI> And therefore, since it appears from History, that most of the Kingdoms now in <HI>Europe,</HI> and particularly this of <HI>England,</HI> began from <HI>Conquest,</HI> under the Conduct of their first Kings, if then whatsoever was so Con∣quered was <HI>acquired</HI> for them, and they <HI>alone</HI> had a <HI>Property</HI> in it, it will necessarily follow that <HI>all Estates</HI> which the Subjects of all sorts now enjoy, must have pro∣ceeded from their <HI>Grants</HI> or <HI>Concessions</HI>; And hence it is, that not only in <HI>England</HI> but also in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> they are all held either <HI>mediately,</HI> or <HI>immediately, of the King:</HI> as being at first all derived from him; and we read in the <HI>antient</HI> Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that the King had the <HI>whole Property</HI> of the Country, till the Reign of <HI>Mal∣colm Conmor,</HI> who, as we read in the Ancient Histories of that Country, granted all the Lands in <HI>Scotland</HI> to his Nobility, and Gentry, according to that old Maxim in their Law, <HI>Rex distribuit totam Toram Scotiae hominibus juis</HI>: And therefore if <HI>Hereditary Pro∣perty</HI> in Estates were only from the <HI>Gift</HI> and <HI>Bounty</HI> of our <HI>Kings</HI> without any <HI>Funda∣mental Contract</HI> between them, and their Subjects, as you suppose; I cannot see any reason (granting the worst that can happen, which is highly improbable) if the <HI>Kings</HI> of this, or of our Neighbouring Nations, should go about by force to <HI>destroy,</HI> and take away this <HI>Hereditary Property</HI> they now enjoy, That the People should have <HI>any Right</HI> to <HI>resist</HI> them; But that it would be not only <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> but <HI>Rebelli∣on</HI> so to do. For tho' I own that <HI>Kings</HI> were guilty of <HI>Perjury</HI> in the sight of God if they did it, yet that being an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffence only against God, the Subjects could have no more right to resist, than Sons in the State of Nature had to resist their Father, if he should go about to take away those Estates, which he had before bestowed upon them.</P>
<P>And as for what you say concerning the <HI>Roman</HI> Common-Wealth, I grant in∣deed, that the <HI>Government</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> did there <HI>precede</HI> that of the <HI>Emperour,</HI> yet if you please to Remember, <HI>Monarchy</HI> was the <HI>first,</HI> and <HI>most Antient</HI> Government of that People. And I doubt not but all the <HI>Property</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> had in their Estates, tho' they preceeded from <HI>Conquest</HI> of their Arms, yet it was wholly owing to the <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Bounty</HI> of their first <HI>Kings,</HI> and when upon the Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulsion of <HI>Iarquin,</HI> the <HI>Supream Power</HI> became divided between the <HI>Senate</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> the <HI>Property</HI> of all the Lands that were <HI>Conquered</HI> devolved upon them, who often divided them to <HI>particular Private Men</HI> as they thought fit, tho' I confess the <HI>Not dividing</HI> of these Lands amongst the <HI>Common People,</HI> was afterwards the Cause of <HI>great Tumults,</HI> and Commotions amongst them; Yet notwithstanding the <HI>Senate</HI> and <HI>Nobility</HI> still maintained their <HI>Power,</HI> and to the last <HI>refused</HI> to make a <HI>Division</HI> of those Lands, they had formerly <HI>Conquered</HI>; So that the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors succeeding in the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Senate,</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> they were likewise restored, as it were <HI>ex pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liminio,</HI> to the <HI>Prerogatives</HI> of the <HI>first Kings,</HI> and consequently, as <HI>Seneca</HI> himself confesses in the place you have quoted, tho' the <HI>particular Propriety</HI> of Estates was in <HI>Private Men,</HI> yet you see he grants the <HI>Vniversal Possession,</HI> or Dominion of them was in the <HI>King,</HI> or Emperor, from whom they were <HI>Originally</HI> derived.</P>
<P>I would not be thought to speak thus, as if I were an Enemy to Mens Liberties, and Properties, or that I either Fear, or desire any Change in them, from what we now enjoy, but since I think it a thing <HI>Morally Impossible</HI> to alter them, and that there∣fore no King will be so ill advised, as to go about to <HI>Seize</HI> them into his <HI>own hands</HI>; but only by way of discourse, supposing the worst that can happen, I think we are not only <HI>Obliged in Conscience,</HI> but also that it were <HI>much better</HI> for the <HI>Common Peace</HI> that the Ring should take <HI>all we have,</HI> than that we should <HI>involve</HI> the Nati∣on in <HI>Civill War,</HI> and confusion, and our <HI>Consciences</HI> under the Guilt of a <HI>Mortal Sin,</HI> by such <HI>Resistance,</HI> and <HI>Rebellion.</HI></P>

<P>I am very sorry to see, that by your Principles all the <HI>Free Nations</HI> of <HI><UNCLEAR>Eu∣rope</UNCLEAR></HI> lye at the Mercy of <HI>any Prince</HI> to be made as <HI>arrand slaves</HI> as any are in <HI>Turkey,</HI> when ever their Monarch please, or that they think that they can make more of their People by taking away their Estates and Liberties, than by let<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing them enjoy them, which would render <HI>Civil Property</HI> in all Kingdoms like <HI>private Estates,</HI> which every Man may let to his <HI>Tenants</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> VVill, upon a <HI>Rack Rent,</HI> or for Years, or Lives as they shall think fit. But I think I may very well differ from you in both your Pro∣positions: For, omitting any farther discourse of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <HI>Eastern</HI> Monarchies, where I grant the <HI>People</HI> are little better than <HI>Slaves</HI>; Yet I think I can easily prove, out of the Ancient Histories of those Kingdoms that are now in <HI>Europe,</HI> that tho' <HI>most</HI> of them began by <HI>Conquest,</HI> yet was it not under the Conduct of <HI>Absolute Monarchs,</HI> but under such Princes, or Leaders, whose <HI>followers</HI> (as I said before at our last meeting,) were not properly <HI>Subjects</HI> nor <HI>Mercenaries,</HI> but <HI>Volunteers,</HI> under those that Com∣manded them. And therefore would never have gone out of their own Countries, but to advantage themselves, and to enjoy those Priviledges, which their Country-men had at home, of which, Liberty in their Persons, and Property in their Estates, were the Chief; and this is apparent in the <HI>French</HI> Nation, who whatever their Conditi∣on may be now, yet Anciently called themselves <HI>Francs</HI>▪ in opposition to that <HI>Ser∣vitude,</HI> which they supposed their <HI>Neighbouring Nations</HI> amongst the <HI>Germans</HI> were in to the <HI>Romans</HI> at that time: And tho' I grant, that these Nations of the <HI>Goths, Van∣dals, Francs</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> from whom most of the Kingdoms in <HI>Europe</HI> are now deri∣ved, might <HI>Vest,</HI> or <HI>intrust</HI> the Lands of the Countreys they had <HI>Conquered,</HI> in him whom they had <HI>made their King,</HI> yet still it was with <HI>this Trust,</HI> that retaining a suf∣ficient part to sustain the <HI>Royal Dignity,</HI> they should <HI>distribute</HI> the <HI>rest</HI> to all their <HI>Officers,</HI> and <HI>Soldiers,</HI> according to each man's <HI>Valour,</HI> or <HI>Merit</HI>; And if they had refu∣sed to have done this, can any Man believe, that so <HI>free a People,</HI> as the Antient Hi∣stories relate them to have been, would ever have suffered it, <HI>without pulling down those Kings they had set up,</HI> which was then very common among them for much slighter occasions? And to go no higher than <HI>William</HI> (whom you call the <HI>Conque∣rour</HI>) can any Man believe, that if he had retained all the Lands of <HI>England</HI> to himself, not only his own <HI>Norman</HI> Lords and Souldiers, but those of other <HI>Forreign</HI> Na∣tions, who assisted him in this <HI>Expedition,</HI> would ever have suffered him to have reigned in quiet over them, if instead of a <HI>Limited King,</HI> he had set himself up for an <HI>absolute Monarch,</HI> and have granted them <HI>no Estates</HI> but at his <HI>Will,</HI> and <HI>Pleasure</HI>: which would have reduced the <HI>Conquerour,</HI> and the <HI>Conquered</HI> to the <HI>same condition</HI>▪ But as for your Example of <HI>Malcolm Canmor,</HI> I cannot believe that the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> were so lately as his Reign possessed of the <HI>whole Hereditary Property</HI> of all the Lands in that Kingdom, so as that no Man had any setled Interest in them before that time, and therefore I must beg your pardon, if I think this Passage in their Historians to be very suspicious, if not false: But I speak this only by the by, and I reserve what I have more to say on this Head, for another time, wherein, I doubt not but to be able to shew you, as evidently as can be done after so many Ages, that <HI>all</HI> the Kingdoms in <HI>Europe</HI> which are descended from the <HI>Gothick</HI> or <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Nations commenced at first from <HI>Compact,</HI> with their <HI>first Kings,</HI> and have thereby an <HI>unalterable Right,</HI> in their Lives, Liberties, and Estates; And if so, have likewise <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> them, if <HI>generally,</HI> and <HI>Vniversally</HI> invaded by their Princes.</P>
<P>But granting for the present, what you have asserted to be true, that all this Pro∣perty, which is now in <HI>Europe,</HI> proceeded <HI>wholly</HI> from the <HI>Grants,</HI> and <HI>Concessions</HI> of <HI>Princes</HI>; yet will it not follow, that by the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> or <HI>Nations,</HI> if any King
<PB N="173" REF="95"/>
should go about generally, or at once to <HI>invade</HI> the Liberties, and Properties of their People, they might not <HI>Lawfully</HI> be <HI>re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isted,</HI> for, as I said before, even a <HI>sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve</HI> when <HI>Manumitted</HI> by his Patron, may <HI>Lawfully d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fend</HI> his Liberty against him, if he goeth about to take it away, and reduce him again into <HI>slavery</HI>; So likewise in the same State of Nature▪ if a <HI>Prince</HI> freely grant his Subjects a <HI>setled</HI> and <HI>Hereditary Property</HI> in their Estates, they have likewise a <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> them, against him, or any other that would endeavour by force to take them away; For he that in this State <HI>grants</HI> any thing to <HI>another,</HI> grants him likewise a <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>Keep</HI> it, whether the Donor will, or not, or else it were indeed <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, For he, that in the <HI>State of Nature</HI> grants another Man any thing to be possessed, or enjoyed only as long as he himself, or his Heirs, shall think fit, doth in effect grant him as good as nothing; since he may alter his mind to morrow and demand it again, and take it away the very next day. So that if you will grant, that Subjects have <HI>such a Right</HI> to their <HI>Estates,</HI> as that the <HI>Prince</HI> cannot without manifest violence, or in∣justice <HI>take them away,</HI> you must likewise grant, that they have also a <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> them.</P>
<P>But I suppose you will not deny <HI>that Right,</HI> that all Men have to their <HI>Civil Properties</HI> in all our <HI>European</HI> Kingdoms,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T.T. G. c.</HI> 19.</NOTE> and Common-Wealths, tho' never so <HI>absolute</HI>: But your <HI>Objection</HI> against the sub∣jects defending it by force, if it be invaded, is, that it may cause <HI>Rebellion,</HI> and <HI>Con∣fusion</HI>; I grant indeed, it may <HI>sometimes</HI> occasion <HI>Civil Wars,</HI> or <HI>Intestine Commotions,</HI> if the <HI>People</HI> finding their Liberties and Properties notoriously invaded, shall op∣pose the <HI>unjust violence</HI> of those who, <HI>contrary to the trust</HI> reposed in them, do thus vio∣lently invade them: therefore, (forsooth) if this Doctrine be allowed, it may prove destructive to the Peace of Kingdoms, and Common Wealths and Consequently to the good, and happiness of Mankind: But methinks you might as well have ar∣gued, that <HI>honest Men</HI> might not resist <HI>Robbers</HI> or <HI>Pirates,</HI> because it may occasion <HI>Disorder,</HI> and <HI>Bloodshed</HI>; If any mischief come in such cases, sure it is not to be char∣ged upon him, who <HI>defends</HI> his own <HI>Right,</HI> but on him that <HI>invades</HI> anothers. If the Innocent honest Man must quit all he hath for quietness sake to him who will lay Violent Hands upon it, I desire it may be considered, what a <HI>kind of Peace</HI> there will be in the World, which would <HI>consist</HI> only in <HI>Violence,</HI> and <HI>Rapi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> and which would be <HI>maintained</HI> only for the <HI>benefit</HI> of <HI>Publick Robbers,</HI> and <HI>Oppressors.</HI></P>

<P>Sir, Tho' your <HI>Definition</HI> be somewhat <HI>lame,</HI> yet I am pretty well content∣ed
<PB N="471" REF="96"/>
with it, only I will shew you by and by wherein it is <HI>deficient</HI>: The <HI>first</HI> and therefore chiefest <HI>Branch,</HI> or Office of Civil Magistrate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to <HI>make Laws</HI> for the <HI>Benefit,</HI> and <HI>Protection</HI> of the <HI>Subjects:</HI> Is it then a Branch of this Power, to send Souldiers, or <HI>Dragoons,</HI> to take away their Liberties, Lives or Estates▪ This sure is directly <HI>contrary</HI> to their <HI>Duty,</HI> and that <HI>Trust</HI> which God hath conferred upon them. Let us go on to the <HI>next Branch:</HI> The <HI>inflection of Punishments</HI> for the transgr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of such Laws; Is this a part of <HI>Civil Government</HI> not only to send their <HI>Souldiers,</HI> and other <HI>Officers</HI> to take away their Subjects <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Estates,</HI> but also to let the most <HI>Capital Offenders</HI> or <HI>Robbers</HI> pass <HI>unpunish'd</HI> when they have done; if you maintain these to be the <HI>Prerogatives</HI> of <HI>Civil Government,</HI> or that to be <HI>Civil Government</HI> where these things are <HI>commonly practised,</HI> you may, even with Mr. <HI>Hobbs</HI> set the great <HI>Levi∣athan</HI> Free from all obligation to his Subjects, any further than he shall think fit for his own interest, and make them always in a <HI>State of Nature,</HI> that is, (as he sup∣poses) of <HI>War</HI> with them, and then pray tell me, whether <HI>such a State,</HI> can be the <HI>Ordinance of God,</HI> or not? But to come to the <HI>last Branch</HI> of your <HI>Definition</HI> (and in which alone I think it <HI>deficient</HI>) the appointing what share of <HI>Property</HI> each per∣son in that Common-Wealth shall enjoy; Tho' I grant it may be the <HI>Prero∣gative</HI> of <HI>Civil Governments</HI> to appoint this at <HI>first,</HI> Yet are they likewise ob∣liged to maintain this <HI>Property</HI> when it is once <HI>Instituted</HI>; and the <HI>People</HI> have as much <HI>Right</HI> to it as any <HI>King</HI> can have to his <HI>Crown, viz.</HI> the <HI>Civil Law</HI> of that Country, or <HI>Consent</HI> of the <HI>whole Nation:</HI> And therefore, if, according to King <HI>Iames</HI> the First his Rule, <HI>a King of a Setled, (or limited) Kingdom will break all the Laws thereof, and Degenerate into a Tyrant</HI>; unless such <HI>Tyrant</HI> be the <HI>Ordinance of God,</HI> he may certainly be so far <HI>Opposed,</HI> for what can Pirates, or <HI>Robbers</HI> do more than his <HI>Officers,</HI> and <HI>Guards</HI> by his <HI>Commission?</HI> The for∣mer can but Murder Men, Ravish their Wives, burn their Houses, and take away their Estates; and if the latter may do so too, pray where is the Diffe∣rence? Or what satisfaction is it to me, that I am Ruined by one Man having the King's Commission, or by another that Ruins me without it? Since I am sure, God hath given the one no more Authority to do it, than the other; if then this <HI>unlimited Power</HI> be neither conferred by <HI>God,</HI> nor <HI>Man</HI> upon the <HI>Civil Magistrates,</HI> I would fain know any Reason, why <HI>Thieves,</HI> and <HI>Pirates</HI> may be <HI>Resisted,</HI> but their Instruments may not, that do the same things; And why, when <HI>Civil Authority</HI> exceeds its <HI>utmost Bounds,</HI> the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> or <HI>Self-defence,</HI> may not take place; Since the <HI>Civil Government</HI> is as much <HI>Dissolved</HI> by such <HI>Violent Actions,</HI> as if a <HI>Forreign</HI> Enemy had broke in, and <HI>Conquered</HI> the Country?</P>
<P>But to Answer your <HI>Query,</HI> whether I think a <HI>Civil Government</HI> may not be, where there is no <HI>Setled Property</HI> in Estates, and whether the <HI>Eastern</HI> Monar∣chies are not <HI>Civil Governments?</HI> To this I answer, that I have <HI>Aristotle</HI> on my Side, who, not without Reason Affirms, that the <HI>Government</HI> of one Man, where there is <HI>no Civil Property,</HI> and where all Men are <HI>Slaves,</HI> is not <HI>Civil Government,</HI> but that of a Master of a Great Family over his <HI>Slaves</HI>: And tho' I grant, that they may have some <HI>shew</HI> of <HI>Civil Government</HI> among them, as in a <HI>Plantation,</HI> where one of the Slaves may complain to the Master against another for any Injury or Wrong done him, yet is not this Property Civil Government any more than that of the Master of a Separate Family who looks upon himself as Absolute Lord over all his Slaves, and they allowed him by God, only for his Benefit, and Grandeur, and not he instituted, (as all Civil Powers are) for the Good, and Preservation of the Subjects.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already given you my Sense of that Place, and I shall speak more particularly to it, when you shall come to those Texts of <HI>Scripture,</HI> that you said you would produce for <HI>Absolute Subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction,</HI> and <HI>Non-Resistance</HI>: And therefore at present: I shall only here shew you what the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> in the above mentioned Survey of the <HI>Leviathan, cap.</HI> 19. hath very prudently as well as honestly said concerning this Text:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>pag.</HI> 74.77.</NOTE>
<Q>They who will deduce the extent of the absolute and illimited Power of Kings, from that Declaration by <HI>Samuel,</HI> which indeed, seems to leave neither Property nor Liberty to their Subjects, and could be only intended by <HI>Samuel</HI> to terrifie them from that Mutinous, and Seditious Clamor; as it hath no Foundation from any other part of Scripture, nor was ever practi∣sed, or exercised by any Good King, who succeeded over them, and was blessed, and approved by God. So when those <HI>State Empiricks</HI> (of what de∣gree, or Quality soever) will take upon them to prescribe a new Dyet, and Exercise to Soveraign Princes, and invite them to assume new Powers, and Prerogatives over the People, by the Precepts, Warrants, and Prescriptions of the Scriptures: they should not presume to make the Sacred Writ Subject to their own private Fancies.</Q>
So likewise in a Leaf or two before, he speaks much to the same Purpose.
<Q>That what <HI>Samuel</HI> had said was rather to terrifie them, from pursuing their foolish Demands, than to Constitute such a Prerogative as the Kings should use,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>pag.</HI> 74.</NOTE> whom God would ap∣point to go in and out before them; which methinks is very ma∣nifest, in that the worst Kings that ever reigned over them, never challen∣ged, or assumed those Prerogatives Nor did the People conceive themselves liable to those impositions; as appears by the application they made to <HI>Reho∣boam</HI> upon the Death of <HI>Solomon,</HI> that he would abate some of that Rigor his Father had exercised towards them, the rough Rejection o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which request, contrary to the Advice of his Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est Counsellours, cost him the greater part of his Dominions: And when <HI>Rehoboam</HI> would by Arms have reduc'd them to Obedience, God would not suffer him, because he had been in the fault himself.</Q>

that you may not mistake me, and suppose that <HI>I</HI> would go about to <HI>allow Subjects</HI> to <HI>Resist,</HI> and <HI>take up Arms</HI> against the Supream Power upon any less Occasion than an <HI>Absolu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Necessity,</HI> and apparent Danger of being <HI>Destroyed,</HI> and Ruined in their Lives, Liberties, and Estates; first therefore, considering that the Corruption of Humane Nature is such, that <HI>no sort</HI> of Government whatsoever can continue <HI>long,</HI> without <HI>some Inconveniences,</HI> and Mischiefs, to <HI>particular Men,</HI> not that any Man either <HI>Prince,</HI> or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubject</HI> was ever Master of such <HI>perfect Wisdom,</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> as always to peform his Duty so exactly, as never to Offend; I do in the <HI>first place,</HI> grant, that it would be both <HI>Un∣dut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful</HI>▪ as well as <HI>Unjust</HI> for Subjects to <HI>Rebell</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ainst their Prince for his <HI>Per∣sonal Failings,</HI> or Vices; <HI>Undutiful,</HI> Since the Prince may be often times an <HI>ill Man</HI> in his <HI>private Capacity,</HI> and yet a <HI>good Governour,</HI> in respect of the <HI>Pub∣lick</HI>; and also <HI>Unjust,</HI> since neither do we our selves exactly perform our Duties toward the Supream Powers (or to one another) as we ought: And therefore it is highly reasonable for <HI>Subjects</HI> to endure▪ and pass by the <HI>personal Faults</HI> or <HI>Failings</HI> of Princes, in consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eration of that <HI>Protection,</HI> and Security, in their Lives, and Fortunes, which they do enjoy under them▪ since it hath been found by experience with how great a Slaughter of People, and how great a confusion, and danger of the whole Common-Wealth, <HI>Evil Princes</HI> have been <HI>resisted,</HI> or <HI>turn'd out of their Thrones</HI>: And therefore I grant the <HI>Private Injuries</HI> of Princes are to be past over, in consideration of that <HI>great Charge</HI> they undergo, and for those <HI>greater Benefits</HI> we receive from their Go∣vernment, but chiefly for the <HI>publick Peace</HI> of the Common Wealth, or Ci∣vil Society; And therefore I own it is very well said by that Master in Politicks, <HI>Tacitus, That the ill Humours or Dispositions of Kings, are to be born withal, and that often Mutations of Governments are of dangerous Consequence.</HI> And he wisely introduces <HI>Ceriales</HI> speaking to this purpose to the Rebellious <HI>Treveri: That they ought to bear with the Luxury and Avarice of Rulers, as they do with immoderate showers, and other unnatural Evils, since there will be Vices whilst there are Men, yet neither are these continual, but are often recompensed by the Intervention of bet∣ter.</HI></P>
<P>But I will now particularize those Cases wherein I do absolutely disallow, and disclaim <HI>all Resistance</HI> in Subjects against the <HI>Supream Powers.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. I <HI>deny all Resistance</HI> to Subjects against their Princes, or Supream Magi∣strates, in all such Actions, or Prerogatives which are <HI>absolutely necessary</HI> to the Exercise of their <HI>Supream Power, viz.</HI> of Protecting and Defending their Peo∣ple, as also against those who are <HI>Commission'd</HI> by them for the <HI>Execution</HI> of such Powers.</P>
<P N="2">2. I <HI>Condemn all Rebellion</HI> against Princes, or States, meerly on the <HI>Score of Religion,</HI> or because they are not of the Religion of their People, or Subjects, if there be <HI>no positive Law</HI> Extant, Disabling or Forbidding Princes, or other Magistrates of different Religions than that of their People, from being admit∣ted to the Throne, or Government.</P>
<P N="3">3. I look upon it as Rebellion in the People, <HI>Tumultuously to rise up in Arms</HI> to alter, or reform the Religion of the Nation, or Kingdom already established by Law, without the <HI>Consent</HI> of the <HI>Legislators.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. I <HI>Disclaim all Resistance,</HI> or Self-defence in Subjects, upon the account that the free, or publick Exercise of that Religion they profess, is not al∣lowed them by the <HI>Legislative Power</HI> of the Kingdom, or Nation, provided
<PB N="177" REF="97"/>
that such Supream Powers do not forbid, or hinder the People professing such a different Religion, to Sell, or Transport their Estates, and Persons into any other Country where they please.</P>
<P N="5">5. I <HI>Deny Resistance</HI> to Subjects against their Princes or Governours upon <HI>Pretence</HI> of any <HI>Personal Vices,</HI> as because they are wicked, Atheisti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al, Cruel, Lustful, or Debauched, provided they generally Protect their Subjects in their Lives, Liberties, and Properties.</P>
<P N="6">6. I <HI>Deny this Right of Resistance</HI> to any particular person less than the <HI>wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Body,</HI> or <HI>Major part</HI> of the People, or at least such a <HI>considerable Portion</HI> of a Nation, as are able, when Assaulted, or Oppressed in their Lives, Liberties, or Estates to constitute a distinct, and entire Kingdom, or Common-Wealth of themselves.</P>
<P N="7">7. I <HI>look upon it as Wicked, and Rebellious</HI> for any private Subjects to Assassinate, Murder or Imprison their Monarch, or other Supream Governour, since no private Person whatever ought to lay Violent Hands upon his <HI>Prince,</HI> whose person ought to be <HI>Sacred,</HI> and in no wise to be <HI>Violated,</HI> unless he put off the <HI>Character</HI> of a <HI>Prince,</HI> and <HI>Actually</HI> make War upon his People. But if in <HI>this Case,</HI> he happen to be <HI>Resisted,</HI> and Perish in the Attempt, he <HI>falls not</HI> as a <HI>Prince,</HI> but as a <HI>Common Enemy,</HI> by breaking the <HI>Original Compact</HI> with his Peo∣ple; and entring into a <HI>State of War</HI> against them: As a Father who unjustly makes War upon his Children, may be, (as I have already proved at our first conference) Resisted by them in the State of Nature.</P>
<P>But as for all <HI>other Grievances,</HI> or Oppressions, if they are of that <HI>Nature</HI> as may Ruine the <HI>whole Common-Wealth,</HI> yet not suddenly, but after some time, and often Repeated, I cannot allow <HI>such Grievances,</HI> or Oppressions, as a <HI>Sufficient Cause</HI> of <HI>Resistance</HI>; For as on the one hand, there is no Incon∣venience so small, but in process of time it may turn to the Ruine of the Com∣mon-Wealth, if it be often Repeated, and excessively Multiplie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; so on the other side, length of time produces so great Changes, that the Nature of these Encroachments, or Injuries are not sufficient to justifie <HI>Resistance,</HI> and the Breach of that Peace and Unity in a Common Wealth, which must necessarily follow by entering into a <HI>State of War.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, I do not in any Case whatever allow of <HI>Resistance</HI>; but only in these <HI>three necessary</HI> ones: When the Lives, Liberties, or Estates of the <HI>whole People,</HI> of the <HI>greatest part</HI> of them, are either <HI>actually Invaded,</HI> or else <HI>taken away,</HI> and when they are <HI>Reduced</HI> into so bad a Condition, that a <HI>State of War</HI> is to be <HI>preferred</HI> before such a <HI>Peace</HI>; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d when the <HI>End</HI> of <HI>Civil Go∣vernment</HI> being no longer to be <HI>obtained</HI> by it, the <HI>Common-Wealth</HI> may be look't upon as <HI>Dissolved.</HI></P>

<P>Tho' you have been pretty long in treating of this Matter, yet I did not think it Tedious, since I confess you have given me honestly enough, (and so far I agree with you) all those Cases wherein you say it is <HI>U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>law∣ful</HI> for Subjects to <HI>take up Arms,</HI> or <HI>Resist</HI> the Supream Powers: But I wonder you have not added one Case more, which Diverse Authors, that are high enough against <HI>Non-Resistance,</HI> in other things, do yet allow to be a <HI>sufficie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Cause of <HI>taking up Arms,</HI> and <HI>Resisting</HI> their Prince; And that is, when he <HI>Actually</HI> hath, or goeth about to <HI>Alie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate,</HI> or make over his Dominion and Subjects to some <HI>Forreign</HI> Prince, or State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not ignorant of what you say, but I thought it not worth speak∣ing
<PB N="178" REF="98"/>
ot, because in <HI>absolute Monarchies,</HI> (which we are now treating of;) if such Kingdoms are <HI>Patrimonial,</HI> and that the Monarch hath <HI>such</HI> an <HI>absolute Dominion</HI> over his Subjects, as neither to let them enjoy any Liberty in their Persons, nor Properties in their Estates, but at his Pleasure; I cannot see any reason, why <HI>such a Prince</HI> may not <HI>alienate</HI> his <HI>Dominion,</HI> over such a Kingdom, and People, as well as any <HI>private-Man,</HI> may his <HI>Property</HI> in his Estate: Nor have the People any Cause to be concerned at it, since they can then likewise be but <HI>Slaves,</HI> and enjoy nothing but at their Princes Pleasure, as they did before; so that whether He, or a Stranger govern them▪ it is all one as to their Circumstances; But yet under such <HI>Governments,</HI> as are <HI>absolute,</HI> where the <HI>People</HI> enjoy their <HI>personal Lib rites,</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> in their <HI>Estates,</HI> the Case may be much otherwise; since they may not be sure, that the <HI>Foreign</HI> Prince, to whom their own Monarch, or other Supream Powers hath assigned them, will <HI>maintain</HI> their Liberties, and Properties as the former did: And therefore not being Slaves before, they cannot be <HI>Alienated</HI> without their <HI>own Consents,</HI> and consequently they may <HI>take up Arms,</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> themselves if they are able; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Prince, or State to whom they are so <HI>Alienated</HI> will give them the <HI>like assurance</HI> to preserve their Lives, Liberties, and Properties, as their former Governours did; and therefore I do conceive, the People of the Islands of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and <HI>Candy,</HI> might very well have <HI>refused</HI> to become Sub∣jects to the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> in case the <HI>Venetians</HI> should have <HI>Sold,</HI> or <HI>Alien'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> their Dominion over them, before he had <HI>actually conquer'd</HI> them. But in <HI>Li∣mited,</HI> or <HI>Hereditary Kingdoms,</HI> which are so by their <HI>fundamental Constitution,</HI> I suppose, the Prince cannot upon <HI>any account whatsoever,</HI> make over his Do∣minions, to a <HI>Foreign</HI> Prince without the <HI>consent</HI> of his <HI>People,</HI> and next Heir: And therefore, (granting the Story to be true;) I doubt not but the People of this Kingdom might very well have <HI>opposed</HI> King <HI>Iohn,</HI> if he had gone about to have subjected it, to the Dominion of the Emperour of <HI>Morocco,</HI> up∣on Condition that he would <HI>Assist</HI> him with an Army of <HI>Moors</HI> to subdue h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Barons,</HI> and <HI>Nobility</HI> then in Arms against him.</P>

<P>I confess it is not worth while to dispute about that which so seldom happens, and is indeed almost impossible to be put in practice, and therefore I shall not much oppose you in what you have said upon this Case; yet, that I may be as good as my word, and give you my Judgment concerning what you have lately said, I must freely tell you, that as it may happen, that a <HI>Prince,</HI> or <HI>State</HI> may sometimes <HI>abuse</HI> their <HI>Power,</HI> so as to <HI>take away</HI> the Li∣berties, and Estates of <HI>all</HI> their <HI>Subjects,</HI> as you have set forth, (and which I confess is a very great mischief) yet upon second thoughts, I think it were much better that <HI>this Inconvenience</HI> should be suffered, rather than the <HI>work mischief</HI> of leaving <HI>Subjects</HI> to be the <HI>sole Iudges,</HI> when their Liberties, and E∣states are <HI>invaded,</HI> or like to be taken away; nay, every <HI>private Subject</HI> would be first <HI>Iudge</HI> of it, or else the <HI>whole People</HI> could never come to pass their <HI>Iudgment</HI> upon it, which would leave too great a <HI>latitude</HI> for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urbulent,</HI> and <HI>Rebellious</HI> Spirits to make <HI>disturbances</HI> in Kingdoms, and Commonwealths: especially if there be any <HI>small Grievances,</HI> on the Subjects, especially too, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they touch at those things they account their <HI>Hereditary Liberties,</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI>: these, (tho' never so small) if the <HI>People</HI> are suffered to be their <HI>own Iudges</HI> (as you make them to be in their own Case) will soon be aggravated, and blown up to <HI>intolerable</HI> Oppressions of, and <HI>Invasions</HI> upon their Liberties and
<PB N="179" REF="98"/>
Properties, when indeed they are not: This is a pernitious Doctrine, for it will be a perpetual Cause of Quarrels, Civil Wars, and Rebellions, which would turn <HI>all Commonwealths,</HI> tho never so <HI>well Constituted,</HI> into <HI>Anarchy,</HI> and Confusion. So that as you have stated this Question, you have broach∣ed a <HI>Principle</HI> highly <HI>destructive</HI> to all <HI>Civil Government</HI>; for if <HI>All,</HI> or <HI>Any</HI> of the People, may <HI>Resist,</HI> or <HI>Rebel,</HI> (call it what you please) when∣ever they think themselves <HI>oppressed</HI> in their Liberties and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L. O.</HI></NOTE> this is for them only to be <HI>obedient,</HI> when they think themselves <HI>well governed</HI>; but <HI>stubborn,</HI> and <HI>Rebellious</HI> when they believe they are <HI>not,</HI> which would be to make <HI>all</HI> Government <HI>Precarious</HI> and <HI>Condi∣tional,</HI> and the <HI>People</HI> not only <HI>Parties</HI> but <HI>Iudges,</HI> and <HI>Executioners</HI> too in their own Case; how far <HI>these Conditions</HI> are observed on the <HI>Governours</HI> part, and then the <HI>Regularity,</HI> or <HI>Irregularity</HI> of the <HI>Administration</HI> will no longer be the <HI>Question,</HI> but the <HI>Validity</HI> of the Power to <HI>Command</HI>▪ And there wants no more to <HI>dissolve</HI> such a Government, than for <HI>Dick,</HI> or <HI>Tom,</HI> and every <HI>Rascal</HI> of the <HI>Mobile</HI> to say, This or That, is <HI>destructive</HI> to the Peoples Liber∣ties, and Properties, and therefore an <HI>insupportable grievance,</HI> and oppression. And if you will once allow <HI>any number</HI> of the People, tho' never so many, to <HI>Iudge</HI> This, or That <HI>Law,</HI> or <HI>Order</HI> of the Government, not to be for their <HI>Good,</HI> and that they may likewise <HI>Resist,</HI> and <HI>Right</HI> themselves by <HI>Arms,</HI> when ever they thus fancy, they will quickly come to say, that the Government it self is not for their good neither; and upon this ground all the <HI>Rebellions</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sed by an Incensed, and mistaken Multitude against the Government in all Ages, may easily be justified, and <HI>Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ Tyler,</HI> and <HI>Mass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llo</HI> shall be so far from being <HI>Rebels,</HI> that they may pass in future Ages for <HI>Heroes,</HI> and <HI>Noble Assertors</HI> of the Peoples Liberties; and I hope you will believe, I do not speak this out of <HI>any</HI> liking, or <HI>Approbation</HI> of <HI>Tyranny,</HI> or that I desire, that <HI>Princes</HI> should stretch their Power to the utmost, to <HI>Invade</HI> their Subjects Liberties, or Estates; but only to let you see, how far your <HI>Principles</HI> may serve the <HI>Pretences</HI> of wicked Men to set <HI>whole Kingdoms</HI> together by the Ears, whenever they find the <HI>People</HI> so far <HI>discontented</HI> with the Government, as to believe their Malicious and wicked Insinuations; of all which those long, and cruel, <HI>Civil Wars,</HI> and <HI>Rebellions</HI> which for several Years tormented, and almost ru∣ined these <HI>three Kingdoms,</HI> are too late, and sad Examples.</P>

<P>I confess Sir, you have made a very <HI>Pathetick</HI> speech, and exerted, I suppose the utmost Strength of your reason and Eloquence on this Subject, for you have made the <HI>Consequences</HI> of this Principle, <HI>viz.</HI> (<HI>That the People may judge when their Liberties, and Properties are invaded</HI>) to seem very <HI>dreadful,</HI> but after all, it is no more than what you have urged in great part already, and the <HI>main Strength</HI> of your Argument lyes here, that if the <HI>People</HI> should take upon them but once to <HI>judge,</HI> when they were <HI>notoriously injured,</HI> or <HI>op∣press't,</HI> and thereupon <HI>take Arms,</HI> to <HI>right</HI> themselves; they would soon make bold to put this Power into use and Practice, when they had <HI>no occasi∣on</HI> for it at all, or at least <HI>not sufficient</HI> to make any open <HI>Insult.</HI> But to shew you, that there is <HI>no need,</HI> of such an <HI>infallible Iudge,</HI> as you suppose, to be <HI>necessary</HI> in a <HI>Commonwealth</HI> any more than there is in the <HI>Church</HI>; pray, tell me, Sir, would it not have been very convenient, if <HI>Christ</HI> had appointed, an <HI>Infallible Iudge,</HI> (be it the <HI>Pope,</HI> or <HI>General Counsel,</HI> or both together, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to decide all <HI>Controversies</HI> in Religion, and to whose Judgment <HI>all People</HI> ought to submit?</P>

<P>I cannot deny, but it would have been a very <HI>ready way</HI> to end all <HI>Disputes</HI> about <HI>Religion,</HI> but since <HI>God</HI> hath not thought fit to appoint any such <HI>Iudge,</HI> it were very <HI>great Presumption</HI> in us to set up one to please our humour, since such a one could have <HI>no Infallibility,</HI> unless it were given him from <HI>above.</HI></P>

<P>You Judge very well; and doth it not therefore follow, that since there is <HI>no such</HI> infallible Judge, all Men ought to <HI>Iudge</HI> for themselves of the <HI>Truth</HI> of their <HI>Religion,</HI> and also in the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> what <HI>Doctrines</HI> are agreeable to the <HI>Word of God,</HI> and what not, and yet you see that from the ill use of this Liberty have sprung all the <HI>Different Sects,</HI> and <HI>Heresies</HI> in the World? Does it therefore follow, that <HI>Men</HI> must not <HI>make use</HI> of this <HI>Liber∣ty,</HI> because they may <HI>abuse</HI> it? So likewise, must Subjects judge in <HI>no Case</HI> what∣soever, when the Supream Power <HI>Tyrannizes</HI> over them, beyond what they are able to bear? and must they <HI>never resist,</HI> or endeavour to cast off this <HI>in∣supportable Yoak,</HI> because they may happen one time or other to be <HI>wanton,</HI> and believe themselves <HI>oppress't</HI> when indeed they are not?</P>

<P>I grant your <HI>Parallel</HI> would have some what in it, were the <HI>Conse∣quences</HI> of every Mans judging for himself in Matters of <HI>Religion,</HI> as <HI>fatal</HI> to the Peace, and Happiness of <HI>Mankind,</HI> as your <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Subjects judging,</HI> when it is fit for them to <HI>resist</HI> the Supream Powers; for I do not at all de∣bar them from the <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Iudging,</HI> when they are <HI>oppress't,</HI> or ill used by them, for that may very well consist with the <HI>Publick Peace,</HI> but I utterly dis∣allow all manner of <HI>Resistance by Force,</HI> because it tends, not only to <HI>dissolve</HI> all <HI>Civil Government,</HI> but to <HI>disturb</HI> the <HI>Common Peace,</HI> and safety of Man∣kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding your <HI>Distinction,</HI> the <HI>Parallel</HI> with hold in both Cases, for are not <HI>differences</HI> in <HI>Religion</HI> as <HI>fatal</HI> to the <HI>Peace,</HI> and Unity of the <HI>Church,</HI> as the <HI>Subjects judging,</HI> when they are <HI>oppress't,</HI> and thereupon taking up <HI>de∣fensive Arms,</HI> can be to that of a <HI>Civil State</HI>? And do not <HI>more Wars,</HI> and <HI>Quarrels</HI> arise about Mens <HI>differences</HI> in <HI>Religion,</HI> than from <HI>any other</HI> Cause you can Name? So that if the <HI>Peace</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> were a <HI>sufficient</HI> Cause for supposing a certain, or <HI>Infallible Iudge</HI> in <HI>Religion,</HI> there would be the same Reason to suppose it in <HI>Civil Matters</HI> too. And therefore your Argument, from the <HI>abuse</HI> of this <HI>Liberty</HI> of the <HI>Subjects judging,</HI> when they may <HI>resist,</HI> is of no more force in one Case, than the other; for I grant it may so hap∣pen in a <HI>Civil State,</HI> as well as in an <HI>Ecclesiastical,</HI> that the <HI>Subjects</HI> may <HI>rise up,</HI> and <HI>resist</HI> their <HI>Civil,</HI> as well as <HI>Spiritual</HI> Governours, without any just Cause: doth it therefore follow, that God hath <HI>wholly</HI> delivered up Mankind to the <HI>domineering</HI> humours of <HI>Men in Power,</HI> let them <HI>abuse</HI> it never so grosly? And therefore we must not be wiser than <HI>God Almighty</HI> himself, and when he hath not appointed any certain, and <HI>Infallible Iudges</HI> either in <HI>Civil</HI> or <HI>Spi∣ritual</HI> matters without any Contradiction, or Resistance, we ought not to suppose a necessity of such Judges, meerly because of <HI>some Inconveniences,</HI> which may perhaps often happen from the <HI>abuse</HI> of that <HI>Christian Liberty</HI> he hath given us. For then I doubt you will find the Remedy would be much worse than the Disease, as if to avoid <HI>Heresies,</HI> we should set up the <HI>Pope</HI> for an <HI>Infallible Iudge.</HI> So would it be likewise if to avoid <HI>Civil Wars,</HI> and <HI>Rebel∣lions</HI>

we should set up the <HI>Supream Magistrate</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Hobbs</HI> hath done) for a certain, and <HI>Irresistible Iudge</HI> of whatsoever Means are necessary for the <HI>Peo∣ple's</HI> Quiet and Preservation, since I have already proved, that an <HI>Insupportable Tyranny</HI> is not <HI>Civil Government,</HI> and that the Supream Powers can no more <HI>alter</HI> the Nature of things, but their <HI>own Laws,</HI> or <HI>Edicts,</HI> than they can or∣dain Poyson to be used, in stead of wholesom Food, by the Peo∣ple.</P>

<P>I confess what you have now said, carries some weight with it, and my own Carnal Reason doth very much incline me to your Opinion, were it not for <HI>two things,</HI> the one (as I said) is the <HI>Horrid Rebellions,</HI> that have, and may again arise in these Kingdoms from this Principle; which hath made God so strictly forbid, <HI>all Resistance of the Higher Powers,</HI> upon any account what∣soever; And therefore you are much mistaken, when you assert, that <HI>Resistance,</HI> tho' for <HI>Self defence,</HI> is one of the <HI>Liberties,</HI> that God hath left us; since cer∣tainly he would never so severely have forbidden it, but that he not only knew how <HI>prone</HI> Men's Corrupt Natures were to <HI>Rebellion,</HI> but also foresaw the <HI>fatal Consequence</HI> of it.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If God's Commands in <HI>Scripture</HI> be the greatest Argument, you have against <HI>all Resistance</HI> whatever, I doubt not but to shew you, (when We come to it,) that you as well as others are mistaken in that <HI>Strict Interpretation</HI> of those places of <HI>Scripture</HI>; and as for the <HI>Evil Consequences</HI> you suppose may fol∣low from this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> I doubt not likewise but to convince you, that much <HI>worse</HI> will follow from the <HI>Irresistible Tyranny</HI> of the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> than ever have happen'd from the <HI>Dreadfullest Rebellions.</HI> And therefore I desire you to take Notice, that what I have now said, is not out of any design to <HI>Iustifie</HI> so Horrid a Crime, as I grant <HI>Rebellion</HI> to be, or to <HI>incite</HI> Subjects to be Guilty of it; but only to hinder <HI>Civil Government</HI> from being destroyed, and <HI>Man∣kind</HI> from being made <HI>Miserable.</HI></P>
<P>For I have first Asserted, that <HI>no Resistance</HI> whatever is to be made in <HI>Abso∣lute Governments</HI>; but in those Cases in which the <HI>main Ends</HI> of Civil Govern∣ment are <HI>Visibly</HI> destroyed, or so near it, that there is <HI>no other</HI> means left but <HI>Resistance</HI> to prevent it.

<P>And as for the ill use that may be made of this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> to stir up the <HI>Peo∣ple</HI> to <HI>Rebellion,</HI> when they have no just, or sufficient Provocation to Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st.

<P><PB N="182" REF="100"/>But since you have already acknowledged, that the <HI>People</HI> might <HI>Iudge</HI> (if such a Case should happen) whether the <HI>Prince,</HI> or other <HI>Supream Magistrate</HI> makes <HI>Actual War</HI> upon them, I would very fain know, why the <HI>People</HI> can∣not as plainly distinguish when he sends his <HI>Guards,</HI> or <HI>Dragoons</HI> to take away their Lives and Liberties, or to turn them out of their Estates: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this be done, and the <HI>Tyranny</HI> so evident, and general, and insupportable, that it is past all question I grant that the <HI>People</HI> ought to have <HI>Patience,</HI> and rather suffer <HI>many Oppressions,</HI> and Hardships, than put themselves into a <HI>State of War.</HI> So that I think it is <HI>Morally impossible,</HI> that the People can be <HI>mistaken</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> evi∣dent a Case: Nor I believe can you scarce shew me one Example, either out of <HI>Antient</HI> or <HI>Modern</HI> History, of any <HI>whole Nation,</HI> or <HI>People,</HI> or the <HI>Major part</HI> of them, that did ever rise in Arms to cast off either a <HI>Foreign,</HI> or Do∣mestick Yoke, which pressed too hard upon them; but when they had the most unavoidable, and justest causes so to do. And I believe I can shew you <HI>Ten</HI> Examples out of Histories, (if the Question were to be decided by them) for <HI>one</HI> you can shew me to the Contrary. 'Tis true, some <HI>private Men</HI> may sometimes make Disturbances, or <HI>Rebellions</HI>; but it is commonly to their own <HI>Iust Ruine,</HI> and <HI>Perdition</HI>; for, till the <HI>Mischief</HI> be grown <HI>General,</HI> and the <HI>Violence</HI> of the Rulers become <HI>Evident,</HI> and their Attempts to <HI>Destroy,</HI> or make <HI>Slaves</HI> of them, are most sensible to all, or the greatest part of the People; they are <HI>commonly</HI> more a great deal disposed to <HI>Suffer,</HI> than to <HI>Right</HI> themselves by <HI>Resistance,</HI> well knowing the <HI>Mischiefs</HI> of <HI>War,</HI> and how Destructive it will prove, not only to their <HI>Lives,</HI> but to the Welfare of their <HI>Families</HI> and <HI>Posterities,</HI> as well as <HI>Private Concerns.</HI> So that the Example of some <HI>particu∣lar Injustice,</HI> Oppression, nay, or <HI>Absolute Ruine</HI> of here and there an <HI>Unfor∣tunate</HI> person, moves them not. But if once they find their Lives, Liberties, and Estates <HI>Universally</HI> Assaulted, and about to be taken away, who is to be blamed for it: The <HI>Magistrate,</HI> or the <HI>People</HI>? for the former might have <HI>avoided</HI> it if they had pleased, either by <HI>not urging</HI> them to that <HI>Extremity</HI> at all, or at least <HI>Redressing</HI> those <HI>Grievances,</HI> and Oppressions before they be∣came so <HI>General,</HI> and <HI>Insupportable,</HI> as not to be any longer endured.</P>
<P>So that, tho' I grant, the <HI>Ambition,</HI> or Turbulency of <HI>private Men</HI> have <HI>sometimes</HI> caused great Disorders in <HI>Common-Wealths,</HI> and Factions have been fa∣tal to States, and Kingdoms, Yet whether <HI>this Mischief</HI> hath oftner begun from the <HI>People's Wantonness</HI>; and desire to cast off the <HI>Lawful Authority</HI> of their Rulers, or from the <HI>Rulers Insolence,</HI> and Endeavours to get, and Exercise a <HI>Tyrannical Arbitrary Power</HI> over their <HI>People,</HI> that is, whether <HI>Oppression,</HI> or <HI>Disobedience</HI> gave the <HI>first Rise</HI> to the Disorder, I leave it (as I said) to <HI>Impar∣tial History,</HI> to Determine.</P>
<P>But this I am sure of, whoever (either <HI>Ruler,</HI> or <HI>Subject</HI>) goes about by force to <HI>Invade</HI> the Rights of either <HI>Prince,</HI> or <HI>People,</HI> and lays a <HI>Foundation</HI> for <HI>over∣turning</HI> the <HI>Original Constitution,</HI> and Frame of any <HI>Civil Government,</HI> he is Guilty of the <HI>greatest Crime,</HI> I think a Man is capable of, being to <HI>Answer for</HI> all those Mischiefs, Bloudshed, Rapine, and Desolations which the <HI>breaking to pieces</HI> of Governments does bring on a Country▪ And he who doth it is justly to be esteemed a <HI>Common Enemy,</HI> and is to be <HI>treated</HI> accordingly.</P>
<P>But as for the Instances you give of <HI>Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tyler,</HI> and <HI>Massianello,</HI> I grant indeed it may so happen, that a Great part of the <HI>Common People,</HI> or <HI>Rabble</HI> may

<HI>sometimes</HI> upon sudden, or false Apprehensions, occasioned by some <HI>Real Grievances</HI> or <HI>Oppressions,</HI> such as are <HI>great Taxes,</HI> or <HI>Gabels</HI> imposed by the <HI>State, take up Arms,</HI> and <HI>Rebell</HI> against the <HI>Supream Powers</HI>; Yet these Ex∣amples do not reach the Question in Hand, these <HI>Insurections,</HI> or <HI>Rebellions</HI> you mention being of a <HI>much less</HI> number, than the <HI>whole People,</HI> or the <HI>Major part</HI> of them, and in which I still include the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry,</HI> and other <HI>Land-holders,</HI> as the most <HI>considerable part.</HI> And so those <HI>Insurrections</HI> were in no wise <HI>Iustifiable,</HI> especially in such a Government as <HI>ours,</HI> where no Man can be <HI>Taxed</HI> but by his <HI>own Consent</HI> included in his <HI>Representatives,</HI> whereas all these <HI>Rebellions</HI> were chiefly (if not altogether) made by the <HI>meaner sort,</HI> or Scum of the <HI>People,</HI> of one, or a few Countries, whom I can never allow to make Disturbances, since they, having <HI>very little</HI> to lose, ought in all <HI>Ci∣vil Governments</HI> whatsoever, to be <HI>directed</HI> and <HI>Governed</HI> by those, in whom the <HI>Ballance</HI> of the <HI>Government</HI> in Lands, and other Riches doth reside and on whom they chiefly depend for their <HI>Protection</HI> and Subsistance, and consequent∣ly ought to make <HI>no Alterations</HI> in the State without their <HI>consent,</HI> and <HI>Appro∣bation.</HI></P>
<P>But as for your other Instance of the <HI>Wars</HI> raised in these <HI>Three Kingdoms,</HI> against King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, upon the Pretence of our <HI>Religion, Liberties,</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> being <HI>Invaded,</HI> it is not proper to be Treated of in this place: Since we are now Discoursing of the <HI>Power</HI> of Princes, and the <HI>Right</HI> of Sub∣jects under <HI>Absolute,</HI> and <HI>not limited</HI> Monarchies; And I grant that <HI>some Re∣sistance</HI> may be <HI>Rebellion,</HI> under <HI>Absolute</HI> Monarchies which would <HI>not</HI> be so under <HI>limited</HI> ones: Yet I do still suppose that it may be <HI>Lawful</HI> under such <HI>li∣mited</HI> Monarchy for the People <HI>to take up Arms,</HI> and make <HI>Resistance</HI> in defence of those <HI>Iust</HI> Liberties, and Priviledges which they <HI>Lawfully</HI> enjoy either by the <HI>Original Constitution</HI> of the <HI>Government,</HI> or by <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Grace,</HI> or Conces∣sion of the <HI>Prince</HI>; but this requires a more large, and accurate Discourse which at another time, I am ready to give you. Therefore granting at pre∣sent, that those <HI>Wars were down Right Rebellion</HI> against the King, and also that they were made under <HI>Pretence</HI> of the <HI>Principle</HI> I now assert, yet doth it not at all <HI>overthrow</HI> the <HI>Iustice</HI> of that Cause, which I now maintain; since (as I have already more than once intimated) the <HI>abuse</HI> that may be <HI>sometimes</HI> made of a <HI>Natural Right,</HI> by some Wicked, Factious, or Hypocritical Men ought not in the least to <HI>preju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice</HI> the <HI>Exercise</HI> of that <HI>Right</HI> to all the <HI>rest</HI> of Man∣kind; who may lye under a <HI>Real Necessity</HI> of making use of it.</P>
<P>To conclude, if the People may <HI>nev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> be trusted to <HI>Iudge</HI> when their <HI>Li∣berties</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> are <HI>actually Invaded,</HI> because they may happen <HI>one time or other</HI> to be <HI>mistaken,</HI> and so enter into a <HI>State of War</HI> without cause to the <HI>Destruction</HI> of Mankind, this Argument would serve as well against <HI>all Princes,</HI> and <HI>Common-Wealths,</HI> who, being in the <HI>State of Nature</HI> with each other, should <HI>never</HI> make War for any Cause or <HI>Provocation,</HI> how <HI>great</HI> soever, because being <HI>Iudges</HI> and <HI>Executioners</HI> too in their own Case, they may more easily happen to be mistaken, I suppose you your self will grant, that <HI>one,</HI> or a <HI>few Men</HI> are more apt to be in an <HI>Error,</HI> than 100000, and I have already proved, that where the <HI>People</HI> have <HI>never wholly</HI> given up their Liberties, and Properties unto the <HI>Absolute Will</HI> of the Supream Powers, they are as to <HI>that</HI> still in a <HI>State of Nature,</HI> and do <HI>reserve</HI> to themselves a <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Iudging</HI> when they are Violently and Insupportably invaded and Consequently of <HI>vindicating</HI> themselves from
<PB N="184" REF="101"/>
that Oppression. And therefore granting what you have said to be true, that the <HI>People</HI> may <HI>sometimes</HI> happen to <HI>abuse</HI> this <HI>Natural Right</HI> of <HI>Iudging,</HI> and <HI>re∣sisting</HI> by exerting it, when there is <HI>no real</HI> and <HI>absolute</HI> necessity: so on the other side, if they are <HI>wholy</HI> debarred from it, because they may happen <HI>some∣times</HI> to <HI>abuse</HI> it, the <HI>Freest People</HI> in the World, <HI>viz.</HI> (our selves for Example) may easily be <HI>reduced</HI> into a Condition of <HI>absolute Slavery</HI> and Beggery, and that without all Remedy, by any <HI>Humane means</HI> that I can think of, and which is the <HI>worst mischief</HI> of these two, I leave to your self, or any indifferent Man to <HI>Iudge.</HI></P>

<P>If you will have my <HI>Opinion</HI> in this point<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I must freely tell you, that it is a hard matter to find out a <HI>mischief</HI> so <HI>destructive</HI> to the <HI>People,</HI> and which they should <HI>exchange</HI> for this <HI>miserable State</HI> of <HI>War,</HI> which you suppose may prove so <HI>beneficial</HI> to them, and yet I doubt, if it be throughly lookt into, not only the <HI>Doctrine</HI> it self, but also the <HI>lasting Wars,</HI> and miseries it may pro∣duce, would sufficiently prove the <HI>contrary</HI> since the <HI>cruellest Tyranny,</HI> Slavery, and loss of Estates, or any thing else almost may be <HI>better</HI> born with in <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Unity</HI> than a <HI>Civil War,</HI> with the <HI>greatest</HI> Liberty, and Plenty: seeing all such comforts would quickly be devoured like <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Fat Kine, by such a <HI>Cruel M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nster</HI> feeding in their bowels: And therefore since <HI>Civil War</HI> is one of the <HI>greatest Calamities,</HI> and Punishments that God uses to send upon a <HI>Na∣tion,</HI> it seems evident to me, that the <HI>Wellfare</HI> of any <HI>State,</HI> or <HI>People</HI> requires them to be <HI>Obedient</HI> unto the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> tho' they be never so great Op∣pressors, or <HI>Cruel Tyrants.</HI> For when once they enter into this dismal <HI>State of War,</HI> who can tell whether it will have an <HI>End,</HI> without almost the <HI>total de∣struction</HI> of the <HI>Nation,</HI> or at least by bringing them into a far <HI>worse Condition</HI> of <HI>Slavery</HI> and <HI>Suffering,</HI> than they were before, since the <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Princes,</HI> or o∣ther <HI>Supream Powers</HI> can never be so mean, and <HI>inconsiderable</HI> in the World, as not to find, when like to be Opprest by such <HI>insurrections,</HI> and <HI>Rebellions</HI> of their Subjects, <HI>sufficient assistance</HI> from Neighbouring Princes or States, who making the <HI>Cause</HI> of such a Prince their <HI>own,</HI> will be sure to <HI>assist</HI> him to the utmost of their Power, it being found true by experience as <HI>Tully</HI> long ago observed:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cicero orat. pro Lege Manil.</HI></NOTE>

<P>You seem so in Love with <HI>slavery,</HI> and all the <HI>Consequences</HI> of it, that it is an <HI>hundred pities</HI> but that you should feel the smart of it a <HI>little while,</HI> provided no body was to <HI>suffer</HI> by it but your <HI>self,</HI> and those of your <HI>Opinion</HI>; But could you see the <HI>miserable Condition</HI> those poor People are in who live under <HI>Arbitrary</HI> and <HI>Tyrannical</HI> Government, I doubt not but you would be of <HI>another mind,</HI> and preferr a <HI>War,</HI> tho' never so <HI>Violent,</HI> before such a <HI>Peace,</HI> for when Men are once <HI>reduced</HI> to so <HI>desperate a Condition</HI> as neither to be <HI>secured</HI> of their Lives, Liberties, or Estates, they may have some hope to <HI>redress</HI> themselves by <HI>Resistance,</HI> but need not fear to be reduced to a <HI>worse Condition</HI> than they were before, and therefore I cannot understand how <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Comforts</HI> of a <HI>Civil Life,</HI> would then be <HI>lost</HI> by a <HI>Civil Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> when I have already put-it as a chief part of the Case, that Subjects are <HI>never</HI> to make such a <HI>Resistance</HI> but when the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> are just about to <HI>begin,</HI> or else have <HI>actu∣ally</HI> entered into a <HI>State of War</HI> against their <HI>Subjects</HI>: For what can any <HI>foreign</HI> E∣nemy do more if he <HI>Conquers</HI> them, than take away their Lives, Liberties, and Estates?

So that if that be <HI>false</HI> the rest of the <HI>Comparison</HI> will signifie nothing; And as for what you say concerning <HI>MAGNA CHARTA,</HI> I think it is not much for its <HI>credit,</HI> to have been <HI>extorted</HI> by <HI>Force,</HI> and afterwards <HI>defended</HI> by <HI>Rebellion</HI>; tho' I will not go about to <HI>Impeach</HI> the <HI>Validity</HI> of it, since so many of our <HI>Succeeding</HI> Kings, have so <HI>solemnly,</HI> and <HI>vo∣luntarily</HI> confirmed it; only pray take notice, that it is <HI>wholly</HI> derived from the <HI>Grace,</HI> and <HI>Bounty</HI> of our <HI>Monarchs</HI>▪ and therefore we are not to <HI>resist,</HI> tho' it may happen to be <HI>sometimes,</HI> and in some <HI>Particular</HI> Cases <HI>broken,</HI> and <HI>infringed</HI> by the King, for some <HI>great Occasions</HI> or <HI>Necessities</HI> of which we are not <HI>compet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t Iudges.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to the rest of those <HI>evil Consequences</HI> that may attend your Doctrine of <HI>Resistance</HI>; I think the <HI>Benefits,</HI> would be much <HI>greater</HI> to the <HI>People</HI> by <HI>strictly adhe∣ring</HI> to those Doctrines of <HI>Absolute Subjection,</HI> and <HI>Non-resistance</HI> than by <HI>propagating</HI> yours of <HI>Rebellion.</HI> For if the <HI>former</HI> were <HI>constantly</HI> taught, and inculcated, as <HI>most beneficial</HI> for them, and if they were once <HI>really persuaded</HI> of the <HI>Truth</HI> of it, and would both <HI>constantly profess,</HI> and <HI>practise</HI> it, it would make <HI>all Princes,</HI> much <HI>more Gentle,</HI> and mild to their <HI>Subjects,</HI> than otherwise at some times they are. For
<PB N="187" REF="102"/>
now they are still <HI>fearful,</HI> that they will take the <HI>first opportunity,</HI> they can to <HI>take up Arms</HI> against them: And upon the <HI>least Grievance,</HI> or Mis-Government, to <HI>resist</HI> their Authority, for then <HI>Princes</HI> not needing to keep any such <HI>constant Guards,</HI> and <HI>stand∣ing Armies,</HI> might afford to lay much <HI>easier Taxes,</HI> and <HI>impositions</HI> upon them, for the <HI>maintenance</HI> and support of the <HI>Government,</HI> than now they do, and in short, would have much <HI>fewer</HI> Temptations to <HI>Tyranny</HI> and <HI>Oppression,</HI> could they be once assured of their Subjects <HI>absolute Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Subjection.</HI> Whereas when they are under those <HI>constant fears,</HI> and suspitions of <HI>Insurrections,</HI> and <HI>Rebellions</HI> against them, upon the <HI>least</HI> occasion, it is no wonder, if they are <HI>tempted, sometimes</HI> to <HI>abuse</HI> this <HI>Power</HI> for their <HI>own Security.</HI> And therefore we read in our Histories, that <HI>William the Conquerour</HI> never thought himself <HI>secure</HI> from the <HI>English,</HI> whom he had newly Conquered, till such time as he had turned <HI>most</HI> of the <HI>Nobility,</HI> and <HI>Gentry,</HI> out of their Offices and Estates, lest they should have <HI>any Power</HI> left either in his <HI>Life</HI> time, or after his <HI>Death</HI> to turn him, or his Posterity out of the Throne, as they did the Heir of the <HI>Danish</HI> King <HI>Cnute,</HI> who with his <HI>Danes</HI> had before Conquered <HI>England,</HI> as King <HI>William</HI> did afterwards with his <HI>Normans:</HI> So that upon the whole matter it seems to me much more to con∣duce to the <HI>main design</HI> of <HI>Civil Government,</HI> viz. The Happiness and Peace of Mankind in General, that <HI>Princes</HI> and other <HI>Supream Magistrates,</HI> should be <HI>suffered</HI> (I will not say <HI>authorized</HI>) by God, <HI>sometimes</HI> to <HI>abuse</HI> their <HI>Power</HI> to the <HI>general oppression,</HI> and <HI>enslaving</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> without any <HI>Resistan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> on their side, expecting their <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liverance WHOLY</HI> from him who can bring it about in his <HI>good time</HI>; and by such means as shall seem most meet to him▪ than that <HI>Subjects</HI> should take upon them to be both <HI>Iudges,</HI> and <HI>Executioners</HI> too, in their own Case, and thereby <HI>introduce</HI> not only all the <HI>Mischiefs</HI> of <HI>Civil War,</HI> and all those <HI>cruel Revenges</HI> which the <HI>Wrath</HI> of an <HI>Incensed Prince</HI> may justly in∣flict upon such <HI>Rebels</HI> in this Life; but also the <HI>Wrath of God,</HI> and those <HI>Punish∣ments</HI> that he hath denounced in the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> in the Life to come against such <HI>Rebellious Subjects,</HI> as dare <HI>resist</HI> the Supream <HI>Powers ordained by God.</HI></P>

<P>Before I answer the main part of your last discourse, give me leave first to <HI>justifie</HI> my <HI>Simile,</HI> for tho' I grant <HI>Similes</HI> are no <HI>Arguments,</HI> yet they often serve to <HI>expose</HI> the <HI>absurdity</HI> of several things which either the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alse colours</HI> of Eloquence, or the <HI>too great Authority</HI> of learned men might otherwise have <HI>hid from our Eyes,</HI> and therefore if the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> have no <HI>Authority</HI> from the <HI>Revealed Will of God,</HI> or the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> nor by the <HI>Municipal Laws</HI> of any Countrey to <HI>invade</HI> their Subjects Lives, Liberties or Estates, they may be so far compared to <HI>Thieves</HI> and Robbers, when they do; nor are such <HI>vio∣lent Actions</HI> of theirs to be <HI>submitted</HI> to as the <HI>Ordinance of God.</HI> And I suppose you will not deny, but that a <HI>Prince</HI> or <HI>State</HI> that does thus, Acts as directly <HI>contrary</HI> to <HI>Gods</HI> Will, as <HI>Thieves</HI> themselves; and consequently all <HI>honest men</HI> or <HI>Subjects</HI> having so far <HI>no obligation</HI> to <HI>suffer</HI> or <HI>obey,</HI> may <HI>justly Resist</HI> them; So that if this be true, all the rest of the Comparison, <HI>currit quatuor pedibus.</HI></P>
<P>But as for your reflections upon <HI>MAGNA CHARTA</HI> it is <HI>you your self,</HI> not I, that asserted it to have been <HI>extorted</HI> by <HI>force,</HI> and <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fended</HI> by <HI>Rebellion,</HI> for it is very well known to those who are at all <HI>Conve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sant</HI> in our <HI>English</HI> Histo∣ries, and Laws; that there was <HI>nothing</HI> granted in that <HI>CHARTER,</HI> which was not the <HI>Birth-right</HI> of the <HI>Clergy, Nobility,</HI> and <HI>People</HI> long before the <HI>Conquest,</HI> and were comprised under the <HI>Title</HI> of King <HI>Edwards Laws,</HI> and which were after <HI>confirmed</HI> by <HI>William</HI> the <HI>first,</HI> as also more expresly by the <HI>Grants</HI> of
<PB N="188" REF="103"/>
his Son <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>first,</HI> and King <HI>Stephen,</HI> as appears by their <HI>Charters</HI> still to be seen. And therefore these <HI>fundamental Rights,</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> were not <HI>extorted</HI> by <HI>force</HI> from King <HI>Iohn,</HI> as you suppose; The <HI>War</HI> commencing be∣tween <HI>him,</HI> and his <HI>Barons,</HI> was not, because he would <HI>not grant</HI> them fresh Priviledges, which they had not before; but because he had not <HI>kept,</HI> nor <HI>observed</HI> the <HI>Fundamental Laws</HI> of the Land, and those <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> which before belonged to the <HI>Clergy, Nobility,</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> as well by the <HI>Com∣mon Law</HI> of the Land as the <HI>Grants</HI> of former <HI>Kings.</HI> And therefore if King <HI>Iohn</HI> by his <HI>apparent breach</HI> of them forced the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>People</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> them, it was <HI>no Rebellion</HI> for so doing, nor was it <HI>ever declared</HI> to be so by any <HI>Law</HI> now extant.</P>
<P>But to come to the <HI>main force</HI> of your Argument: I confess it were an <HI>ad∣mirable expedient</HI> not only against <HI>Rebellion,</HI> but also the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of <HI>Princes</HI> to <HI>PREACH</HI> that they should not <HI>oppress</HI> their <HI>People,</HI> nor yet that the <HI>People</HI> should <HI>rebel</HI> against them, but the preaching of these <HI>Doctrines,</HI> or getting as many as you can to <HI>believe</HI> them, will no more make Princes leave keeping <HI>standing Armies,</HI> or laying <HI>great Taxes</HI> upon their <HI>People,</HI> than <HI>Constant Preach∣ing</HI> against <HI>Robbery,</HI> or <HI>Murder,</HI> will take away the <HI>necessary use</HI> of <HI>Gallows</HI> out of the Nation: Since we know very well, that as long as the <HI>Corruption</HI> of hu∣mane Nature continues; so long must likewise all <HI>Powerful Remedies</HI> against it. And therefore your Instance of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror will signifie very little, for I believe had all those learned <HI>Divines</HI> (who have of late so much Written and Preached for <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> and <HI>Non-resistance</HI>) been then alive, and had exerted the utmost of their <HI>Reason,</HI> and <HI>Eloquence</HI> to prove them ne∣cessary, nay farther, I do not believe, tho' all the People of <HI>England,</HI> should have given it under their hands, that they would <HI>not</HI> have <HI>Resisted,</HI> or <HI>Rebel∣led</HI> against King <HI>William,</HI> that yet he would have <HI>trusted</HI> them the <HI>more</HI> for all that, or have kept <HI>one Soldier</HI> the <HI>less</HI> for it; nor have remitted <HI>one Denier</HI> of those great Taxes he imposed, for he was too <HI>cunning</HI> and <HI>Politick</HI> a Prince not to understand <HI>humane Nature</HI>; which cannot willingly endure great and <HI>intolerable Slavery,</HI> and <HI>Oppression</HI> without <HI>Resistance,</HI> if men are able, and there∣fore, he very well knew that after the <HI>forcible taking</HI> away of so many of the <HI>English</HI> Nobilities Estates, there was no way but <HI>force</HI> to keep them in <HI>Obedi∣ence</HI>: And as Princes can never be satisfied that their <HI>Subjects</HI> have been throughly paced in these <HI>difficult Doctrines,</HI> so they can never be <HI>secure,</HI> that they will not play the <HI>Iades,</HI> and Kick, and <HI>fling</HI> their <HI>Riders,</HI> when they spur them <HI>too severely,</HI> and press too hard upon them. And therefore, I doubt such Princes, whose Government is severe will always find it necessary to Ride this <HI>Beast,</HI> (as you call it) the <HI>People,</HI> with strong Curbs and <HI>Cavessons.</HI> But besides all this, there is likewise another <HI>infirmity</HI> in the Nature of Man∣kind, and of which <HI>Princes</HI> may as well be <HI>Guilty,</HI> as other men, that they are more apt to <HI>oppress,</HI> and insult over those whose <HI>Principles,</HI> or <HI>Natural Tempers</HI> may be against all <HI>Resistance,</HI> and for this I appeal to your Example of the <HI>Primitive</HI> Christians who were not one jot the <HI>better</HI> used by the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours, tho' they expresly disclaimed <HI>all Resistance</HI> of those Emperours for <HI>Persecution</HI> in matters of <HI>Religion</HI>; and tho' some <HI>neighbouring</HI> Princes are thought to have their Subjects in more <HI>perfect Subjection,</HI> and that either their <HI>Religion,</HI> or <HI>Natural Tempers</HI> makes them less apt to <HI>resist</HI> the Violence and <HI>Oppression</HI> of their Monarchs, than the <HI>English,</HI> or other Nations: Yet I desire
<PB N="189" REF="103"/>
you to enquire whether <HI>Taxes,</HI> and all other oppressions do not Reign as much under those <HI>Governments</HI>; however sensible the Princes may be of their <HI>Subjects Loyalty,</HI> and <HI>Obedience.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore to conclude, I shall freely leave it to your Judgment, or that of any indifferent Person, which is most agreeable to the <HI>main Ends</HI> of <HI>Civil Go∣vernment,</HI> viz the <HI>Common good</HI> of Mankind, and the Happiness, and Safety of each particular Kingdom, or Commonwealth, that the Violence, and <HI>Tyran∣ny</HI> of <HI>Princes,</HI> should be sometimes <HI>Resisted,</HI> than that the <HI>People</HI> under the Pre∣tence of this <HI>irresistible Power,</HI> should be liable to be made <HI>beggars,</HI> and <HI>Slaves</HI> whenever any Prince, or State had a Mind to it. And I appeal to your <HI>own Conscience,</HI> if the supposed belief of the <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> of some of <HI>our Church,</HI> was not one of the greatest <HI>encouragements</HI> which the <HI>King,</HI> and the <HI>Iesuited F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction</HI> had, to bring in the <HI>Popish</HI> Religion under the Colour of the <HI>dispensing Power, Ecclesiastical Commissioners,</HI> and force of a <HI>standing Army,</HI> from which <HI>Unavoidable mischiefs,</HI> nothing under God but this <HI>wonderful Revolution,</HI> could have rescued us: And therefore, I think it becomes any <HI>honest man</HI> to thank God for it, and join with his <HI>Highness</HI> the Prince of <HI>Ori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge,</HI> as the <HI>only means</HI> (now miracles are ceased) which God hath been pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ased to <HI>ordain</HI> by the course of his Providence for our <HI>Deliverance.</HI></P>

<P>I must confess, I am <HI>somewhat staggered</HI> with those Reasons, and Ar∣guments you have now given me against those <HI>Principles,</HI> which as I have al∣ways, and must still esteem as <HI>sacred,</HI> till I am convinced, I am in an Errour▪ and perhaps, if I were to consult my own <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reason,</HI> and <HI>natural Inclina∣tions,</HI> I should come over to your <HI>opinion:</HI> But since, it hath pleased God to lay much <HI>higher restraints,</HI> and stricter Rules of <HI>Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Subjection</HI> on us by his <HI>Revealed Will</HI> in the <HI>Scripture,</HI> beyond what can be discovered by the <HI>Light of Nature</HI>; and that under the highest Penalty, <HI>viz. Damnation:</HI> I can see no reason, why God Almighty, may not grant <HI>Eternal Life</HI> upon what Condi∣tions he pleases, tho' never so <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>uneasie</HI> for <HI>Flesh,</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> to perform. So that, if our Saviour <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> hath commanded us <HI>to take up his Cross, and follow him,</HI> that is, to suffer all sorts of <HI>Injuries,</HI> and <HI>Afflictions,</HI> nay <HI>Death</HI> it self, (as he himself did,) rather than to <HI>Resist</HI> the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> under which He lived, I cannot see any Reason why he should not Propose his <HI>own Example,</HI> for our <HI>Imitation.</HI> And as he hath enjoined, and expects from us <HI>greater Degrees</HI> of Chastity, Charity, and Humility than ever he did from the <HI>Iews,</HI> or <HI>Pagans,</HI> so I see no reason, why he may not likewise exact from us a greater, and more <HI>perfect Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Submission</HI> without any <HI>Resistance</HI> to all Soveraign Princes, and States, than ever he did either by the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> or that of <HI>Nature</HI>; not but that there are sufficient Proofs in the <HI>Old Te∣stament,</HI> for the <HI>absolute Power</HI> of Princes against all <HI>Rebellion,</HI> or <HI>Resistance</HI> in Subjects: Tho' I confess, this Doctrine is more plainly proved by the <HI>Example</HI> of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> and the <HI>Precepts</HI> of his <HI>Apostles</HI> in the <HI>New Testament,</HI> as also from the <HI>Example</HI> of the <HI>Primitive</HI> Christians in <HI>Obedience</HI> thereunto.</P>

<P>I perceive you begin to distrust your Arguments drawn from <HI>Natu∣ral Reason,</HI> and the <HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> and when you are pressed with the <HI>absurdi∣ty</HI> of this Doctrine of yours, you fly from Gods <HI>Natural,</HI> to his <HI>Revealed Will,</HI> and take refuge under the Covert of the <HI>Holy Scripture,</HI> to impose an Opinion <HI>contrary</HI> to the <HI>Common sense,</HI> and <HI>Natural Notions</HI> of Mankind, not <HI>corrupted</HI> with the <HI>Prejudices</HI> of <HI>Education</HI>; and therefore, give me leave at present to tell
<PB N="190" REF="104"/>
you, that I think, I shall be able to prove, that the <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> as you call it, of the <HI>Primitive</HI> Christians, and their <HI>sufferings</HI> for the Name of <HI>Christs</HI> will not at all <HI>contradict</HI> that <HI>Natural Right,</HI> which I suppose <HI>all Freemen</HI> to have, as well under <HI>Civil Government</HI> as in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> for the <HI>de∣fence</HI> of their Lives, Liberties, and Properties, unless where the <HI>Common good,</HI> and Peace of the <HI>whole</HI> or <HI>Major part</HI> of the People require the <HI>contrary.</HI> And therefore, the same Reasons, which oblige <HI>particular private Persons</HI> to be <HI>quiet,</HI> and not to <HI>disturb</HI> the publick Peace of the <HI>whole Society,</HI> for their own private Safety, and Advantage, when the <HI>whole Body</HI> of the People, or the <HI>Major part</HI> of them is thus <HI>violently assaulted</HI> in their Lives, Liberties and Estates, the same considerations of the <HI>Publick good</HI> of their Country, (whereof every Man is a Member.) doth then as strongly persuade, I may say enjoyn them to <HI>take up Arms,</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> themselves for the Preservation of the <HI>whole People</HI> or <HI>Commu∣nity,</HI> whose <HI>Natural,</HI> and <HI>Civil Rights</HI> being now attack't, can no otherwise be <HI>restored</HI> to the same State they were in before, but by that <HI>last Remedy</HI> that can be used in this Case, <HI>viz.

<P>I confess, that of all <HI>Commonwealth-hypotheses,</HI> yours is most reasona∣ble, being <HI>coherent</HI> with it self, and also <HI>most likely</HI> to be swallowed by the <HI>People,</HI> because it flatters our <HI>corrupt Natures,</HI> to which this <HI>Christian</HI> Doctrine of <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> is so directly <HI>opposite,</HI> as also because it gives them a <HI>full Liberty,</HI> I mean, not only the <HI>Representative</HI> Body, but the <HI>Major part</HI> of them, to <HI>reassume</HI> that <HI>Power</HI> which you pretend, they <HI>never parted with,</HI> and so con∣sequently all <HI>necessity</HI> of <HI>suffering</HI> (except when they please to think they have justly deserved it) is taken away, and the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of the <HI>Primitive</HI> Christi∣ans will be rendered only a <HI>tame Madness,</HI> and that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was very much overseen to enjoin <HI>this Subjection</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> under the Government of one of the most <HI>cruel Tyrants</HI> that ever sway'd that Scepter; but <HI>we have not so learned Christs</HI>; And therefore, I am firmly persuaded, that we ought to be <HI>strictly obedient</HI> without any <HI>Resistance</HI> to those <HI>Civil Governours,</HI> that God hath been pleased to set over us, let them <HI>abuse</HI> their Power never so <HI>Tyrannically.</HI></P>

<P>I am beholden to you for your <HI>plain dealing</HI> with me in this matter, and pleased to find, that you have an <HI>Inclination</HI> to my <HI>Principles,</HI> were it not for some <HI>Texts</HI> of <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Citations</HI> out of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> and <HI>Church Histo∣ry</HI> which give you a <HI>Prejudice</HI> against them; which I hope when they come to be closely examined will signifie no more than the former.</P>
<P>But for the dispatching this <HI>Important Controversie,</HI> I pray give me leave to propose this <HI>easie method,</HI> first that you would be pleased to lay down your <HI>Au∣thorities</HI> out of <HI>Scripture,</HI> in order as they lie. And afterwards to shew me, that the <HI>Ancient Fathers,</HI> and <HI>Primitive</HI> Church always understood <HI>those Texts</HI> in the same Sense that you do, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>No Resistance</HI> of the Supream Powers is <HI>Lawful</HI> to be exercised <HI>in any Case whatsoever.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I approve of your <HI>Proposal,</HI> and therefore, I will first begin with those <HI>proofs,</HI> which are expresly against <HI>all Rebellion</HI> or <HI>Resistance</HI> in the <HI>Old Testament.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. R.</HI> Ch. 1. <HI>p.</HI> 7.</NOTE> The <HI>first Governour</HI> that God set over the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> when he brought them out of the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> was <HI>Moses,</HI> and I think, I need not prove how <HI>sacred,</HI> and <HI>irresistible</HI> his <HI>Authority</HI> was. This is sufficiently evident in the <HI>Rebellion</HI> of <HI>Korah, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> against <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> when God caused <HI>the Earth to open her Mouth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Numb.</HI> 16.</NOTE> <HI>and swallow them up.</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="104"/>
And lest this should be thought an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Case, <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> being <HI>extraordinary</HI> Persons, immediately appointed by God, and governed by his <HI>Immediate direction</HI>; the Apostle St. <HI>Iude</HI> alledges this example against those in his days, who were Turbulent, and Factious, <HI>who despised Do∣minions, and spake evil of Dignities,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iude v.</HI> 11.</NOTE> <HI>that they should Perish in the gainsaying of Core</HI>; which he could not have done, had not this Example extended to all <HI>ordinary,</HI> as well as <HI>extraordinary</HI> Cases; had it not been a <HI>lasting Testimony</HI> of Gods displeasure against all those, who <HI>oppose</HI> them∣selves against <HI>Soveraign Powers.</HI> But <HI>Moses</HI> was not always to rule over them, and therefore God expresly provides for a <HI>succession</HI> of <HI>Soveraign Powers,</HI> to which they must <HI>all submit.</HI> The <HI>ordinary</HI> Soveraign Power of the <HI>Iewish</HI> Na∣tion after <HI>Moses</HI>'s Death was devolv'd either on the <HI>High-Priest,</HI> or those <HI>extra∣ordinary</HI> Persons whom God was pleas'd to raise up, such as <HI>Ioshua</HI> and the se∣veral <HI>Iu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges,</HI> till in <HI>Samuels</HI> Days it setled in their <HI>Kings.</HI> For as for the <HI>Iewish Sanhedrim</HI> whose Power is so much extolled<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 8.</NOTE> by the <HI>Iewish</HI> Writers (who are all a <HI>late Date,</HI> many years since the <HI>Destruction</HI> of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and therefore no <HI>competent Witnesses</HI> of what was done so many <HI>Ages before</HI>) it does not appear from any Testimony of <HI>Scrip∣ture,</HI> that there was such a <HI>Court of Iudicature,</HI> till after their Return from the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Captivity.</P>
<P>But yet God took care to secure the Peace, and good Government of the Nation, by appointing such a <HI>Power</HI> as should receive the <HI>last Appeals,</HI> and whose <HI>sentence</HI> in all Controversies should be <HI>final</HI> &amp; <HI>uncontrou∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble</HI> as you may see in <HI>Deuteronomy Chap.</HI> 17.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut.</HI> 17. <HI>v.</HI> 8.9, 10, 11, 12.</NOTE> There were indeed <HI>inferiour Magistrates,</HI> and <HI>Iudges</HI> appointed in their several <HI>Tribes</HI> and Cities, which <HI>Moses</HI> did by the advice of <HI>Iethro</HI> his Father in Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Exod.</HI> 18.</NOTE> and by the <HI>Approbation</HI> of God. But as the <HI>Su∣pream Power</HI> was still reserv'd in the hands of <HI>Moses</HI> while he <HI>liv'd,</HI> so it is here <HI>secured</HI> to the <HI>High-Priest,</HI> or <HI>Iudges</HI> after his Death; for it is expresly appointed, that if those <HI>inferiour Iudges</HI> could not <HI>determine</HI> the Controversie, <HI>they should come unto the Priests, the Levites,</HI> that is, the Priests of the Tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> (who by the 12. <HI>v.</HI> appear only to be the High-Priest) <HI>and to the Iudge that shall be in those days,</HI> that is, if it shall be at such a time, when there is an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Judge raised by God, (for there were not always such <HI>Iudges</HI> in <HI>Israel,</HI> as is evident to anyone who reads the Book of <HI>Iudges</HI>) they should enquire of them and <HI>they shall shew the sentence of Iudgement; and thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place</HI> (which the Lord shall Chuse) <HI>shall shew thee, and thou shalt observe to do, according to all they shall inform thee:</HI> And what the Authority of the <HI>Chief-Priest,</HI> or of the <HI>Iudge,</HI> when there was one, was in those days, appears from, <HI>v.</HI> 12. <HI>And the Man that will do presumptuously, and wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not hearken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Priest (that standeth to Minister there before the Lord thy God) or unto the Iudge, even that Man shall dye, and thou shalt put away the evil from</HI> Israel This is as <HI>absolute</HI> an <HI>Authority,</HI> as the most <HI>absolute Monarch</HI> in the World can challenge that <HI>disobedience</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S.

they were not bound to abide by their sentence, nor were punishable if they did not, but <HI>only</HI> in such Cases when they <HI>gave sentence according to the Law of God.</HI> But these Men do not consider, that the <HI>Matter</HI> in Controversie is sup∣posed to be <HI>doubtful,</HI> and such as could not be <HI>determin'd</HI> by the <HI>inferiour Courts,</HI> and therefore is submitted to the <HI>Decision</HI> of the <HI>Supream Iudge,</HI> and as he deter∣min'd so they must do &amp; no Man under the Penalty of Death, must presume to do otherwise;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>ibid. p.</HI> 11.</NOTE> which takes away all <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Iudging</HI> from <HI>Private Persons,</HI> tho' this <HI>Supream</HI> Judge might possibly <HI>mistake</HI> in his Judgment, as all <HI>Humane Iudicatures</HI> are liable to mi∣stakes; but it seems <HI>God Almighty</HI> thought it necessary that there should be some <HI>final Iudgment</HI>; from whence there should be <HI>no Appeal,</HI> notwithstand∣ing the Possibility of a mistake in it.</P>
<P>So likewise when God had appointed <HI>Ioshua</HI> to succeed <HI>Moses,</HI> and had con∣ferrd upon him <HI>all</HI> that Power that <HI>Moses</HI> had before, and that he came to give his Orders to the two <HI>Tribes</HI> and an <HI>half</HI> before their Passage over <HI>Iordan,</HI> you'l find that they not only promis'd him <HI>perfect Obedience,</HI> as they had before pay'd to <HI>Moses,</HI> but farther also assure him <HI>That whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy Commandment,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iosh</HI> 1.18.</NOTE> <HI>and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou Commandest him, he shall be put to Death:</HI> So that there was a <HI>Supream,</HI> and <HI>Soveraign,</HI> that is, an <HI>unaccountable,</HI> and <HI>irresistible Power,</HI> in the <HI>Iewish</HI> Nation appointed by God himself; for indeed it is not possible that the <HI>Publick Peace,</HI> and Security of any Nation should be <HI>preserved</HI> without it.</P>

<P>You have, Sir methinks taken a great deal of pains to <HI>prove</HI> that which I do not at all <HI>Deny,</HI> but rather <HI>joyn</HI> with you to <HI>ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt,</HI> that <HI>Stubborn∣ness</HI> and <HI>Disobedience</HI> to Gods Commands is a very <HI>great Sin,</HI> and the <HI>Re∣bellion, thereunto is likened to the Sin of Witchcraft</HI>; as <HI>Samuel</HI> shews to no less a Man, than King <HI>Saul</HI> himself, when he had <HI>Rebelled</HI> against (that is, disobey∣ed) <HI>God</HI> in not destroying the King of the <HI>Amal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kites,</HI> and therefore it is no wonder that in a <HI>Government,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15.23.</NOTE> where <HI>God</HI> him∣self was the <HI>Head,</HI> and had appointed <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> as his <HI>Lieutenants</HI> or <HI>Substitutes</HI> under him, the one in <HI>Civil,</HI> and the other in <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> matters, that God should punish their <HI>Murmuring,</HI> and <HI>Rebellion</HI> against them as done to <HI>himself</HI>; not that I deny, but that St. <HI>Iude</HI> does likewise denounce this Judgment of perishing <HI>in the gainsaying of Core,</HI> against those wicked Hereticks the <HI>Gnosticks,</HI> who thought themselves set <HI>free</HI> from all <HI>Civil subjection,</HI> and therefore <HI>despised Dominions, and spake evil of Dignities,</HI> that is, not the Men <HI>invested</HI> with them, but <HI>Civil Magistracy</HI> it self; which they look'd upon as <HI>inconsistent</HI> with their <HI>Christian</HI> Liberty.</P>
<P>But yet for all this, and that I grant God denounced no less than the <HI>Sen∣tence of Death</HI> against any Man that <HI>refused</HI> to Hearken to the <HI>Priest,</HI> or unto the <HI>Iudge</HI> in those matters that should be brought before them, by way of <HI>Appeal,</HI> and also that whoever would not obey <HI>Ioshua,</HI> but should <HI>Rebel</HI> against his Commandments, should be <HI>put to Death</HI>; yet can I not think that there was any <HI>Irresistible Power,</HI> plac'd by God, in the <HI>Persons</HI> of <HI>Moses, Ioshua,</HI> or the <HI>Iudges,</HI> or that it was <HI>not possible</HI> for the <HI>Publick Peace,</HI> or security of the Nation, to be <HI>preserved</HI> without that; But indeed all these Persons above nam'd, being to be <HI>Obeyed,</HI> as <HI>Gods Substitutes,</HI> or <HI>Lieutenants,</HI> as he was King of the <HI>Children of Israel,</HI> so likewise their <HI>Commands,</HI> or Dictates were only so
<PB N="193" REF="105"/>
far to be observ'd, as they perform'd this <HI>Commission,</HI> and if they had <HI>swerved</HI> from it, I doubt not but they might not only have been <HI>disobeyed,</HI> but also <HI>resisted</HI> by them: And therefore, pray tell me, suppose this <HI>Rebellion</HI> of <HI>Core</HI> had hap∣pened, because <HI>Moses</HI> making himself a <HI>distinct</HI> party, amongst <HI>the mixt multitude</HI> of strangers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Exod.</HI> 12.38.</NOTE> that came up with them, out of the <HI>Land of Egypt,</HI> and others of his own <HI>Tribe</HI> or whom he could bring over to his <HI>Faction,</HI> under colour of this <HI>Soveraign Power,</HI> (which God had given him) had instead of leading and <HI>governing</HI> the People commit∣ted to his charge, taken upon him to have <HI>rob'd</HI> them of all those Goods, and Riches which they had brought with them out of the <HI>Land of Egypt,</HI> and had sold the <HI>People,</HI> or their <HI>Children</HI> for <HI>slaves</HI> to the Neighbouring Nations, to in∣rich himself and his Family; do you believe that the <HI>Children of Israel</HI> had been <HI>Obliged</HI> to have Obeyed such a <HI>Leader,</HI> and not have <HI>resisted</HI> him, and his party, if there had been occasion? So likewise, if <HI>Ioshua,</HI> instead of Leading Gods People into the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> had taken upon him, notwithstanding Gods Com∣mands, to have <HI>carried</HI> them again into <HI>Egypt,</HI> can you think they had been <HI>bound</HI> to <HI>Obey</HI> him, and might not <HI>Lawfully</HI> have <HI>resisted</HI> him if he had gone about, by the assistance of his <HI>Accomplices,</HI> to force them to it? For I doubt not but if these <HI>Substitutes</HI> had acted contrary to that <HI>Commission</HI> God had given them, they were no longer to be look'd upon as <HI>Gods Vicegerents,</HI> no more than the now <HI>Lieutenant</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Lord <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> ought to be <HI>Obeyed,</HI> and not <HI>resisted,</HI> if he should go about by Vertue of that <HI>Commission</HI> which the King hath conferred upon him, and by the help of the <HI>Rebellious Irish</HI> in that King∣dom, to murder all the <HI>Protestants,</HI> and set up for himself. So likewise all this <HI>strict Obedience,</HI> and submission that was to be paid to the <HI>Sentence</HI> of the <HI>High-Priest,</HI> or <HI>Iudge,</HI> was only in <HI>Relation</HI> to God himself, whose Sentence it was, and who always <HI>Revealed</HI> his Will either to the <HI>Iudge</HI> by particular In∣spiration, or to the <HI>High-Priest</HI> by the <HI>Ephod,</HI> or <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI>; And there∣fore we read in <HI>Iudges,</HI> that <HI>Deborah,</HI> tho' a Woman, yet being a <HI>Prophetess,</HI> inspir'd by God, <HI>judged Israel.</HI></P>
<P>Now suppose that this <HI>Iudge,</HI> or <HI>High-Priest,</HI> neglecting (like <HI>Balaam</HI>) the <HI>Divine Inspiration,</HI> and the <HI>Dictates</HI> of that <HI>Sacred Oracle,</HI> had, instead of a <HI>Righteous Iudgment,</HI> given a <HI>Sentence,</HI> in a Cause that had come before them, whereby <HI>Idolatry</HI> or breach of some <HI>great Point</HI> of the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> had been established, do you think that God ever intended that this <HI>Sentence</HI> should have been <HI>Obeyed</HI> under Pain of <HI>Death</HI>?</P>
<P>And therefore you may find in the 2d. Book of <HI>Maccabees,</HI> that when <HI>Iason</HI> and <HI>Menelaus</HI> had by <HI>Bribery</HI> obtained the <HI>High-Priesthood,</HI> tho' it was then the <HI>Chief Authority,</HI> (under the Kings of <HI>Syria</HI>) both in <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> and <HI>Civil</HI> matters, yet when they went about to <HI>undermine</HI> the <HI>Iewish</HI> Religion, and <HI>se∣duce</HI> the People to <HI>Idolatry,</HI> they are not at all look'd upon as <HI>High-Priests,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Maccab.</HI> 4. <HI>v.</HI> 25.</NOTE> <HI>but are there called Ungodly Wretches, doing nothing worthy of the High-Priesthood, but having the fury of a Cruel Ty∣rant, and of a Savage Beast</HI>; and were so far from being at all Obeyed by the <HI>Iews,</HI> that <HI>Iason, Menelaus,</HI> and <HI>Alcimus</HI> who were successively <HI>High-Priests</HI> in the room of <HI>Onias,</HI> were as far as the People were able opposed by them till at last <HI>Iudas Maccabeus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Mac.</HI> 7.23, 24, 25.</NOTE> taking Arms against <HI>Alcimus</HI> the High-Priest, restored by <HI>force</HI> the true Worship of God: So that you see, that the <HI>Obedience</HI> was not pay'd to the <HI>Person</HI> of the <HI>High-Priests,</HI>
<PB N="194" REF="106"/>
only as such, by vertue of this Precept in <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> but only as far as they <HI>observed</HI> the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> and gave sentence, or Judgment in all mat∣ters according to it. And therefore it is no <HI>good Argument</HI> of yours, because the People were <HI>bound</HI> to obey their sentence in <HI>doubtful cases,</HI> therefore they had an <HI>absolute irresistible Power</HI> to give what <HI>Iudgments</HI> they pleased, and that the People were obliged to <HI>observe</HI> them under pain of <HI>Death,</HI> and being Guilty of <HI>Rebellion.</HI> For that had been to have given the <HI>High-Priests</HI> and <HI>Iudges</HI> a Power to have <HI>altered</HI> the true Worship of God when ever they plea∣sed, and to have introduced <HI>Idolatry</HI> in the Room of it. So that I think none of these places will prove any more, but that <HI>God,</HI> and his <HI>Lieutenants</HI> were to be <HI>Obeyed,</HI> and that it was <HI>Rebellion</HI> to resist them under the <HI>Iewish</HI> Government, as long as they did not <HI>force</HI> the People to <HI>Idolatry,</HI> which I do not at all deny.</P>

<P>Tho you labour to wave <HI>these examples,</HI> and Precepts, which I have now cited, and will not take them for convincing, yet let me tell you <HI>your exceptions</HI> against them only tend to prove that <HI>Idolatrous,</HI> Kings might be <HI>resi∣sted</HI> under the <HI>Iewish</HI> Law, which is directly <HI>contrary</HI> to the <HI>Sacred</HI> History, as I shall prove very clearly to you by these following Testimonies, I shall make use of, yet I think it is much more plain, that when the <HI>Iews</HI> would have a King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. R.</HI> S. <HI>P. p.</HI> 11.</NOTE> their <HI>Kings</HI> were to be <HI>invested</HI> with a <HI>Su∣pream</HI> and <HI>irresistible Power,</HI> for when they desired a King of <HI>Samuel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 8.6.19, 20.</NOTE> they did not desire a meer nominal, and titular King, <HI>but a King to Iudg them, and go in and out before them, and fight their Battles, that is,</HI> a King who had the <HI>Supream,</HI> and <HI>Sove∣raign Authority,</HI> a King who should have <HI>all</HI> that Power of <HI>Government</HI> (excep∣ting the peculiar Acts of the <HI>Priestly</HI> Office) which either their <HI>High-Priest,</HI> or their <HI>Iudge</HI> had before.</P>
<P>And therefore when <HI>Samuel</HI> tells them, what shall be the <HI>manner</HI> of their King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 8.6.19, 20.</NOTE> tho what he says doth necessarily sup∣pose the <HI>translation</HI> of the Soveraign, and <HI>Irresistible Power</HI> to the <HI>Person</HI> of their King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>v.</HI> 11.</NOTE> yet it doth not suppose that their King had any <HI>new Power</HI> given him, more than what was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cised formerly by the <HI>Priest,</HI> and <HI>Iudges.</HI> He doth not deter them fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>chusing</HI> a King, because a King should have <HI>greater Power,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e more <HI>uncontroulable,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S.</HI> C. <HI>R. P. p.</HI> 12, 13.</NOTE> and <HI>Irresistible</HI> than their other Ru∣lers were, for <HI>Samuel</HI> himself had before as <HI>Soveraign,</HI> and <HI>Irresistible,</HI> a Power as any King, being the <HI>Supream Iudge</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> whose sentence no Man could disobey, or contradict, but he incurred the penalty of <HI>Death,</HI> according to the <HI>Mosa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cal</HI> Law; But the reason why he distuades them from <HI>chusing</HI> a King was, because the <HI>external</HI> Pomp, and Magni∣ficence of Kings, was like to be very <HI>Chargeable,</HI> and <HI>oppressive</HI> to them. <HI>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your Sons, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them for himself, for his Chariots, and to be his House Men and some shall ran before his Chariots. And he will appoint him Captains over Thousands, and Captains over Fifties, and will set them to ear his Ground, and to reap his Harvest.</HI> And thus in several Particulars he shews them what <HI>burdens,</HI> and <HI>exactions</HI>; they will bring upon themselves by setting up a <HI>King</HI>; which they were then <HI>free</HI> from▪ and if any Prince should be <HI>excessive</HI> in such <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>acti∣ons,</HI> yet they had <HI>no way</HI> to help themselves; they must not <HI>resist,</HI> nor <HI>rebel</HI> against him, nor expect that, whatever <HI>inconvenience</HI> they might find in <HI>Kingly
<PB N="195" REF="106"/>
Government,</HI>, God would relieve, and <HI>deliver</HI> them from it, when once they had <HI>chosen</HI> a King: Ye shall cry out in <HI>that day because of your King, that you have chosen you,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>v.</HI> 18.</NOTE> <HI>and the Lord will not hear you in that day,</HI> That is, God will, not <HI>alter</HI> the Government for you again how much soever you may complain of it.</P>
<P>This, I say, is a plain Proof, that their <HI>Kings</HI> were to be <HI>invested</HI> with that <HI>So∣veraign Power,</HI> which must not be <HI>resisted,</HI> tho' they <HI>oppress</HI> their Subjects to main∣tain their own State and Grandeur, and Magnificence of their Kingdoms: But I cannot think that these words contain the <HI>Original Grant</HI> and <HI>Charter</HI> of <HI>Regal Power</HI>; but only the <HI>Translation</HI> that was formerly in their <HI>High-Priests,</HI> or <HI>Iudges</HI> to <HI>Kings.</HI> Kings had no more Power, than their other Governours had: for there can be <HI>no Power</HI> greater than that which is <HI>irresistible:</HI> but this <HI>Power</HI> in the hands of <HI>Kings,</HI> was likely to be more <HI>burdensome,</HI> and <HI>oppressive</HI> to them, than it was in the hands of their <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Iudges,</HI> by reason of their different way of living, which is the only Argument <HI>Samuel</HI> makes use of to dissuade them from <HI>transferring</HI> the Supream, and <HI>Soveraign Power</HI> to a <HI>King</HI>; And therefore I rather Chuse to trans∣late <HI>Mishpat,</HI> as our Translators do, by the <HI>manner of the King,</HI> than with some lear∣ned Men, <HI>by the Right of the King,</HI> thereby understanding the <HI>Original Charter</HI> of <HI>Kingly Power</HI>: for it is not the <HI>Regal Power</HI> which <HI>Samuel</HI> here <HI>blames,</HI> which was much like that which he himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad exercised while he was <HI>Supream Iudge</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> but their <HI>Pompous way</HI> of living; which would prove very <HI>oppressive,</HI> and <HI>burdensome</HI> to them, and be apt to make them <HI>complain,</HI> who had not been used to such <HI>Exa∣ctions.</HI></P>

<P>You have, I must confess, made a much fairer exposition of this out of <HI>Samuel,</HI> than divers of our Hot and Giddy <HI>Divines</HI> who would render this <HI>Mishpat,</HI> as it is in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> i. e. the <HI>manner</HI> of the King, by <HI>Right</HI> of the King, whereby they would <HI>entitle</HI> all Kings whatsoever to an <HI>absolute Right</HI> to all their <HI>Subjects E∣states,</HI> when ever they would take them away, not taking notice that this word, <HI>Mishpat,</HI> is sometimes used, not only in a <HI>good,</HI> but a <HI>bad</HI> sense, not for <HI>Right,</HI> or <HI>Power,</HI> but for an <HI>evil Custom</HI> or <HI>Abuse,</HI> and therefore you may find in the second Chapter of this Book of <HI>Samuel</HI> that speaking of the Sons of <HI>Eli who were Sons of</HI> Belial <HI>they knew not the Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>v.</HI> 12, 13, 14.</NOTE> <HI>that the Priests,</HI> viz. (their) <HI>Custom with the People was, that when any man offered Sacrifice, the Priests servant came, whilst the Flesh was in seething, with a Flesh-Hook of three teeth in his hand, and he strook it into the Pan, or Kettle, or Caldron, or Pot, all that the Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh book brought up, the Priest took for himself: so they did in</HI> Shiloh, <HI>unto all the</HI> Israelites <HI>that came thither.</HI> Where I desire you to observe, that that which is ren∣dred in our Translation the <HI>Priests Custom,</HI> is in the Hebrew <HI>Mishpat</HI> which you ren∣der <HI>Right</HI>; so that if this word would do it, these <HI>wicked Priests</HI> had also a <HI>Right</HI> to take away as much of every Man's <HI>Sacrifice</HI> as they pleased for themselves; nay, to take it before God himself was served, and the Fat burnt (according to the rites of <HI>Sacrificing</HI>) and by the same Rule Kings also by this word <HI>Mishpat</HI> should have a <HI>Right</HI> to take what they pleas'd of the <HI>Subjects Estates.</HI></P>
<P>I do like wise also so far agree with you, that <HI>Samuel</HI> does not here describe a a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> but one of those <HI>absolute Eastern</HI> Princes, who made use of a great part of their <HI>Subjects Estates</HI> (as they do at this day) to maintain their <HI>standing Armies,</HI> and <HI>Royal</HI> Pomp, and Magnificence, so that I grant in short, <HI>Samuel</HI> meant no more when he thus spake to them, but since you will have a <HI>King,</HI> he must be maintained like a <HI>King,</HI> and very <HI>great Taxes</HI> will be laid upon you for this End;

of which <HI>Burden</HI> if you shall hereafter be <HI>weary,</HI> or would cast it off agai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, you shall by no means do it: for since <HI>this King</HI> shall obtain the Crown not only by <HI>Gods appointment,</HI> but by your <HI>own Choice,</HI> or <HI>Election,</HI> it shall not be in your Power again to <HI>depose</HI> him; since it is your <HI>own Act,</HI> and therefore <HI>Samuel</HI> tells them, <HI>That when they should cry unto the Lord in that day, because of the King which they had chosen, the Lord would not hear them</HI>; and as long as this <HI>King</HI> kept himself within <HI>these bounds,</HI> I grant, he was <HI>not</HI> to be <HI>resisted.</HI></P>
<P>Yet nevertheless, this place you have now cited, as it is very far from <HI>Pa∣tronising</HI> Tyranny, or all the <HI>abuses</HI> of Regal Power, so neither do I think it was <HI>Samuel's</HI> meaning to make the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> so <HI>absolute,</HI> or <HI>irresistible,</HI> as that upon <HI>no account whatsoever</HI> the People might <HI>disobey,</HI> or <HI>resist</HI> them, let them use this Power <HI>never so wickedly,</HI> nay, contrary to <HI>Gods</HI> express com∣mands, and the <HI>Ends</HI> of all <HI>Civil Government</HI>; and therefore pray tell me; Suppose, instead of these <HI>necessary burdens,</HI> which they should be <HI>Subject</HI> to, when they had a King, <HI>Samuel</HI> had spoke thus to them, This <HI>King</HI> (whom you desire) shall prove an <HI>Idolater,</HI> and as <HI>cruel</HI> a <HI>Tyrant</HI> as <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> or any of the Kings of the <HI>Philistines, Canaanites,</HI> or any other Nations who so long <HI>Tyran∣nized</HI> over you, and shall <HI>take away</HI> all your Estates, and Lives too, at his <HI>Good Pleasure,</HI> without any Crime, or <HI>Legal Trial,</HI> and in short will not on∣ly Himself use you for <HI>Slaves,</HI> but <HI>sell</HI> you, and your Children for <HI>Bondmen</HI> to the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and other Nations, and shall lay such <HI>Grievous Tributes</HI> and Burthens upon you, that you shall be scarce able to live under them.</P>
<P>Now can any Man think, if the <HI>Israelites</HI> had been really persuaded, that their King <HI>must</HI> have such an <HI>Absolute,</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Power,</HI> as a necessary and <HI>Inseparable Prerogative</HI> of his Crown, they would ever have been so fond of <HI>such</HI> a Government, as to have cried out with one Consent, <HI>Nay, but we will have a King over us, that we may be like other Nations.</HI> (But sure) not to <HI>Tyrannize</HI> over, and <HI>enslave</HI> us, but <HI>that he may Iudge us,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 20.</NOTE> <HI>and go out before us, and fight our Battels:</HI> Or do you think, if they had had such a King as this, they would ever have long endured him? for that the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> did not conceive that their Kings had such an <HI>Absolute,</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Power</HI> over them, as to <HI>op∣press</HI> them with <HI>Taxes,</HI> and to make their Yoke more grievous to them, than they were able to bear, or to <HI>Tyrannize</HI> over them at his <HI>good Pleasure,</HI> appears plainly by the Story in the first of <HI>Kings</HI> concerning the Chil∣dren of <HI>Israels</HI> assembling <HI>together at</HI> Sichem <HI>to make</HI> Reho∣boam <HI>King,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 12.</NOTE> and you'll find the Preliminary Conditions of his Government were these.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 3.4.</NOTE> <HI>All the Congregation of</HI> Israel <HI>came, and spake unto</HI> Rehoboam <HI>saying: Thy Father made our Yoke grievous: Now therefore make thou the grievous Service of thy Father, and his heavy Yoke, which he put upon us, Lighter, and we will serve thee.</HI> But see the An∣swer that <HI>Rehoboam</HI> made them, according to the Wisdom of his Young Counsellours.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 10.11.</NOTE> <HI>My little Finger Shall be Thicker than my Fathers Loyns: And whereas my Father did lade you with a heavy Yoke, I will add to your Yoke: My Father has chastised you with Whips, but I will chastize you with Scorpions.</HI> And mark, what follows upon this Answer:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 16.</NOTE> <HI>So when all</HI> Israel <HI>saw, that the King heark∣ened not unto them, the People answered the King, saying, What Portion have we in</HI> David? <HI>Neither have we inheritance in the Son of</HI> Jesse; <HI>To

<P>I hope you will not be in a Passion; because I have brought this In∣stance of the <HI>Israelites</HI> Defection from <HI>Rehoboam</HI> as an Example of the <HI>Right</HI> that Subjects may have in those Cases. I have put, to <HI>resist,</HI> or cast off those <HI>Su∣pream Powers</HI> that God had once set over them. For I do confess Divines, and other Authors, are much <HI>divided</HI> about this Action of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> some main∣taining it to be <HI>well done,</HI> and in Pursuance to God's Will, and others holding it to be <HI>Down-right Rebellion.</HI> And therefore, I shall not <HI>positively assert</HI> either the one, or the other, much less that <HI>Subjects</HI> may <HI>rebel</HI> whensoever they con∣ceive themselves <HI>overtax't</HI>; but thus much, I think, I may safely affirm, that if the <HI>Israelites</HI> had <HI>no Right</HI> upon any score whatsoever to <HI>resist, I</HI> cannot see, why <HI>Rehoboam</HI> might not have made them, if he had pleas'd, as <HI>Arrant Slaves,</HI> as ever their <HI>Ancestors</HI> were in <HI>Egypt</HI>; and what he else meant, by say∣ing, <HI>instead of Whips, to chastise them with Scorpions,</HI> (which were a sort of thorny rods, with which the <HI>Iews</HI> corrected their Slaves, and Malefactors) I cannot understand; and as for <HI>Taxes,</HI> tho I confess, there is no setting any <HI>positive measure</HI> to them; since no man can positively define what the <HI>Exi∣gences</HI> of a State may require, and I think no <HI>good Subjects</HI> ought to deny to contribute as much as <HI>ever</HI> they are able to afford, to <HI>maintain</HI> the Govern∣ment they live under, as long as they receive the <HI>Protection</HI> of it: So, on the other side, should the <HI>Supream Power</HI> of any Nation, (where the <HI>People</HI> are not <HI>meer Slaves</HI>) under the Pretence of laying <HI>necessary Taxes,</HI> for the Main∣tenance, or Preservation of the Government be constantly exacting from the People, more than they were able to pay, as if, for Example, they should out of every Mans Estate take <HI>Nineteen parts,</HI> and leave but the <HI>Twentieth</HI> for the Subsistance of those that own it, I do not think, in that Case the People were <HI>obliged in Conscience</HI> to pay it, and might in such Case <HI>Lawfully</HI> resist those Officers, that should come to <HI>levy</HI> it by <HI>force.</HI></P>

<P>I could have argued farther against what you have now said, con∣cerning this <HI>Right</HI> of the People of <HI>resisting,</HI> in case of extravagant, or <HI>into∣lerable Taxes</HI>; but since it is not to the Subject in hand, I shall refer it to ano∣ther time: And therefore to return where I left off; I shall in the <HI>next place</HI> shew you, how sacred, and <HI>irresistible</HI> the <HI>Persons,</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> of Kings were under the <HI>Iewish</HI> Government; and there cannot be a <HI>plainer Example</HI> of this, than in the Case of <HI>David.</HI> He was himself <HI>anointed</HI> to be King, af∣ter <HI>Sauls</HI> death, but in the mean time, he was grievously persecuted by <HI>Saul,</HI> who pursued him from one place to another with a design to <HI>take away</HI> his Life: How now doth <HI>David</HI> behave himself in this <HI>Extremity</HI>? What Course doth he take to <HI>secure</HI> himself from <HI>Saul</HI>? Why he takes the <HI>only Course</HI> that is left to a Subject;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C.

<PB N="199" REF="108"/>
and when he found he was <HI>discovered</HI> in one place, he <HI>removes</HI> to another; He kept Spies upon <HI>Saul</HI> to observe his Motions, not that he might meet him <HI>to give him Bat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le,</HI> or to take him at an Advantage, but that he might keep <HI>out of his way,</HI> and not fall unawares into his hands.</P>
<P>Well, but this was no thanks to <HI>David,</HI> (you'll say) because he could not do otherwise. He was <HI>too weak</HI> for <HI>Saul,</HI> and not able to stand against him; and therefore had no other Remedy but <HI>flight.</HI> But yet we must consider that <HI>David</HI> was a Man of War, he slew <HI>Goliah,</HI> and fought the <HI>Battles of</HI> Is∣rael with great success; he was an admired, and <HI>beloved Captain,</HI> which made <HI>Saul</HI> so Jealous of him; the Eyes of <HI>Israel</HI> were upon him for their next King, and how easily might he have raised a Potent, and <HI>formidable Rebellion</HI> against <HI>Saul</HI>? But he was so far from this, that he <HI>invites</HI> no Man to his <HI>Assistance</HI>; and when some came uninvited he made no use of them in an <HI>Offensive,</HI> or <HI>Defensive</HI> War against <HI>Saul:</HI> Nay, when God delivered <HI>Saul</HI> twice into <HI>David's</HI> hands; that he could as easily have killed him as have, <HI>Cut off the Skirts of his Garment at</HI> Engedi,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 24.—26.</NOTE> or, as have taken <HI>That Spear away, which stuck on the Ground as his Bolster,</HI> as he did in the Hill of <HI>Hachil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI> yet he would neither touch <HI>Saul</HI> him∣self, nor suffer any of the People that were with him to do it, tho' they were very <HI>importunate</HI> with him to let them kill <HI>Saul</HI>; nay, tho' they urged him with an Argument from <HI>Providence,</HI> that it was a <HI>plain Evi∣dence,</HI> that it was the Will of God that he should kill him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">—24.4.—26.8.</NOTE> <HI>Because God had now delivered his Enemy into his Hands,</HI> accor∣ding to the Promise he had made to <HI>David</HI>; we know what use some Men have made of this Argument of <HI>Providence</HI> to ju∣stifie all the Villanies they had a Mind to act:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> p. 30.</NOTE> But <HI>David,</HI> it seems, did not think, that an opportunity of doing evil, gave him a License; and Authority to do it. <HI>Opportunity,</HI> we say, makes a <HI>Thief,</HI> and it makes a <HI>Rebel,</HI> and a <HI>Murderer</HI> too. No man can do any wickedness which he has no opportunity of doing; and if the <HI>Providence</HI> of God, which puts such oppor∣tunities into Mens hands, might <HI>justifie</HI> the wickedness they commit, no Man can be <HI>chargeable</HI> with any Guilt whatever he does; and certainly <HI>Opportunity</HI> will as soon justifie any <HI>other Sin,</HI> as <HI>Rebellion,</HI> and the Murder of Princes. We are to learn our Duty from the <HI>Law</HI> of God, not from his <HI>Providence:</HI> At least this must be a settled Principle, that the <HI>Providence</HI> of God will never justifie any Action which his <HI>Law</HI> forbids.</P>
<P>And therefore, notwithstanding this Opportunity which God has put into his hands to destroy his Enemy, and to take the Crown for his Reward, <HI>Da∣vid</HI> considers his Duty, remembers, that tho' <HI>Saul</HI> were his Enemy, and that very unjustly; yet he was still the Lords anointed. <HI>The Lord forbid,</HI> says he, <HI>That I should do this unto my Master, the Lords anointed, to stretch forth any Hand against him,</HI> seeing he is the <HI>Lords anointed.</HI> Nay, he was so far from <HI>taking away his Life,</HI> that his Heart smote him for <HI>cutting off the Skirt of his Garment.</HI> And we ought to observe the Reason <HI>David</HI> gives, why he durst not hurt <HI>Saul,</HI> because he was the <HI>Lords anointed,</HI> which is the very Reason the Apostle gives in the <HI>Romans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13.1, 2.</NOTE> because <HI>the Powers that are, are ordained of God; and he that resisteth the Power, resisteth the Or∣dinance of God.</HI> For to be <HI>anointed</HI> of God signifies no more than that he was made King or ordained by <HI>God.</HI> For this <HI>external Unction</HI> was only a <HI>Visible
<PB N="200" REF="109"/>
Sign</HI> of Gods <HI>Designation</HI> of them, to such an Office; And it is certain, they were as much <HI>Gods</HI> Anointed <HI>without</HI> this Visible Unction <HI>as with</HI> it. <HI>Cyrus</HI> is called <HI>Gods Anointed,</HI> tho' he never was Anointed by any Prophet, but only <HI>designed</HI> for his Kingdom by Prophecy;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isa.</HI> 45.1.</NOTE> And we never read in <HI>Scripture,</HI> that any Kings had this <HI>external Vnction,</HI> who succee∣ded in the Kingdom by <HI>Right of Inheritance,</HI> unless the <HI>Title</HI> and <HI>succession</HI> were <HI>doubt∣ful</HI>; and yet they were the <HI>Lords Anointed</HI> too, that is, were plac'd in the Throne by him.

<P>I am so far from differing with you in what you have said concerning this Example of <HI>David</HI> towards <HI>Saul,</HI> tho' his Enemy, that I think it ought to be a <HI>Pattern</HI> to every single <HI>Private Man,</HI> tho never so great, in a Kingdom or Common-Wealth, how to comport himself towards the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> if he himself alone be unjustly persecuted by them either in his Life, or Estate, that is, <HI>to fly</HI> if he can, tho' with the loss of all his Estate, rather than <HI>resist,</HI> tho' there are some Circumstances in this Story of <HI>David</HI> that make it evident that he did not think a <HI>Defensive War</HI> against those Cut-throats that <HI>Saul</HI> might send to Kill him unlawful,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sect.</HI> 2.</NOTE> and so much Dr. <HI>Fearn himself,</HI> in his first Discourse call'd <HI>resolving of Conscience,</HI> &amp;c. against <HI>Resistance of the Higher Powers</HI> acknowledges: For <HI>David</HI> when he fled from <HI>Saul,</HI> made himself Captain of four hundred Men, which number soon encreased to six hundred;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 22.2.23.13. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12.1.</NOTE> And still every day grew more by Additions. Now why should he entertain those Men, but to <HI>defend</HI> himself against the Forces of <HI>Saul?</HI> that is, to make a <HI>De∣fensive War</HI> when ever he was assaulted by him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I can give you a sufficient answer to this, and therefore you must observe that <HI>David</HI> invited none of these Men in to him; but they came as <HI>Volunteers</HI> after a Beloved Captain,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. R. p.</HI> 32.</NOTE> and <HI>Gene∣ral</HI>; which shews how formidable he could easily have made himself, when such Numbers resorted to him of their own Ac∣cord.</P>
<P>When he had them he never used them for any <HI>Hostile Acts</HI> against <HI>Saul,</HI> or any of his Forces; he never <HI>stood his Ground</HI> when he heard <HI>Saul</HI> was coming, but always <HI>fled,</HI> and his Men with him; Men who never were us'd to fly, and were very ready to have served him against <HI>Saul</HI> himself, would he have per∣mitted them: And I suppose you will not call it a <HI>defensive War,</HI> to <HI>fly</HI> before an Enemy, and to hide themselves in Caves, and Mountains; and yet this was the <HI>only defensive</HI> War which <HI>David</HI> made with all his Men about him: nay, all that he would make, and all that he could make according to his <HI>Professed Principles</HI>; that it <HI>was not Lawful to stretch out his hand against the Lords Anoint∣ed.</HI> And when these Men are pursued, as <HI>David</HI> was, by an enraged and Jea∣lous Prince, I will not charge them of <HI>Rebellion,</HI> tho' they <HI>fly</HI> before him by thousands in a Company.</P>
<P>Yet there was sufficient Reason why <HI>David</HI> should entertain these Men who voluntarily resorted to him, tho' he never intended to use them against <HI>Saul:</HI> for some of them served for <HI>Spies</HI> to watch <HI>Sauls</HI> Motions, that he might not be <HI>surprised</HI> by him, but have timely notice to make his <HI>Escape.</HI> And the very presence of such a number of Men about him, without any <HI>Hostile Act,</HI> pre∣served
<PB N="201" REF="109"/>
him from being seiz'd on by some <HI>Officious Persons,</HI> who otherwise might have delivered him into <HI>Sauls</HI> hands. And he being Anointed by <HI>Samuel</HI> to be King after <HI>Sauls</HI> Death this was the <HI>first step</HI> to his Kingdom, to have such a <HI>Retinue</HI> of Valiant Men about him; which made his <HI>Advancement</HI> to the <HI>Throne</HI> more easie, and discouraged any <HI>Oppositions,</HI> which might otherwise have been made against him; as we see it proved in the event, and have reason to be∣lieve that it was thus ordered by God for that very End. It is certain that <HI>Gad</HI> the Prophet▪ and <HI>Abiathar</HI> the Priest, who was the only Man, who escaped the Fury of <HI>Saul</HI> when he destroyed the Priests of the Lord, were in <HI>David<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Retinue,</HI> and that <HI>David</HI> enterpriz'd nothing, without first asking Counsel of God: But he who had Anointed him to be King, now draws Forces after him, which after <HI>Saul's</HI> Death should facilitate his Advancement to the Kingdom.</P>

<P>I cannot think your Answer to this Objection satisfactory, for first it is evident, that when <HI>David</HI> was at the Cave of <HI>Adullam,</HI> his Brethren,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22.1.</NOTE> and all his Fathers House, as soon as they heard it, went down thither to him, and tho' it be not expresly said, that he sent for any to come to his <HI>Assistance,</HI> yet it is plain he refused none that came, and to what purpose should he make use of so many as 400, or 600 Men, unless it were to <HI>defend</HI> himself against those Men, that <HI>Saul</HI> might send against him? since half a score, or twenty Persons had been enough to have served for <HI>Spies,</HI> and if he had thought himself obliged only to <HI>run away</HI>▪ three or four Servants had been enough in conscience to have Waired on him in any Neighbouring Country; but that <HI>David</HI> thought it <HI>no Sin</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> him∣self from the Violence of those which <HI>Saul</HI> should send to Kill him, is plain from what he says to <HI>Abiathar</HI> upon his flight unto him after the Death of his Father:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22. <HI>v.</HI> 23.</NOTE> <HI>Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my Life, seeketh thy Life, but with me thou shalt be in safe∣guard</HI>; And if <HI>David</HI> had not meant by these Words to have <HI>defended Abiathar's</HI> as well as his <HI>own Life,</HI> if assaulted, and with∣out a Possibility of <HI>escaping,</HI> it had been very cold comfort, for <HI>David</HI> to have only assur'd him that he should be in <HI>safe-guard</HI> with him, till the <HI>first assault</HI> that should be made upon them, but that then he should <HI>shift</HI> for himself; for as for his own part he would rather permit his <HI>Throat</HI> to be cut by the <HI>Kings Officers</HI> or Souldiers, than <HI>resist</HI> them.</P>
<P>And therefore, tho' I own that it was not Lawful for him <HI>to stretch out his hand against the Lords Anointed: Since I do</HI> not allow any <HI>Private Subject</HI> to Kill, even <HI>Tyrants,</HI> unless a in State of <HI>actual War,</HI> or Battle, wherein they are <HI>Aggressors</HI>; nor then neither, if it can possibly be avoided: Yet do I not find it at all <HI>unlaw∣ful</HI> for <HI>David,</HI> or any other <HI>private Man,</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> his own Life, against such <HI>Assassinates</HI> as his Prince may send against him: So it may be done without a <HI>Civil War,</HI> or endangering the <HI>Peace</HI> of the <HI>Common-Wealth</HI>; And so much you your self, tho' Coldly, seem to yield, when you say, that the very Presence of such a number of Men about <HI>David,</HI> without any <HI>Hostile Act,</HI> preserved him from being seiz'd on by some <HI>Officious Persons,</HI> who otherwise might have <HI>deli∣vered</HI> him into <HI>Sauls</HI> Hands: For I cannot think that <HI>David</HI> would have been at the trouble of keeping so many Men only for <HI>shew,</HI> and a <HI>Terrour</HI> to those <HI>Officious Persons</HI> you mention, without <HI>resisting</HI> of them if there had been oc∣casion.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="110"/>And tho' you tell me that his being <HI>Anointed</HI> by <HI>Samuel</HI> to be King after <HI>Sauls</HI> Death, was the first step to the Kingdom, to have such a Retinue of Valiant Men about him; which made his <HI>Advancement</HI> to tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>punc; Throne so much the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aster,</HI> and discouraged any <HI>Opposition</HI> which might have been made against him, and that we see it proved so in the Event; and therefore have Reason to believe, that it was thus ordered by God to that very End, I must take the Liberty so far to differ from you.</P>
<P>For first, I desire to know by what Authority <HI>David</HI> could <HI>List</HI> 600, or 700 Men in Arms in <HI>Sauls</HI> Territories▪ and whether, according to your Doctrine, they were not <HI>Rebels</HI> for <HI>joyning</HI> themselves with one who was declared a <HI>Tray∣tor</HI> by the King? And tho' you say it was thus ordered by God. I grant indeed it was, yet doth it not appear, that it was done by any <HI>Divine Revelation</HI> to <HI>Na∣than,</HI> or <HI>Abiathar,</HI> but only by the <HI>Ordinary Course</HI> of his Providence, like other things in the World; and therefore it is no fair way of <HI>Arguing</HI> for you, to affirm, that what ever <HI>David</HI> did in the matter of his own <HI>Defence,</HI> contrary to your Principles, he must needs do it by <HI>express order</HI> from God, of which the <HI>Scripture</HI> is wholy silent, much less doth it appear from the Story▪ that these Men, whom <HI>David</HI> kept with him, were only to <HI>facilitate</HI> his attaining the Kingdom (as you affirm,) since the <HI>Scripture</HI> mentions no such thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.4.</NOTE> only that after <HI>Saul's</HI> Death he went up by Gods Command to <HI>Hehron</HI> with the Men that were with him, and thither the Men of <HI>Iudah came, and there they Anointed</HI> David <HI>King over the House of</HI> Judah; but 'tis no where mention'd, that these Men were of any use, to <HI>David</HI> for the Obtaining of the Crown, since the <HI>Tribe of Iudah</HI> would have made him King, tho' these Men had not been with him, for what could 600, or 1000 Men do against so vast a Multitude as the <HI>whole Tribe</HI> of <HI>Iudah</HI>? And therefore it is evident, that these Forces were for <HI>no other End</HI> than his <HI>own defence.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' you make very light of this <HI>State of War,</HI> in which <HI>David</HI> was, in relation to <HI>Saul</HI>; yet pray tell me, supposing that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had really been (as he Pretended,) the <HI>Legitimate Son</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. but by some <HI>Particular Disgust</HI> of his Father, or by the <HI>Intrigues</HI> of his Competitor, the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> had been forc'd to fly into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to have <HI>defended</HI> himself with 1000, or 1500 of his Tenants, and follow∣ers, tho' without <HI>Fighting</HI> the Kings Forces that should have been se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> against him, but <HI>flying</HI> into the <HI>High-lands,</HI> and had there maintain'd himself, as <HI>David</HI> did by <HI>Free Quarters,</HI> or <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ribu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion</HI> of the Inhabitants; till his Father dyed, would not this have been <HI>cryed out upon in all the Pulpits in</HI> England, as a most <HI>Horrid Rebellion,</HI> of a <HI>Son</HI> and a <HI>Subject</HI> against his <HI>King,</HI> and <HI>Father</HI>; tho' he had never done any <HI>Act of Hostility</HI> against his Forces, but always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from them? And yet he, being <HI>Heir Apparent</HI> to the Crown might have <HI>plead∣ed</HI> as well as <HI>David,</HI> that he kept these <HI>Soldiers</HI> about him, only to keep him∣self from being <HI>Murdered</HI> by those <HI>Officious Persons,</HI> whom his Father, or Uncle might send to <HI>apprehend</HI> him, and to have such a <HI>Retinue</HI> of Valiant Men about him, as might render his advancement to the Throne more easie when ever his Father should dye.</P>
<P>I shall not urge, as a farther proof of the <HI>Lawfulness</HI> of <HI>Davids Resistance</HI> of <HI>Sauls</HI> Forces, his Intention to have slay'd in <HI>Keilah,</HI> and to have <HI>fortified</HI> it against <HI>Saul,</HI> had not he been informed, that the Men of that City <HI>would have saved themselves by delivering him up to Saul</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.</NOTE>
<PB N="203" REF="110"/>
Since I confess it doth not certainly appear by the Text, whether <HI>David</HI> would have stayed any longer there than till <HI>Saul</HI> had approach'd near to that place; whether the <HI>Keilites</HI> would have delivered him up, or not; much less shall I urge, that other example which some Men make use of, of <HI>Davids</HI> going to the <HI>last Battle</HI> against <HI>Saul</HI> with <HI>Achish,</HI> King of the <HI>Philistines</HI>; For tho' it be plain he march'd with them, as far as <HI>Apbek</HI> in the <HI>Tribe</HI> of <HI>Is∣sachar,</HI> yet I confess it is not certain, whether he <HI>really intended</HI> to have <HI>assisted</HI> them, or not, in this <HI>War</HI> against his Country, since he might either have <HI>gone over</HI> to <HI>Saul</HI> at the beginning of the <HI>Battle</HI>▪ or else have stood <HI>neuter</HI>; tho' nei∣ther of them would have been <HI>very Honourable</HI>; or Consonant with <HI>Davids</HI> Character, therefore I shall say nothing of this; since the Lords of the <HI>Philistines,</HI> for fear he should prove <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> adversary to them in the Battle, made him retire again into the Land of the</HI> Philistines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 29.3, 4.8.</NOTE> <HI>tho' he seemed</HI> to be very much troubled to be so <HI>distrusted,</HI> that he might not <HI>fight</HI> against the <HI>Enemies of that</HI> King, who had so good an Opi∣nion of him; And therefore I pray will you proceed to those other Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mples you have to produce out of the <HI>Old Testament.</HI></P>

<P>Well, since you are not fully satisfied with this Instance of <HI>David,</HI> (tho' I am glad you allow the <HI>Persons</HI> even of <HI>Tyrannical Princes</HI> to be <HI>Sacred</HI>) therefore to proceed in the story; <HI>Solomon,</HI> who succeeded <HI>David</HI> in his Kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. R. p.</HI> 37, 38.</NOTE> did all those things which God had expresly forbid the King to do. He sent into <HI>Egypt</HI> for Horses. He <HI>multiplied</HI> Wives, and loved many <HI>strange Women,</HI> (together with the Daugh∣ter of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>) VVomen of the <HI>Moabites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Kings</HI> 11.1.10.27.</NOTE> <HI>Ammonites,</HI> &amp;c. He Multiplied Silver, and Gold. For this God (<HI>who is the only Iudge of Soveraign Princes</HI>) was very angry with him, and threa∣tens to <HI>rend</HI> the Kingdom from him; which was afterwards <HI>accomplish'd</HI> in the Days of <HI>Rehoboam</HI>: but yet this did not give <HI>Authority</HI> to his <HI>Subjects</HI> to <HI>Rebel.</HI> If to be under the <HI>Direction,</HI> and <HI>Obligation</HI> of <HI>Laws,</HI> makes a <HI>Limited Monarchy,</HI> it is certain the Kingdom of <HI>Israel</HI> was so. There were <HI>some things</HI> which the King was <HI>expresly forbid</HI> to do, as you have already heard; and the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> was to be the <HI>Rule</HI> of his <HI>Government,</HI> the <HI>standing Law</HI> of his Kingdom. And therefore he was Com∣manded, when he came to the Throne <HI>to write a Copy of the Law with his own hand,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut.</HI> 17. <HI>v.</HI> 18, 19, 20.</NOTE> <HI>and to read in it all his Days, that he might learn to fear the Lord his God, and to keep all the Words of this Law, and these Statutes to do them,</HI> and yet being a <HI>Soveraign Prince</HI>; if he <HI>broke</HI> these Laws, God was his <HI>Iudge,</HI> and <HI>Avenger</HI>; but he was <HI>accountable</HI> to no <HI>earthly Tribunal</HI>; nor do we find, tho' there were so many <HI>wicked,</HI> and <HI>Idolatrous</HI> Kings of <HI>Iudah,</HI> who <HI>broke</HI> all the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>God</HI> given them by <HI>Moses</HI> that ever any of the <HI>Priests,</HI> or <HI>Pro∣phets</HI> stirred up the People to <HI>Rebel</HI> against them for it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither of these Instances do reach the Case in hand; For I grant that neither the <HI>Breach,</HI> or <HI>non-observance</HI> of these Precepts enjoyned the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> by God; Nor yet their <HI>open Idolatry</HI> were a <HI>sufficient Cause,</HI> for their <HI>taking up Arms,</HI> or <HI>resisting</HI> their Kings in so doing▪ since those were <HI>offences</HI> only against <HI>God,</HI> and in which the <HI>People</HI> had nothing to do, those being no part of that <HI>Tacit,</HI> or <HI>implicit Com∣pact</HI> of <HI>Protection,</HI> and <HI>Preservation,</HI> that goeth along with all Kingdoms and <HI>Supream Powers</HI> whatsoever. And I have already excepted out of the Causes of <HI>Resistance,</HI> or <HI>taking up Arms,</HI> the <HI>Princes</HI> being of a <HI>different Religion</HI> from that of his <HI>Subject</HI>;
<PB N="204" REF="111"/>
And tho' I must own, that the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> were under the direction or <HI>Obligation</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> and so were <HI>limited Monarchs,</HI> yet this <HI>limitation</HI> was <HI>not</HI> from the <HI>People,</HI> but from <HI>God,</HI> whose business it was to revenge the <HI>breach</HI> of it as often as they <HI>offended,</HI> and if they <HI>broke</HI> those <HI>Laws,</HI> God only was their Judge, and Aveng∣er (as you your self very well observe) who never failed severely to punish this breach of his Laws.</P>
<P>Nor yet were the People of the <HI>Iews</HI> always so nice and temperate as you make them; For (besides the example of <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> which I have formerly made use of, you will find in the 2d. of <HI>Chronicles</HI> concerning <HI>Amaziah,</HI> who when he turned away from following the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 25. <HI>v.</HI> 27.</NOTE> <HI>They (viz. the People) made a Conspiracy against him in</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and he fled to</HI> La∣chish <HI>but they sent to</HI> Lachish <HI>after him, and slew him there</HI>: and made his Son <HI>Vzziah</HI> King in his stead; nor do we read that any were punish'd for killing him, as <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ziab</HI> put to Death the Servants of his Father King <HI>Ioash,</HI> for conspiring against him, as it is related in the 10th. <HI>Chap.</HI> of the 2d. of <HI>Kings,</HI> and you'l find in the same <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 21.10.</NOTE> Book that the City of <HI>Libna</HI> revolted (which sure is the <HI>highest</HI> degree of <HI>Resistance</HI>) from that wicked King <HI>Iehoram,</HI> who had slain all his Brethren with the Sword,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>v.</HI> 4.6.</NOTE> and walked in the way of the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> as did the house of <HI>Ahab,</HI> and wrought that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, &amp;c. And therefore it is said expresly in the Text, <HI>that the City of</HI> Libna <HI>revolted from his hand,</HI> because he had forsaken the God of his Fathers. I bring not these Instances to <HI>Iustifie Rebellion,</HI> but to let you see that it was sometimes practised, amongst the <HI>Iews,</HI> tho' you affirm to the contrary.</P>
<P>But much more lawful was the <HI>Resistance,</HI> which <HI>Azariah,</HI> and the 80 Priests,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26.</NOTE> that were with him, made against King <HI>Vzziah,</HI> when he would have burnt Incense in the Temple: pray turn with me to the Place, and read what is there said, <HI>And they (viz. the Priests with∣stood</HI> Uzziah <HI>the King, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee,</HI> Uzziah,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>ver.</HI> 18.</NOTE> <HI>to burn incense unto the Lord, but to the Priests the Sons of</HI> Aa∣ron, <HI>that are consecrated to burn Incense: go out of the Sanctuary, for thou hast trespassed, neither shall it be for thine Honour,</HI> &amp;c. And when he persisted therein, and took the <HI>Censer</HI> in his hand to Burn <HI>Incense,</HI> and that thereupon the <HI>Leprosy</HI> arose in his Forehead▪ the Priests thrust him out of the Temple, The <HI>LXX.</HI> render it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide St.</HI> Chry∣sost. <HI>Ecloga at Imperio, &amp; Pote∣state,</HI> where you'l find that he both owns &amp; justifies this Resistance in the <HI>High-Priest.</HI></NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. <HI>they resisted</HI> him; <HI>Iosephus</HI> says, they drove him out in haste, so that you see they went somewhat farther than <HI>Solomons</HI> Question, <HI>Who may say to a King what doest thou</HI>? And, which is more remarkable, they <HI>with∣stood</HI> him before the <HI>Leprosy</HI> rose upon his Forehead, and no doubt but they would have done the same to him, whether that Judg∣ment had happened, or not, since he went about to <HI>Vsurp</HI> the <HI>Priests Office,</HI> it not being so much as <HI>Lawful</HI> for him, that was no Priest to set his foot within the Temple.</P>
<P>But if you look into the History of the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> after their Division from <HI>Iudah,</HI> they are so far from teaching us these <HI>Lessons</HI> of <HI>Passive Obedi∣ence,</HI> and <HI>Non-resistance,</HI> that you will scarce find any other manner of <HI>Succession</HI> a∣mongst them, but the <HI>Killing</HI> of <HI>one King,</HI> and the <HI>setting</HI> up <HI>another,</HI> and <HI>Iehu</HI> for <HI>Rebelling</HI> against and destroying the house of <HI>Ahab,</HI> had the Crown <HI>entailed</HI> by <HI>Gods Promise</HI> to his <HI>Posterity</HI> unto the <HI>fourth Generation.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Kings</HI> 10.30.</NOTE> And
<PB N="205" REF="111"/>
tho' I do not produce any of these Examples as fit for our Imitation at this day, (since what <HI>Iehu</HI> did was done by Gods <HI>express Warrant</HI> and Command) yet I think they are <HI>sufficient Evidences,</HI> that neither the <HI>Person,</HI> or <HI>Power</HI> of the Kings of <HI>Iudah,</HI> or <HI>Israel</HI> were always look'd upon as <HI>so Sacred,</HI> and <HI>Irresistible</HI> by their <HI>Subjects,</HI> as you suppose.</P>

<P>I so far agree with you, and I do by no means allow that <HI>particular Private Men,</HI> of what condition soever they are, should <HI>disturb</HI> the <HI>Common Wealth,</HI> and <HI>Murder</HI> their <HI>Lawful Princes,</HI> tho' wicked, or Idolatrous, only to satisfy their own <HI>private Zeal</HI> or Ambition and to set up themselves, who perhaps are altogether as <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> or <HI>worse</HI> than him they <HI>depose,</HI> or make away.

thou hast walked in the way of</HI> Jeroboam, <HI>and hast made my People</HI> Israel <HI>to Sin, to provoke me to anger by their Sins: And therefore the</HI> Text concludes this Narration <HI>with there words, that the Word of the Lord came against</HI> Baasha <HI>and against his House, even for all the Evil which he did in the sight of the Lord in provoking him to anger with the work of his Hands in being like the Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of</HI> Jeroboam, but the words which immediately follow, <HI>and because he killed him</HI> (i. e. <HI>Ieroboam</HI>) cannot be truly ren∣dred in our <HI>English Translation,</HI> for the Reason already given, and therefore the best <HI>Criticks</HI> upon this place <HI>Translate</HI> it thus, leaving out, <HI>and</HI> therefore <HI>He</HI> (viz. the Lord) smote him: (i. e. <HI>Nadab</HI>) by the hand of <HI>Baasha</HI>) Where∣as our Translation makes the Scripture to contradict it self.

<P>Well, I think I can make it much more plain, from other Examples and Precepts out of Scripture, that the <HI>Iews</HI> were not only un∣der high Obligations to be <HI>Subject</HI> to the <HI>Higher Powers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S.

<P>King <HI>Ahasuerus</HI> upon the suggestions of <HI>Haman,</HI> had granted a <HI>Decree</HI> for the <HI>Destruction</HI> of the <HI>whole People</HI> of the <HI>Iews</HI>; which was sent into <HI>all the Pro∣vinces,</HI> Written, and Seal'd with the Kings Ring; This <HI>Decree</HI> could <HI>never</HI> be <HI>reversed</HI> again; for that was <HI>contrary</HI> to the Laws of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians.</HI> And therefore when <HI>Esther</HI> had found <HI>Favour</HI> with the King, all that could be done for the <HI>Iews,</HI> was, to grant <HI>another Decree</HI> for them to <HI>defend</HI> themselves; which accordingly was done, and the effect of it was, <HI>That the</HI> Jews <HI>at</HI> Shusan <HI>slew</HI> 300 <HI>Men and the</HI> Jews <HI>of the other Provinces slew</HI> 75000 <HI>and rested from their Enemies:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Esther</HI> 6.15.16, 17.</NOTE> Without this Decree, <HI>Mordecai</HI> did not think it <HI>Lawful</HI> to <HI>resist</HI> (which yet was a <HI>Case</HI> of as great extremity, and <HI>Barbarous Cruelty</HI> as could ever happen) which made him put <HI>Esther</HI> upon so hazardous an Attempt, as to <HI>venture</HI> into the Kings <HI>Presence,</HI> without being called, which was <HI>Death</HI> by their <HI>Law,</HI> unless the King should graciously hold out the <HI>Golden Scepter</HI> to them;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Esther</HI> 4. 11.</NOTE> yet when they had obtained this <HI>Decree,</HI> they were able to <HI>defend</HI> themselves and to <HI>destroy</HI> their Enemies; which is as famous an Example of <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> as can be met with in any History.</P>

<P>Tho' this last proof be the stongest you have yet brought, yet I think it will not reach the <HI>Point in Question,</HI> to prove, that <HI>no Resistance what∣soever, tho' for saving the Lives of a whole Nation, can be Lawful:</HI> I grant indeed that the Command of the Prophet <HI>Ieremiah, of Praying for the Peace of the City whither they were carried away Captives, was to be obeyed, being obliged</HI> to do it, not only by the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> and in Regard of those <HI>Benefits</HI> of <HI>Protection,</HI> and injoying the <HI>Free exercise</HI> of their Religion, and Liberties without being made <HI>Slaves,</HI> tho' they had been carryed <HI>Captives</HI>; which was no more than removing them out of one Country, and setling them in another, according to the Custom of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Princes of those times, when they would by removing of the <HI>best,</HI> and <HI>greatest</HI> of the People out of a <HI>Conquered Countrey</HI> pre∣vent their <HI>Rebelling</HI> against them, as they had done before, but that they enjoyed a Property in their Lands, and Estates after their Captivity, is certain <HI>by the Prophets</HI> commanding them, to <HI>Build and Plant Vineyards</HI> in the Coun∣try of <HI>Babylon</HI> during the 70 years Captivity foretold by him from God. So like∣wise I grant it to be a <HI>necessary</HI> Duty in <HI>Subjects,</HI> tho' strangers, to be <HI>Faithful,</HI> and <HI>Obedient</HI> to those Princes and States under whose Governments they live; and therefore <HI>Mordecai</HI> no doubt performed his Duty, when he discovered the <HI>Treason</HI> of the Kings Chamberlains that thought to kill him.</P>
<P>But to come to your <HI>main Argument,</HI> that it was <HI>unlawful</HI> for the whole Nation of the <HI>Iews</HI> to <HI>resist</HI> those, who were impowered by the <HI>Decree</HI> of King <HI>Ahasuer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> to Massacre and Destroy them, I shall not dispute with you about the Matter of Fact, as you have related it, but only in this par∣ticular,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Esther</HI> 8.11.</NOTE> that whereas you suppose till the King had Issued out a <HI>second Decree,</HI> wherein he granted the <HI>Iews which were in every City to gather themselves together, and to stand for their Lives, to destroy, to slay, and Cause to Perish all the Power of the People, and Province that should assault them,</HI> &amp;c. and to take the spoil of them for a Prey; without which Decree you suppose, <HI>Mordecai did not think it Lawful to resist, tho' it was a Case of as great extremity, as</HI> could ever happen, and that therefore <HI>Esther</HI> was put upon so <HI>Hazardous</HI> an <HI>Attempt</HI> as to venture to <HI>Obtain</HI> this <HI>Decree,</HI> tho' with the Peril of her Life: but that when they had once <HI>obtained</HI> it, they were then, and not before <HI>enabled</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> themselves, and destroy their Enemies. In answer to which, I must needs tell you that, you do not fairly represent the <HI>latter part</HI> of this story; for it no where appears in the Text, (tho' you are pleased to add it,) that <HI>Mordecai</HI> did not think it <HI>Lawful</HI> for the <HI>Iews</HI> to <HI>resist,</HI> till this <HI>Decree</HI> was obtai∣ned; for it is only there said, <HI>That he sent</HI> Esther <HI>to the King, and as soon as she came into his presence, she fell down at his feet, and besought him with Tears to put away the Mischief of</HI> Haman <HI>the</HI> Agagite.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Esther.</HI> 8.5.</NOTE> (Pray read the words) <HI>And she said, If it pleases the King, and if I have found
<PB N="208" REF="113"/>
favour in his fight, and the thing seems right before the King, and I be pleasing in his Eyes let it be written to reverse the Letters devised by</HI> Haman, <HI>the Son of</HI> Hamme∣datha <HI>the</HI> Agagite, <HI>which he wrote to destroy the</HI> Jews <HI>which are in all the Kings Pro∣vinces.</HI> By which you may see that <HI>Esthers</HI> Request was not for a <HI>Liberty</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> themselves, (as you suppose) but only to try if she could get the King to <HI>reverse</HI> the <HI>first decree,</HI> obtained by <HI>Haman</HI> to destroy them; but be∣cause the <HI>Kings Decree,</HI> when once Issued out was <HI>not</HI> to be <HI>reversed,</HI> therefore, He Issued this <HI>second Decree,</HI> to give the <HI>Iews</HI> a <HI>Legal</HI> or <HI>Civil Power,</HI> to gather themselves together, and stand upon their <HI>defence</HI> against all that should assault them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 9.3.</NOTE> which was so far obeyed, that the Rulers of the Provinces, and other Officers of the King, instead of destroying, helped the <HI>Iews, because</HI> (says the Text) <HI>the fear of</HI> Mordecai <HI>fell upon them.</HI></P>
<P>So that, tho' I own this <HI>Decree,</HI> gave them a <HI>Legal Power</HI> to stand upon their <HI>defence,</HI> and did likewise hinder the Kings <HI>Officers</HI> from Heading the <HI>People,</HI> and putting the <HI>first Decree</HI> for their <HI>Destruction</HI> in Execution, as otherwise they would have done, had it not been for this <HI>last,</HI> and for that <HI>great Power</HI> which they perceived <HI>Mordecai</HI> had at Court; yet doth it not therefore follow, that it was before that, absolutely <HI>unlawful</HI> for the <HI>whole Iewish Nation</HI> to have <HI>de∣fended</HI> their Lives against those Officers, or others who would have gone about to destroy them, and have <HI>totally extirpated</HI> their Nation. So that I take this <HI>Decree</HI> not to confer any <HI>new Right</HI> in the People of the <HI>Iews</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> them∣selves, but only to be a <HI>Confirmation</HI> of that <HI>Natural Right</HI> of <HI>self-defence,</HI> which <HI>all Nations,</HI> and every <HI>particular Member</HI> of Mankind have to <HI>preserve</HI> themselves And tho' I grant that <HI>Particular Persons</HI> are often obliged to <HI>give up</HI> this Right for the <HI>Publick Peace,</HI> and safety of the Common-Wealth, yet doth not <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Law</HI> extend to <HI>whole Nations,</HI> or such <HI>Bodies of People,</HI> without which the <HI>Common Wealth</HI> cannot well subsist.</P>
<P>And therefore I leave it to any unprejudiced person to judge, whether it had not been better, that the <HI>Iews</HI> should have thus <HI>resisted,</HI> and saved their Lives, tho' without this <HI>second Decree,</HI> which only discouraged the Kings Officers, and others from falling upon them, than that all Gods <HI>Peculiar People</HI> should have lain at the Mercy of their Enemies, to be <HI>destroyed</HI> according to the <HI>first Cruel Decree.</HI></P>
<P>But farther to convince you, that the <HI>Iews,</HI> after the <HI>Captivity,</HI> did not think it <HI>unlawful</HI> to make use of <HI>defensive Arms</HI> against cruel, and <HI>persecuting Ty∣rants,</HI> who went about to destroy their Religion, and Nation, it is apparent from the Famous Example of the Priest <HI>Mattathias,</HI> with <HI>Iudas Maccabeus,</HI> and the rest of his Sons, who successively <HI>Headed</HI> the People of the <HI>Iews</HI> in that obstinate, and <HI>Noble Resistance,</HI> which they made against <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes,</HI> tho' then their <HI>Soveraign,</HI> who when he had Prophaned the Temple, and would have <HI>forced</HI> the <HI>Iews</HI> to <HI>renounce</HI> their <HI>Circumcision,</HI> and to have <HI>Sacrifi∣ced</HI> to <HI>Idols,</HI> under Pain of <HI>Death,</HI> they joyned together, and resolved to <HI>de∣fend</HI> themselves, and to stand up for their <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Nation,</HI> then ready to be destroyed; And you find by the History, as it is related in the Books of the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> and <HI>Iosephus,</HI> that God did <HI>Bless those</HI> Arms with <HI>Success,</HI> which they had taken up in their <HI>own defence,</HI> against a Prince <HI>infinitely more Powerful</HI> than themselves, who with his <HI>Predecessors</HI> had been their <HI>Soveraigns</HI> for above 130 years; And tho' <HI>Antiochus</HI> died long before the <HI>End</HI> of the <HI>War,</HI> yet did
<PB N="209" REF="113"/>
they still <HI>prosecute</HI> it against his <HI>Successors</HI>; Nor did they ever make <HI>Peace</HI> with them till <HI>Ionathan,</HI> Brother of <HI>Iudas</HI> (who had before recovered and purifi∣ed the Temple) was acknowledged <HI>High-Priest,</HI> by <HI>Alexander,</HI> the pretended Son of <HI>Epiphanes,</HI> and that they had cast off that <HI>Yoak</HI> of <HI>Subjection,</HI> which they were under to the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Syria,</HI> and had <HI>setled</HI> the <HI>Government</HI> of their Nation upon the <HI>Princes</HI> of the <HI>Asmonaean Race</HI> in gratitude of that <HI>deliverance,</HI> they so justly owed to their <HI>Piety,</HI> and <HI>Courage</HI>; and which continued in this Family till the <HI>Conquest</HI> of <HI>Iudea</HI> by <HI>Pompey,</HI> after 106 years free enjoyment of it: So that it is plain, the <HI>Iews,</HI> before the Coming of <HI>Christ,</HI> both <HI>Priests,</HI> and <HI>Peo∣ple,</HI> did not think it <HI>unlawful</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> their Lives, and Religion, in Case of great Extremity, and that our <HI>Saviour Christ,</HI> hath any where by his Gospel <HI>Retrenched whole Nations</HI> of that liberty lies upon you to prove.</P>
<P>But to conclude, as for the Text you have cited out of the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> that will do you as little service: For tho' I grant it is true, that no Man can say to an <HI>Absolute King,</HI> or Monarch, <HI>What dost thou</HI>? i. e. <HI>Call him to Account</HI> as his <HI>Superiour</HI>; Yet doth it not therefore follow, that a <HI>whole People,</HI> or Nation, have <HI>no Power</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> themselves in any case whatsoever, against his <HI>unjust, Violence,</HI> or <HI>Tyranny</HI>: This not being the <HI>Act</HI> of a <HI>Superiour,</HI> but an <HI>equal</HI> (as I have already said) nor any <HI>Political,</HI> but a <HI>Natural Power.</HI></P>

<P>I confess this is the <HI>Notablest Example of Resistance,</HI> that you have brought yet, but I think it may be easily answered, if we suppose with <HI>Iose∣pbus</HI> and other Authors, that tho' <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, was certainly possest of <HI>Palestine,</HI> by right of <HI>Conquest,</HI> and the <HI>Submission</HI> of the High-Priest <HI>Iaddus</HI> unto him; Yet his <HI>Chief Captains</HI> conspiring together, made such a <HI>Scambling Division</HI> of the Empire among themselves, as they could, every one almost, seeking how he might <HI>suppress</HI> the rest, and attain <HI>the whole</HI> alone for himself: so as thereupon the <HI>Iews,</HI> were as free from the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> as any other of their <HI>Bordering Neighbours</HI>; none of the said Captains having any <HI>Lawful Interest,</HI> or Title to <HI>Iudah</HI>: But that which turned to the benefit of some o∣thers, brought a great detriment (for want of Ability) unto them: For one of the said Captains, viz. <HI>Antiochus,</HI> having gotten to himself a very great King∣dom in <HI>Syria,</HI> and another, viz. <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> the <HI>Iews</HI> dwelling betwixt them both, were miserably, on every side, vexed by them, sometimes the <HI>Egyptians</HI> by <HI>Oppression</HI> and <HI>force,</HI> brought them under their <HI>Subjection,</HI> and imposed <HI>great Tributes</HI> upon them; and sometimes the <HI>Syrians,</HI> growing mighti∣er than the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> did likewise very <HI>greatly afflict</HI> them; especially in the Reign of <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes,</HI> whose Invasion and Government was most Unjust and Tyrannical.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Macc.</HI> 1.37.</NOTE> <HI>He shed Innocent Blood on every side of the Sanctuary, spoiled the Temple, erecting in it the Abomina∣tion of the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>and caused it to be named the Temple of</HI> Jupiter Olympius.

<P>Notwithstanding what you have now said concerning this Action, I doubt not, but if you will consider <HI>Iosephus</HI> better, as also the two Books of the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> you will find, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t not only <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes,</HI> but also <HI>Anti∣ochus</HI> the Great, and <HI>Seleucus Philopater</HI> were true and Lawful Monarchs of <HI>Coelo-Syria,</HI> and consequently of <HI>Palestine,</HI> And tho' I grant there had been Wars between <HI>Antiochus</HI> the Great, and <HI>Ptolemy Philopater,</HI> concerning the Domini∣on of that Country, yet it is plain out of <HI>Iosephus</HI>'s Antiquities. <HI>Lib.</HI> 12.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 3.4<HI>th.</HI></NOTE> That <HI>Antiochus</HI> had <HI>re-conquer'd</HI> all this Country from the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> tho' he afterwards parted with <HI>half</HI> of the <HI>Tribute</HI> of it to <HI>Ptolomy Epiphanes</HI> King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> as a <HI>Dowry</HI> with <HI>Cleopatra</HI> his Daughter; Yet surely he retained the <HI>Supream Dominion</HI> of it to himself, for we find in the 2 <HI>Maccabees,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 3.</NOTE> that <HI>Seleucus Philopater,</HI> supplied all the <HI>Costs</HI> of the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> out of his <HI>own Revenues,</HI> that is, of <HI>those Sacrifices,</HI> that were offered for the <HI>Health</HI> of the King, as afterwards for the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors. And we find in the beginning of both the Books of the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> that the King of <HI>Syria</HI> had Power to <HI>make,</HI> and <HI>unmake</HI> the <HI>High-Priest</HI> when ever he pleased, as having the Dominion over <HI>Coelo-Syria,</HI> and <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> over which, as appears by the 2d. <HI>Chap.</HI> of the 2d. of <HI>Macc. Seleucus</HI> had made <HI>Apollonius</HI> Governour under him: So that there cannot be more certain marks of <HI>Soveraign Majesty,</HI> exercised by the <HI>Great Turk</HI> over any of those <HI>Tributary Princes,</HI> or Governours, which he <HI>places,</HI> and <HI>displaces</HI> at his Pleasure: And therefore it is apparent, notwithstanding what you have said to the Contrary, out of I know not what Authors, that the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes,</HI> was an <HI>unjust Usurpation,</HI> for bating this Tyranny in the exercise of it, he had a <HI>juster Title</HI> than ever <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great had, since be∣sides <HI>Conquest,</HI> he had your <HI>own Right</HI> of <HI>Prescription</HI> by three Descents, and I have <HI>Grotius,</HI> (besides other more antient Authors) on my side in this matter. And pray now see <HI>Grotius</HI> his Opinion in his first Book <HI>de I.B. &amp; P. cap.</HI> 4. which I will read into <HI>English,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">§. 7.</NOTE> and I think will make sufficiently for my Opinion.</P>
<P><Q>The Fact of the <HI>Maccabees</HI> may seem like to this, (<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Example</HI> of <HI>David</HI> before going) for that some to defend these Arms by this Pretence, as if <HI>Antiochus</HI> were not their <HI>King,</HI> but an <HI>Invader,</HI> I suppose to be vain, since no where in all the History of the <HI>Maccabees, Antiochus</HI> is called by any <HI>other Name,</HI> but that of the <HI>King</HI>; and that deservedly, since the <HI>Iews</HI> had long since acknowledged the Empire of the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> in whose Right <HI>Antiochus,</HI> had succeeded, for that the Law forbids a <HI>Stranger</HI> to be <HI>set over</HI> the <HI>People,</HI> is only to be understood of a <HI>Voluntary Election,</HI> and not of that which the <HI>People</HI> were <HI>forced</HI> to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bmit to by a necessity of the times. But what others say, that the <HI>Iews</HI> then used the Right of a People, who were in their own Power is not true. For first of all, the <HI>Iews</HI> being Conquered by <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> by the Right of War, obeyed by the same Right the <HI>Medes,</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> as Successors to the <HI>Caldeans,</HI> whose whole Empire devolved upon the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> (with which <HI>Iustin</HI> likewise agrees in his 36. Book) hence the <HI>Iews</HI> are said by <HI>Taci∣tus,</HI> to have been during the Empire of the <HI>Medes,</HI> and <HI>Persians, Vilissima pars Servientium.</HI> Neither did they covenant any thing with <HI>Alexander,</HI> and his Successors, but submitted themselves to their Dominion without any Con∣ditions
<PB N="211" REF="114"/>
as they had been under that of <HI>Darius</HI> before. But if the <HI>Iews</HI> were sometimes permit∣ted to observe their own Rites and Laws, that was meerly pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cariou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding from the Beneficence of those Kings, and not from any Law superinduced on that Empire. Therefore there is nothing which can defend the <HI>Maccabees</HI> in this matter, besides the most extreme and most certain dan∣ger (<HI>viz.</HI>) as long as they so contained themselves within the <HI>boun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> of <HI>self-defense,</HI> and that ac∣cording to <HI>Davids</HI> Example, they retired into defeat Places for their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, nor took Arms until they were set upon.</Q>

<P>Yet for all that, some of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> and <HI>Modern Commentators,</HI> on these Books of the <HI>Mac∣cabees</HI> do hold, that such <HI>wonderful Victories,</HI> as were obtained by <HI>Iudas,</HI> and his Brethren, could not have been without the <HI>Miraculous Providence</HI> of God, and Consequently a <HI>Divine Inspiration</HI> assisting them, especially considering the <HI>Strange Iudgment,</HI> that we read fell upon <HI>Antiochus</HI> for his Impiety; and that <HI>Iudas</HI> had oftentimes <HI>Divine Revelations,</HI> appears by that <HI>Dream,</HI> or <HI>Vision,</HI> mentioned in the last Chapter of the 2d of <HI>Maccabees,</HI> of <HI>Ieremiah</HI> the Prophets giving him a <HI>Golden Sword,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>v.</HI> 16.</NOTE> and in giving it, speaking thus, <HI>Take this Holy Sword a Gift from God, with which thou shalt wound the Adversaries: which dream, if it</HI> were sent from God, as is highly probable, sufficiently confirms the Commonly received Opinion, that this <HI>Resi∣stance</HI> of the <HI>Maccabees</HI> was by <HI>Divine Warrant,</HI> or Inspiration: and when ever you can shew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> since the <HI>Coming of Christ, any Resistance</HI> so miraculously <HI>abetted</HI> as this was, I will grant it also to be <HI>Lawful.</HI></P>

<P>I do <HI>joyn Issue</HI> with you in this, and must still suppose, (until you give me better evidence to the contrary) that the <HI>Iews,</HI> under the Conduct of the <HI>Maccabees</HI> did not <HI>take up Arms,</HI> against <HI>Antiochus,</HI> and his Successors by Vertue of any <HI>Divine Inspiration</HI> to <HI>Mattathias,</HI> or any of his Sons, far it appears plainly, as well by the <HI>Scripture,</HI> as by <HI>Iosephus</HI> his Testimony, that there was <HI>no more Divine Revelation</HI> after <HI>Malachi,</HI> neither do the Books of the <HI>Maccabees, Iosephus, Sulpitius Severus,</HI> or any other ancient <HI>Ecclesiastical Writer,</HI> mention these <HI>Maccabees</HI> as Men inspired by God. I grant indeed, they might be <HI>excited</HI> by some <HI>Divine Impulse</HI> of Gods spirit to do what they did; But this is so far from being at all <HI>Miraculous,</HI> that I do suppose that divers great, and good Men have been in our <HI>latter times</HI> of <HI>Reformation</HI> stirred up by the same <HI>Divine Spirit</HI> to undertake, and perform extraordinary things; for the <HI>Reformation</HI> of Religion, and the <HI>deliverance</HI> of Gods <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>People.</HI> And therefore as for the <HI>Vision,</HI> or <HI>Dream</HI> which you mention, it doth not appear, that it was any more than an <HI>Ordinary Dream</HI>; and if this might p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for a <HI>proof</HI> of a <HI>Divine Revelation,</HI> I could quote you many such <HI>Dreams,</HI> as this, out of the <HI>Lives</HI> of <HI>Luther, Calvin</HI> and divers others of the <HI>first Reformers</HI>; whom I suppose you will not maintain to have had any <HI>express Revelation</HI> to do what they did, contrary to the <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Ecclesiastic Laws</HI> of those Princes, and States under which they lived. And tho' tis true these Books are not held <HI>Canonical</HI>; yet they were always esteemed in the Church as <HI>Sacred Writing,</HI> as Written, tho' not by <HI>Inspired,</HI> yet,
<PB N="212" REF="115"/>
by <HI>Pious Men,</HI> and tho' they are not received in matters of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Doctrine,</HI> yet you know very well they are <HI>Commanded</HI> to be read in our <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es,</HI> as containing <HI>excellent Precepts,</HI> and <HI>Ex∣amples</HI> in matters of <HI>Morality,</HI> and therefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rhaps they would not be a <HI>good Authority</HI> to a <HI>Praesbyterian,</HI> yet I hope we of the <HI>Church<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s England</HI> cannot refuse them as Rules of Morality.

<P>I confess I am not able, in a <HI>Story</HI> so imperfectly related as this of the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> to prove they had Gods <HI>express Warrant</HI> for this <HI>Resistance</HI>; and you on the other side, produce b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a <HI>Ne∣gative Argument,</HI> that they had not (<HI>viz</HI>) because neither <HI>Iosephus,</HI> nor the Book of the <HI>Macca∣bees</HI> expresly mention any such thing, and yet for all that <HI>Mattathias</HI> might (for ought that you, or I know,) have acted in this matter by <HI>Divine Revelation,</HI> since as the <HI>Rabbins</HI> suppose▪ there was for a long time after the times of the <HI>Prophets a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t</HI> of <HI>Revelation,</HI> given by God to some particular Men called <HI>Batcol,</HI> that is, the <HI>Daughter of the V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce,</HI> which seems to have been some <HI>Private,</HI> or <HI>inward Voice,</HI> by which God <HI>Revealed</HI> his Will in some <HI>Particular Cases,</HI> and we read that long after this, <HI>Iosephus</HI> relates that <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcanus,</HI> the last good <HI>High-Priest</HI> of the <HI>Maccabean Race,</HI> had the Gift of <HI>Prophecy</HI> by <HI>Divine Revelation</HI>: And why his <HI>Great Grand-Father,</HI> might not have it likewise, I see no reason, besides all this, there might be other reasons, that God might allow to the People of the <HI>Iews</HI> a greater Liberty of <HI>Resistance,</HI> even without <HI>Cruel Authority,</HI> to re∣venge the <HI>Profanation</HI> of his <HI>Temple,</HI> and Religion, being the Place, where he was pleased parti∣cularly to place his Name, than are allowed to us <HI>Christians</HI> at this Day, who have no such <HI>Visible Temple,</HI> nor are under such <HI>severe Obligations</HI> to extirpate <HI>Idolatry.</HI> So that what <HI>Mattathias,</HI> and the People of the <HI>Iews</HI> acted in this matter, they might do it by the <HI>Right of Zealot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> for the <HI>de∣fence</HI> of the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> even as <HI>Phineas</HI> did, who by killing <HI>Zimri</HI>; and <HI>Cosbi,</HI> for <HI>Fornication,</HI> and <HI>Idolatry,</HI> did that which in another occasion, and at another time would have been <HI>down right Murder.</HI></P>
<P>But be it as it will, I think we <HI>Christians</HI> are by the Laws of the Gospel tyed to a <HI>stricter Sub∣jection</HI> to the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> (if it be possible) than the <HI>Iews</HI> themselves were, and whatsoever they might have done under <HI>Antiochus,</HI> for their <HI>own defence,</HI> and to avoid <HI>Persecution,</HI> yet <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> doth now require <HI>Higher things</HI> of us, and hath by his <HI>own Example,</HI> as well as <HI>Precept,</HI> for∣bidden us to <HI>Resist</HI> the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> for any Pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cution, for Religion, whatsoever, since, he hath <HI>Ordained</HI> his <HI>Religion,</HI> to be Propagated, and <HI>desended</HI> by <HI>Sufferings,</HI> and <HI>Persuasions,</HI> and not by <HI>Force of Arms,</HI> against the <HI>Will</HI> of the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> and if not for <HI>Religion,</HI> the most <HI>Weight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of all Concerns, surely not for any <HI>Temporal thing</HI> whatsoever.

<P>YOur Servant Sir, I see you are better than your Word, since you come somewhat before the time appointed.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not deserve any great Commendation for it, for this Evening being a time of leisure, I had nothing else to do but to wait on you, and in∣deed I was impatient, `till I was with you, since I desire nothing more, than to receive satisfaction in this weighty controversie; since I know how great a Master you are both in Divine, as well as Civil Knowledge; and therefore, I beseech you▪ to proceed in the Method I at first proposed, by giving me these places of Scripture out of the New Testament, which you suppose prove your Doctrine, and in the next place shew me that they were always under∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood by the ancient Fathers, as well as the Practice of the whole Primitive Church in that Sense.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I very well approve of your Method, and therefore to go on where we left off, I shall in the first place lay down some plain, and easie Proposi∣tions, as the Grounds of our future Discourse, which I suppose you will have no Reason to deny.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Therefore I suppose, that our Saviours Kingdom not being of this World, he came not to alter the Civil Government or Polity of it, (as you have already asserted) And therefore did not alter any of those Rights of So∣veraign Powers, and those measures of Obedience, and Subje∣ction which were before fixed and determined by God himself:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. R. Ch</HI> 2. p. 43.</NOTE> Neither hath given the People (either considered as particu∣lar men, or as a collective Body) any Power or Right to resist, or rebel against such Supream Magistrates, tho' they never so much abuse their Power by their Tyrannical Government, either by persecuting the true Reli∣gion, or by any other Violences, and Oppressions whatsoever.</P>
<P>And our Saviour himself tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. 44. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.17.</NOTE> <HI>That be came not to destroy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Law, and the Prophets, but to fulfil it</HI>; that is, to fulfil the Anci∣ent
<PB N="216" REF="117"/>
Types, and Prophecies in his own Person, to perfect an External, and Ce∣remonial, by a Real, and Evangelical Righteousness; to perfect the Moral Laws with new Instances and Degrees of Vertue, and Obedience, but he abrogated no Moral Law, and therefore not the Laws of Obedience, and Sub∣jection to Princes which have always been reduced to the fifth Command∣ment. Pray tell me, how you approve of this Doctrine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do readily agree to the greatest part of it, but yet as our Saviour hath not been pleased expresly to enjoyn us to resist the Supream Powers when they manifestly break, and transgress all the Ends of Civil Govern∣ment, and consequently dissolve it, so on the other side, he came not to de∣stroy those Natural Rights, which Mankind enjoyed before his coming, of defending themselves, and providing for their own Happiness and Security when their Civil Governours either could not, or would not protect them▪ And as I grant, that our Saviour made no Alteration in Civil Government by abridging the Rights of Soveraign Power; so likewise hath he not confer∣red upon them any new Rights, or Prerogatives of <HI>destroying,</HI> or ens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> their Subjects, without any Contradiction, or Resistance: and consequently hath altered nothing in those Natural Rights, or means which the People had before his Coming, of hindering the Supream Powers, from perverting those main Ends of Government, the Happiness, and Preservation of the People▪ And that this Liberty doth not any way destroy those Rights or Prerogatives which are necessary for their own Security, and the Well-governing of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> People, I have, I think, sufficiently proved in our last Conversation. So that, unless you can now shew me, by such express Authorities, as that I can have no reasonable ground to deny it, I hope you'll pardon me, if I cannot be∣lieve, that Christ by his coming into the World has taken away, or abridged, that Natural Right which Mankind before enjoyed (even after the Instituti∣on of Civil Government) of <HI>Resistance</HI> or <HI>Self-defence</HI> in Cases of Extrem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ty, against those who exercise nothing of that Supream Power, with which God hath invested them, but the meer Title: For had the intent of our Savi∣ours coming, been for this End, he had instead of freeing us from the Yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Law, laid a much heavier upon our Necks, if the Doctrines of Pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Obedience, and Non-resistance are to be taken in that <HI>large Sense,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣mited extent</HI> that their Asserters have been pleased to give them: So that tho' I grant our Saviour came to perfect, and not to abrogate the Moral Law, with new Instances of Vertue and Obedience, and therefore hath not abrogated any Laws of Obedience, and Subjection to Princes; so hath he nei∣ther abrogated the great Law of Nature, of <HI>Self-defence</HI> in the People, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they are <HI>universally</HI> assaulted, or oppress't in their Lives, Liberties, or Pro∣perties.</P>
<P>And tho' I grant Obedience to Princes hath been reduced to the fifth Com∣mandment, yet neither doth that by commanding us to Honour our Father, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Mother, forbid all Resistance of Children to the Violent and unreasonable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctions of their Parents, much less of those whom they may command, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et on to kill, or ruine us, as I have, I think sufficiently proved at our first Conference. And therefore, I pray, proceed to your Proofs themselves, and shew me, that they prove, as much as you have affirmed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I come to my Proofs, I pray give me leave to observe it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou by way of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntroduction, that as our Saviour hath left the Government of
<PB N="217" REF="117"/>
the World as he found it: So he hath besides all this, given such admirable Laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. R.</HI> p. 46.</NOTE> as will both teach Princes to Govern, and Subjects to Obey better, which is the most effectual way to secure the publick Peace, and Happiness, to prevent the Oppression of Subjects, and Rebellion against Princes; But he has not interposed in new modelling the Governments of the World, which is not of such consequence, as some Men imagine. It is not the External form of Government, but the Fatherly Care and Prudence, and Justice of Gover∣nours and the dutiful Obedience of Subjects, which can make any People Happy. If Princes, and Subjects be good Christians, they may be happy under most forms of Government, if they be not, they can be so under none: Had our Saviour given Subjects Liberty to Resist, to Depose, to Murder Tyrannical Princes, he had done them no kindness at all: For to give Liberty to Subjects to Resist, is only to proclaim an universal Li∣cense to Factions, and Seditions, and Civil Wars, and if any Man can think this such a mighty Blessing to the World, yet methinks, it is not a Blessing, proper for the Prince of Peace to give.</P>
<P>But he, who instructs Princes to rule as Gods Ministers, and Vicegerents, and to express a Fatherly Care, and Concernment for the Happiness of their Subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> p. 47.</NOTE> and that teaches Subjects to Re∣verence, and obey their Prince as the Image of God, and qui∣etly to submit, and yield to his Authority, and that inforces these Laws both on Princes and Subjects in the Name and Authority of God, and from the Consideration of the future Judgment, when Princes who abuse their Power shall give an account of it to their great Master, and when Subjects who re∣sist, shall receive to themselves Damnation, and those who patiently suffer for Gods sake shall have their Injuries redress't, and their Obedience rewar∣ded: I say, such a Person as this, takes a more effectual Course to reform the abuses of Civil Power, and to preserve good Government in the World, than all your <HI>wise Politians, and State-Menders who think</HI> to re∣form the Government of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> p. 47.</NOTE> by some State Spells, and Charms, without reforming those, who govern, and those who are governed. This our Saviour hath done, and this is the best thing that could be done; nay this was all that he could do in this matter: He ne∣ver usurpt any Civil Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> p. 48.</NOTE> and Authority, and therefore could not new model the Governments of the World, He never offers any External force, and Compulsion to make Men obey his Laws, and there∣fore never forces Princes to rule Well, nor Subjects to Obey. But he has taken the same care of the Government of the World; as he has done of the other Duties of Piety, and Vertue, that is, he has given very good Laws and threat∣ned those who break them with Eternal Punishments, and as the Laws, and Religion of our Saviour prevail, so will the Governments of the World mend without altering the Model and Constitution of them: But I come now to those places of Scripture, I have to urge against your Opinion—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray Sir, pardon me, if I interrupt you, and beg leave to make some Remarks upon this Preface you have now made. I will not deny, but you have spoken some honest Truths, in what you have now said, tho' not without a mixture of divers mistakes, for tho' I grant that Jesus Christ hath not in∣terposed
<PB N="218" REF="118"/>
in new modelling the Governments of the World; so he hath like∣wise given Princes no Authority to alter those, which they find ready made, and modelled to their hands in those Countries wherein God hath placed them at the helm. And tho' you tell me, those models of Government are not of such consequence as some men imagine, yet I hope you ought to have a better opinion of this of <HI>England,</HI> since it is only to this Frame of Govern∣ment, that you'll own, we owe all our Freedom and Happiness above divers other Nations our Neighbours: Since if it were not for our Laws, and Origi∣nal Constitutions to the contrary, I do not see why we may not be made as absolute Slaves as any in <HI>Turkey,</HI> when ever the King pleases: I grant indeed, that it is the Fatherly Care, Prudence, and Justice of Governours, that can make any People Happy. But I desire you to shew me, how many Govern∣ments there are in the World where Princes exercise this Fatherly Care, as they ought, without any known Laws, or where Subjects express a dutiful Love, and Obedience to their Governours (unless Servile fear must be called so) whilst they find themselves miserable Slaves, and Beggars.</P>
<P>I also yield, that if Princes, and Subjects are good Christians, they may be happy under most forms of Government; and if not, they can be happy under none, is true in this Sense, if you take Happiness, for the hopes of a future Life; but otherwise there have been divers Princes, who have been very good Christians, and yet by carelesness of their Affairs have governed their Subjects very ill; and likewise, I know some Subjects who have been very Loyal to their Prince, and very good Christians, and yet have been made very miserable, as Witness the Protestants in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But as I do not suppose, that our Saviour hath given Subjects Liberty to resist <HI>Tyrannical</HI> Princes upon every slight occasion, much less to <HI>depose,</HI> or murder them; yet will it not follow, that if he hath given Liberty to Subjects to resist in some Cases, it would only serve to proclaim an uni∣versal License to Seditions, and Civil Wars: Since I do not suppose such Wars to be lawful, but when the People are in as miserable Condition as a State of War can bring them to; and if our Saviour had not allowed them this Power, no rational Man would think it a Blessing proper for the Prince of Peace to give, or to come into the World to introduce Slavery, and the Arbitrary Power of the Sword.</P>
<P>Tho' I grant he instructs Princes to rule as Gods Ministers, and Vicege∣rents, and to express a Fatherly Care, and Concern for the Happiness of their Subjects, and that he likewise teaches Subjects to obey their Princes: Yet you know too well, how seldom these Instructions have all those good effects either with the Princes, or People. And therefore, as on the Peo∣ple's side, besides those Obligations of Conscience you speak of, there are likewise ordained temporal Punishments, to keep Subjects to their Duty, so likewise there is often need of something else, besides meer Conscience, and honour, to keep Princes from Tyrannizing over their Subjects.</P>
<P>And tho' I suppose the Consideration of a future Judgment may go a great way with some Princes to make them perform that great Trust, God hath given them, yet pray tell me, have you not read (if not known) some Princes in the World of late times, who have either believed no such thing, as Eternal Damnation, or at least have found a way by Nice Distinctions,
<PB N="219" REF="118"/>
or Equivocations to evade all Laws, Oaths, and Promises whatsoever? And what satisfaction is it to me, or how doth it serve to alleviate my mi∣sery, When I am made a Slave, and a Beggar, that those that had the Rule over me will be damned for so doing. But you tell me, that I must quiet∣ly and patiently suffer this for God's sake, and that then we shall have our injuries redress'r, and Obedience rewarded: I grant indeed that a single Per∣son may be rewarded in this kind, for preferring the Common Good, or Quiet of the Nation before his own Private Interest. But that whole Na∣tions, and Bodies of People are obliged by the like Rule, I utterly deny, since I do not find where our Saviour either enjoyns, or requires such an absolute Subjection at their Hands; and if he doth not, it is no better than Will-worship to pay it, and therefore, it still lies upon you to prove it to me.</P>
<P>To conclude. I think it may be a more effectual Course, to preserve the main Ends of Government, for the People sometimes to <HI>resist the insup∣portable Tyranny and Violence</HI> of the Supream Powers in those Cases of Ex∣tremity I have already put, than to let those, who have got the Power over us in their Hands, do whatsoever they please with it to our ruine without any controul. And also, I desire you to consider, whether the Fear of such re∣sistance from Subjects, when thus outraged and oppress't, may not often be a more Powerful State's Spell or Charm (as you call it) to keep the Supream Powers in their Duty, than those many Sermons, and other Dis∣courses that have been lately preached, and publish't, that <HI>their Power is irresistible,</HI> and that therefore, all their Subjects are bound to endure what∣soever Tyranny they have a mind to exercise upon them: In short, I ab∣solutely agree with you, that as our Saviour never usurpt any Civil Power, or Authority, and therefore did not new model the Governments of the World, so hath he also given Subjects a Right to maintain whatsoever Models, or Forms of Government, God hath been pleased to establish among them, when they are in danger to be altered, or invaded either by a Domestick Tyranny, or Forreign Force. And without this Right of Resi∣stance, for you to tell us, <HI>That Iesus Christ hath given</HI> very good <HI>Laws, and threatned those that break them</HI> with Eternal <HI>Punishments, and that as</HI> the <HI>Laws, and Religion of our</HI> Saviour <HI>prevail, that so the Government of</HI> the <HI>World will mend without any more ado</HI>; is altogether as reasonable, as to preach, that because Christ hath given us good Laws, and threatens Ever∣lasting Punishments to those that break them, therefore they are suffi∣cient to keep Men from Robbing, and Murdering their Neighbours; and that all men giving up their Natural Rights of resisting such Robbers, and defending themselves against them, should wholy relie upon the Effi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acy of the Commandment against Stealing, or else on the more Powerful Mo∣tive with such People, of a Judge, and a Gallows, should let them do with us what they please, whenever we fall under their Power: And therefore, I desire you would give me some better proofs, that our Saviour hath en∣joyned all Mankind an absolute Subjection to the Supream Powers under pain of Damnation without any Resistance in any Case whatsoever; but I pray pardon this Digression, which your own long Preface extorted from me.</P>

<P>I shall not now dispute this matter with you, and therefore to observe your Commands, I shall begin with that Divine Answer, of our Saviour to the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and <HI>Herodians</HI> when they consulted together to en∣tangle him in his Talk. They came to him with great Cere∣mony, and Address,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. R.</HI> p. 49. Matth. 22.15. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> saying, <HI>Master we know, that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in Truth, neither carest thou for any Man, for thou regardest not the Person of Man. Tell us there∣fore, what thinkest thou?</HI> Is it lawful to give Tribute to <HI>Caesar</HI> or not? They thought it impossible that he should give any Answer to this, which would not make him obnoxious, either to the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours, if he denied that the <HI>Iews</HI> might Lawfully pay Tribute to <HI>Caesar,</HI> or to the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and People, if he affirmed that they might; for there was a very potent Faction among them, who thought it unlawful for the <HI>Iews,</HI> to own the Authority, or Usurpations of any Foreign Prince, or to pay Tri∣bute to him as to their King, They being expresly forbidden by the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut.</HI> 17.15. <HI>Ib.</HI> p. 50.</NOTE> <HI>To set a Stranger over them for their King</HI>; who was not their Brother, that is, who was not a Natural <HI>Iew.</HI> And it seems they could not distinguish between their own Volun∣tary Act in chusing a Stranger for their King (which was indeed forbid by their Law) and their submitting to a Foreign Prince, when they were conquered by him. Our Saviour, who knew their Wicked Intention in all this, that they did not come with an honest Design to be instructed in their Duty but to seek an Advantage against him, expresses some Indigna∣tion at it, <HI>Why tempt ye me, ye Hypocrites</HI>? but yet to return them an Answer to their Question, he bids them shew him the Tribute Money, that is, the Money in which they us'd to pay Tribute, and enquired, whose Image, and Superscription it had. For Coining of Money was then as certain a mark of Soveraignty, as making Laws, or the Power of the Sword. Well, they acknowledge that the Image, and Superscription on the Tribute-Mo∣ney was <HI>Caesars,</HI> upon which he replies, <HI>Render therefore unto</HI> Caesar, <HI>the things that are</HI> Caesar<HI>'s, and unto God the things that are Gods.</HI> The plain mean∣ing of which Answer is this, that since by the very Impression on their Mo∣ney, it is evident, that <HI>Caesar</HI> is the Soveraign Lord, they must render unto him all the Rights of Soveraignty,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> p. 51. <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.7.</NOTE> among which Tribute is one, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us. <HI>Render therefore unto all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Custom to whom Custom, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour.</HI> Whatever then is due to Soveraign Princes, and doth not interfere with their Duty to God, that they must give to <HI>Caesar,</HI> who at this time was their Soveraign.</P>
<P>And tho' our Saviour commands us, only in general, <HI>to render to</HI> Caesar <HI>the things that are</HI> Caesars, without telling us, what <HI>Caesar</HI>'s things are; this is so far from making his Answer Ambiguous, and of no use in this present Controversie, that it suggests to us three plain, and natural Consequences, which are sufficient to end this whole dispute. <HI>First,</HI> That our Saviour did not intend to make any Alteration in the Rights of Soveraignty, but what Rights he found Soveraign Princes possest of, he leaves them in the quiet Possession of, for had he intended to make any change in this matter, he would not have given such a general Rule, <HI>to render to</HI> Caesar <HI>the things that
<PB N="221" REF="119"/>
are</HI> Caesars, without specifying what these things are. <HI>Se∣condly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. R.</HI> p. 56.</NOTE> And therefore he leaves them to the known Laws of the Empire, to determine what is <HI>Caesars</HI> Right. What ever is essential to the Notion of Soveraign Power, whatever the Laws, and Customs of Nations determine to be <HI>Caesar's</HI> Right, that they must render to him; for he would make no alteration in this matter. So that Subjection to Princes, and Non Resistance, is as plainly determined by our Saviour in this Law of paying Tribute; for Subjection, and Non-Resistance is as essential a Right of Soveraign Power, and as inseparable from the Notion of it, as any thing can be, and so it is acknowledged by the Laws, and Customs of Nations, and is so determin'd by the Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> as I shall shew hereafter. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> I observe farther that when our Saviour joyns our Duty to our Prince, with our Duty to our God <HI>Render to</HI> Cae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar <HI>the things that are</HI> Caesars, <HI>and to God the things that are Gods,</HI> he excepts nothing from <HI>Caesars</HI> Right, which by the Laws of Nations is due to Soveraign Princes, but what is a Violation of, and an encroachment on God's Right, and Soveraignty, that is, we must pay all that Obedience,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> p. 57.</NOTE> and Subjection to Princes which is consistent with our Duty to God. This is the only limit our Saviour sets to our Duty to Princes. This, I hope, is sufficient for the Explication of our Saviours Answer to the <HI>Pharisees</HI> and <HI>Herodians,</HI> which evidently contains the Doctrine of Obedience and Subjection to Princes, enforced on us by the Authority of our Saviour himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not dispute, that this Instance of our Saviour doth enjoyn the <HI>Iews</HI> to pay Tribute, and render all those Rights, and Dues to <HI>Caesar</HI> as the Supream Power, which are necessary to it's Essence, but you seem to me, to stretch this Prerogative a great deal too far, when you thus suppose an absolute Subjection to Princes, without any resistance to be as plainly enjoyn'd by our Saviour in this Law, as paying Tribute. For the Reason you give for it, <HI>viz.</HI> that Subjection, and Non resistance is as essen∣tial a Right of Soveraign Power, and as inseparable from the Notion of it, as any can be, and that it is so acknowledged by the Laws, and Customs of Nations, is the thing which I deny, and which having been the Subject of our last Conversation, is still the thing to be proved; and I think I have there sufficiently proved that absolute Non resistance is no Essential Right of Soveraign Power, nor inseparable from the Notion of it: Since by asserting it, no just Right of Soveraign Power will be thereby destroy∣ed, or taken away; but rather confirm'd, and that I may make it out, yet plainer by a Familiar Instance; a General of an Army, hath an absolute Power over the Lives of his Souldiers, that transgress his Rules of War, or Military Discipline; but suppose that in a Mad, or Drunken sit he should command some Troops of his Guards to cut the Throats of all the rest of the Army, and they be such obedient Coxcombs, as to go about to put this order in Execution, doth it therefore derogate, from the absoluteness of his Power as General, if the Army will not stand still, and let three, or four hundred fellows take away all their Lives? But that this Principle of <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> in your Sense, of suffering Princes, or other Supream Powers to destroy, or inslave them; is so far from being acknow∣ledged, by the Laws, and Customs of all Nations, that, as I think, I have
<PB N="222" REF="120"/>
proved it to be contrary to the Laws of Nature, and Reason; so I doubt not, but I can much easier make it out by the Laws and Customs of all Nations, as well Barbarous, as Civiliz'd to be both unreasonable, and im∣practicable. And that it is otherwise determin'd by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> I desire you to prove it to me, when you come to make use of the 13<HI>th</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> so much insisted upon by those of your Opinion.</P>
<P>But before I make an end with this Text we are now upon, I cannot but take notice of your last Assertion, <HI>That by rendring to</HI> Caesar <HI>the things, which are</HI> Caesars, <HI>God excepts nothing from</HI> Caesar<HI>'s Right, which by the Laws of Nations is due to Soveraign Princes, but what is a Violation of, and Encroach∣ment on Gods Right, and Soveraignty; that is, we must pay all that Obedience, and Subjection to Princes, which is consistent with our Duty to God. Now if this be the only limit that our Saviour sets to our Duty to Princes (as you sup∣pose) I wonder by what Law the Learned Doctor from whom you borrow this Prin∣ciple, as also those other Clergy-men of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>could justifie thelr refusing to read the Kings late Proclamation of Indulgence, or Toleration, for if the King (as they own in the Oath of Supremacy) is the only Supream Governour of his Dominions, in all Things, or Causes whatsoever</HI>; He must likewise be the <HI>Caesar</HI> here meant in this Text; and consequently an Active, not Passive Obedience ought to have been paid to this Declaration. Since you say, that Obedience is by the Law of Nations due to Soveraign Princes, to whom we must pay all that Obedience and Subjection, which is consistent with our Duty to God, and I hope you will not say, that this Declaration was inconsistent with that Duty, or was any Violation or Encroachment upon Gods Rights of Soveraignty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for your last observation upon those Clergy men who refused to read the Declaration, I must confess, I have according to my Civil Law Maxims, no excuse ready for them, since with us it is always true, in this as well as other absolute Monarchies, <HI>Quicquid Regi placuit, Legi's habet Vi∣gorem.</HI> Much less can I reconcile it with that unbounded Supremacy which the Oath of Allegiance, as also the Opinions of most modern Judges have placed in the King in all Ecclesiastical Matters; but indeed I can least of all reconcile it with this Assertion you now mention, which I confess, I have taken from divers Sermons and Treatises, that have been Prea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht and Printed of late by our City Divines; to whom I shall leave it to An∣swer this Objection; but to proceed with the design in Hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. R.</HI> p. 57.</NOTE> I shall come in the next place to prove an absolute Subjection without Resistance to be due to the Soveraign Power, from our Saviour's rebuke to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> when he drew his Sword, and struck a Servant of the High-Priest, and smote off his Ear, which is as plain a Declaration against Resistance as Words can make it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 26.52.</NOTE> <HI>Then said Iesus unto him, put up thy Sword unto his place; for all they that take the Sword, shall perish by the Sword.</HI> For the understanding of which, we must consider, upon what occasion St. <HI>Peter</HI> drew his Sword; for we must not think that our Saviour doth absolutely forbid the use of the Sword; which is to destroy all Civil Governments,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> p. 58.</NOTE> and the Power of Princes, and to proclaim impunity to all which Villanies that
<PB N="223" REF="120"/>
are committed in the World. The Sword is necessary to punish wicked∣ness, and to protect the Innocents. In the Hands of Princes it is an Instru∣ment of Justice, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us. That they bear not the Sword in vain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13.4.</NOTE> <HI>But are the Ministers of God, revengers to ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI> In the Hands of pri∣va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Persons it may be lawfully used in Self-defence▪ thus our Saviour a lit∣tle before his Crucifixion, gave Commission to his Disciples to furnish themselves with Swords,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk.</HI> 22.36.</NOTE> tho' they parted with the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Garments for the Purchase. Which we suppose was not designed as a meer modish, and fashionable thing, but to defend them∣selves from the Private assaults of Robbers▪ and such like Common Enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 59.</NOTE> who as <HI>Iosephus</HI> tells us, were very nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s at that time. <HI>For no Man wanteth Authority to defend his Life against him, who hath no Authority to take it away.</HI></P>
<P>But the Case of St. <HI>Peter</HI> was very different: He drew his Sword indeed in his Masters defence, but against a lawful Authority. The Officers of the Chief Priests, and <HI>Pharisees</HI> came with <HI>Iudas</HI> to the place where Jesus was, to seize on him. This was a lawful Authority tho' employed upon a ve∣ry unjust Errand; but Authority must not be resisted, tho' in defence of the greatest Innocence. Men who draw their Swords against lawful Pow∣ers shall perish with the Sword, which doth not signifie, what the event shall always be, but what is the desert and merit of the Action. Rebels may sometimes be prosperous, but they always deserve Punishment; and if they escape the Sword in this World, St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, they shall receive Dam∣nation in the next. What can be said more expresly against Resistance than this?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> p. 59 60.</NOTE> St. <HI>Peter</HI> never could have drawn his Sword in a better Cause, never in the Defence of a more sacred Person: If we may defend oppressed Innocence against a lawful Au∣thority, if we may oppose unjust and illegal Violence, if any obligations of Friendship, Gratitude, or Religion it self could justifie Resistance, St. <HI>Peter</HI> had not met with this Rebuke. But tho' it was a very unjust Action, yet it was done by a just Authority; and lawful Powers must not be resisted, tho' it were in defence of the Saviour of the World, and if St. <HI>Peter</HI> might not use the Sword in defence of Christs Person, there is much less pretence to fight for his Religion, for tho' some call this f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghting for Religion; it is only fighting for themselves. Men may keep their Religion, if they please in despite of Earthly Powers; and therefore no Powers can hurt Religi∣on, tho' they may persecute the Professours of it: And therefore when Men take up Arms to avoid Perse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ution, it is not in defence of Religion, but of themselves, that is, to avoid their suffering for Religion. And if St. <HI>Peter</HI> might not fight to preserve Christ himself, certainly neither he, nor we, ought to take up Arms to defend our selves from Persecution. Christ was the first Martyr for his own Religion, his Person was infinitely more Sacred, and inviolable than any one of us can pretend to be. And if St. <HI>Peter</HI> must not fight for Christ, certainly we must not fight for our selves, tho' we absurdly enough call it fighting for our Religion. And who were these Powers St. <HI>Peter</HI> resisted? They were only the Servants and Officers of the High-Priest. The High-Priest did not appear there himself, much
<PB N="224" REF="121"/>
less, <HI>Pilate,</HI> much less <HI>Caesar,</HI> and yet our Saviour rebukes St. <HI>Peter</HI> for resisting the Inferiour Officers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> p. 62.</NOTE> tho' they offered the most unjust, and illegal Violence. It seems he did not un∣derstand our modern distinctions between the Person, and the Authority of the Prince, that tho' his Person be sacred, and must not be touched, yet his Ministers who act by his Authority may be oppos'd. We may fight his Navies, and demolish his Garisons, and kill his Subjects, who fight for him, tho' we must not touch his Person. But he is a Mock Prince, whose Authority is confin'd to his own Person, who can do nothing more than what he can do with his two hands; which cannot answer the Ends of Government. A Prince is not meerly a natural but a Political Person, and his Personal Authority reaches as far as his Commission doth. His Of∣ficers and Ministers of State, and Commanders and Soldiers are his Ends, and Eyes, and Ears, and Legs, and he who resisteth those who Act by his Commission, may as properly be said to resist the personal Authority of the Prince, as if he himself were present in his Natural Person as well as by his Authority. Thus our Saviour, it seems, thought, when he rebuk'd St. <HI>Peter</HI> for striking a Servant of the High Priest, and smiting off his Ear.</P>

<P>In Answer to this place, which you have now brought to prove that the <HI>Resistance</HI> that St. <HI>Peter</HI> would have made on our Saviours behalf, was absolutely unlawful, I shall not insist as some do, that Christ came in∣to the World on purpose to be a Sacrifice for Sin, and that therefore it was inconsistent with his design, and the Person he undertook, to resist, and op∣pose, had it been never so lawful to resist; tho' our Saviour himself by the Words,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> 18.11.</NOTE> which St. <HI>Iohn</HI> relates him to have spoken to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> seems to favour this Interpretation; when after he had bid him put his Sword into the Scabbard, he adds, <HI>The Cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it</HI>; and so likewise the answer he gave <HI>Pilate,</HI> who asked him whether he was a King?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> 18.37.</NOTE> <HI>Thou sayest, that I am a King; to this End was I born, and for this Cause came I into the World, that I should bear Witness unto the Truth:</HI> Nor yet shall I go about to interpret these Words, <HI>For they that take the Sword shall perish by the Sword</HI>; in that Sense which <HI>Grotius</HI> puts upon it, tho' quite different from yours, as if it were not designed as a re∣buke to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> but for the encouragement of his Disciples, and being indeed a Prophesie, that the <HI>Iews,</HI> who now came against him with Swords, and Staves, should perish by the Sword of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who should be the <HI>Avengers</HI> of Christs Death: but I shall take it in the same sense as you do, as a rebuke to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> for going about to <HI>resist</HI> a <HI>Lawful Authority,</HI> tho' employed upon a very <HI>unjust Errand</HI>: Yet will it not prove that the <HI>Su∣pream Powers</HI> may not be resisted in any Case, or by any Person whatso∣ever, let them use their <HI>Power</HI> never so <HI>Cruelly,</HI> or <HI>Tyrannically</HI> against their <HI>Subjects:</HI> I grant indeed, it proves, what I have never <HI>denyed,</HI> that a <HI>pri∣vate Person,</HI> tho' <HI>Innocent</HI> ought not to <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sist</HI> the <HI>Civil Officers</HI> that come to <HI>seize him,</HI> for a <HI>Crime</HI> whereof he is accused before a <HI>Lawful Authority,</HI> for this is not only <HI>unlawful</HI> by the <HI>Command</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> but also by the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> and <HI>Nations.</HI> For in <HI>England,</HI> it is not only <HI>Penal,</HI> for a Man to <HI>re∣sist</HI> the <HI>Officers</HI> of <HI>Iustice,</HI> that come to <HI>seize</HI> him, tho' he be <HI>Innocent</HI> of the
<PB N="225" REF="121"/>
Crime, whereof he is <HI>accus'd,</HI> but also to withdraw himself from <HI>Iustice</HI> by flight. And tho' upon <HI>Tryal,</HI> he be found <HI>Innocent,</HI> yet if he fled for the same, he shall forfeit all his Goods; and that very justly, because no Man ought to suspect, and withdraw himself from the <HI>publick Tryal</HI> of the <HI>Laws</HI>; now to apply this to the Case of our Saviour, tho' the <HI>Action</HI> which these <HI>Priests,</HI> and <HI>Souldiers</HI> came about was in it self <HI>unjust</HI>; Yet was it not so, either in <HI>respect</HI> of these <HI>Officers</HI> themselves, who acted by a <HI>Lawful Au∣thority,</HI> nor yet was it <HI>unjust,</HI> or <HI>unlawful</HI> in <HI>respect</HI> of the <HI>High Priest</HI> and <HI>Sanbedrim,</HI> who sent them: For since it belong'd to them alone to <HI>Iudge</HI> of a <HI>Prophet,</HI> who they supposed taught contrary to the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> since they did believe our <HI>Saviour</HI> to be such a <HI>Prophet,</HI> it was in <HI>respect</HI> of them, neither <HI>unjust</HI> nor <HI>unlawful</HI> to <HI>seize</HI> him, and bring him before them, to give <HI>an account</HI> of his <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and they might likewise do this either by <HI>day,</HI> or by <HI>Night</HI> with the help of more, or fewer men, according as they should think fit; since they feared the <HI>People</HI> might <HI>rescue</HI> him; especially since they look't upon him as one who went about to make himself <HI>King</HI> of the <HI>Iews,</HI> in <HI>Opposition</HI> to <HI>Caesar</HI>; and therefore whilst they lay under this <HI>Mistake</HI>▪ they were <HI>under</HI> as high an <HI>Obligation,</HI> as an <HI>Erroneous Conscience</HI> could lay upon them of <HI>Seizing</HI> him, and bringing him before the <HI>High-Priest</HI> and the <HI>Governour.</HI> For if they had believed him to be the true <HI>Messiah,</HI> and con∣sequently the <HI>King</HI> of their <HI>Nation,</HI> it had been impossible, that they should ever have gone about to put him to <HI>Death.</HI> Which likewise our <HI>Saviour</HI> himself <HI>acknowledges,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk.</HI> 23.24.</NOTE> when <HI>Praying</HI> for them that Crucified him, he said, <HI>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI> I speak not this to excuse the <HI>Priests,</HI> or <HI>San<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edrim</HI> for <HI>condemning</HI> our <HI>Saviour</HI> to <HI>Death,</HI> or for using all the <HI>Power</HI> they had with <HI>Pi∣late</HI> to have him <HI>executed</HI>: Since I grant their <HI>Ignorance</HI> being in great part <HI>Wilful,</HI> at least not <HI>Invincible,</HI> they had no <HI>just excuse,</HI> not to believe on him, after so many <HI>Miracles</HI> he had wrought in the <HI>sight</HI> of all the <HI>World:</HI> But only to prove that (which I suppose you will not deny) <HI>i. e.</HI> that <HI>Magistrates,</HI> even whilst they <HI>Act unjustly</HI> are not to be <HI>resisted</HI> in the <HI>Execution</HI> of <HI>Publick Iu∣stice</HI>; no, not to <HI>rescue</HI> an <HI>Innocent Man</HI> by <HI>force,</HI> from the <HI>Hand</HI> of <HI>Iustice,</HI> after he is <HI>Condemned</HI>: Since the <HI>false,</HI> or <HI>unjust Sentences</HI> of <HI>Iudges</HI> against particular <HI>Persons,</HI> are to be taken for <HI>just</HI> in <HI>common Acceptation,</HI> till they be <HI>Repealed</HI>; according to that <HI>Maxime</HI> in your <HI>Civil Law, Proe∣tor dum iniquum decernit, Ius dicit</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Iustitia, &amp; Iure Lege Ius.</HI></NOTE> and therefore our <HI>Sa∣viour</HI> coming to <HI>fulfil</HI> all <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and to be the <HI>exact Patern</HI> of <HI>Divine,</HI> and <HI>Moral Actions</HI> could not do less than <HI>rebuke</HI> St. <HI>Peter,</HI> for making use of the Sword against a <HI>Law∣ful Authority,</HI> but what is this to the <HI>Cases</HI> that I have put of the <HI>Resistance</HI> of <HI>whole Nations,</HI> or <HI>Bodies</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> against an <HI>unjust force,</HI> and <HI>destructive Vio∣lence,</HI> upon their <HI>Persons,</HI> and <HI>Estates</HI> by those who pretend to <HI>Act</HI> as the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> tho contrary to all <HI>Laws, Natural,</HI> and <HI>Divine,</HI> and who have no <HI>Pretence</HI> to <HI>Act</HI> as they do, but only their <HI>unjust</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Wills</HI> back't by <HI>Power:</HI> A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that there is a great difference in these two, I will clearly shew you, from your own <HI>Concession,</HI> that no man wanteth <HI>Autho∣rity</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> his <HI>Life</HI> against him, that hath no <HI>Authority</HI> to take it away;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 21.</NOTE> and therefore I suppose St. <HI>Paul</HI> might

I grant indeed a <HI>Prince</HI> is not meerly a <HI>Natural,</HI> but a <HI>Political Person,</HI> but certainly his <HI>Personal Authority</HI> as <HI>King</HI> doth not reach as far as his <HI>Commission,</HI> or that he who <HI>resists</HI> those, who <HI>Act</HI> by his <HI>Commission,</HI> may be said in all <HI>Cases</HI> to <HI>resist</HI> his <HI>Regal Authority.</HI> Since at this rate the poor <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>Ire∣land</HI> at the beginning of the last <HI>Irish Rebellion,</HI> had been in a very <HI>wo∣ful Condition,</HI> if it had happened (which was not impossible) that King <HI>Charles</HI> the first should really have granted a <HI>Commission</HI> to Sir <HI>Phelim On<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al</HI> to <HI>destroy</HI> them; which no man could then certainly tell, but that

<P>If this <HI>Distinction</HI> of yours were true, it would render the Exam∣ple of <HI>Christ's</HI> suffering, in obedience to the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> tho' <HI>unjustly,</HI> yet without <HI>Resistance,</HI> of no <HI>effect</HI> to us, whereas I am firmly perswaded,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S.

is never said <HI>to call, nor any one to be called of God,</HI> but with respect to some <HI>Divine Decree,</HI> and <HI>Constitution</HI>; and therefore when St. <HI>Peter</HI> tells the <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> that they are <HI>called</HI> to <HI>suffer,</HI> it signifies that God hath appointed them to it, by his positive <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Decree.</HI></P>
<P>This St. <HI>Paul</HI> discourses more at large in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and comforts them under their <HI>sufferings,</HI> from this very consideration, that the <HI>sufferings</HI> which they underwent, were not the Effects of meer <HI>Chance</HI> and <HI>Accident,</HI> nor of the wickedness and injustice of men, nor barely of God's <HI>Permission,</HI> but of his <HI>Decree</HI> and <HI>Appointment</HI>; and therefore they might cer∣tainly conclude, that whatever their <HI>sufferings</HI> were, they should turn to their <HI>Good.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 8.28, 29, 30.</NOTE> <HI>And we know, that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them that are called ac∣croding to his purpose,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 14.</NOTE> <HI>those who are called, that is, to suffer</HI> (which is the Argument, the <HI>Apostle</HI> is discoursing of) according to his <HI>Will,</HI> and <HI>Appointment.</HI> And a little after he goes on, and says;</P>
<P>And such Persons who are thus appointed, who are thus cal∣led by God to <HI>suffer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 85.</NOTE> shall be sure to conquer, and to receive the Reward of <HI>Conquerors.</HI> For thus the <HI>Apostle</HI> adds, <HI>for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son; that he might be the first born amongst many Brethren.</HI> This Conformity to the Image of Christ in this place, doth plainly signifie a Conformity to him, in <HI>sufferings,</HI> as is evident from the whole scope of this place. Some Persons it seems there are, whom God doth <HI>predestinate,</HI> or <HI>fore-appoint</HI> to be conformed to the <HI>sufferings</HI> of Christ; for this is not the actual porti∣on of all <HI>Christians,</HI> though it is the Condition of our <HI>Disciple-ship.</HI></P>
<P>So that though God hath not made us <HI>Slaves</HI> and <HI>Vassals</HI> to the humour of every <HI>Tyrant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 86.</NOTE> yet all the <HI>Afflictions</HI> and <HI>Sufferings</HI> of <HI>Christians,</HI> especially those which befall them on the account of <HI>Religion</HI>; are as particularly ordered, and determined by <HI>God,</HI> as the <HI>suffer∣ings</HI> of Christ himself were; and therefore there is no difference upon this Account, between the <HI>sufferings</HI> of Christ, and the <HI>sufferings</HI> of his Disci∣ples; and therefore though Christ came into the World on purpose to <HI>suffer</HI> in <HI>Obedience</HI> to the <HI>Divine Will,</HI> this doth not make him ever the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss fit to be an <HI>Example</HI> to us.

<P>It is true, none of us in particular can know, that God hath decreed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 87.</NOTE> that we shall suffer such, or such things; and from such or such hands, as our <HI>Saviour</HI> did; but yet this we know, that it is <HI>God's Will</HI> and <HI>Pleasure,</HI> that we should patiently endure those <HI>sufferings</HI> which we cannot avoid without <HI>sin</HI>; and since he hath forbid us by express Laws to resist the <HI>higher Powers,</HI> whatever <HI>sufferings</HI> cannot be avoided without <HI>resistance,</HI> it is <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Will,</HI> and <HI>Pleasure,</HI> that we should <HI>submit to them.</HI> And since none of these <HI>sufferings,</HI> which are unavoidable to us, befall us without the particular <HI>Decree,</HI> and <HI>Appointment of God,</HI> we have reason in Imitation of our <HI>great Master,</HI> to <HI>submit</HI> to them, with the same cheerfulness and self-resignation as he did.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="123"/>There is something indeed in the <HI>Example</HI> of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> which in our Circumstances we are not bound to <HI>imitate</HI>; for he punctually knowing, what God's <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Pleasure</HI> was concerning him, voluntarily chose that <HI>Condition</HI> which he so well knew, God had <HI>allotted</HI> for him.

<P>I shall only here observe what a mighty security this is to all <HI>Good Christi∣ans,</HI> how <HI>absolute</HI> or <HI>Tyrannical</HI> soever the <HI>Power</HI> be under which they live; that they are safe in God's hands, and all the <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Devils</HI> can∣not touch them, till God by a positive <HI>Decree</HI> appoints, and orders their <HI>suf∣ferings.</HI> There could not be greater, nor more <HI>absolute Tyrants,</HI> than the <HI>Roman Emperours</HI> were at this time, and yet they had no <HI>Power</HI> over the <HI>meanest Christian,</HI> but by an express Commission from Heaven.

It is a great security to the World, that there is no evil happens to men, but what God permits, and that he permits nothing but what he can over∣rule to wise and good Ends; but it is a greater happiness to have our Con∣dition immediately allotted by God. God may permit a great many evils to befall us in <HI>Anger</HI> and <HI>Displeasure,</HI> but when he takes us into his immedi∣ate Protection, and under his own Government, whatever evils he appoints for us, whoever are the Instruments of them, they are certainly for our good.

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>To answer this long speech of yours, the best way may be, to shew you first how far I agree with you, and wherein I must differ from you, and I will also tell you what reasons I have for it. In the first place I grant, that though our Saviour was indeed the <HI>Messias,</HI> and true King of the <HI>Iews,</HI> yet was he not such a <HI>Messias</HI> as they expected, nor was he to have a <HI>Temporal,</HI> but <HI>Spiritual Dominion,</HI> and therefore would not be such a king, though the <HI>Iews</HI> would have made him so. I likewise yield, that Christ submitted to the most unjust Sentence, and to the most ignominious, and painful Death, rather than he would <HI>resist</HI> the <HI>Higher Powers</HI>; though he could easily have called for Legions of Angels to his rescue: As also that he rebuked <HI>Peter,</HI> when he drew his Sword in his defence, and tells <HI>Pilate</HI> the reason why he was so easily apprehended, and without any Resistance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Opposition. <HI>My Kingdom</HI> (said he) <HI>is not of this World, if my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight that I should not be delivered to the</HI> Jews; <HI>but now is my Kingdom not from hence.</HI> All which plainly shews that our Saviour's <HI>Subjection</HI> was no matter of <HI>force,</HI> or <HI>constraint,</HI> because he wanted Power to <HI>resist,</HI> but it was matter of <HI>choice,</HI> that which was most suitable to the Nature of his Kingdom, which was not to be propagated by <HI>Carnal Weapons,</HI> but by <HI>sufferings</HI>; yet though it may not be propagated, sure it may be defended by <HI>force.</HI> In some Cases, as if we were invaded by a <HI>Foreign Power,</HI> who made War upon the Account of <HI>Religion,</HI> and also in those <HI>Kingdoms</HI> or <HI>Common-wealths,</HI> where <HI>Christianity,</HI> or the true <HI>Professi∣on</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> is established by Law, and makes a part, not only of the <HI>Ecclesiastical,</HI> but <HI>Civil Constitution</HI> of a <HI>Nation.</HI> In these Cases, if tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e who pretend to the <HI>sole Legislative Power,</HI> (but have it not) should go about to alter the <HI>National Religion</HI> by <HI>force,</HI> and put Men to death con∣trary to the former <HI>Laws,</HI> and <HI>Constitutions</HI> of that <HI>Kingdom,</HI> I think such <HI>Illegal Powers</HI> may lawfully be resisted by the <HI>People,</HI> they having as much <HI>right</HI> to the <HI>free Exercise,</HI> and <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of their <HI>establish'd Religion,</HI> as they have to their <HI>Liberties, Properties,</HI> or any other <HI>Civil Rights</HI>; since by this <HI>Legal Establishment, Religion</HI> becomes a part of the <HI>Civil Constitution</HI> of the Kingdom, and so may be maintained by the same means as other <HI>Rights.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> I grant, that in all other Cases our Saviour hath so far proposed his <HI>sufferings</HI> to us for our <HI>Imitation,</HI> as we are engaged by our <HI>Baptismal Vow,</HI> to suffer in the same <HI>Cause</HI> for which he himself suffered, that is, for the bearing witness, <HI>That Iesus is the Christ,</HI> or <HI>true Messias,</HI> and <HI>Son of God.</HI> And this the <HI>Apostle</HI> calls (speaking of Christ himself) <HI>the witnessing before</HI> Pontius Pilate <HI>a good Confession.</HI> The like I also hold of all such Truths, as are the necessary consequences of this great <HI>Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> I farther grant, that when our God calls any Person to <HI>suffer,</HI> for the Testimony of his Truth, by the Cruelty of those who are the <HI>Supreme Powers,</HI> (as the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and <HI>Primitive Christians</HI> were by a particular <HI>Pro∣vidence,</HI>) that then those Powers are not to be <HI>resisted,</HI> but patiently sub∣mitted to by <HI>Christians</HI> at this day; whenever it proves necessary for the same great ends for which Christ at first enjoyned it, (<HI>viz.</HI>) for bearing witness to the Truth of the <HI>Gospel</HI>; and for the further Propagation thereof by our constant <HI>Sufferings</HI> and <HI>Example,</HI> according to that saying of the
<PB N="231" REF="124"/>
<HI>Primitive Fathers, Sanguis Martyrum, semen Ecclesiae</HI>; yet is not this absolute Submission to the <HI>Supreme Powers</HI> in matters of <HI>Religion</HI> due by the Law of <HI>Nature,</HI> or that delivered to <HI>Moses,</HI> but (if at all) purely from the express <HI>Example of Christ</HI>; so that all the difficulty lyes in discovering, when we are thus called by our <HI>Saviour</HI> to <HI>suffer,</HI> and bear witness to the <HI>Truth</HI>; though with the loss of our Lives, and all that is dear to us.</P>
<P>And therefore, if I should grant that when ever we lye under the same Cir∣cumstances of giving this Testimony as the <HI>Primitive Christians</HI> then did, and that it may serve as much for the same ends design'd by God, thereby we are also under the same Obligations; otherwise I think we are lawfully discharged from it: As for <HI>Example,</HI> suppose the King should, instead of a <HI>Papist,</HI> have turned <HI>Mahometan,</HI> and to propagate, or set up his own abo∣minable <HI>Superstition</HI> here, should have sent for from <HI>Turkey,</HI> or <HI>Morocco</HI> a great Army of <HI>Turks,</HI> or <HI>Moors,</HI> and by them would force all the <HI>Christians</HI> in <HI>England</HI> to turn <HI>Mahometans,</HI> by the same Methods of <HI>Dragooning</HI> Men, and <HI>seizing</HI> their <HI>Estates,</HI> as the <HI>French King</HI> hath exercised upon his <HI>Prote∣stant Subjects.</HI> Can any reasonable Man believe, that we lye under the same Obligation, thus to suffer in a <HI>Country</HI> where the People are all <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> as we were if we had happened to be converted in a <HI>Country</HI> where almost all or the greater part of them were <HI>Mahometans,</HI> or <HI>Heathens,</HI> and where the <HI>Mahometan,</HI> or <HI>Pagan Religion</HI> hath been for many Ages the Established <HI>Religion</HI> of that <HI>Nation</HI> and <HI>Government</HI>?</P>
<P>For in our Case, there is no farther occasion to bear witness to the <HI>Truth</HI> by patient <HI>Suffering</HI> for it; Nor yet of Propagating it by our <HI>Martyrdom</HI>; since all the People amongst whom we live, are sufficient∣ly convinced of the Truth of it: Nor can it be reasonable that our <HI>Sa∣viour</HI> should give up whole <HI>Nations</HI> to be thus <HI>destroyed,</HI> at the <HI>Will</HI> of one, or a few <HI>Men,</HI> only to do that, of which there is no need. <HI>For then Iesus Christ had delivered us up to be meer Slaves, and Vassals to the Will and Humour of every wicked Tyrant,</HI> (which you seem to disapprove) without performing any of those great Ends, for which <HI>He</HI> at first en∣joyned this <HI>Submission.</HI> And though I grant, that the <HI>Afflictions</HI> and <HI>Suf∣ferings</HI> of <HI>Christians,</HI> on the Account of <HI>Religion</HI> are as particularly <HI>ordered</HI> and <HI>determined</HI> by <HI>God,</HI> as those of Christ himself; yet, it is only, as they may be subservient to higher Ends, <HI>viz.</HI> The propagation of his <HI>Religion,</HI> and the <HI>Good,</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> of <HI>Mankind,</HI> which I think cannot be well promoted by supposing, an <HI>irresistible Power</HI> in the <HI>Prince,</HI> or <HI>State,</HI> of rooting <HI>Christianity</HI> quite out of a <HI>Nation,</HI> or <HI>Country,</HI> after it is setled by <HI>Law,</HI> and become the <HI>National Religion</HI> thereof; and of <HI>inslaving</HI> all the <HI>People</HI> of it when ever he pleases And though I take this to be the true <HI>bounds</HI> and <HI>limits</HI> of our <HI>Submission</HI> to the <HI>Supreme Powers</HI> in matters of <HI>Religion.</HI> But supposing not granting at present that <HI>Christ</HI> hath laid any more strict Commands of <HI>Submission</HI> upon us in those matters, yet since he came not into the World to put us into a more miserable Condition in other things, than we were before his Coming, nor to take away, or abridge us of any of those <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>Civil Rights</HI> that we enjoy as <HI>Men</HI> or <HI>Subjects,</HI> therefore if the <HI>People</HI> had a <HI>Right</HI> before Christ, to <HI>defend</HI> their <HI>Lives, Liberties,</HI> or <HI>Properties</HI> against the <HI>violent As∣saults,</HI> and <HI>Oppressions of Princes</HI> or <HI>States,</HI> they have still the same Liberty
<PB N="232" REF="125"/>
left entire in all Cases, which remain not excepted by the express <HI>Precepts</HI> or <HI>Example</HI> of Christ; since it is a general rule in all <HI>positive Laws,</HI> that whatever is not excepted, or altered, by a <HI>subsequent Law,</HI> remains the same as it was before in all other Cases, which are not so particularly ex∣cepted; and therefore though I should grant that it were now unlawful in any case to <HI>resist</HI> the <HI>supream Powers</HI> who <HI>persecute,</HI> or put Men to <HI>death</HI> for bearing witness to Christ's <HI>true Religion</HI>; yet doth it not therefore follow that it were unlawful to <HI>resist</HI> in any other Case whatsoever, though it were in the defence of our <HI>Lives, Liberties,</HI> or <HI>Properties,</HI> since such defence was <HI>lawful</HI> (as I have already proved) before Christ's coming, and is not ex∣presly forbidden by any <HI>Place of Scripture,</HI> or express Command of <HI>Christ</HI> or his <HI>Apostles.</HI></P>
<P>And without the Considerations of these great Ends, that Jesus Christ had to enjoyn his Followers, an <HI>absolute Submission</HI> to the <HI>supream Powers</HI> in some Cases, (tho' not in all) were to suppose, that instead of a merciful Saviour he had only come into the World to patronize Tyranny, and to render the Condition of Mankind much more miserable than it was under the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> or in the State of <HI>Nature,</HI> and seems to suppose that instead of Commiserating Men's <HI>sufferings,</HI> he only took delight to make them miserable; nor will it be any comfort, or security to <HI>Christians</HI> when they are once made Slaves under an <HI>Arbitrary Tyrannical Power, That they are safe in God's hand, and that all the Powers of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n or Devils can't touch them, till God by a Positive Decree appoint, and order their Sufferings:</HI> For if this were a good Argument against all <HI>Resistance,</HI> it would be so likewise against <HI>resist∣ing Pirates</HI> or <HI>Robbers,</HI> since whatever we suffer from them is by God's <HI>po∣sitive Decree,</HI> who thus orders all our <HI>sufferings</HI> even from them; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I think (since men are not now to be saved by <HI>Miracles</HI>) he hath like wise also ordain'd <HI>Resistance</HI> as the only human means to prevent their Malice and Violence; or escape out of their hands when we fall under them; nor are the same ends unlawful against any other <HI>humane Powers,</HI> but what God himself hath ordained.</P>
<P>And therefore it is a very crude Assertion to say, that though there could not be more <HI>absolute Tyrants</HI> than the <HI>Roman Emperours,</HI> yet than they had no Power against the meanest Christian, but by an express <HI>Commission</HI> from Heaven; whereas I never knew as yet (and I would be very glad you could shew it me) where this express <HI>Commission</HI> is to be found, whereby <HI>Princes,</HI> or other <HI>Supream Powers</HI> are Authoriz'd to <HI>persecute, enslave,</HI> or take away the <HI>Lives</HI> of the <HI>meanest Christians,</HI> barely for matters of Opini∣on, or faults that do not immediately concern the publick <HI>quiet</HI> and <HI>safety</HI>; and as you have talk't a great deal of the great <HI>security it is to the World, that no evil can happen to us, but what God permits, and that he permits nothing but what he can over-rule to wise and good Ends, and that God may permit a great many evils to befall us in his Anger and Displeasure, and that whatever Evils be appoints for us, they are certainly for our good, and that therefore there is no such danger in the Doctrine of</HI> Non-resistance <HI>as some Men imagine, because</HI> sincere Christians <HI>can</HI> suffer <HI>nothing by it, since they shall suffer nothing more, or less than what God appoints them to</HI> suffer. All these Arguments might as well be used for not resisting <HI>Pirates,</HI> or <HI>Thieves,</HI> or not endeavouring to divert, or
<PB N="233" REF="125"/>
oppose a River, that had run beyond its <HI>Banks,</HI> but to let it go where it lists to the destruction of a whole <HI>Country,</HI> because forsooth <HI>sincere Christians</HI> can <HI>suffer nothing by it, for they can suffer nothing more nor less than God a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>points them to suffer</HI>; indeed a wondrous use of Consolation. And there∣fore unless you can prove that all <HI>Tyranny</HI> is ordained by God for our good, and that therefore we are obliged under pain of <HI>everl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sting Damnation,</HI> to submit to it; all that you have spoken concerning the <HI>Example</HI> and <HI>sufferings</HI> of Christ signifie just nothing; so that I think the absurdity still lyes at your door, since if Christ has not expresly forbidden all <HI>resistance</HI> of the unjust <HI>violence of Princes,</HI> (as I do not find he has by any of the Texts you have yet brought) every man may <HI>defend</HI> his Life against him, who you grant hath no Authority to <HI>take</HI> it away: and as for its being forbidden by the Laws of our Country, I shall answer that when you urge those Laws to me.</P>

<P>I hope I shall be able to prove that by and by, but in the mean time give me leave to observe, that it seems very strange to me; that you should own Christ hath obliged his Disciples to submit without any <HI>resist∣ance</HI> in some Cases to the <HI>Supreme Powers,</HI> when they persecute them and put them to <HI>death</HI> for <HI>Religion</HI>; and that they might not take up Arms in their own <HI>defence,</HI> and that of their <HI>Religion,</HI> which is the greatest concern that men ought to have in this World; and yet that they might do it for much less considerable Matters, <HI>viz.</HI> their <HI>Lives, Liberties,</HI> or <HI>Estates,</HI> which sure ought to be of much less importance than the <HI>Glory of God,</HI> which is chiefly maintained by his <HI>true Worship</HI>; but I see you have found a <HI>Salvo</HI> for this, and will not allow Princes the <HI>irresistible Power</HI> of <HI>Persecution,</HI> when the <HI>Religion</HI> is once <HI>setled</HI> by <HI>Law</HI>; that is, when the <HI>Christians</HI> were strong enough to resist, which certainly would be no thanks at all, for their Sub∣mission, since Men who are weak and unable to resist, must needs <HI>obey,</HI> and <HI>suffer</HI>; which were matter of force and not of Duty; whereas we find by <HI>Tertullian,</HI> and all the <HI>Ecclesiastical Historians,</HI> that though the <HI>Christians</HI> were strong and numerous enough in the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> yet they chose rather to <HI>dye</HI> than to <HI>resist,</HI> as I shall shew you more particularly anon, when I come to those Quotations; but I will if you please, now proceed to the two last Texts I have to cite to you out of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and St. <HI>Peter.</HI></P>

<P>That we may not confound things one with another, I pray give me leave now to answer what you have objected against what I said last, before you proceed to any fresh places of <HI>Scripture</HI>; for though in the first place I doubt whether the <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> which <HI>Tertullian</HI> and other <HI>Primi∣tive Fathers</HI> so strictly preached up, was sounded upon any express Command of our Saviour or his Apostles; yet granting at present that Christ and his Apostles enjoyn'd it both by their Example and Precept, yet this does not reach the case now before us, for there may be very good Reasons why our Saviour might enjoyn an absolute Submission to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Powers</HI> without any Resistance, though they persecute us, nay, put us to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for Matters of <HI>Religion</HI>; and yet he may allow us greater Liberty for the defence of our <HI>Lives, Liberties,</HI> and <HI>Estates,</HI> when assaulted by the unjust violence of the <HI>supreme Powers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="126"/>For, <HI>First,</HI> our Saviour ordaineth his <HI>Religion</HI> to be suitable to his Person, <HI>viz.</HI> a meek, humble, <HI>Suffering Messiah</HI> to be an Example of a meek, and suffering <HI>Religion. Secondly, Religion</HI> is a thing that no <HI>Power</HI> in the World can take from us, <HI>Persecution</HI> indeed may encrease it, and render it more fervent, but can never diminish it, if it be real. And God hath expresly promis'd so great a Reward in another <HI>Life</HI> for our <HI>sufferings</HI> for it in this, that it will infinitely outweigh all that ever we can suffer on that Account; and <HI>Lastly,</HI> our Saviour Christ was pleased to ordain his <HI>Doctrine</HI> to be pro∣pagated by <HI>Miracles,</HI> and <HI>Sufferings</HI> to distinguish it from all the false <HI>Reli∣gions</HI> that had been in the World before his, or that should be set up in opposition to it afterwards; since neither the <HI>Pagan,</HI> nor <HI>Mahometan Super∣stitions,</HI> nor yet the <HI>Iewish Religion</HI> can shew the like; to <HI>subsist,</HI> nay <HI>encrease</HI> for above three hundred years under such <HI>great</HI> and <HI>cruel Persecutions</HI>; nor yet is the Glory of God at all diminish'd, but rather encreas'd under <HI>Persecu∣tion,</HI> since none are then firm to it, but such as are really perswaded of its Truth; and that they ought to suffer the worst that can befall them, rather than forsake it.</P>
<P>And certainly nothing can tend more to the Glory of God, than to see it <HI>subsist</HI> and <HI>encrease</HI> under a cruel and bloody <HI>Persecution</HI>; nor is it the same reason that we should suffer <HI>Persecution</HI> after <HI>Religion</HI> is become the setled <HI>Constitution</HI> of a <HI>Nation,</HI> because then every man hath the same <HI>Right</HI> to it as he hath to his <HI>Property</HI> or <HI>Freedom</HI>: And though a man may part with either the one or the other, yet is he not obliged to give them up by force, and whether he will or no; so likewise neither that <HI>Right</HI> which he hath to enjoy his <HI>Religion</HI> according to the Laws of his <HI>Country.</HI> And there∣fore I do not resolve the Obligation to <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> in matters of <HI>Religi∣on</HI> into the being the major party in a <HI>Kingdom</HI> as you suppose, for if the Government of <HI>England</HI> were <HI>Popish,</HI> that is, the <HI>Legislative</HI> part of it, and the <HI>Major</HI> part of the <HI>Common People</HI> were <HI>Protestants,</HI> perhaps in that Case they were under all the Obligations of enduring <HI>Persecution</HI> without <HI>re∣sistance,</HI> as they were under the <HI>Heathen Emperours</HI>; but indeed the <HI>Primi∣tive Christians</HI> were obliged to <HI>Non-resistance,</HI> because they lived under a Go∣vernment in which <HI>Christianity</HI> was forbid, and <HI>Paganism</HI> established by Law.</P>
<P>And though it is true, <HI>Constantine</HI> made several Laws, enjoyning the free Exercise of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> and forbidding the <HI>Heathen Sacrifices,</HI> and that the <HI>Pagan Temples</HI> should be shut up; yet was not the <HI>Christian Religi∣on</HI> for all that, the sole <HI>Religion</HI> of the <HI>State</HI>; the <HI>Senators</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the <HI>Major</HI> part of the Common People continuing <HI>Pagans</HI> still. So that it seems the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> was all this while rather established, together with <HI>Heathenism,</HI> than that this was wholly forbid; since all Civil Offices and Preferments were equally conferred upon <HI>Pagans,</HI> as well as <HI>Christians,</HI> if they deserved them; and therefore it was no hard matter for <HI>Iulian</HI> the Apostate, to revoke so many of those Edicts his Uncle had made in Favour of <HI>Christianity,</HI> and to abrogate those, which had been publish't against the publick Sacrifices to the <HI>Heathen Gods,</HI> and shutting up their Temples; so that no wonder if they were now again under the same Obligations to <HI>suffer,</HI> as they were before <HI>Constantine</HI>'s Time; since the <HI>Christian Religion</HI>
<PB N="235" REF="126"/>
was never the only <HI>One</HI> establish't by Law, so as to exclude the open Pro∣fession of any other, till the Time of <HI>Theodosius</HI>; after which, as also be∣fore, according as the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> encreas'd, and as they got greater Priviledges from the Emperours, so were they more stout and bold in <HI>standing up for,</HI> and <HI>defending</HI> the <HI>just Rights</HI> of their <HI>Religion,</HI> when ever they thought them invaded by the <HI>Arian,</HI> or other <HI>Heretical Emperours,</HI> as I shall shew you by several Instances out of <HI>Church-History</HI> when we come to it; but you may now if you please proceed to the rest of those places of Scripture, which you have to produce against this Doctrine of <HI>Resistance</HI> in those Cases I have put.</P>

<P>I have many things still to object against your last <HI>Discourse</HI>; but since it grows late; I shall now continue my self to the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Apo∣stles</HI> concerning <HI>Non-resistance</HI>; not as if the <HI>Authority,</HI> and <HI>Example</HI> of our <HI>Saviour</HI> were not sufficient of it self to make a <HI>Law,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. R.</HI> p. <HI>Ch.</HI> 4. p. 100.</NOTE> but stood in need of the <HI>Confirmation,</HI> and <HI>Additional Authority</HI> of his own <HI>Apostles,</HI> but we might <HI>justly suspect</HI> our selves mistaken in the meaning of our <HI>Saviours</HI> Words, or in the <HI>Intention,</HI> and <HI>design</HI> of his <HI>Sufferings,</HI> had none of his <HI>Apostles</HI> who were immediately <HI>instructed</HI> by <HI>himself,</HI> and acquainted with the most sacred <HI>Mysteries</HI> of his <HI>Kingdom</HI> ever <HI>Preacht</HI> any such <HI>Doctrine,</HI> as this of <HI>Subjection</HI> to <HI>Princes.</HI> And therefore, to give you the more <HI>abundant Assurance</HI> of this, I shall plainly shew you, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> taught the same <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and imitated the <HI>Example</HI> of their great <HI>Master.</HI> I shall begin with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who hath as fully declared himself in this <HI>matter,</HI> as it is possible any <HI>Man</HI> can do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13.1, 2.</NOTE> by <HI>Words. Let every Soul be subject unto the Higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God, the Powers that be, are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God, and they that resist shall receive to themselves Damnation.</HI></P>
<P>This is a very express <HI>Testimony</HI> against <HI>Resistance,</HI> and therefore, I shall consider it at large, for there have been <HI>various Arts</HI> used to pervert every <HI>Word</HI> of it and to make this <HI>Text</HI> speak quite contrary to the <HI>Design,</HI> and <HI>Intention</HI> of the <HI>Apostle</HI> in it: And therefore, I shall <HI>divide</HI> the <HI>Words</HI> into three general parts. 1. The <HI>Doctrine</HI> the <HI>Apostle instructs</HI> them in, <HI>Let eve∣ry Soul be subject to the Higher Powers.</HI> 2. The <HI>Reason,</HI> whereby he proves, and inforces this <HI>Doctrine: For there is no Power, but of God; the Powers that he, are ordained of God. Whoever therefore resisteth the Power resisteth the Ordinance of God.</HI> The <HI>Punishment</HI> of such <HI>Resistance, and they that resist shall receive to themselves Damnation.</HI> I shall begin with the <HI>Do∣ctrine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 102.</NOTE> <HI>That every Soul must be Subject to the Higher Powers,</HI> and here are three things to be explained. 1. Who are con∣tained under this <HI>general Expression</HI> of every <HI>Soul.</HI> 2. Who are meant by the <HI>Higher Powers.</HI> 3. What is meant by being <HI>Subject.</HI> 1. Who are con∣tained under this <HI>general Expression</HI> of <HI>every Soul,</HI> which by an <HI>ordinary He∣braism,</HI> signifies <HI>every Man:</HI> For <HI>Man</HI> is a <HI>Compounded Creature</HI> of <HI>Body,</HI> and <HI>Soul,</HI> and either part of him is very often in <HI>Scripture</HI> put for the whole, sometimes <HI>Flesh,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Soul</HI> signifies the <HI>Man</HI>; and when every <HI>Soul</HI> is oppos'd to the <HI>Higher Powers,</HI> it must signifie <HI>all Men,</HI> of what <HI>Rank,</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="127"/>
or <HI>Condition</HI> soever they be, who are not invested with this <HI>Higher Power.</HI> And again, says he, The design of the <HI>Apostle,</HI> as you shall hear more <HI>par∣ticularly,</HI> by and by, was to <HI>forbid</HI> all <HI>Resistance</HI> of <HI>Soveraign Princes</HI>; and had he <HI>known</HI> of any <HI>Man,</HI> or <HI>Number</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> who might <HI>Lawfully resist,</HI> he ought not to have express't it in such <HI>general Terms,</HI> as to forbid all without <HI>Exception.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore, I shall now a little more closely <HI>examine</HI> your <HI>main Ar∣gument,</HI> or indeed <HI>Foundation</HI> of all that you have <HI>Urged,</HI> for <HI>Resistance, viz.</HI> That, tho' it is <HI>unlawful,</HI> for <HI>private</HI> or <HI>particular Men,</HI> to <HI>resist</HI> the <HI>Su∣pream Powers</HI>; yet that it doth not extend unto the <HI>whole,</HI> or <HI>Major part</HI> of a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople</HI> or <HI>Nation,</HI> whenever they are <HI>outragiously oppress't,</HI> or <HI>assaulted</HI> by the <HI>Higher Powers</HI> beyond what they suppose they are able to <HI>bear</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 103.</NOTE> whereas the Apostle here commands <HI>every Soul to be sub∣ject,</HI> and therefore if the whole body of the People be subject to God, they must also be subject to the <HI>Prince</HI> too, because he acts by God's <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uthority</HI> and <HI>Commission</HI>; were a <HI>Sovereign Prince</HI> the Peoples Creature, that might be a good Maxim; <HI>Rex maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r singulis, sed minor universis, That the King is greater than any particular Subject, but less than All together</HI>; but if he be God's Minister, he is upon that account as much greater than all, as God is.</P>
<P>And that the whole body of the People altogether, as well as one by one,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 104.</NOTE> are equally concerned in this Command of being subject to the <HI>higher Powers,</HI> is evident from this Con∣sideration, that nothing less than this will secure the Peace and Tranquil∣lity of <HI>humane Societies.</HI> The <HI>resistance</HI> of single Persons is more dangerous to themselves, than to the Prince; but a powerful <HI>Combination of Reb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls</HI> is formidable to the most puissant <HI>Monarchs.</HI> The greater Number of Subjects <HI>rebell</HI> against their <HI>Prince,</HI> the more do they <HI>distress</HI> his <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>threaten</HI> his <HI>Crown</HI> and <HI>Dignity</HI>; and if his <HI>Person</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> be <HI>sacred,</HI> the greater the <HI>violence</HI> is which is offered to him, the greater is the Crime.</P>
<P>Had the Apostle exhorted the <HI>Romans</HI> after this manner;
<Q>Let no private and single man be so foolish,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> 104.105.</NOTE> as to <HI>rebel</HI> against his Prince, who will be too strong for him; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f you can raise sufficient <HI>forces</HI> to <HI>oppose</HI> against him, if you can all consent to <HI>depose,</HI> and <HI>murder him,</HI> this is a very <HI>innocent,</HI> and <HI>justifiable,</HI> nay, an <HI>he∣roical Atchievement,</HI> which becomes a <HI>Free-born People</HI>:</Q>
How would this have secured the Peace, and quiet of the World? How would this have agreed with what follows, that Princes are advanced by God, and that to <HI>resist</HI> our Prince, is to <HI>resist</HI> the Ordinance of God, and that such Men shall be severely punish't for it in this World or the next? for can the Apostle be thought absolutely to condemn <HI>Resistance,</HI> if he makes it only unlawful to <HI>resist</HI> when we want Power to conquer? which yet is all that can be made of it, if by every Soul the Apostle means only particular men, not the <HI>united Force</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can there be any reason assigned why the Apostle should lay so strict a Command on particular <HI>Christians</HI> to be subject to the <HI>higher Powers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 106.</NOTE> which doth not equally con∣cern whole Nations. For if it can ever be lawful for a whole Nation to <HI>resist</HI> a Prince, it may in the same Circumstances be equally lawful for a
<PB N="237" REF="127"/>
particular man to do it; if a Nation may conspire against a Prince who <HI>in∣vades</HI> their <HI>Rights,</HI> their <HI>Liberties,</HI> or their <HI>Religion,</HI> why may not any man by the same reason <HI>resist</HI> a Prince when his single <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Liber∣ties</HI> are <HI>invaded</HI>?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib</HI> p. 106.</NOTE> It is not so safe, and prudent indeed for a private man to <HI>resist,</HI> as for great and powerful <HI>Numbers</HI>; but this makes <HI>resistance</HI> only a matter of <HI>Discretion,</HI> not of <HI>Conscience</HI>; if it be lawful for the whole body of a Nation to <HI>resist</HI> in such Cases, it must be equally lawful for a particular man to do it; but he doth it at his own Pe∣ril, when he hath only his own single force to <HI>oppose</HI> against his Prince. So that our Apostle must forbid <HI>resistance</HI> in all men, or none. For single Per∣sons do not use to <HI>resist,</HI> or <HI>rebel,</HI> or there is no great danger to the Publick if they do; but the <HI>Authority</HI> of <HI>Princes,</HI> and the <HI>Security</HI> of <HI>publick Govern∣ment,</HI> is only endangered by a <HI>Combination of Rebels,</HI> when the whole <HI>Nation,</HI> or any considerable part for <HI>Numbers, Power,</HI> and <HI>Interest,</HI> take Arms against their <HI>Prince.</HI> If <HI>resistance</HI> of our <HI>Prince</HI> be a Sin, it is not the less, but the greater sin, the greater and the more formidable the <HI>resistance</HI> is; and it would very much unbecome the gravity and sacredness of an <HI>Apostolical Precept,</HI> to injoyn <HI>Subjection</HI> to private Christians, who dare not, who can∣not <HI>resist</HI> alone; but to leave a powerful <HI>Combination</HI> of <HI>Rebels</HI> at liberty to <HI>resist</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 107.</NOTE> so that every Soul must signifie all Subjects, whether single or united; for whatever is unlawful for every single Person considered as a Subject, is unlawful for them all together; for the whole Nation is as much a subject to the <HI>higher Powers</HI> as any sin∣gle Man. Thus I am sure it is in our Government, where Lords and Commons assembled in <HI>Parliament</HI> own themselves the Subjects of the King, and have by publick Laws disclaimed all Power of raising any War either <HI>offensive,</HI> or <HI>defensive</HI> against the King.</P>
<P>Let us now consider what is meant by the <HI>higher Powers,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) which signifies the <HI>Supream Power</HI> in any Nation, in whom∣soever it is placed, Whether in the <HI>King,</HI> as in <HI>Monarchical Governments</HI>; or in the <HI>Nobles</HI> as in <HI>Aristocratical</HI>; or in the <HI>People</HI> as in <HI>Democracies</HI>; At the time of writing this Epistle, the <HI>Supream Power</HI> was in the <HI>Roman Emperours</HI>; and therefore when St. <HI>Paul</HI> Commands the <HI>Roman Christians</HI> to be Subject to the <HI>higher Powers,</HI> the plain meaning is, that they should be subject to the <HI>Roman Emperour.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.13.</NOTE> And thus St. <HI>Peter</HI> explains it: <HI>Be subject to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords sake,</HI> whether to the King as <HI>Supream,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the word us'd in this Text, as to him who hath a <HI>Supereminent Power,</HI> and is above all others, as also unto <HI>Governours</HI> that are sent by him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From which Text <HI>Epiphanius</HI> proves, that subordinate Magistrates under the King are <HI>ordained</HI> of God.

<P>I hope I shall not be very tedious in answering your long Speech, since a small share of <HI>Natural Reason,</HI> and <HI>Grammar</HI> will do it; therefore to be as short as I can, I do freely acknowledg, that not only private men, but whole Nations are by this <HI>Precept</HI> of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> to be subject to
<PB N="238" REF="128"/>
the <HI>higher Powers,</HI> without any <HI>Rebellion</HI> against them, as well as particu∣lar Persons, as far as they are <HI>Powers</HI> ordain'd by God. And therefore it is necessary, that you should consider what is the true signification of the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which if it be once discovered, you will find it carries its own limitation along with it▪ for it excludes both the <HI>Usurpation</HI> of the <HI>supream Power,</HI> and also the <HI>illegal</HI> and <HI>wicked Exercis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of it; and of this Opinion is the Learned Dr. <HI>Sanderson</HI> in his Lectures of the Obligation of <HI>humane Laws,</HI> where in his 5<HI>th</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecture, § 12. (as I remember) he speaks to this purpose, in answer to an Objection▪ <HI>That then all those who have the Power of the Sword, that is, of compelling those who are under their Power to perform t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir Commands, ought then to be obeyed in Conscience.</HI> His Answer is to this purpose,
<Q>That the Power he means, and on which alone lyes the Obligation of Conscience, is not that Power which the Greeks call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, <HI>Natural,</HI> or <HI>Physical Power</HI> or <HI>Force</HI>; or else that which is only <HI>de facto,</HI> by which any one is able to do whatever he pleases, without any hinderance; but that Power which they call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, <HI>lawful Power,</HI> or of <HI>Right,</HI> to wit, that which belongs to him that hath it by the Law of <HI>Nature, Nations,</HI> or <HI>Civil Constitutions</HI>▪ by rea∣son of the Person who bears it, and in respect of those, who are to be subject to it; to this <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>lawful Authority</HI> the Apostle doth now so much press an exact Obedience, that he names it five times in the space of three Verses, but says not one word of this <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or force.</Q>
So far he. And if our <HI>Transl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ors</HI> of this place had rendred the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Authorities,</HI> instead of <HI>Powers,</HI> as they have rendered it in other Places, and as they were forc'd to do in the first of <HI>Peter</HI> Ch. 3. Ver. 22. where <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> coming together in the same Verse, they are forced to render the former word by <HI>Authorities</HI>▪ and the latter by <HI>Powers,</HI> which if they had constantly done, they had effectually prevented the false application of this Text, since no Man in his Wits can imagi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that when a Prince (for <HI>Example</HI>) <HI>destroys, oppresses,</HI> and <HI>enslaves</HI> his <HI>Subjects,</HI> he acts thus as a <HI>lawful Power</HI> or <HI>Authority,</HI> or that belongs to him (as Dr. <HI>Sanderson</HI> very well expresses it) by any <HI>Natural,</HI> or <HI>Munici∣pal Laws,</HI> much less can be the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>true,</HI> or <HI>just Authorities,</HI> or <HI>Powers</HI> which are here meant by St. <HI>Paul</HI> to be ordain'd by God; and that these words may be so rendred, instead <HI>of the Powers that are,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.

<P>So that if this Text were to be understood in your sense, this place of <HI>Scripture</HI> would serve to <HI>countenance</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> all the <HI>Tyranny, Cruelty,</HI> and <HI>Oppression</HI> which the most wicked <HI>Tyrants</HI> can commit, all which must be ordained by God, by vertue of this equivocal word <HI>Power.</HI> But that you may the better see the absurdity of this <HI>Interpretation,</HI> Pray let us put these things into the <HI>Text</HI> instead of <HI>Powers,</HI> and see how it will run then. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is no <HI>Tyranny, Violence,</HI> or <HI>Oppression</HI> committed by <HI>Princes,</HI> or their <HI>subordinate Officers,</HI> but what is ordained of God. Whosoever therefore <HI>resists</HI> this <HI>Power, resists</HI> the Ordinance of God. You'll say perhaps, that
<PB N="239" REF="128"/>
this is not your meaning, yet is it the true sense that must arise from your <HI>Interpretation</HI> of this place. Which is no more than the Voice of God approving all <HI>just</HI> and <HI>lawful Governments,</HI> and confirming from Heaven those <HI>Moral Duties</HI> of <HI>Submission, Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Non-resistance,</HI> which were always due, and must ever be to <HI>lawful Authority,</HI> that is, such as is agreeable to the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Nature,</HI> which you plainly see are not due to meer <HI>Force, Violence</HI> or <HI>Cruelty,</HI> for that is absolutely excluded out of the Text, which will by no means admit of it. The <HI>higher Powers</HI> ordained by God having no <HI>Commission</HI> from him for any of these wicked Purposes.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt for all your Confidence, that you very much mistake the sense of these Words,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. A. p.</HI> 19.</NOTE> for in the first place your (or rather the Dr's) Criticism between <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> will not do; for they both signifie the same thing in Scripture, either <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> or <HI>Authority,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>I will not be brought under the Power of any thing,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.12. must signifie <HI>force,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> must signifie <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>Dignity</HI>; thus <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1.21. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which are several Names, and degrees of <HI>Dignity,</HI> and <HI>Authority,</HI> as well as <HI>Power.</HI> And in the second place, you do much more mistake, when you suppose by this word <HI>Powers</HI> to be meant only the true, or just Exercise of <HI>Civil Authority,</HI> whereas the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, are the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the persons themselves, who exer∣cise <HI>Authority,</HI> and <HI>Dominion,</HI> the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <HI>Rulers, v.</HI> 3. the Ministers of God which bear the Sword, <HI>v.</HI> 4. in St. <HI>Peter,</HI> the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>▪ the <HI>King,</HI> and his <HI>Governours,</HI> and <HI>Magistrates,</HI> 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> Ch. 2. <HI>v.</HI> 13, 14. And therefore Imust tell you, you do very ill to separate the <HI>Power,</HI> or <HI>Au∣thority</HI> from the Persons instructed with it.</P>
<P>But suppose I should grant you, that this word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> doth here signifie the Exercise of <HI>Authority,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>U. S. A. S.</HI> p. 133.</NOTE> yet doth it not signifie the <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>lawful use</HI> of this <HI>Power,</HI> but the <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>Exercise</HI> this <HI>Authority</HI>; whether well, or ill, 'tis all one, as to the <HI>Submission</HI> due to it, because no <HI>Resistance</HI> can be law∣ful for want of a <HI>superiour Iurisdiction</HI> over it. The truth of this is evident from <HI>Iohn</HI> 19.10, 11. <HI>Pilate</HI> says to Jesus, <HI>Knowest thou not that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> I have Power to crucifie thee, and have Power to release thee,</HI> Jesus grants it, <HI>and answers <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. Thou couldest have no Power against me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> 138.</NOTE> <HI>except it were given thee from above.</HI> And therefore I shall reduce your Argument into the form of a <HI>Syllogism,</HI> that you may more plainly see the absurdity of it. Powers not <HI>ordained</HI> by God, may be <HI>resisted</HI> without danger of <HI>Damnation.</HI></P>
<P>But Powers used <HI>Tyrannically,</HI> are not <HI>ordained</HI> of God,</P>
<P>Therefore we are not forbidden to <HI>resist</HI> them.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Syllogism</HI> the <HI>Minor</HI> is not true; for though <HI>Tyranny</HI> be not the <HI>Ordinance</HI> of God, yet the <HI>Power,</HI> or <HI>Authority</HI> (of which this <HI>Tyranny</HI> is but an <HI>abuse</HI>) is of <HI>Divine Institution</HI>: For though the <HI>Supream Power</HI> is commanded to rule justly, yet is it withal enabled to act otherwise; for the good, or ill use of it is left indifferent in respect of the <HI>Subjects sub∣jection,</HI>
<PB N="240" REF="129"/>
though not of the <HI>Magistrates</HI> commanding, or acting <HI>Power</HI>; so that the abuse of this <HI>Power</HI> doth not make void the <HI>Authority,</HI> though acting contrary to the Laws of <HI>God,</HI> or <HI>Nature.</HI> The Obligation not to <HI>resist</HI> the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> receiving not any Validity from their Justice, nor is it weakened, or annulled by their <HI>violence,</HI> or <HI>injustice. Saul</HI> was God's anointed, and <HI>Pilate</HI> had his <HI>Authority</HI> from above, notwithstanding their high abuse of it.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole matter, I incline to believe, that the reason which made St. <HI>Paul</HI> call the Magistrates by the <HI>abstract, Powers,</HI> was this▪ He wrote to Christians living in the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> and it was the Custom of the Latin Tongue to call <HI>Persons</HI> endued wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Power,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> p. 133.</NOTE> <HI>Potestates.</HI> You may observe it in <HI>Ulpi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, L quid sit.

Thus anciently the <HI>Latin</HI> word for the <HI>Chief Iustice,</HI> was <HI>Iustitia,</HI> as you may find in <HI>Glanvil, Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 6. and <HI>Roger Hoveden</HI>'s Annals; so our King is called in the <HI>abstract, Majesty,</HI> as the <HI>Graecian Emperours</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>Many dangerous Consequences flow from thence, but I desire not to make sport with that unhappy distinction, which had almost ruined as flourishing, and strongly temper'd a Kingdom as any in the Christian World. It exposes <HI>Magistrates,</HI> and all in <HI>Authority,</HI> to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Injuries of the basest sort of People; for when discontented, it is ve∣ry obvious for them to tell them, tho' Reverence is indeed due to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Function, yet that setting their Office aside, they will take the liberty only to kick their Persons, and that the <HI>Magistrate</HI> is not at all affronted, though the Man be soundly beaten. Indeed it is against common sense to put such a difference between the <HI>Person</HI> and the <HI>Authority</HI> of <HI>Kings,</HI> for if it were real, neither God, nor the <HI>Laws</HI> of the <HI>Land</HI> have made any Provision for the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>safety</HI>; for his <HI>Authority</HI> is not capable of receiving any benefit, and therefore it must be acknowledged by all sober and reasonable men, that this <HI>Authority</HI> doth but convey such and such <HI>Priviledges</HI> upon the <HI>Person,</HI> who only can be sensible of them, and con∣sequently whatever is attempted again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his <HI>Person,</HI> is attempted against his <HI>Authority</HI> likewise.</P>

<P>I doubt you will have no better luck in <HI>Criticisms,</HI> than my se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, and that they will do your cause as little good; for if there be no diffe∣rence in the Scripture between <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as you affirm, and that both of them signifie, not the <HI>Authority</HI> alone, but the Persons en∣dued

<P>But since you will needs have these <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, not to signifie Powers, or Authorities, but the Persons themselves, you shall have your will for once, only I pray now Answer me one short Question, when for Example, <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>sixth</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> fell mad, and would have killed his Servants, by what Authority did they distinguish and separate between his Person, and his Power? and thought that they might very well <HI>resist</HI> and <HI>bind</HI> the one, without any <HI>Diminution</HI> to the other. Or by what Right did the <HI>Portugueses</HI> seize, and imprison their late King, and make his Brother <HI>Regent</HI> in his Room because the former used sometimes in a Frolick to murder his Subjects, out of the Win∣dow, or as he met them upon the way, and was besides found by Reason of incurable Folly to be utterly uncapable to govern?

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>These Instances of the Folly and Madness of Princes are the main things that you Gentlemen of <HI>Common-wealth</HI> Principles have to defend them withal; but to shew you there is a great difference be∣tween <HI>Mad,</HI> or <HI>Foolish,</HI> Princes, and <HI>Tyrants,</HI> who are in their Right Wits, I will shew you my Reasons, why the one may be bound, or resi∣ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ and not the other. In the first place, I suppose, you will not de∣ny, but that <HI>Folly,</HI> and <HI>Madness</HI> do so far incapacitate the <HI>Persons,</HI> that are under those misfortunes, that they hinder them from acting like <HI>ration<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Men,</HI> much more from performing any of the <HI>functions</HI> of <HI>Ci∣vil Government.</HI> In the next place, they ought to be <HI>restrained</HI> for the <HI>Common good</HI> of their People, as well as themselves, lest they should not only Murder and Hurt their Subjects, but themselves too. And lastly, because it is the highest Courtesie, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enefit, that can be done such Mad, or Foolish Princes, to <HI>shut them up close,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inder them from exposing their Folly, and Madness, and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dring themselves <HI>ridiculous</HI> to the World; whereas a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> whom I suppose in his Right Wits, tho' he never so much <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nslaves</HI> or <HI>oppresses</HI> his People▪ yet <HI>Civil Gov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn∣ment</HI> may be well enough carried on, and maintained under his <HI>Per∣sonal Conduct,</HI> and as long as he hath Wit and Sense enough to <HI>govern,</HI> he is so long to be <HI>obeyed</HI> as the <HI>Ordinance of God,</HI> without any <HI>Resi∣stance</HI> whatsoever.</P>

<P>But this much I suppose you will not deny, but that this Power of <HI>resisting,</HI> and shutting up <HI>Mad,</HI> or <HI>foolish</HI> Princes is wholy exercised by the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> since I never heard of any <HI>Civil,</HI> or <HI>Munic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pal Law</HI> that made Provision for it.</P>

<P>I shall not much dispute that with you, it may be so, but what do you inferr from thence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, no more than this, that if I can prove to you, that there is no such great difference, between <HI>Mad-men,</HI> and <HI>Fools,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>incurable Tyrants</HI> (as you imagine) there is a like <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght</HI> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople by the <HI>Law of Nature</HI> to <HI>resist,</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> themselves again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the <HI>one</HI> as the <HI>other</HI>; and therefore I will examine each of your three Rea∣sons, one after another, and see whether they may not as well be ap∣plied to such <HI>Tyrants,</HI> whom alone I suppose may be <HI>resisted,</HI> as to <HI>Mad-men,</HI> or <HI>Fools,</HI> and if they do, I suppose you wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l not deny the Consequence. Your first Reason is, that <HI>Folly,</HI> and <HI>Madness</HI> do so far <HI>incapacitate</HI> their Reasons that are under those Misfortunes, that they hinder them from acting like <HI>rational men,</HI> much more from perform∣ing any of the <HI>functions</HI> of <HI>Civil Government:</HI> Now pray tell me, doth no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Anger, Lust, Pride, Cruelty,</HI> and <HI>Ambition,</HI> and <HI>unreasonable Self-love</HI> which are the Passions, and Vices which disturb the Souls of <HI>Tyrants,</HI> and make them to take a delight to <HI>enslave, destroy,</HI> and <HI>oppress</HI> their Subjects, as much <HI>incapacitate</HI> their Reasons for performing these <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un∣ctions</HI> of <HI>Civil Governments,</HI> as Folly and Madness themselves? and I think I have already proved, that when <HI>Princes</HI> bring things to this Pass, they do as much deserve <HI>Tutors</HI> or <HI>Guardians</HI> to keep them from doing mischief, and to manage their Kingdoms for them, as the most Mad, or Foolish Prince we have read of in History: But the mischief of it is, that such <HI>Tyrants,</HI> not being <HI>Mad enough</HI> to be <HI>shut up</HI> like <HI>Mad-men,</HI> or <HI>Fools,</HI> nor yet having <HI>Iudgment,</HI> nor <HI>Good Nature</HI> sufficient to perform the <HI>Main Ends</HI> of <HI>Civil Government,</HI> by the greatness of the Rewards that they are able to bestow upon their followers, they may soon bring the <HI>best Government</HI> into a State of <HI>War,</HI> and <HI>Confusion:</HI> And till then, I do not allow their <HI>Subjects</HI> to <HI>resist</HI> them.</P>
<P>Your next Reason is, that they ought to be <HI>restrained</HI> for the <HI>Com∣mon good</HI> of their People, as well as themselves; lest they should not only hurt, or Murder their Subjects, but themselves too. Now, pray consider, if these Mad, and Foolish Princes may be <HI>restrained,</HI> and <HI>re∣sisted,</HI> because they only Murder, or hurt a <HI>few</HI> of their <HI>Subjects,</HI> that may come in their way; then have not such <HI>Tyrants</HI> much greater Rea∣son to be <HI>resisted,</HI> and secured, that through <HI>unreasonable revenge</HI> or <HI>Su∣perstition,</HI> make War upon and <HI>destroy</HI> the People, for no other cause, but because they will <HI>not Submit</HI> themselves to their <HI>unreasonable Lusts</HI>? Or that burn Cities, Massacre whole Towns of Innocent Subjects, and enslave, and oppress a late flourishing Kingdom; ought not <HI>these</HI> as well to be <HI>restrained</HI> or <HI>resisted</HI> for the <HI>Common good</HI> of Mankind, tho' perhaps they will not hurt or <HI>make themselves away,</HI> as <HI>Mad men</HI> or <HI>Fools</HI> may?
<PB N="243" REF="130"/>
Or can any reasonable Man show me, why the <HI>Extravaganoles</HI> of such Mad or Foolish Princes may be <HI>resisted,</HI> but the furious, wicked and <HI>Tyrannical Actions</HI> of the other, must be <HI>submitted</HI> to as the Ordinance of God? Or lastly, why a <HI>Natural Infirmity,</HI> or Weakness, such as Folly, or Frenzy, shall make a Prince <HI>uncapable</HI> of Government, and why <HI>insufferable Tyranny,</HI> which is but a <HI>moral Disability,</HI> shall give Princes a <HI>greater Priviledge,</HI> I cannot understand; since the <HI>latter</HI> is much <HI>more destructive</HI> to the main Ends of Government, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Preservation, and good of the People, than the <HI>former</HI> can possibly be.</P>
<P>As for your last Reason, that it is the <HI>highest Courtesie,</HI> that can be done to such <HI>Mad,</HI> and <HI>Foolish</HI> Princes to shut them up and hinder them from exposing their Folly and Madness, and rendring themselves <HI>ridicu∣lous</HI> to the World, I think the Reason will hold more strongly for the one, than the other. For as such Foolish and Mad Princes would, if they could come to themselves, thank those, who had done them so charitable an Office as to resist them, and shut them up; So likewise, I verily believe, that if the <HI>Grace of God,</HI> or some <HI>Natural Means</HI> or Acci∣dent could so far open the Eyes of <HI>such a Tyrant,</HI> as to let him <HI>see</HI> the <HI>Folly,</HI> and <HI>Wickedness</HI> of those Courses he takes against the People, he would, instead of being Angry, thank his Subjects for <HI>resisting</HI> him, because, thereby they had not only hindred him from making himself any far∣ther the <HI>Common-hatred</HI> of his own Subjects, as well as his Neighbours; but also from committing such <HI>hainous Sins</HI> and <HI>Offences</HI> against <HI>God,</HI> as <HI>Murder, Violence</HI> and <HI>Oppression.</HI> To conclude, I grant, that as long as a <HI>Cruel,</HI> or <HI>Wicked Prince</HI> can so far restrain his Vices and Passions, as to maintain the <HI>Ends</HI> of <HI>Civil Government</HI> above mentioned, he is to be <HI>O∣beyed</HI> as the <HI>Ordinance of God:</HI> But when he will set no Bounds to his Tyranny, but resolves that his Lust shall be unconfined, whereby he be∣comes insupportable to his People, they may as well <HI>distinguish</HI> his <HI>Per∣son,</HI> from his <HI>Power,</HI> as they do in the Case of Princes, when they are either <HI>Fools</HI> or <HI>mad Men.</HI></P>

<P>But Pray consider the rest of the Consequences, of my last Discourse, and will not then the supposing a <HI>Power</HI> in the People of ma∣king this <HI>Distinction</HI> when they please, and of Judging when the Prince's <HI>Government</HI> becomes <HI>intolerably Tyrannical,</HI> make them to take upon them to judge it so, when it is <HI>quite otherwise</HI>; and so not scruple to <HI>Rebel,</HI> or to <HI>Resist,</HI> (as you call it) when ever they are in the mind to do it? And we have the more reason to be afraid of this because from the <HI>Long Parliaments</HI> and their <HI>Adherents</HI> making use of this <HI>Distinction</HI> among other <HI>Specious Pretences,</HI> were derived all the <HI>Miseries</HI> of our last <HI>Civil War.</HI> And therefore, tho' I own it is an <HI>easie thing</HI> to judge of the <HI>Mad∣ness</HI> and <HI>Folly</HI> of Princes as well as other men, yet (the <HI>Wickedness</HI> and <HI>Partiality</HI> of <HI>Human Nature</HI> consider'd,) it is a much <HI>harder Task</HI> to judge rightly, <HI>what Actions</HI> of Princes are <HI>destructive</HI> to <HI>Civil Government,</HI> and tender them as <HI>uncapable</HI> of it, as the most <HI>Extravagant Actions</HI> of <HI>Foolish</HI> and <HI>Mad</HI> Princes can be pretended to make them so.</P>

<P>If the Instance of <HI>mad Men</HI> and <HI>Fools</HI> seem to displease you, because it is very pat to the Subject in hand, I think I may likewise re∣mark, that those <HI>Inconveniences,</HI> you suppose of making the <HI>People Iudges</HI> in this Case, is the <HI>Sole Objection,</HI> I can find you have against what I have said; for otherwise I do not see you have any thing to alledge against the fitness of the Parallel. But I have already, I believe, made it pretty plain, that <HI>Murdering, Enslaving</HI> and <HI>Robbing</HI> of the People of their <HI>Properties</HI> are thing <HI>as easie</HI> to be Judged of, as <HI>Folly</HI> or <HI>Mad∣ness,</HI> and if a <HI>few Domesticks</HI> about the Prince shall be allowed to <HI>Iudge,</HI> when their Monarch is <HI>mad</HI> or <HI>foolish</HI> enough to be <HI>resisted,</HI> and <HI>shut up</HI>; I cannot see any Reason, why the <HI>whole Body of the People,</HI> may not as well be able to <HI>Iudge,</HI> when, by his <HI>Tyranny</HI> and <HI>Oppression,</HI> he hath <HI>dis∣solved</HI> the <HI>Government,</HI> and entered into a <HI>State of War</HI> with them.</P>
<P>But to return now to the <HI>last part</HI> of your former Answer, wherein you grant that this word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, doth sometimes signifie not onely the <HI>Person,</HI> but the <HI>Exercise</HI> of <HI>Authority</HI>; but that it doth not signifie the <HI>Right</HI> or <HI>Lawful Use</HI> of it, but <HI>Abuse</HI> too; and for the Proof of this, you alledge the Speech of <HI>Pilate</HI> to our <HI>Saviour</HI>; I am very well satis∣fied, that that Text will make nothing for your Purpose; For tho' I grant that the <HI>Word</HI> in that place denotes <HI>Power,</HI> or <HI>Authority,</HI> yet doth it not there signifie the <HI>Abuse</HI> of it too? For certainly, <HI>Pilate</HI> would never have told our <HI>Saviour,</HI> that he had a Power to <HI>abuse</HI> his Autho∣rity, and to <HI>condemn</HI> him, tho' <HI>innocent</HI>: Neither would our <HI>Saviour</HI> have answered him, that he had that Power <HI>from above.</HI> And therefore, I think I may very well maintain my <HI>Syllogism</HI> to be true, notwithstand∣ing your denying of the <HI>Minor Proposition</HI>; For since you cannot affirm <HI>Tyranny</HI> to be the <HI>Ordinance of God,</HI> yet that the <HI>Power</HI> or <HI>Authority,</HI> of which this <HI>Tyranny</HI> is but an <HI>Abuse,</HI> is of <HI>Divine Institution</HI>; which is but a <HI>Fallacy</HI> if it be lookt into. For tho' you may, vulgarly speaking, call all <HI>Tyranny</HI> an <HI>Abuse</HI> of <HI>Civil Power,</HI> yet <HI>some Tyranny</HI> is more than that. For it is not so properly an <HI>Abuse,</HI> as a <HI>Corruption</HI> of it, into quite ano∣ther thing▪ which <HI>God never Instituted,</HI> and consequently therefore is <HI>not to be submitted</HI> to out of Conscience. It is an old saying, <HI>Corruptio op∣timi, est pessima,</HI> and you may as well tell me, that <HI>Vinegar,</HI> notwith∣standing its <HI>Acidity,</HI> continues <HI>Wine</HI> still, as that <HI>Civil Government,</HI> when it degenerates into the rankest <HI>Tyranny,</HI> continues still <HI>Gods Ordinance</HI>? and if this be the true Consequence you draw from your Argument, it sig∣nifies little, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Abuse</HI> of this <HI>Power,</HI> doth not make void the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> or <HI>Nature.</HI> For I think I may maintain the clear contrary to what you assert, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Obligation not to resist Supream Powers,</HI> doth receive some <HI>Validity</HI> from the <HI>Iustice</HI> they execute, and is <HI>weakened,</HI> and at last <HI>annulled</HI> by their <HI>Intolerable Vio∣lence,</HI> or <HI>Injustice.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are your Instances of <HI>Saul,</HI> or <HI>Pilate</HI> to the Question in hand; I grant <HI>Saul</HI> was <HI>God's Anointed,</HI> and could <HI>not</HI> have been <HI>Lawfully re∣sisted</HI> by <HI>David,</HI> notwithstanding his Murdering of <HI>Abimelech,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Priests</HI>; And <HI>Pilate</HI> might have his <HI>Authority from above,</HI> notwithstanding
<PB N="245" REF="131"/>
his <HI>Abuse</HI> of it; Yet doth it not therefore follow, that if either the <HI>one,</HI> or the <HI>other,</HI> had declared themselves <HI>Sworn Enemies</HI> to the <HI>whole Nation</HI> of the <HI>Iews,</HI> and that instead of <HI>Governing</HI> and <HI>Protecting</HI> them, they had gone about utterly to <HI>destroy</HI> them, I think they had then ceased to be the <HI>Ordinance of God,</HI> and their <HI>Divine Commission</HI> had been at an end. To conclude, as for the Reason you give, why St. <HI>Paul</HI> might call the <HI>Roman Emperours</HI> by the Name of <HI>Powers,</HI> I shall not deny it: But whe∣ther by the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Apostle means <HI>Persons</HI> or <HI>Powers,</HI> is much at one, for if he means the <HI>former,</HI> he only urges <HI>Obedience</HI> to them as they are the <HI>means</HI> of the <HI>Happiness,</HI> and <HI>Preservation</HI> of the People, as appears by the Third and Fourth Verses of the Chapter you now quote, where the main Reason St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives for our Obedience, is, That Rulers <HI>are not a Terror to God Works, but to the Evil,</HI> and that <HI>He,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> the Supream Power) <HI>is a Minister to us for our Good</HI>; and indeed it had been a very odd way of enforcing our <HI>Obedience,</HI> for him to have said the quite con∣trary, that this <HI>Power</HI> was to be <HI>Obeyed,</HI> because he was a <HI>Terror to good Works,</HI> and a <HI>Plague to all good Men,</HI> and a <HI>Minister</HI> to us of all manner of <HI>mischief</HI> and <HI>misery.</HI> This had been an excellent way of proving the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> to be the <HI>Ordinance of God.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I can give you a full Answer to what you have now said; I must beg leave to look back to the <HI>beginning</HI> of your <HI>first An∣swer,</HI> where you <HI>object,</HI> that if by the <HI>higher Powers</HI> here mentioned, the <HI>Persons,</HI> and not the <HI>Authority</HI> of those in Power are to be <HI>understood,</HI> then it would follow, that <HI>Tyrants</HI> and <HI>Usurpers</HI> are likewise the <HI>Powers ordained of God,</HI> which Objection, I think, may admit of an easie An∣swer:
<Q>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. R. p.</HI> 120.</NOTE> can there be no wise Reason given why God may advance a <HI>bad man</HI> (or <HI>Tyrant</HI>) to be a <HI>Prince▪</HI> If there may, then it is no Reproach to the <HI>Divine Provi∣dence.</HI> The <HI>Natural End</HI> of <HI>Human Societies</HI> is the <HI>Preservation</HI> of <HI>pub∣lick Peace</HI> and <HI>Order</HI>; and this is in <HI>some measure</HI> attained even under the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Tyrants</HI>: But God hath a farther end than this, to bless and reward a virtuous Nation, or to punish a loose and degene∣rate Age; and there cannot be a greater Blessing, than a <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Virtu∣ous Prince,</HI> nor a <HI>greater Plague,</HI> than a <HI>merciless Tyrant.</HI> And there∣fore the Providence of God, is as much concerned in setting a <HI>good,</HI> or a <HI>bad Prince</HI> over any People, as in rewarding, or punishing them. Upon this account God calls <HI>the King of</HI> Assyria <HI>the Rod of his Anger,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 10.5.6.</NOTE> <HI>whom he raised up for the punishment of an hypocritical Nation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Secondly,
<Q>I have already proved, that by the <HI>Powers</HI> in this <HI>Text,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 121.</NOTE> the <HI>Apostle</HI> means the <HI>Persons</HI> of <HI>Soveraign Princes,</HI> and therefore, according to his Doctrine, those <HI>Princes</HI> who were then in Being, that is, the <HI>Roman Emperours,</HI> were advanced by God; <HI>the Powers that be,</HI> that is, the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Emperours</HI> who now govern the World, are ordained and appointed by God, and that thus it is God himself tells us.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ierem.</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>v.</HI> 5.6.</NOTE> <HI>I have made the Earth, and given it to whom it seemed meet unto me,
<PB N="246" REF="132"/>
and now I have given all these Lands into the hands of</HI> Nebuchadnezzar, <HI>King of</HI> Babylon, my Servant.</Q></P>
<P>This was also the Belief of the <HI>Primitive Christians</HI> under <HI>Heathen</HI> and <HI>persecuting Emperours.</HI>
<Q><HI>Tertullian,</HI> who wrote his Apology under <HI>Severu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> asserts, that <HI>Caesar</HI> was chosen by <HI>God,</HI> and therefore that the <HI>Christians</HI> had a <HI>Peculiar</HI> Propriety in <HI>Caesar,</HI> as being made <HI>Emperour</HI> by their God. So likewise St. <HI>Augustine, de Civitate Dei,</HI> speaks to this purpose (as I remember)?</Q>
<Q><HI>God</HI> giveth <HI>Happiness</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Heaven</HI> to the <HI>Godly alone:</HI> But this <HI>Earthly Kingdom,</HI> both to the <HI>Godly,</HI> and <HI>Ungodly,</HI> as it pleases him. He that gave the <HI>Government</HI> to <HI>Marius,</HI> gave it also to <HI>Caesar</HI>: He who gave it to <HI>Augustus,</HI> gave it also to <HI>Nero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> He who gave it to the <HI>Vespasians</HI> Father and Son, most <HI>beloved Emperours,</HI> gave it also to the <HI>most cruel Domitian</HI> (and not to recount the rest of them) He who gave it to <HI>Constantine</HI> the <HI>Christian,</HI> gave it also to the <HI>Apostate Iulian.</HI> These things without doubt, the only True God governed as he pleased, by <HI>Causes</HI> tho' hidden, yet not <HI>unjust.</HI></Q>
So likewise almost all the rest of the Fathers do own, that <HI>Wicked</HI> and <HI>Tyrannical Princes</HI> are given as <HI>Punishments</HI> to the <HI>People</HI> for their Sins, and so upon this ac∣count are to be <HI>endured,</HI> and <HI>not resisted,</HI> since it is <HI>God's Will</HI> to have it so.
<Q>But as for Usurpers, I think I can give you a very sa∣tisfactory Answer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. R. p.</HI> 128.</NOTE> for the most <HI>prosperous Rebel</HI> is not the <HI>higher Power,</HI> while our <HI>natural Prince,</HI> to whom we owe Obedience and Subjection, is in being: And therefore, tho' <HI>such men</HI> may get the <HI>Power</HI> into their hands by <HI>God's Permission,</HI> yet not by <HI>God's Ordinance,</HI> and he who <HI>Resisteth</HI> them doth <HI>not Resist the Ordinance of God,</HI> but the <HI>Usurpations</HI> of Men. Whereas in <HI>Heredita∣ry Kingdoms</HI> the <HI>King</HI> never dies, but the same Minute, that the <HI>Na∣tural Person</HI> of a <HI>King</HI> dies, the Crown descends upon the next of Blood; And therefore, he who <HI>Rebelleth</HI> against the <HI>Father,</HI> and <HI>murders</HI> him, continues a <HI>Rebel</HI> in the Reign of the <HI>Son,</HI> which commences with his <HI>Fathers Death.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>It is otherwise indeed, where <HI>none</HI> can pretend a <HI>greater Right</HI> to the Crown than the <HI>Usurper</HI>▪ for there the <HI>Possession</HI> of Power seems to give a <HI>Right.</HI> Thus many of the <HI>Roman Emperours,</HI> came to the Crown by very ill means,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 129.</NOTE> but when they were <HI>pos∣sest</HI> of it, they were then the <HI>higher Powers:</HI> For the <HI>Empire</HI> did not descend by <HI>Inheritance,</HI> but sometimes by the <HI>Election</HI> of the <HI>Senate,</HI> sometimes of the <HI>Army,</HI> and sometimes by <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> which always draws a <HI>Consent</HI> (and Submission) after it. And therefore, the <HI>Apostle</HI> doth not direct the <HI>Christians</HI> to inquire by what <HI>Title</HI> the <HI>Emperours</HI> held their <HI>Crowns,</HI> but commands them to <HI>submit</HI> to those who had the <HI>Power in their hands.</HI> For the Possession of the <HI>Supream</HI> and <HI>Soveraign Power</HI> is <HI>Title</HI> enough, when there is no <HI>better Title</HI> to oppose against it, for then we must presume, that God gives him the <HI>Irresistible Authority</HI> of a <HI>King,</HI> to whom, he gives an <HI>Irresisti∣ble Power</HI>; which is the only means, whereby <HI>Monarchies</HI> and <HI>Empires</HI> are transferred from one Nation to another: There are two Exam∣ples
<PB N="247" REF="132"/>
in Scripture, which manifestly confirm, what I have now said.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The first is in the Kingdom of <HI>Israel,</HI> after the <HI>Ten Tribes</HI> had divided from the <HI>Tribe</HI> of <HI>Iudah,</HI> and the Family of <HI>David,</HI> where God had <HI>not entailed</HI> the Kingdom upon any <HI>certain Family.</HI></Q>
For after <HI>Ieroboam</HI> the first King, it is plain by the Story in the Books of <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Chronicles,</HI> that for some <HI>Successions,</HI> there was nothing but <HI>Rebellion,</HI> and the <HI>Murder</HI> of one King by another, so that the Kingdom <HI>rarely descended</HI> from the Fa∣ther to the Son▪ and in the <HI>whole Succession</HI> of these Kings, it only re∣mained in the House of <HI>Ie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u</HI> for <HI>four Generations,</HI> and then it returned to its former <HI>uncertainty,</HI> as you may see in the 15<HI>th. Chap.</HI> of the 2<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>Kings:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 131.</NOTE>
<Q>All which plainly shews that where there is no <HI>regular Succession</HI> to a Kingdom, there <HI>Possession of Power</HI> makes a King, who yet cannot afterwards be <HI>resisted</HI> and <HI>opposed</HI> without the Guilt of <HI>Treason</HI>; And this was the Case of the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> at the Writing of this <HI>Epistle</HI>: And therefore the <HI>Apostle</HI> might then very well say, that <HI>the Powers that be, are ordai∣ned of God,</HI> and that whoever had the <HI>Supream Power</HI> in his hands, was the <HI>Supream Power,</HI> that might <HI>not be resisted.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>But it was otherwise in the Kingdom of <HI>Iudah,</HI> which God himself had <HI>entailed</HI> on <HI>David's</HI> Family, as appears from the Examples of <HI>Ioash</HI> and <HI>Athaliah,</HI> which we discoursed of at our last meeting but one; which Examples plainly shew, that <HI>no Usurpations</HI> can extinguish the <HI>Right</HI> and Title of a <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>Hereditary Prince</HI>; such <HI>Usurpers,</HI> tho' they have the <HI>Possession</HI> of the <HI>Supream Power,</HI> yet they have <HI>no Right</HI> to it, and tho' <HI>God</HI> for wise Reasons, may sometimes permit <HI>such Usurpati∣ons,</HI> yet whilst his <HI>Providence</HI> secures the <HI>Persons</HI> of such <HI>deposed</HI> and <HI>ba∣nished Princes</HI> from Violence, he secures their <HI>Title</HI> too.</Q></P>
<P>But to prove more plainly that <HI>no Resistance</HI> is to be made against the <HI>Persons</HI> or <HI>Authorities</HI> of the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> let them be never <HI>so Cruel</HI> and <HI>Tyrannical,</HI> as it is evident not only from what St. <HI>Paul</HI> hath here written; but I shall crave leave to insist farther on that <HI>Text</HI> of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> before cited in his 1<HI>st.</HI> Epistle 2<HI>d. Chap.

<P>You have made a pretty <HI>long reply,</HI> and I have heard it <HI>patient∣ly,</HI> because I confess, that on this depends the <HI>whole Controversie</HI> be∣tween us; and therefore, I shall beg that you would hear me with the <HI>like Patience,</HI> because what you have now said, I grant to be of <HI>that weight</HI> as to require a <HI>large,</HI> as well as a <HI>considerable Reply.</HI> And therefore, I shall make bold to consider the <HI>last part</HI> of your speech in the <HI>first place,</HI> because I can soonest dispatch it: As for your Argu∣ment, that we ought to be <HI>Subject</HI> to the most <HI>Tyrannical Governours</HI> without any <HI>Resistance,</HI> because <HI>Claudius</HI> or <HI>Nero,</HI> whom you suppose to be <HI>cruel Tyrants,</HI> then governed the <HI>Empire,</HI> and persecuted the Christians.</P>
<P>In Answer to this, I must tell you, that if you please better to consider of it, you will find it <HI>very doubtful,</HI> whether St. <HI>Paul</HI> wrote this <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Romans</HI> during the Reigns of <HI>Claudius,</HI> or <HI>Nero.</HI> The Learned <HI>Monsieur Capel</HI> in his Discourse which he hath written, on purpose, concerning the time of the writing of <HI>this Epistle,</HI> proves this <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> to have been written during the <HI>latter End</HI> of the Reign of <HI>Claudius.</HI> But those <HI>Learned Men,</HI> who will have it writ∣ten during the Reign of <HI>Nero,</HI> do all <HI>agree,</HI> that it was in the <HI>begin∣ning</HI> of it within the <HI>first five years,</HI> when the <HI>Administration</HI> of Af∣fairs was under the <HI>Ministry</HI> of <HI>Seneca,</HI> and <HI>Burrhus,</HI> and when the <HI>Go∣vernment</HI> of the Empire, was most <HI>just</HI> and <HI>moderate,</HI> and divers years before ever <HI>Nero</HI> burnt the <HI>City,</HI> or persecuted the <HI>Christians,</HI> and did so many <HI>extravagant Cruel,</HI> and <HI>Tyrannical Actions,</HI> as forced the <HI>Se∣nate</HI> to declare him the <HI>Enemy</HI> of Mankind.

<P>I pray Sir, give me leave to interrupt you a little; Did not <HI>Claudius</HI> persecute the <HI>Christians,</HI> when under the Notion of <HI>Iews</HI> he banished them from <HI>Rome,</HI> as appears by <HI>Acts</HI> the eighteenth, when <HI>Aquila,</HI> and <HI>Priscilla</HI> were forced to quit <HI>Italy</HI> and come into <HI>Greece,</HI> because of that <HI>Edict</HI>? And yet it was this very <HI>Claudius,</HI> to whom St. <HI>Peter</HI> (if not St. <HI>Paul</HI>) doth require <HI>all Men</HI> to be <HI>Subject</HI> without <HI>any Resistance.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think this difficulty will easily be answered, for in the first place, tho' I grant that <HI>Claudius</HI> towards the <HI>latter End</HI> of his Reign banished the <HI>Iews</HI> from <HI>Rome,</HI> yet did he not banish the <HI>Christians</HI> from thence, as we know of, any otherwise than as they were <HI>Iews</HI> by <HI>Nation,</HI> and upon this account it was, that <HI>Aquila</HI> being a <HI>Iew</HI> by Birth, was forced to quit <HI>Rome</HI> with the rest; but neither <HI>Suetonius,</HI> nor any <HI>other Author</HI> tell us, that he likewise banished the <HI>Christians,</HI> tho' I know indeed there are some learned Men, that would interpret this Passage in the former Author, in his life of <HI>Claudius: Iudaeos tu∣multuantes, impulsante Cresto Româ expulit:</HI> to be meant of the <HI>Christi∣ans</HI> being expelled <HI>Rome,</HI> as instigated by <HI>Christ</HI> their Prophet to <HI>Se∣dition.</HI> But tho' I own that our <HI>Saviour,</HI> was sometimes called <HI>Chre∣stus</HI> by the <HI>Pagans,</HI> by way of <HI>contempt,</HI> yet, that by this <HI>Chrestus</HI> here mentioned, cannot be understood our <HI>Saviour Christ,</HI> is very evident, for it had been very improbable, for <HI>Suetonius</HI> to have made <HI>Christ</HI> who was dead above thirty years before, to have <HI>excited</HI> the <HI>Iews</HI> to <HI>Sedition</HI>: And therefore, the Lord Primate <HI>Usher,</HI> in the <HI>second Vo∣lume</HI> of his <HI>Annals,</HI> (with much better Reason) supposes, that not our <HI>Saviour,</HI> but some <HI>Seditious Iew</HI> called <HI>Crestus,</HI> who headed this <HI>Sedition,</HI> was the Cause of the <HI>Banishment</HI> of the <HI>Iews</HI> from <HI>Rome:</HI> So that this was no more a <HI>Persecution for Religion,</HI> than it would have been for the <HI>Parliament</HI> in <HI>King Charles</HI> the <HI>seconds</HI> Reign during the heat of the <HI>Popish Plot</HI> to have <HI>banished</HI> all the <HI>Papists</HI> out of <HI>England,</HI> upon the Account of their <HI>former Rebellions,</HI> and constant <HI>Machinati∣ons</HI> to overturn the <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>Religion establisht by Law</HI>; but sup∣posing this <HI>Edict</HI> to have banished the <HI>Christians</HI> as well as <HI>Iews,</HI> it had signified <HI>nothing,</HI> for it was <HI>no Persecution</HI> for <HI>Religion:</HI> and besides, be∣ing made in the <HI>last year</HI> of <HI>Claudius,</HI> it was but a <HI>temporary Edict</HI>; and we find the <HI>Iews</HI> to have lived quietly at <HI>Rome</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Nero,</HI> as appears by the last Chapter of the <HI>Acts.</HI></P>
<P>But as for <HI>Claudius</HI>'s Government, it was so far from being an <HI>in∣supportable Tyranny,</HI> that there was no Prince, that did take more care to do <HI>impartial Iustice,</HI> according to that <HI>small Capacity</HI> he was Ma∣ster of, than <HI>himself.</HI> And tho' I yield that by his <HI>Proconsuls, Presi∣dents,</HI> and <HI>Freemen</HI> there were <HI>many Oppressions,</HI> and <HI>Cruelties</HI> commit∣ted in the Provinces, yet it was only against some <HI>Private Men,</HI> and did not extend to the <HI>destroying,</HI> and <HI>enslaving</HI> the <HI>whole Body</HI> of the People, who during his Reign <HI>generally</HI> enjoyed their <HI>Liberties,</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> with as great Freedom, as under any of his <HI>Predecessors.</HI></P>
<P>And as for <HI>Nero,</HI> all <HI>Ecclesiastical Historians</HI> agree, that if this <HI>Epistle</HI> of St. <HI>Paul</HI> was written in his Reign, it was within the <HI>first five years</HI> of it, which was in his <HI>Non-age,</HI> under the Administration of <HI>Seneca,</HI> and <HI>Burrhus,</HI> during which time all the <HI>Historians</HI> agree, that the <HI>Empire</HI> was never <HI>better governed</HI>▪ and as for the wickedness, and Violence that <HI>Nero</HI> committed afterwards, when he persecuted the <HI>Christians,</HI> murdered his <HI>Mother,</HI> his <HI>Wife,</HI> and most of his <HI>best,</HI> and most <HI>intimate Friends,</HI> and set the City on <HI>Fire:</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> was so far
<PB N="250" REF="134"/>
from knowing any thing of them, that sure he would not have ur∣ged it to the <HI>Romans,</HI> as a Reason of their <HI>Subjection</HI> to him, that <HI>Rulers are not a terrour to good Works, but to the Evil,</HI> or that he was a <HI>Minister</HI> to them, that is, <HI>to the Subjects, for good</HI>; nay even in the worst of his <HI>Reign,</HI> as far as <HI>Iustice</HI> was duely administred by <HI>himself,</HI> or his <HI>Under-Officers.</HI> I grant, he was <HI>not</HI> to be <HI>resisted,</HI> notwithstan∣ding his <HI>Personal Crimes,</HI> which could only reach a <HI>few Persons,</HI> since a <HI>wicked Man</HI> may often make a <HI>Tolerable Prince.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' <HI>Domitian</HI> was in his own Person, a <HI>Cruel Tyrant,</HI> yet he was so far <HI>commendable</HI>; and to be <HI>born with</HI> by his <HI>Subjects,</HI> that during his Reign the <HI>Proconsuls, Presidents,</HI> and other <HI>inferiour Magistrates,</HI> were never freer from <HI>Corruption,</HI> and <HI>Oppression</HI>: Whereas when <HI>Ner∣va</HI> (who was a mild good natured Prince) succeeded him; by his <HI>too great Lenity,</HI> towards those <HI>inferiour Magistrates,</HI> all things present∣ly <HI>degenerated</HI> into a most sad Condition, <HI>Iustice</HI> being <HI>sold,</HI> and <HI>Per∣verted,</HI> and the <HI>Poor</HI> robbed and <HI>oppress't,</HI> by the <HI>Violence</HI> of the <HI>Rich,</HI> and <HI>Powerful.</HI> And even <HI>Nero</HI> himself had this <HI>Commendation</HI> from his <HI>greatest Enemy, Suetonius,</HI> that he would not be <HI>governed</HI> by his <HI>Offi∣cers,</HI> and <HI>Freed-men</HI> (as <HI>Claudius</HI> was) to do <HI>foolish,</HI> and <HI>unjust things.</HI> So that if <HI>Nero</HI> himself had not by <HI>burning</HI> the <HI>City,</HI> and by <HI>murdering</HI> the <HI>Innocent Citizens</HI> in the Night, made himself a <HI>publick Enemy:</HI> I do not see, but his <HI>Government</HI> might very well have been <HI>born with,</HI> notwithstanding his <HI>Personal Crimes,</HI> and <HI>Vices.</HI> For if you please to remember, I have already excepted <HI>Personal Faults</HI> in <HI>Princes,</HI> from being any <HI>just Cause</HI> of <HI>resisting</HI> their <HI>Authority,</HI> if they are such as can <HI>any way consist</HI> with the <HI>Common safety,</HI> and welfare of the <HI>People.</HI></P>

<P>I must confess, I never yet considered this matter, concern∣ing the <HI>time</HI> when St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> wrote these <HI>Epistles,</HI> and you'll pardon me, if I do not readily allow what you say, but I pro∣mise you to consider farther of this Story, and examine the Au∣thors you have quoted; but however, whether the <HI>Christians</HI> were then <HI>actually persecuted,</HI> or not, or whether these <HI>Emperours</HI> were then <HI>actually Tyrants,</HI> or not, signifies very little to me; for these <HI>Holy Apostles</HI> might very well foresee not only by <HI>Divine Revelation,</HI> but by <HI>Natural Prudence,</HI> or <HI>Foresight,</HI> that the <HI>Emperours</HI> would prove <HI>great Tyrants,</HI> and <HI>Persecutors</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> and the <HI>late Example</HI> of the Emperour <HI>Caligula</HI> had shewed them not only the <HI>Possibility,</HI> but also the <HI>great likelyhood,</HI> that it might happen again; and therefore it is no wonder, that these <HI>Apostles</HI> do, in consideration of this, command all <HI>Christians,</HI> to <HI>submit</HI> to, and <HI>obey</HI> all <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> and their <HI>Subordinate Officers,</HI> upon pain of <HI>Damnation</HI>; and if St. <HI>Peter</HI> in this Chapter last quoted commands <HI>Servants to be Subject to their Masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward,</HI> (that is, to the <HI>Cruel,</HI> and <HI>Ill-condition'd</HI>) and gives this Reason for it. <HI>For this is thank-worthy, if a Man for Conscience towards God endures grief, suffering wrongfully:</HI> And inforces it with this great Motive, <HI>For even hereunto were ye called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an Example, that ye should

follow his Steps: And if Servants,</HI> or <HI>Slaves</HI> were to be <HI>Subject</HI> to their <HI>Masters,</HI> let them use them never so <HI>cruelly</HI>; it will, I think, hold more strong for <HI>Soveraign Powers</HI> who are the <HI>immediate Ordinance of God.</HI></P>

<P>You need not have made your Answer half so long, if you had been pleased to take notice, that I have still <HI>excepted any Resist∣ance,</HI> which might be then made against the <HI>Roman Emperours,</HI> upon the account of <HI>Persecution</HI> upon the <HI>meer score of Religion,</HI> since I grant, that our <HI>Saviour</HI> hath for those particular Reasons, I have already al∣ledged, commanded us to a <HI>patient Suffering,</HI> and bearing <HI>Testimony</HI> to the <HI>Truth</HI> of his <HI>Religion</HI> by <HI>Martyrdom,</HI> or any <HI>other Sufferings</HI> which he shall think fit to inflict <HI>upon us</HI> by <HI>Lawful Authority,</HI> and for the like ends for which they were to suffer. Yet hath he not therefore taken away, all those <HI>Natural Rights,</HI> which <HI>whole Nations</HI> had of <HI>Self-defence</HI> against <HI>Tyranny,</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> whensoever they are exer∣cised upon them. Nor doth your Argument from <HI>particular Slaves,</HI> to their <HI>Masters</HI> at all concern <HI>Subjects,</HI> much less <HI>whole Nations</HI>; For, I hope, there is a great deal of <HI>difference</HI> between <HI>them,</HI> and <HI>perfect Slaves,</HI> who have <HI>no Interest</HI> in their own <HI>Persons,</HI> and so had neither <HI>Liberties,</HI> nor <HI>Properties</HI> to lose.</P>
<P>But besides, if you please better to consider this <HI>Text,</HI> you will find, that this did wholy concern such <HI>Christian Slaves,</HI> who were for their <HI>Religion</HI>'s <HI>sake</HI> oftentimes the more <HI>cruelly treated</HI> by their <HI>Hea∣then Masters.</HI> And therefore those Words you have but now repea∣ted, <HI>If a Man for Conscience sake suffers wrongfully,</HI> as likewise those in the 20<HI>th</HI> verse, <HI>if you do well, and suffer for it,</HI> can only be meant of <HI>Suffering</HI> for the <HI>Profession</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> since no <HI>Heathen</HI> Emperours, nor Masters ever <HI>persecuted</HI> their <HI>Subjects,</HI> or <HI>Cruelly treated</HI> their <HI>Slaves,</HI> for well doing, that is, doing those <HI>duties</HI> and <HI>services</HI> that they owed them, and therefore, this place makes nothing at all to the Questi∣on in Hand.</P>

since you will needs have it made <HI>plaine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to you, I hope you will pardon me, if in the doing of it, I am forced to use <HI>some Repetition.</HI> Therefore in the <HI>first place,</HI> I shall not deny the <HI>Interpretation,</HI> which our <HI>Translators</HI> put upon this Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which tho' it sometimes signifies not <HI>Eternal Damnation,</HI> but <HI>Temporal Iudgments</HI>: Yet I will own, it will not well agree with what follows in this place, which are only temporal Reasons, and Motives for this Duty, now under∣stand this word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in the <HI>Scripture Sense,</HI> and tho' I do, it will be much at one, for I have already proved to you, that whether you take these <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> for <HI>Powers,</HI> or <HI>Persons,</HI> they are not <HI>absolutely irresistible,</HI> and I have St. <HI>Chrysostome▪</HI> on my side in the <HI>Interpretation</HI> of this Word, who understands no more by it, than that <HI>Civil Power,</HI> or <HI>Au∣thority</HI> is from <HI>God,</HI> but not the <HI>Tyrants</HI> or <HI>Wicked Men</HI> that execute it; but if it be taken for the <HI>Person,</HI> endued with this <HI>Authority,</HI> I have also shewn you, that when they <HI>degenerate</HI> into <HI>intolerable Tyrants</HI> they lose their <HI>Character,</HI> and may be <HI>resisted,</HI> as well as <HI>Madmen,</HI> and <HI>Fools</HI>; So much in respect of the <HI>Powers themselves,</HI> and now to come to the <HI>People</HI>: I think I have given very good Reasons already, why a <HI>whole People</HI> or <HI>Nation,</HI> or the <HI>Major part</HI> thereof, may have a <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>resist</HI> the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> and yet that I need not allow particu∣lar, <HI>private Persons</HI> the same Liberty; and one great Reason is, because they <HI>cannot,</HI> and the other, because they <HI>ought not</HI> to do it. The first you your self do acknowledge, since you say, <HI>A private Person, when he makes such Resistance doth it at his own peril, when he hath only his own single self to oppose against his Prince.</HI> And <HI>that single Persons don't use to resist, nor is there any great Danger to the publick if they do</HI>; to which I shall likewise add a much <HI>better Reason,</HI> which I have also given you before, why <HI>private Subjects</HI> ought not in a <HI>Civil State</HI> to make <HI>publick disturbances,</HI> to avoid any Violence that may be done to their <HI>Particular Persons,</HI> or <HI>Estates,</HI> because every <HI>private Subject</HI> ought to prefer the <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> of the <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> whereof he is a <HI>Member,</HI> before his own <HI>private Interest,</HI> which being a Dictate of the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> or <HI>Right Reason</HI> cannot extend to the <HI>whole Nati∣on,</HI> or <HI>Civil Society:</HI> Since it is as much against the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> for that to be <HI>destroyed, beggar'd,</HI> and <HI>enslaved,</HI> as it is that <HI>God</HI> should or∣dain <HI>all Mankind</HI> to be so. And therefore our <HI>Saviour,</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> never intending to alter any of those <HI>great Laws</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> it can∣not be believed, that they would tye Mankind to such <HI>strict,</HI> and <HI>se∣vere Rules</HI> of <HI>Non-Resistance,</HI> and <HI>Subjection,</HI> as should expose them to <HI>Beggary,</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> and <HI>Ruine,</HI> with all the Miseries of this Life: Nor do I find that our <HI>Saviour,</HI> or his <HI>Apostles</HI> have either promised <HI>Eternal Life</HI> for such <HI>slavish Subjection,</HI> nor threatned <HI>Damnation</HI> for such <HI>Resistance.</HI></P>

<P>To answer what you have now said, I must in the <HI>first place</HI> take notice, that tho' I grant, St. <HI>Chrysostome,</HI> for fear of ma∣king <HI>Tyrants,</HI> and <HI>wicked Princes</HI> to be <HI>ordained by God,</HI> gives that <HI>In∣terpretation</HI> of the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which you have now done, yet he
<PB N="253" REF="135"/>
owns the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Non-Resistance,</HI> because the <HI>Power is from God,</HI> as you may here see in these <HI>Quotations</HI> out of him, which the Learned <HI>Primate</HI> hath made use of in the <HI>second part</HI> of his Treatise of the <HI>Pow∣er of the Prince,</HI> which you may, if you please, read with me; and compare the Greek in the Margin:<NOTE PLACE="marg">pag. 111, 112.</NOTE>
<Q>For it is the pleasure of God, that the Magistrate whom he hath stamped with his own Image should have also his own Power. <HI>And</HI> he that obeyeth not him, makes War in a sort with God who hath appoint∣ed these things. Let us not therefore invert this Order, nor Fight with God: demonstrating by our deeds, that saying of the Apostle, Whosoever re∣sisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God.</Q>
So likewise in ano∣ther place, <HI>If we reverence, and fear those Magistrates that are elected by the King, altho' they be Wicked, altho' they be Thieves, altho' they be Rob∣bers, altho' they be unjust, or whatever they be; not despising them for their wickedness, but standing in awe of them for the Dignity of them that did Elect them:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> p. 116.</NOTE> <HI>much more ought we thus to do in the Case of God.</HI> But it is no matter in what Sense <HI>this,</HI> or any <HI>other Father</HI> takes these Words, so long as the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> is <HI>secure.</HI></P>
<P>But it seems very strange that you cannot find that our <HI>Saviour</HI> and his <HI>Apostles</HI> have neither promised <HI>Eternal Life</HI> for <HI>slavish Subje∣ction,</HI> nor threatned <HI>Damnation</HI> for <HI>Resistance</HI>; for as sure as the Words are, that <HI>they that resist shall receive to themselves Damnation,</HI> so sure it will likewise follow, that they that do the <HI>Contrary,</HI> and are <HI>Patiently Sub∣ject,</HI> shall receive <HI>Eternal Life.</HI> I beg your pardon for this <HI>Interrupti∣on,</HI> therefore pray go on with the <HI>rest</HI> of your <HI>reply.</HI> And let me see how you can avoid <HI>Damnation,</HI> if the Words of the <HI>Apostle</HI> are true.</P>

<P>I think the Reason is very plain, because to understand them in a <HI>literal Sense,</HI> were utterly <HI>unpracticable,</HI> and <HI>contradictory</HI> to the <HI>common Sense,</HI> and <HI>Notions</HI> of Mankind, and those <HI>Natural Dictates</HI> of <HI>self▪ Pre∣servation,</HI> which St. <HI>Paul</HI> approves of, when he says, <HI>No man yet hated his own Flesh</HI>; and it was altogether unsuitable to the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> which was intended for the <HI>perfection</HI> of <HI>human Nature,</HI> that is, of Men's <HI>Souls,</HI> and natural Reasons, and for the <HI>Quiet</HI> and <HI>Happiness,</HI> not <HI>Hurt</HI> and <HI>Destruction</HI> of their Bodies.</P>

<P>I grant your Reasons are very good, and self-evident, but pray tell me, is it not as much against the <HI>Common Sense</HI> and <HI>Notions</HI> of Mankind, that God should give any <HI>Civil Soveraign</HI> an Arbitrary <HI>Irresi∣stible Power</HI> to Murder, Destroy and Ruine their <HI>People,</HI> if they should think fit so to do, or that <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> who you say came into the World for the <HI>Perfection</HI> of our <HI>Human Nature,</HI> and not for the <HI>Destru∣ction</HI> of our Bodies, should give the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> an <HI>Authority</HI> to do the same things with <HI>Murderers</HI> and <HI>Thieves,</HI> and that it was <HI>unlawful</HI> for men to <HI>defend</HI> themselves against their <HI>Violence,</HI> if they could. So that I can see no Reason why this <HI>Precept</HI> against <HI>Non-Resistance,</HI> may not be taken in a <HI>Limited</HI> or <HI>Rational Sense,</HI> as well as <HI>Swear not at all</HI>; which tho' as express as words can make it, yet <HI>Commentators</HI> interpret it to extend no farther than against <HI>Swearing</HI> in <HI>Common Communication.</HI> So likewise this Precept, <HI>Children obey your Parents in all things,</HI> which with∣out the reasonable Interpretation of all things <HI>Lawful,</HI> would oblige <HI>Children</HI> to obey their <HI>Parents</HI> in whatsoever they commanded them, whether <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to your <HI>Quotations</HI> out of St. <HI>Chrysostome,</HI> which you would <HI>oppose</HI> against mine; I think they will not serve so much to your pur∣pose, as you imagine. For I grant, that the <HI>Supream Magistrate</HI> derives his <HI>Power</HI> from <HI>God,</HI> but not a <HI>Power</HI> to <HI>Murder</HI> and <HI>Destroy;</HI> so likewise he that <HI>obeyeth him not, wars in a sort with God,</HI> and that <HI>whosoever resisteth the Power,</HI> (that is, when it is executed according to God's Will) <HI>Resisteth the Ordinance of God;</HI> And as for the <HI>last Quotation</HI> con∣cerning the <HI>Reverence,</HI> that is due to <HI>subordinate Magistrates</HI> elected by the <HI>King,</HI> tho' they are <HI>Wicked, Thieves</HI> and <HI>Robbers, &amp;c.</HI> And conse∣quently, much more the King who sends them; this, tho' the strongest place of the Three, yet will not do the Business: For I believe you can∣not suppose, that St. <HI>Chrysostome</HI> there means that <HI>subordinate Magistrates</HI> sent by the King were really <HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>Robbers,</HI> and took away Men's Goods upon the <HI>common Road,</HI> but only that by <HI>Bribery,</HI> and <HI>Corruption,</HI> in their <HI>Offices</HI> they did <HI>Robb,</HI> and <HI>Peel</HI> the People, as much as if they had been <HI>really</HI> so, which extending only to some <HI>few Persons,</HI> was rather to be <HI>born with</HI> (<HI>as any intolerable Inconveniences in civil Government are</HI>) than for the <HI>People</HI> to <HI>take Arme</HI> and <HI>Resist</HI> them. But I think the Case would have been much otherwise, had these <HI>Subordinate Magistrates</HI> by vertue of the <HI>Emperours Commission,</HI> made use of his <HI>Forces</HI> to <HI>Murder,</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="136"/>
and <HI>Robb</HI> the <HI>Subjects</HI> of those <HI>Provinces</HI> over which they were set; and that it would not have been <HI>any Rebellion</HI> in the People if they should have <HI>taken Arms,</HI> and <HI>Resisted</HI> them, since the <HI>Emperours</HI> did not <HI>Impower</HI> such <HI>Magistrates</HI> to <HI>murder</HI> or <HI>robb,</HI> but to <HI>protect</HI> his <HI>Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>But to give you a <HI>Quotation</HI> out of St. <HI>Chrysostome,</HI> in lieu of yours, I shall shew you his <HI>Comment</HI> upon these Words in his 23<HI>d.</HI> Homily on the <HI>Romans, Let every soul be subject to the Higher Powers,</HI> (that is, says he) <HI>that Christ might shew that he had not instituted his Laws so, that he might overturn all Common Policy and Government, but that he might reform it to the better, and might also teach us that superfluous, and unnecessary Ways were not to be undertaken, because it was then a Common Discourse traducing the</HI> Apostles <HI>as Seditious and Innovators, and doing all things they could to overthrow the Common Constitutions of their Country</HI>; and therefore he stops their Mouths with these Words.</P>
<P>From whence we may infer, that St. <HI>Chrysostome</HI> did not believe that St. <HI>Paul</HI> wrote this only to give <HI>Tyrants</HI> a <HI>Power,</HI> to do what ever they pleased against their <HI>Subjects</HI> without any <HI>Resistance</HI>; Nor yet that <HI>Sub∣jects</HI> should begin <HI>unnecessary</HI> and <HI>unlawful Wars,</HI> by <HI>Resisting</HI> upon every <HI>slight Occasion</HI>: Nor doth this Father here <HI>forbid</HI> Subjects to <HI>Resist</HI> in Ca∣ses of the <HI>Highest Tyranny,</HI> or <HI>Oppression</HI> that could befall them; so that I take the true Sense of these places of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> to be no more than this: <HI>Let every Christian submit to the Supream Powers,</HI> i. e. <HI>to the Emperour, and all other subordinate Magistrates sent and appointed by him. For all <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or Civil Authority is from God, and Magistrates justly exercising this Power are from him, and in his Stead, all Supream Powers un∣der what ever different Names or Titles they be, are by God's Providence ap∣pointed in the World, for its Order, Peace and the well Governing of it. He therefore that Resisteth such Supream Powers, whoever he be, Resisteth the Ordinance of of God,</HI> that is, the means that God hath ordained for the <HI>Restraining</HI> the <HI>Disorderly Lusts</HI> and <HI>Passions</HI> of Men. And they that will <HI>not obey</HI> their <HI>Laws</HI> as far as the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> may per∣mit, but will <HI>Resist,</HI> shall receive to themselves <HI>Damnation.</HI> And thus far even <HI>Tyrants</HI> and <HI>Usurpers</HI> may be <HI>Obeyed,</HI> tho' not as such, but as <HI>Dispensers</HI> of <HI>Publick Iustice,</HI> and <HI>Executors</HI> of the <HI>Laws,</HI> and so are <HI>God's Ministers for good</HI>; that is, for the publick Peace and Safety. But nei∣ther the <HI>Apostle,</HI> nor St. <HI>Chrysostome</HI> his Commentator, any where say, that either the <HI>Power however exercised,</HI> or the <HI>Persons</HI> that thus <HI>abuse</HI> it to the <HI>Destruction</HI> of Mankind, are likewise <HI>from God.</HI></P>

<P><Q>But pray consider the <HI>Medium</HI> a little more closely, by which the <HI>Apostle</HI> proves, and enforces this <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Subjection,</HI> or <HI>Non-Re∣sistance.</HI> For, says he, <HI>There is no Power but of God, the Pow∣ers that be are ordained of God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">S. C. R. p. 116, 117.</NOTE> <HI>Whosoever therefore resi∣steth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God.</HI> The plain meaning of which is this, That <HI>Soveraign Princes</HI> whe∣ther good or bad, Tyrants, or good Governours, being advanced to the Throne by God, are his Ministers, and Vicegerents invested with his Authority, and Power to govern, and therefore, when we resist
<PB N="256" REF="137"/>
our <HI>Prince,</HI> we resist the Ordinance, Constitution, and Appointment, of God: and such men do not resist, rebel, or fight against Man, but God; as he who resisteth any subordinate Magistrate, resisteth his Prince, from whom they receive their Authority, and Commission. And this is a very forcible Argument for <HI>Subjection</HI> to <HI>Princes,</HI> for whatever our <HI>Prince</HI> be, it is certain, that God hath an absolute, and uncontroulable Right over us, as being the <HI>True</HI> Lord, and Governour of the World; and if Earthly <HI>Princes</HI> are placed in the Throne by him, who is at liberty to put the Government of the World, into what hands he pleases, who will dare to oppose God▪ or ask him, Why hast thou done so? Whoever hath any sense of God's Domini∣on, and Soveraignty, dares not Rebel against him, and he who believes that <HI>Princes</HI> are made by God, will no more dare to Rebell against his <HI>Prince,</HI> than against God himself.</Q>
Since (as I said before) <HI>Evil Princes</HI> may be sent by <HI>God</HI> for a <HI>punishment</HI> to a <HI>Wicked People,</HI> as well as <HI>good</HI> ones for a <HI>Blessing</HI> to a <HI>pious</HI> Nation.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had pleased to have considered what I have already said, you might have spared this <HI>Objection</HI>; for it is no more, than what hath been already <HI>answered</HI>; for tho' I grant that <HI>Soveraign Princes</HI> are <HI>advanced</HI> to the Throne by <HI>God,</HI> and are by him invested with <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> to govern, and that when we <HI>Resist</HI> our <HI>Prince,</HI> we <HI>Resist the Ordinance of God</HI>; yet I desire to be judged only by your own words in this matter; the <HI>Prince</HI> receives from God <HI>Authority</HI> to Govern, but is the <HI>murdering, ruining</HI> and <HI>enslaving</HI> the People, <HI>any part</HI> of <HI>Civil Government</HI>? and when we <HI>Resist</HI> our <HI>Prince,</HI> we <HI>Resist the Ordinance of God</HI>; but is the <HI>Resisting</HI> of an <HI>Implacable Tyrant</HI>▪ and an <HI>Enemy</HI> of Man∣kind, <HI>Resisting the Ordinance of God,</HI> or fighting against him? And I de∣sire you only to consider the force of your own Comparison: for (you say) he who <HI>Resisteth</HI> any <HI>Subordinate</HI> Magistrates, <HI>Resists</HI> the <HI>Princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> from whom they receive their <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>Commission,</HI> yet it is only in such things, which the <HI>Prince</HI> hath given them <HI>Authority,</HI> or a <HI>Com∣mission</HI> to do; as for Example, a <HI>Bayliff</HI> may <HI>Arrest</HI> me for <HI>Debt,</HI> by vertue of the <HI>King's Writ,</HI> yet if he goeth about to <HI>Rob,</HI> or <HI>Kill</HI> me, I may <HI>lawfully Resist</HI> him, and if I kill him, it is no murder. The same may be said of all other <HI>Subordinate Ministers,</HI> how great soever they are, therefore to carry on your Parallel, the same that <HI>Subordinate Magistrates</HI> are in <HI>Relation</HI> to <HI>Princes,</HI> the same are <HI>Princes</HI> in respect of <HI>God</HI>: Therefore if they <HI>never</HI> received any <HI>Commission,</HI> or <HI>Authority</HI> from God to <HI>destroy</HI> and <HI>enslave</HI> their People, they so far <HI>cease</HI> to be the <HI>Powers ordained by God,</HI> and sure may then be <HI>Resisted</HI> by their <HI>opprest people.</HI> As for the rest of your Speech, as far as <HI>Earthly Princes,</HI> are placed in the <HI>Throne</HI> by God, and <HI>Govern</HI> there like his <HI>Vicegerents,</HI> I own they are not to be <HI>Opposed,</HI> but since you will have them to be <HI>submitted</HI> to, be∣cause they may be <HI>Ordained by God</HI> for a <HI>Punishment,</HI> for a <HI>Wicked People</HI>: I thank you for putting me in mind to <HI>answer</HI> what you have before said upon <HI>that Subject:</HI> I do not deny, but <HI>God</HI> may often for the <HI>Punish∣ment</HI> (as you say) of a <HI>sinful Nation,</HI> give them a <HI>wicked,</HI> or <HI>Tyrannical
<PB N="257" REF="137"/>
Prince,</HI> and likewise that such a Prince, when thus <HI>Imposed</HI> by God, is to be <HI>born without Resistance,</HI> as far as is <HI>possible,</HI> or that may <HI>consist</HI> with their <HI>being</HI> a People, and with those <HI>Enjoyments</HI> of Life, which are <HI>neces∣sary</HI> to their being <HI>Subjects,</HI> and <HI>Freemen,</HI> and not <HI>Slaves</HI>: And tho' I grant, that God doth likewise sometimes <HI>punish</HI> a <HI>wicked Nation,</HI> by ap∣pointing <HI>Conquerours,</HI> such as the King of <HI>Assyria, to carry them away cap∣tive,</HI> and to reduce them to the <HI>Lowest Condition</HI> of <HI>Poverty,</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> as in this Case of the <HI>Iews</HI> by the King of <HI>Babylon, who was then the Rod of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d's Anger, and whom he raised up for the punishment of an Hypocritical Na∣tion.</HI> Yet when he doth so, excluding all <HI>farther Resistance</HI> in the Peo∣ple, it can only be known by <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vine Revelation,</HI> and cannot extend to <HI>all Conquerours</HI> whatever, whether by <HI>Right</HI> or <HI>Wrong.</HI> And there∣fore, as <HI>God</HI> doth often in his <HI>Arger</HI> deliver the People, up to the <HI>Power</HI> of some <HI>Cruel Conquerour,</HI> or <HI>Tyrant</HI>; so likewise will he in his <HI>good time,</HI> and upon their <HI>Repentance,</HI> deliver them from it again: Now this <HI>Deliverance</HI> must be performed either by <HI>Miracles,</HI> or <HI>Human Means.</HI> Now <HI>Miracles</HI> are ceased, and therefore, since only <HI>Human Means</HI> re∣main, these must be either 1<HI>st.</HI> by <HI>changing</HI> the Hearts of such <HI>Tyrannical Princes</HI> into a better, and more <HI>merciful Temper</HI> towards their Subjects as <HI>Solomon</HI> says▪<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 21.1</NOTE> <HI>The King's Heart is in the Hand of the Lord, as the Rivers of Water, he turneth it whi∣thersoev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r he will.</HI> Or else 2<HI>dly.</HI> by <HI>taking away,</HI> such a <HI>Tyrannical Prince</HI> out of the World, and putting another in his stead, who may <HI>Govern</HI> the Peo∣ple more <HI>mercifully,</HI> and who will not any more <HI>destroy,</HI> or <HI>oppress</HI> them▪ as his Predecessors did. Or 3<HI>dly.</HI> by stirring up some <HI>Neighbour Prince</HI> to revenge the <HI>Injuries,</HI> and <HI>Oppressions</HI> done unto such a <HI>persecuted,</HI> and <HI>almost ruined</HI> People; and to restore them to the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of their <HI>for∣mer Liberties, Religion</HI> and <HI>Estates.</HI> Or lastly, by stirring up the <HI>People</HI> themselves to <HI>Rise,</HI> and <HI>Resist</HI> those <HI>Oppressions,</HI> they lie under, by their own <HI>single Forces,</HI> or by imploring the <HI>Assistance</HI> of some <HI>Powerful Neigh∣bouring Prince,</HI> or <HI>State.</HI> Now I suppose you will not deny, but that the <HI>first</HI> of these ways does never happen, the second very rarely; and as for the 3<HI>d.</HI> we seldom find that when a <HI>former Prince</HI> is taken out of the way, his <HI>Successor</HI> grows so <HI>sensible</HI> of the <HI>Tyranny,</HI> and <HI>Misgovernment</HI> of his Predecessors, as to let go any of that <HI>Arbitrary Power,</HI> which he hath <HI>usurped,</HI> or to remit any of those <HI>intolerable Taxes</HI> and <HI>Oppressions</HI> which He hath laid upon them▪ but are commonly like <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> when they come to the Crown, so far from making their <HI>People's yoak more easie,</HI> that they rather lay it <HI>more heavy</HI> upon their Necks, as we may see in the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> in these three <HI>last descents,</HI> where <HI>every</HI> Prince hath been still <HI>more severe,</HI> and <HI>Tyrannical</HI> than his <HI>Predecessor</HI>; for finding him∣self <HI>invested</HI> in this <HI>Absolute</HI> and <HI>Despotick Power,</HI> without any <HI>unjust Act</HI> of his own, he will <HI>exercise</HI> it as he found it, and will think himself not at all <HI>obliged</HI> in Conscience to restore any of those <HI>just Rights</HI> his Predecessors had <HI>formerly usurpt</HI> upon the People, since we find, <HI>Princes seldom lose any thing they have once got,</HI> and this may continue to <HI>all generations,</HI> for ought we know, (which is much <HI>too long</HI> for a <HI>punishment</HI>) unless some <HI>extra∣ordinary
<PB N="258" REF="138"/>
Accident</HI> fall out, as we now see by the Example of the <HI>Greek Christians,</HI> who having lain <HI>divers Ages</HI> under the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Yoak, are now restored to the <HI>Liberty</HI> of their <HI>Religion,</HI> by the <HI>Arms</HI> of the <HI>German Emperour,</HI> and <HI>Venetians,</HI> and are so far from being <HI>blamed</HI> for <HI>joyning</HI> themselves to their <HI>Deliverers,</HI> that they are rather <HI>commended by all Christendom</HI> for so doing. And I see no Reason why all good <HI>French men,</HI> as well <HI>Protestants</HI> as <HI>others,</HI> may not as <HI>justly joyn</HI> themselves to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> or any other <HI>Foreign Prince,</HI> who will be so gene∣rous, as to <HI>undertake</HI> their <HI>Deliverance</HI> from that <HI>Cruel Yoak,</HI> they lie un∣der, and will <HI>restore</HI> them to their <HI>Antiens Liberties,</HI> and the <HI>Protestants</HI> to the <HI>Free Exercise</HI> of their <HI>Religion</HI>: Nor can I see any Reason, why <HI>God</HI> should deliver a <HI>People</HI> into <HI>Servitude,</HI> when ever a <HI>Tyrannical Prince</HI> hath sufficient <HI>Power</HI> to <HI>oppress</HI> them, and why God may not be as well said to <HI>deliver</HI> them, as often as the <HI>People</HI> find <HI>fit means</HI>▪ and <HI>opportunity</HI> so to set themselves <HI>free.</HI> For doth such a <HI>Tyrant</HI> derive his <HI>Power</HI> from <HI>God</HI> to <HI>oppress,</HI> only because he hath <HI>Power</HI>? And may not the <HI>People</HI> like∣wise from the <HI>same Original,</HI> derive a <HI>Right</HI> to defend <HI>themselves</HI> against such an <HI>intolerable Oppression</HI>? Otherwise, God would chiefly regard, and provide for this <HI>destructive Tyrannical Power</HI> of Princes, as the <HI>chief end</HI> of all <HI>Civil Society,</HI> and make the <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> of the People as <HI>subordinate</HI> to that, or rather only by the by, which is contrary to Rea∣son. 'Tis true, the Prophet <HI>Amos</HI> saith, <HI>That there is no Evil in a City which God hath not sent:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. 3.6.</NOTE> So likewise are all <HI>Natural Evils</HI> such as <HI>Famine, Pestilence, Inundations</HI> and <HI>Foreign Enemies,</HI> and yet have not the <HI>People</HI> in these Cases a <HI>Power</HI> to rid themselves of them, if they can, by all <HI>natural human means,</HI> and yet they may be likewise <HI>Punishments</HI> sent from <HI>God</HI>? And if they may <HI>Resist,</HI> and <HI>decline</HI> such common and <HI>natural Iudgments</HI> without staying for an <HI>express Revelation</HI> for that purpose; why may they not for the same Rea∣son <HI>rid themselves</HI> of such a <HI>Iudgment</HI> as <HI>Intolerable Tyranny,</HI> when they are <HI>able,</HI> and have an Opportunity to do it? since they proceed from the like <HI>Common Dispensations</HI> of God's Providence; or else we must believe that the <HI>Wickedness</HI> of one, or more persons, for the <HI>Destruction</HI> of <HI>Civil Society</HI> the is more <HI>particularly derived</HI> from God, than the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>whole People</HI> for their own <HI>Preservation,</HI> and the <HI>common Good</HI> and Happi∣ness of the <HI>Common-wealth:</HI> By which means, <HI>Princes</HI> would have the <HI>same Power,</HI> and <HI>Right</HI> over their <HI>Subjects Bodies,</HI> and <HI>Estates,</HI> as they have over those of their <HI>Beasts,</HI> to sell, kill, and devour them at their Pleasure.</P>

<P>Tho' I grant it may be <HI>lawful</HI> for a <HI>People</HI> to remove <HI>Natural Iudgments</HI> by <HI>human Means,</HI> yet doth it not follow, that they may there∣fore remove by <HI>Force,</HI> such <HI>Punishments</HI> as God pleases to lay upon them from the <HI>Abuse</HI> of <HI>Civil Authority,</HI> by the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> since He hath particularly enjoyned them to <HI>bear such Punishments patiently without any Resistance,</HI> because they are <HI>inflicted</HI> by those whom God hath <HI>Ordained</HI> for our <HI>Temporal Governours,</HI> and Masters, and whose <HI>Violences</HI> and <HI>Op∣pressions,</HI> as long as they continue in their <HI>Sins,</HI> God hath very good reason to <HI>continue</HI> upon them, and if they <HI>Repent,</HI> they may be assured
<PB N="259" REF="138"/>
that in his <HI>good time,</HI> he will either <HI>remove</HI> them, or <HI>turn</HI> them to the <HI>best:</HI> For <HI>all things</HI> (even Afflictions) <HI>work for the good of them that fear him.</HI> And God will not suffer <HI>those that trust in him to be afflicted beyond what they are able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear:</HI> And if this Doctrine of yours might take place, both <HI>Servants</HI> and <HI>Children</HI> in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> might upon the like Pretence both <HI>Resist,</HI> and turn their <HI>Father,</HI> and <HI>Master</HI> out of <HI>doors,</HI> because (forsooth) their <HI>Government</HI> was so <HI>severe,</HI> and <HI>Tyrannical,</HI> that it was not any longer to be <HI>endured</HI> by them; And tho' such <HI>severe Fa∣thers</HI> or <HI>Masters</HI> may be <HI>Ordained by God</HI> for the <HI>Punishment</HI> of such <HI>wicked Children,</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> yet that being no more than other <HI>natural Iudgments,</HI> they may be without <HI>any Sin</HI> removed by <HI>Force,</HI> or <HI>Resistance,</HI> when ever they thought themselves <HI>strong enough</HI> to do it: And if this <HI>Doctrine</HI> be <HI>wicked,</HI> and <HI>absurd</HI> in <HI>private Families,</HI> then is it much more so in <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> for certainly there is as <HI>perfect a Subjection</HI> due to a <HI>So∣veraign Prince,</HI> as to a <HI>Father</HI> or <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster,</HI> for he is more <HI>Eminently</HI> the <HI>Minister of God,</HI> and Acts by a more <HI>Sacred,</HI> and <HI>inviolable Authority.</HI> And notwithstanding what you have said to the contrary, that the <HI>Pre∣cep</HI> given to Servants by St. <HI>Peter,</HI> doth not concern <HI>Subjects,</HI> I think I can very well prove that it doth; as appears from the Example of <HI>Christ,</HI> which the Apostle there recommended to our <HI>Imitation,</HI> who was the most <HI>innocent person</HI> in the World, and yet suffered the most <HI>barbarous Usage,</HI> not from the hands of a <HI>private Master,</HI> but of the <HI>Supream Pow∣ers.</HI> And therefore, when he commands, in the same Chapter, <HI>to sub∣mit to Governours, as to those who are for the punishment of Evil doers, and the praise of them that do well, it is</HI> evident, that he did not intend this, as a <HI>Limitation</HI> of our <HI>Subjection,</HI> or as if we were not bound to be <HI>sub∣ject</HI> in other Cases, since in the very same Chapter he requires <HI>Subjection not only to the Good, and Gentle Masters, but also to the froward,</HI> in Imitati∣on of the Example of our Lord, who suffered <HI>patiently</HI> under <HI>unjust,</HI> and <HI>Tyrannical Powers.</HI> I observe therefore, that the <HI>Apostle</HI> doth not al∣ledge this as the <HI>Reason</HI> of our <HI>Subjection,</HI> but as a <HI>Motive,</HI> or <HI>Argument</HI> to reconcile us to the <HI>practice</HI> of it. The Reason of our <HI>Submission</HI> to <HI>Princes,</HI> is, that they are <HI>advanced by God,</HI> that they are <HI>his Ministers,</HI> that those who <HI>Resist</HI> them, <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sist the Ordinance of God,</HI> and therefore, we must <HI>submit for God</HI>'s <HI>sake,</HI> out of <HI>Reverence</HI> to his <HI>Authority.</HI> But it is only an Encouragement to <HI>Subjection</HI> to consider the <HI>great Advanta∣ges</HI> of <HI>Government, that Rulers are not a Terrour to good Works, but to the Evil.</HI> But tho' this Motive should fail in <HI>some Instances,</HI> yet whilst the <HI>Reason</HI> of the <HI>Subjection</HI> lasts (and that can never fail whilst we own the <HI>Soveraign Authority</HI> of God) so long it is our Duty to be <HI>subject,</HI> whether our <HI>Prince</HI> do his Duty, or not.</P>

otherwise than by telling me, that <HI>Princes are God</HI>'s <HI>Ordinance,</HI> and are endued with <HI>Irresistible Power,</HI> all which hath been already considered. And I have already shewn you, it is neither <HI>Commanded</HI> by <HI>God,</HI> nor yet <HI>Ordained</HI> for the <HI>Common Good</HI> of Mankind. And tho' I own that <HI>Af∣flictions</HI> may sometimes serve for a <HI>Punishment</HI> of a <HI>sinful Nation,</HI> yet it is as likely that such a great, and <HI>lasting Punishment,</HI> as a <HI>merciles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tyrant,</HI> may as well bring the People to <HI>Repentance,</HI> and when they are <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficiently amended,</HI> they may very well enjoy the <HI>Benefits</HI> of it, and they may as well expect, that God will bless all <HI>Lawful Means,</HI> for that end, whereof I take <HI>Resistance,</HI> or <HI>self-defence</HI> to be the <HI>Principal</HI>; since Miracles are ceased. And of this we have an Example in the 2<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>Kings, chap.</HI> 18. For tho' <HI>Ahaz</HI> the Father of <HI>Ezekiah</HI> had submitted himself, and become <HI>Tributary</HI> to the King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> yet when <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zek<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ah</HI> his Son turned to the Lord, it is said, that he was with him, and that he rebelled against the King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> and served him not, and yet he was then as much sub∣ject to him as <HI>Iehoiachin,</HI> or <HI>Zedekiah,</HI> were afterwards to <HI>Nebuchadnez∣zar.</HI> So that all that is <HI>new</HI> in this Answer of yours, is only the <HI>fatal Consequences,</HI> that it would bring upon all Families in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> for then (forsooth) <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI> might likewise pretend, that the <HI>Government</HI> of their <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Masters</HI> were so <HI>insupportable,</HI> that it was no longer to be <HI>endured,</HI> and so might <HI>Rebel</HI> against them, and <HI>depose</HI> them, which doth by no means follow, for I have already proved at our <HI>first Conversation,</HI> that <HI>some sort</HI> of <HI>Resistance</HI> for the Preservation of Life and Limbs, may be <HI>lawful</HI> against the Outrages or Violence of a <HI>Father,</HI> or <HI>Master</HI> of a Family; Yet do I by no means allow, that they should <HI>Resist</HI> them for any <HI>other Correction</HI> or <HI>severe Usage</HI> which they shall inflict upon them, since <HI>Servants,</HI> or <HI>Slaves</HI> whilst they continue under their <HI>Masters Power,</HI> can have no <HI>Liberty,</HI> or <HI>Property</HI> of their own to <HI>defend</HI>; and a <HI>Son</HI> whilst he remains <HI>part</HI> of his <HI>Fathers Family,</HI> I grant, <HI>differs not from a Servant,</HI> so that all that ought to be done either by <HI>Sons</HI> or <HI>Servants</HI> in case the <HI>Government</HI> of their <HI>Father,</HI> or <HI>Master</HI> grows so <HI>Cruel</HI> and <HI>Tyrannical</HI> as not to be <HI>endured,</HI> is to <HI>run away,</HI> and leave their <HI>Family.</HI> And thus we read that <HI>Hagar</HI> upon the severe Usage of <HI>Sa∣rah</HI> her Mistress, fled from her, nor was blamed by the <HI>Angel</HI> for so doing.</P>
<P>Nor is what you have now said, to prove the <HI>Subjection</HI> of Servants, and Slaves to be as <HI>absolute</HI> the one as the other, at all convincing for I have long since proved, that a <HI>Family</HI> and a <HI>Kingdom</HI> are very <HI>diffe∣rent things,</HI> and that <HI>Oeconomical</HI> and <HI>Civil Power</HI> do not only differ <HI>in Spe∣cie,</HI> but in <HI>Genere</HI> too. For tho' I grant, that <HI>Slavery</HI> might begin by <HI>Compact</HI> as well as by <HI>War,</HI> yet <HI>Subjection</HI> to <HI>Civil Power,</HI> could <HI>Regularly</HI> commence by <HI>Compact only</HI>; and therefore, since the <HI>Natural State</HI> of Mankind is that of <HI>Freedom</HI> from <HI>Slavery,</HI> all <HI>Subjects</HI> are supposed to be in <HI>that State</HI> of <HI>Freedom,</HI> and to have a <HI>Right</HI> both to their <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI>; which, if the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> go about <HI>forcibly</HI> to take away, they then <HI>cease</HI> to be so, since they take away the <HI>main End</HI> of their <HI>Institution,</HI> I mean, this of such a People, who are properly <HI>Sub∣jects,</HI>
<PB N="261" REF="139"/>
and not <HI>Slaves:</HI> For of those, who own themselves to be <HI>Slaves</HI> to their <HI>Prince,</HI> I told you already, I would not take upon me to <HI>meddle:</HI> Since I doubt whether such an <HI>Empire</HI> can be called a <HI>Civil Government,</HI> or not: So, that for all that you have hitherto said, I must still believe, St. <HI>Peter</HI> did not direct this Precept to <HI>Subjects</HI> but to <HI>Servants under the Yoak,</HI> that is, to <HI>Slaves,</HI> such as had <HI>no Property,</HI> in any thing, nor <HI>Power</HI> over their own <HI>Persons,</HI> but might be <HI>sold,</HI> and <HI>assigned</HI> with their Wives and Children to whom soever their master pleased; which, tho' not of <HI>Divine Institution,</HI> Yet since it was so <HI>ordained</HI> by the <HI>Civil Laws</HI> of the <HI>Empire,</HI> neither <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> nor yet his <HI>Apostles</HI> would make <HI>any Alteration</HI> in it. Nor hath he thought fit to do so, in any of those things, which we enjoy as our <HI>Civil</HI> or <HI>Natural Rights,</HI> by the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> or the <HI>Mu∣nicipal Laws</HI> of our Country: and therefore it is not <HI>true,</HI> that there is as <HI>perfect a Subjection</HI> due to a <HI>Soveraign Prince</HI> as to a <HI>Master,</HI> unless the <HI>People</HI> of that Nation have made themselves <HI>absolute Slaves</HI> to him, in∣stead of <HI>Subjects,</HI> which could never be but by their <HI>own Consent.</HI> It is true, a <HI>Prince</HI> is more <HI>eminently</HI> the <HI>Minister of God,</HI> and Acts by a more <HI>sacred,</HI> and <HI>inviolable Authority,</HI> than a <HI>Master</HI>; Yet doth it not therefore follow, that he acts as <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Minister,</HI> or by this <HI>sacred</HI> or <HI>inviolable Authority,</HI> when he <HI>de∣stroys,</HI> or <HI>enslaves</HI> the Subjects. Nor can you say that <HI>God</HI> hath given him any <HI>Authority</HI> so to do. And as for the Example of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Suffering, which you urge as a Reason of our <HI>absolute Subjection</HI> to <HI>Princes,</HI> without any <HI>Resistance</HI> I have answered that already, and therefore need say no more to it; But do own, that in that <HI>great Point</HI> of <HI>suffering for Religion,</HI> when we are <HI>lawfully</HI> called thereunto, we are to follow <HI>his Example,</HI> yet doth it not prove, that we are to suffer in <HI>all other Cases</HI> whatsoever, concerning which he hath given us no <HI>express Precept</HI> or <HI>Command.</HI></P>

good</HI> but theirs, who design thereby to gain a <HI>Power</HI> of doing to others▪ what they pretend to <HI>fear:</HI> And when all is done, the <HI>Punishment</HI> of <HI>Princes,</HI> who <HI>abuse</HI> their Power must be left to <HI>God Almighty,</HI> who only can and will <HI>punish</HI> his own Ministers.</P>
<P>Now suppose all this were just as it is stated, if the <HI>Injuries</HI> a Man suffer are <HI>insupport<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble</HI> under any Government he may <HI>Petition</HI> for re∣lief, and in all probability find it; if not, he may flie into <HI>another Country</HI> for succour▪ if he cannot do that neither, he will scarce be able to <HI>resist:</HI> So that if it were never so <HI>justifiable,</HI> it could be of <HI>no use</HI> to any such miserable man, for <HI>no Prince,</HI> tho' never so ill natur'd, will <HI>attempt</HI> any such thing against any such <HI>number of Men,</HI> as are in a capacity of <HI>revenging</HI> the Wrong done them, when they will, only <HI>out of hopes,</HI> they will not, because they ought not.

<P>I perceive you think this place of <HI>Scripture</HI> will not carry you through: and therefore you would fain <HI>confute</HI> my Arguments by <HI>ri∣diculing</HI> them. But in answer to the <HI>Expedients</HI> you have now pro∣posed, I think I may make this return. 1. As for <HI>petitioning</HI> when a <HI>Government</HI> grows <HI>insupportable,</HI> suppose then the <HI>Prince</HI> declares he will not be <HI>petitioned</HI> in this matter, but as the <HI>French King</HI> lately did, when the <HI>Protestants</HI> would have petition'd him against the <HI>Violation</HI> of the Edict of <HI>Nantes,</HI> delights to see men <HI>ruined,</HI> or suppose he lays any Man by the heels, that shall offer <HI>never so humbly</HI> to <HI>Petition</HI> him either in his <HI>own,</HI> or the <HI>People's behalf,</HI> as <HI>King Iames</HI> lately served the <HI>Bishops</HI>; then this <HI>Expedient</HI> can signifie <HI>nothing.</HI> As for the next, <HI>flying</HI> into another Country for <HI>Succour,</HI> that is, a very sorry comfort, that a Man must be <HI>forced</HI> to go, and <HI>beg his Bread</HI> in a <HI>strange Land</HI>; and whatever this may be a <HI>Duty</HI> for <HI>Private or Single Persons,</HI> yet it cannot extend to a <HI>whole Nation,</HI> since if <HI>all the People</HI> should go away, the <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> or <HI>Civil Society</HI> would be <HI>dissolved</HI>; and farther
<PB N="263" REF="140"/>
perhaps, as now in <HI>France,</HI> and in all <HI>Tyrannical Governments,</HI> it is commonly practiced, the <HI>Prince</HI> should forbid his Subjects to go <HI>out</HI> of his <HI>Kingdom</HI> upon <HI>Pain of Death,</HI> or being sent to the <HI>Galleys,</HI> then I think this <HI>expedient</HI> would signifie <HI>nothing</HI> neither. But now, if no∣thing else will do, you say, <HI>Resistance</HI> can be of <HI>no use</HI> fo such <HI>mise∣rable People,</HI> because a <HI>Prince</HI> will <HI>not dare</HI> to attempt any such thing against such a <HI>number of Men,</HI> as are in a <HI>Capacity</HI> of <HI>revenging</HI> the Wrongs done them, where they will, only out of hopes, that they will not, <HI>because they ought not to do it.</HI> I grant indeed that never any <HI>Ty∣rant</HI> when he went about thus to <HI>oppress</HI> his People, designed they should be in a <HI>Capacity</HI> to <HI>revenge</HI> the wrong he did them when they would: And therefore such <HI>Tyrants</HI> take very great Care by <HI>Guards,</HI> and <HI>Standing Armies</HI> to prevent it. But yet I can shew you a <HI>Prince,</HI> who very lately received such encouragement, by the <HI>Writing,</HI> and <HI>Preaching</HI> of our high <HI>Clergy,</HI> that he seemed <HI>resolved</HI> to bring in <HI>Po∣pery,</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Government</HI> upon us chiefly out of Hopes, that the People <HI>would not, because</HI> (as he thought) <HI>they ought not to resist:</HI> And tho' I also grant, that <HI>few Monarchs</HI> injure <HI>particular Men</HI> so much▪ but that, if they believe them able to <HI>revenge</HI> the Wrong, they took care as far as they could to <HI>prevent</HI> it: Yet this signifies nothing if once a <HI>whole Nation</HI> come to be <HI>opprest,</HI> and disgusted against the <HI>Government:</HI> For if such a <HI>Prince,</HI> or <HI>Common-wealth have</HI> not the <HI>Assi∣stance</HI> of some <HI>other Power,</HI> either his own <HI>standing Army,</HI> or his <HI>Neigh∣bours,</HI> his <HI>Authority</HI> would soon be at an <HI>End:</HI> Thus we read of the <HI>Massacre,</HI> and <HI>expulsion</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> out of <HI>Sicily,</HI> it was done in the <HI>twinkling</HI> of an Eye, and before those in Power had the <HI>least Suspiti∣on</HI> of it. So likewise in the late <HI>Revolt</HI> of the <HI>Portugueses</HI> from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> his <HI>Government</HI> was at an <HI>End</HI> in little more than a <HI>days time,</HI> and that Nation will tell you, that they look upon the <HI>Be∣nefit</HI> of being governed by a <HI>Prince</HI> of their <HI>own,</HI> and enjoying their <HI>own Laws,</HI> as very well worth that <HI>Expence of Blood, and Treasure</HI> they were at to obtain it. To conclude, I do not speak this to <HI>en∣courage</HI> the <HI>Rabble,</HI> or <HI>Great,</HI> and <HI>Little Vulgar</HI> (as you call them) to <HI>take Arms,</HI> and punish <HI>Princes</HI> every time they do amiss: Nor have I at all <HI>asserted,</HI> that <HI>Princes</HI> may be <HI>punished</HI> by their <HI>Subjects</HI> unless you can prove to me, that <HI>every one</HI> who <HI>resists</HI> the Violence of ano∣ther, is his <HI>Lord,</HI> and <HI>Master.</HI> Neither do I maintain, that tho' <HI>Princes</HI> are <HI>bound</HI> to act <HI>according to Laws,</HI> and to their <HI>Oaths,</HI> yet if they do <HI>otherwise</HI> they are presently to be <HI>treated</HI> as <HI>Tyrants</HI>; and the <HI>Com∣mon Enemies</HI> of Mankind, or that it is <HI>Lawful</HI> for every <HI>Private Man</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> himself against the <HI>Injustice,</HI> and <HI>Oppression</HI> of his <HI>Prince:</HI> I grant such <HI>Doctrine</HI> would serve to <HI>fill</HI> the World with <HI>Rebellions, Wars,</HI> and <HI>Confusions,</HI> and may produce all those <HI>dreadful Consequences</HI> you have here set forth.</P>
<P>But on the other side, under such a <HI>Tyranny</HI> as where the <HI>whole People,</HI> or the <HI>Major part</HI> of them, shall happen to be <HI>assaulted, ensla∣ved,</HI> and <HI>oppressed</HI> to that Degree, that <HI>no Man</HI> can tell when he is
<PB N="264" REF="141"/>
<HI>safe</HI>; I say, in such Cases a <HI>Tyrant</HI> may destroy <HI>more thousands</HI> of Men, ravish <HI>more Women,</HI> and ruine <HI>more Families,</HI> and <HI>Estates,</HI> than it is like∣ly to be done by the <HI>Highest Resistance</HI> the People can make against him: Since they are <HI>Mad</HI> if ever they make <HI>this Resistance</HI> unless they are also <HI>morally sure</HI> either by their <HI>own Strength,</HI> or the <HI>Assistance</HI> of their <HI>Neighbours</HI> of <HI>succeeding</HI> in the attempt.</P>
<P>Nor do the Consequences of <HI>such Resistance,</HI> but rarely fall out in the manner you suppose. For it <HI>seldom</HI> happens but that the <HI>New Prince</HI> to whom the People <HI>submit</HI> themselves, will (being warned by the <HI>Example</HI> of his <HI>Predecessor</HI>) take Care to govern with <HI>greater Mer∣cy,</HI> and <HI>Moderation,</HI> and it is much more unlikely, that if they chuse, or set up <HI>many Representatives</HI> out of their <HI>own Body,</HI> that they will be easily <HI>corrupted</HI> by <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>Greatness</HI> thus to <HI>oppress</HI> the People. And lastly, it is much less probable, that the <HI>People</HI> can continue <HI>long</HI> in an <HI>Anarchy</HI> without any Government at all. So that to conclude, this <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>resisting</HI> of <HI>Princes,</HI> or other <HI>Supream Powers</HI> in Cases of <HI>Extremity</HI> is so far from tending to the <HI>Ruine</HI> of Mankind that I cannot see how they can be <HI>safe</HI> without it; and tho' the <HI>Punishment</HI> of <HI>Princes</HI> who <HI>abuse</HI> their Power may be left to <HI>God Almighty,</HI> yet I am confident the <HI>resisting</HI> of those, who tho' they have the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Sword</HI> in their Hand, yet act as none of <HI>Gods Ministers,</HI> is neither <HI>contrary</HI> to the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> nor <HI>Nature.</HI></P>

<P>You may spare your Pains for making any <HI>long Explanation</HI> on this <HI>Text,</HI> for I have already granted that all <HI>due Submission</HI> is to be given, not only to the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> but also to <HI>all those</HI> who are put in <HI>Authority</HI> under them, <HI>and that not only for Wrath, but for Conscience sake</HI>; yet is this place to be understood in the <HI>same sense</HI> as the former, that is, as far as they make <HI>use</HI> of this <HI>Power</HI> for the <HI>great ends</HI> of <HI>Government</HI> (viz.) the <HI>Good,</HI> and <HI>Preservation</HI> of the People, and not for their <HI>Ruine</HI> and <HI>Destruction,</HI> by taking away their <HI>Lives, Liberties,</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> at their pleasure. So that this Precept is to be understood, according to the Reason, which both St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives for this <HI>Submission,</HI> because <HI>Rulers are not a Terrour to good works, but to the Evil</HI>; and because, <HI>such Governours are for the Punishment of Evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well</HI>; and even a Government, where a <HI>Heathen Prince</HI> hath such <HI>Supream Power</HI> may, and doth most commonly in respect to most of its Sub∣jects, give <HI>more countenance,</HI> and <HI>encouragement</HI> to <HI>good</HI> works than <HI>bad</HI> ones, and therefore <HI>Obedience</HI> to such a sort of <HI>Governours</HI> is not on∣ly <HI>Lawful,</HI> but a <HI>Duty:</HI> Nay, tho' through Ignorance, and Malice, they might <HI>persecute</HI> the <HI>true Religion:</HI> for I have already proved, that at the time of Writing of these <HI>Epistles</HI> there was no <HI>Actual Perse∣cution</HI> begun by the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours against the <HI>Christians</HI>; and tho they did afterwards <HI>persecute</HI> them, yet even <HI>such as did so,</HI> being com∣monly men of <HI>good Morals,</HI> and having much of <HI>Goodness, Iustice,</HI> and <HI>Prudence</HI> in their Natures (such as was <HI>Trajan,</HI> and the two <HI>Antoni∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u's</HI>) they would not fail extreamly to <HI>encourage</HI> the Practice of <HI>such,</HI> and <HI>other vertues</HI> by their <HI>Examples,</HI> and by <HI>good Laws</HI> preserve their Subjects from the <HI>Mischiefs</HI> of <HI>Immoralities,</HI> and keep them in Order, Peace, and Sobriety.

<P>If this be the <HI>Sense</HI> you put upon this place, I think I shall easily shew you not only the <HI>Absurdity,</HI> but <HI>perniciousness</HI> of this <HI>Inter∣pretation,</HI> which indeed doth <HI>undermine</HI> all that <HI>Obedience</HI> and <HI>Subjecti∣on</HI> that is due from <HI>Subjects</HI> to their <HI>Soveraigns,</HI> unless they <HI>rule well,</HI> that is, according to their Humours, or Fancies. Now I pray,
<Q>Con∣sider whether these great <HI>Apostles</HI> intended to oblige the <HI>Christians</HI> of that Age to yield <HI>Obedience</HI> to those Powers, which then gover∣ned the World. If they did, (as I think no Man will be so hardly as to say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S <HI>C. R.</HI> p. 149, 150.</NOTE> that they did not) then it will be proper to inquire whether, what they here affirm, and assign as the Reason of their Subjection, <HI>That Rulers are not a Terrour to good works but to the Evil, were true of the then Roman Emperours, and Governours, or not.</HI> If it were true, then I believe it will hold true of <HI>all Kings</HI> in all Ages of the World; for there cannot well be greater <HI>Tyrants</HI> than the <HI>Roman Em∣perours</HI> were at this time: and so this will prove an <HI>Eternal Reason,</HI>
<PB N="266" REF="142"/>
why we should be <HI>Subject</HI> to <HI>Princes,</HI> notwithstanding the many faults, and miscarriages of their Government. <HI>And</HI> if it were not true, it is very strange; that two such great <HI>Apostles,</HI> should use such an Argument to perswade Christians, to submit to the Powers as only proved the quite contrary, that they ought not to be Sub∣ject to the present Powers, because they were unjust▪ and Tyranni∣cal, and <HI>which indeed</HI> in contradiction to the Original design, and Institution of Civil Power, we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a Terrour to good works, and not to the Evil.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Christians</HI> were at this time <HI>actually persecuted</HI> by the <HI>Iews</HI> in <HI>Palestine,</HI> and if they were not then also persecuted by the <HI>Emperours,</HI> yet it was that which they might <HI>daily expect,</HI> considering their <HI>extra∣ordinary wickedness,</HI> and <HI>Cruelty</HI>: And yet the <HI>Apostle</HI> exhorts them <HI>not to resist the Powers,</HI> because they were not (that is, should not be) <HI>a Terrour to good works, but to the Evil.</HI>
<Q>If by this he only means,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> that they should be Subject to them, while the, encouraged vertue, and vertuous Men, but might rebel against them when they did the contrary: How could the <HI>Christians</HI> of those days think themselves obliged by this to sub∣mit to the Higher Powers▪</Q></P>
<P><Q>For this was not their Case they suffered for Righteousness sake, the Supream Powers were a Terrour to them, tho' they were In∣nocent, tho' they could not charge them either with breaking the Laws of God, or Men; and therefore <HI>upon your Principles</HI> they were not bound to submit to them whenever they could find it safe to resist. So that either <HI>you</HI> put a false comment upon the Text, or while the <HI>Apostle</HI> undertakes to deter them from Resistance, he ur∣ges such an Argument, as was proper only to perswade them to rebel.</Q></P>

<P>Had you been pleased to have minded more attentively, what I said last, you would not have thus <HI>misrepresented</HI> my sense; for I have already proved, that there was <HI>no Persecution</HI> in the <HI>Roman Em∣pire,</HI> against the <HI>Christians</HI> when those <HI>Epistles</HI> were written, nor for many years after, and I have also granted that if the <HI>Emperours</HI> had so <HI>persecuted</HI> them they ought <HI>not</HI> to have <HI>resisted:</HI> And therefore by good works, and Evil doers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in both those <HI>Texts</HI> of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> is not to be understood, only believing in <HI>Christ,</HI> or beha∣ving themselves as became <HI>Innocent Christians,</HI> but in general that at that time when the <HI>Apostles</HI> wrote these <HI>Epistles</HI> under <HI>Claudius,</HI> and the beginning of <HI>Nero,</HI> (and indeed through his <HI>whole Reign</HI> where he go∣verned by his <HI>Deputies</HI>) the <HI>Supream Power</HI> was then really a <HI>Terrour to Evil Works,</HI> that is, to all offences against good manners, and the <HI>publick Peace</HI> of the <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> and were also a <HI>Punishment</HI> for <HI>Evil-doers,</HI> that is, those that did <HI>transgress</HI> against the <HI>Publick Laws</HI> or∣dained for the <HI>restraining</HI> Men from committing any sort of <HI>publick Wickedness,</HI> or <HI>Immorality.</HI> So that I own that neither the <HI>Heathens,</HI> nor the <HI>Christians</HI> had any Reason to <HI>take Arms</HI> or <HI>resist</HI> the <HI>Supream Power</HI> at this time.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="142"/>But admit there had been at that time <HI>great Miscarriages,</HI> and <HI>A∣buses</HI> committed under their <HI>Government,</HI> and that <HI>good Men</HI> had been often times <HI>punished,</HI> and <HI>Evil</HI> ones <HI>Rewarded,</HI> and the <HI>Ends of Govern∣ment</HI> to some Degree <HI>perverted,</HI> especially at <HI>Rome,</HI> where the Empe∣rours took a <HI>Liberty</HI> of doing many <HI>unjust,</HI> and <HI>Tyrannical</HI> Actions▪ Yet I have no where (that I know of) affirmed, that <HI>Princes</HI> ought, to be <HI>Resisted only for being Evil,</HI> or <HI>Wicked,</HI> or that <HI>all</HI> the <HI>evil Actions</HI> and <HI>Mis-government</HI> of <HI>Princes</HI> or their <HI>Subordinate Ministers</HI> ought to be <HI>Resisted</HI> by the People; but I have all along asserted the contrary,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S.C.R. p.</HI> 153.</NOTE> for I own that
<Q>no human Government can be so exact, and perfect, but it may be Guilty of great Miscarriages;</Q>
<HI>Good Men</HI> may <HI>suffer,</HI> and <HI>bad men</HI> may <HI>flourish</HI> under a <HI>vertuous Prince,</HI> much more under those that are themselves <HI>wicked,</HI> and <HI>unjust:</HI> and there are many Degrees of <HI>evil Government</HI> and <HI>Tyranny,</HI> some of which may consist well enough with the <HI>common Safe∣ty</HI> of the People, which was the <HI>Condition</HI> of most of the <HI>Subjects</HI> of the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> under the Reigns of <HI>Claudius</HI> and <HI>Nero.</HI> Since they did then enjoy the <HI>Protection</HI> of the <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> and all the <HI>Civil Rights</HI> of the Subjects; and therefore, you very much mistake me in supposing, that I maintain, we are <HI>only bound</HI> to be <HI>subject</HI> to those <HI>Su∣pream Powers,</HI> who rule <HI>well,</HI> or who <HI>punish Wickedness,</HI> and <HI>reward Ver∣tue:</HI> Since I grant this was scarce ever performed <HI>exactly</HI> even under the most <HI>Regular Governments,</HI> yet there is a great deal of difference between <HI>bearing</HI> with the <HI>common Infirmities</HI> of all <HI>Governments</HI>; and such <HI>intolerable Violences</HI> that <HI>dissolve</HI> the <HI>Government</HI> it self, as by <HI>ma∣king War</HI> upon the People, and <HI>invading</HI> their <HI>Civil Liberty,</HI> and <HI>Proper∣ty.</HI> As for Example, no Man doubts, but the <HI>King</HI> may <HI>pardon</HI> a <HI>Rob∣ber,</HI> or a <HI>Murderer,</HI> but if instead of <HI>hanging,</HI> he should <HI>pardon all Thieves,</HI> and <HI>Murderers,</HI> that should rob or murder in a <HI>year</HI> or <HI>two</HI> together, and should likewise <HI>list</HI> them in his <HI>Guards</HI> to <HI>kill</HI> and <HI>rob</HI> whom they <HI>pleased,</HI> provided he had a <HI>share</HI> of the <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y</HI>; I would ve∣ry fain know of you, or any other reasonable man, whether the <HI>Peo∣ple</HI> were <HI>bound</HI> to bear it, and whether they might <HI>not Resist</HI> them, tho' they had the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Commission</HI> for so doing.</P>
<P>To conclude, when the <HI>Apostle</HI> here says, that <HI>Rulers are not a Ter∣rour to good Works but to the Evil, and that they are for the punishment of Evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well</HI>; the <HI>Apostles</HI> only mean in general, the <HI>great Advantages</HI> of <HI>Civil Government</HI> for the <HI>Sup∣pression</HI> of <HI>Wickedness,</HI> and <HI>Encouragement</HI> of <HI>Vertue,</HI> which is the <HI>true End,</HI> and the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st improvement of <HI>Human Power.</HI> But this also is in <HI>great measure</HI> obtain'd under <HI>Evil,</HI> and (to some degree) <HI>Tyrannical Prin∣ces,</HI> and therefore this Argument for Subjection is good, even under a <HI>Tyrant. Publick Iustice</HI> was administred under the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Ne∣ro,</HI> and <HI>good Men</HI> were then commonly <HI>rewarded,</HI> and <HI>bad men punished.</HI> And tho <HI>Iustice</HI> be not so <HI>equally,</HI> and so <HI>universally</HI> administred under a <HI>bad Prince,</HI> as under a <HI>good one,</HI> tho' such a <HI>Tyrant</HI> may <HI>oppress</HI> many of his Subjects, and be the occasion of <HI>divers Calamities,</HI>
<PB N="268" REF="143"/>
yet whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>main ends</HI> of <HI>Civil Government</HI> are maintained, it lays a <HI>great Restraint</HI> upon the <HI>unruly Lusts,</HI> and <HI>Passions</HI> of Men, and gives <HI>great security</HI> to the <HI>Iust,</HI> and <HI>Innocent.</HI> And therefore, good Men are concerned to promote the Peace, and security of <HI>Civil Government,</HI> tho' the <HI>Prince</HI> be in some degree a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> for there <HI>is more security</HI> to be had under such a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> than in a <HI>Civil War.</HI></P>
<P>In ordinary cases it is very possible for <HI>private good Men</HI> to live <HI>easily</HI> and <HI>tolerably</HI> under a very <HI>bad Prince,</HI> and tho' it should be their <HI>Lot</HI> to <HI>suffer,</HI> yet since the <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Quiet</HI> of <HI>human Societies</HI> is in it self so <HI>great a Blessing,</HI> and the <HI>publick Good</HI> may be better <HI>consulted</HI> by the <HI>Preservation</HI> of <HI>Government,</HI> than by <HI>Resistance</HI>; it becomes every <HI>good Man</HI> rather to <HI>suffer patiently</HI> under such a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> than to <HI>shake</HI> and <HI>unsettle Civil Government,</HI> and disturb the <HI>natural Course</HI> of Justice, by <HI>Sedition</HI> and <HI>Tumults.</HI></P>
<P>Yet all this is to be understood of such <HI>Degrees</HI> of <HI>Tyranny,</HI> or <HI>evil Government,</HI> as may consist with the <HI>main Ends</HI> of a <HI>Civil Society,</HI> or <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> and as far as the <HI>publick Good</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> may be better <HI>consulted,</HI> and <HI>preserved</HI> by the <HI>Preservation,</HI> than <HI>Resistance</HI> of it; I grant it to be <HI>every Man</HI>'s <HI>Duty patiently to suffer</HI> many Injuries and Abuses, rather than to make any <HI>publick Disturbance</HI>: So on the other side, when the <HI>main Ends</HI> of <HI>Civil Government,</HI> viz. the <HI>Common Pre∣servation</HI> of the Peoples <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> are <HI>actually,</HI> or about to be <HI>destroyed,</HI> I think every <HI>honest man</HI> that is careful of his <HI>own,</HI> and his <HI>Posterities well-being,</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> may, nay, ought (if <HI>no other Remedy</HI> can be had) to make <HI>Resistance,</HI> not for the <HI>Destru∣ction,</HI> but <HI>Preservation</HI> of <HI>Civil Government,</HI> which I already look upon as good as <HI>dissolved,</HI> before such <HI>Resistance,</HI> can be <HI>Law∣ful.</HI></P>

<P>I must confess <HI>your Doctrine,</HI> as you have explained it, is not <HI>so bad</HI> as I supposed at the first hearing, but if <HI>People</HI> may <HI>never Resist,</HI> till things come to <HI>such a State,</HI> as that by a <HI>general Invasion</HI> of Mens <HI>Lives, Liberties</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> the <HI>Civil Government</HI> be in a manner <HI>de∣stroyed</HI> (as you suppose) the <HI>People</HI> may stay <HI>long enough</HI> before ever they shall be in a <HI>Condition</HI> to make this <HI>Resistance.</HI> For in all the <HI>small Observations</HI> that I have made out of <HI>History,</HI> I never could find the <HI>People generally reduced</HI> to so sad a Case, as this you have put: <HI>most</HI> of the <HI>Rebellions</HI> and <HI>Alterations</HI> of <HI>Government</HI> that I have read of, having begun from a <HI>few Tyrannical</HI> Actions committed upon the <HI>Persons,</HI> or <HI>Estates</HI> of some <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Powerful Men,</HI> who being <HI>beloved</HI> by the <HI>People,</HI> were able to stir them up to <HI>revenge</HI> their <HI>particular Inju∣ries</HI>; Thus <HI>one single Act</HI> of Lust in the younger <HI>Tarquins</HI> ravishing <HI>Lucretia,</HI> gave occasion to <HI>Brutus,</HI> and her Husband <HI>Colatine,</HI> to <HI>take Arms</HI> against <HI>Tarquin,</HI> and by <HI>expelling</HI> him and his <HI>Family</HI> to set up a <HI>Com∣mon-wealth.</HI> And therefore, since this Case of such as an <HI>extream intolera∣ble Tyranny</HI> as you mention, can <HI>never,</HI> or at least <HI>very rarely</HI> happen, I think I may still <HI>maintain,</HI> what I <HI>first affirmed,</HI> that it is <HI>much better</HI> to put this <HI>mischief</HI> to the <HI>venture,</HI> and suffer all the <HI>Inconveniences</HI> that
<PB N="269" REF="143"/>
may happen from it, than by allowing the <HI>People</HI> to be their <HI>own Iudges,</HI> when the <HI>Government</HI> proves <HI>insupportable,</HI> to give them a <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Iudging</HI> and <HI>Resisting</HI> whenever they shall pretend that it is so, which they may make use of <HI>not</HI> to <HI>secure</HI> their own <HI>Liberties,</HI> and <HI>Estates,</HI> but to <HI>gratifie</HI> their own <HI>Humours,</HI> or else the <HI>Ambition</HI> or <HI>Revenge</HI> of great and <HI>factious men.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S.C.</HI>R. <HI>p.</HI> 160.</NOTE>
<Q>So that unless there is some Power that is <HI>irresistible,</HI> from whence there lies no Appeal,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 161.</NOTE> it is impossible for any Government to subsist. And tho' it is not necessary that this Pow∣er should be always in the hands of one Man, yet if God hath placed it in the hands of a <HI>Prince,</HI> there it must be irresistible too, however he uses it: For if once it be made lawful to resist the Supream Power where ever it is placed, you dissolve human Socie∣ties, or at least expose them to perpetual Disorders and Convulsions. Factious and Ambitious Men will <HI>still</HI> find Pretences to resist good Princes as well as bad, and no Government can be any longer secure than whilst ill-designing men want power to resist.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Now then to pass a true Judgment on this <HI>whole</HI> Matter, we must not only consider what present Inconveniences, we may suffer from the irresistible Power of the <HI>worst</HI> Tyrant, but <HI>also</HI> what an irrepara∣ble Mischief it is, for ever to unsettle the Foundations of Govern∣ment. We must consider whether Civil Government be the great∣er Blessing to Mankind, or a Tyrant the greater Curse: whether it be more desirable to endure the Insolence, and Injustice of <HI>the great∣est</HI> Tyrant, when the Power falls into such a hand, or for ever to be deprived of the Security of Government, and the Blessings of Peace, and Order. And therefore, there is great Reason why God should so severely forbid the Resistance of <HI>all</HI> Princes, tho' <HI>the Cru∣ellest</HI> Tyrants <HI>you can imagine</HI>; and why we should quietly, and con∣tentedly submit to this Divine Appointment, because the Resistance of the Supream Powers, (were it once allowed by God) would weak∣en the Authority of <HI>all</HI> Human Governments, and expose them to the Rage, and Frenzy of Ambitious, and discontented States Men, or wild Enthusiasts. And this, I think, is a sufficient Answer to this Pretence, that the Apostle limits our Subjection to Princes to the re∣gular Exercise of their Authority.</Q></P>

<P>I see we are ev'n come where we set out, to the <HI>necessity</HI> of an <HI>Irresistible Power,</HI> and the mischief that must follow if the <HI>People</HI> ever <HI>Iudge</HI> for themselves, which indeed is but the same Argument in <HI>Politicks,</HI> which the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> makes use of for the <HI>necessity</HI> of an <HI>Infallible Iudge</HI> in <HI>spirituals,</HI> because otherwise if the <HI>People</HI> should <HI>judge</HI> for themselves, in matters of <HI>Religion,</HI> there would <HI>nothing</HI> follow but <HI>Anarchy,</HI> and <HI>Confusion</HI> in the <HI>Church,</HI> and that there would be as <HI>many Religions</HI> as there are <HI>Men</HI>; And so you likewise urge, that if the <HI>Peo∣ple</HI> may ever once come to <HI>Iudge,</HI> when they are <HI>assaulted, enslaved,</HI> or <HI>opprest,</HI> and should have a <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>making Resistance,</HI> nothing but <HI>A∣narchy</HI> and <HI>Confusion</HI> must follow in the <HI>Common wealth.</HI> And truly I
<PB N="270" REF="144"/>
think the <HI>Argument</HI> is as good for the <HI>one</HI> as the <HI>other,</HI> and as I hope we may be always good <HI>Orthodox Christians</HI> without such an <HI>infallible Iudge</HI> in matters of <HI>Faith,</HI> so I think we may be <HI>Loyal Subjects</HI> to our <HI>Prince</HI> without <HI>investing</HI> him with an <HI>Irresistible Power,</HI> of doing with us what ever he hath a mind to.</P>
<P>But since you have only repeated, what you have said at our last meeting, when we first began to <HI>debate</HI> this Question, so I must beg you pardon, if I refresh your <HI>Memory,</HI> and again repeat my <HI>Answers.</HI> In the first place, I deny that it must follow, that if once it be made <HI>Lawful to resist</HI> the <HI>Supream Power,</HI> where ever placed, this must <HI>dissolve Civil Societies,</HI> or expose them to <HI>perpetual Disorder,</HI> because (forsooth) some <HI>Factious</HI> and <HI>ambitious Men</HI> will find Pretences to <HI>Resist good Prin∣ces</HI> as well as <HI>bad.</HI> For first I have all along supposed the <HI>Civil Socie∣ty</HI> as good as <HI>dissolved,</HI> before such <HI>Resistance</HI> is <HI>Lawful</HI>: And therefore, the <HI>Convulsions</HI> or <HI>Disorders</HI> of a <HI>Civil War</HI> can scarce be <HI>worse</HI> than <HI>such a State,</HI> and until the People are under this Condition, I grant <HI>factious,</HI> and <HI>ambitious Men</HI> may make Pretences <HI>to Resist good Princes,</HI> as well as <HI>bad,</HI> and may find some followers as wicked as themselves, to take the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> part. Yet <HI>this Infection</HI> seldom, or never seizeth upon a <HI>whole Nation,</HI> who hath always <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>Affection</HI> enough for the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> to joyn with them, to <HI>Suppress</HI> such <HI>Rebels.</HI> I grant, we ought always to consider, whether <HI>Civil Government</HI> be the <HI>greater Blessing</HI> to Mankind or a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> the <HI>greater Chrs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>; But I do never suppose, such <HI>Resistance</HI> to be <HI>Lawful,</HI> but when the <HI>Power</HI> falls into <HI>such hands,</HI> that tho' they may call themselves a <HI>Civil Government,</HI> yet the <HI>People</HI> are almost as <HI>totally</HI> deprived of all that <HI>Security,</HI> and those <HI>Blessings</HI> of Peace, and order, which they may justly expect from it, as if they were in a <HI>State of War.</HI> And therefore, as you suppose that <HI>God Almighty</HI> forbids the <HI>Resistance</HI> of the most <HI>cruel Tyrants,</HI> because this <HI>Resistance,</HI> were it once allowed, by giving the <HI>People</HI> a <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Iudging,</HI> would weaken the <HI>Authority</HI> of <HI>Human Governments,</HI> and expose them to the Rage, and <HI>Frenzy</HI> of <HI>Ambitious,</HI> and <HI>discontented States-Men,</HI> or <HI>Wild Enthusiasts,</HI> And this, you think a sufficient Answer.</P>
<P>So on the other side, if this <HI>Resistance</HI> be in <HI>no case lawful,</HI> tho' in never so <HI>great Extremities,</HI> and that the People must not <HI>judge,</HI> when they are so <HI>cruelly</HI> used, as that it is <HI>no longer</HI> to be <HI>endured,</HI> not only the <HI>Persons</HI> of <HI>Princes</HI> are Sacred, and <HI>irresistible,</HI> but also all those <HI>In∣struments</HI> of <HI>Tyranny</HI> whom they may hire, and employ to that purpose, by which means <HI>all Government</HI> whatsoever will not only be <HI>Absolute,</HI> but <HI>Arbitrary,</HI> and without any <HI>sufficient Obligations</HI> to other Mercy, Justice, and the <HI>Common Good,</HI> than what the <HI>Tyrannical Will,</HI> or Hu∣mour of one, or more men shall please to allow. So that the <HI>Lives, Liberties,</HI> and <HI>Estates</HI> of a <HI>free People</HI> or <HI>Nation</HI> shall be in as <HI>bad</HI> or a <HI>worse Condition,</HI> than if they were <HI>Slaves,</HI> if all means of <HI>defending</HI> themselves by their own <HI>Resistance,</HI> or joyning with those that would <HI>assist</HI> them be <HI>wholly denyed</HI> them. And whether God can ever be the

<P>I have already proved at our last meeting, that <HI>Resistance</HI> for <HI>self-defence</HI> against those, who have the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Sword,</HI> is a <HI>Right of Nature conferred by God on all Mankind,</HI> and unless you can shew me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>place of Sculpture,</HI> which takes it quite away.

<P>I cannot deny but you have fairly enough represented the <HI>Chief Heads,</HI> or <HI>Principles,</HI> which the Reverend <HI>Primate</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndertakes to prove in this <HI>Excellent Treatise:</HI> And I think you have your self grant∣ed <HI>enough</HI> to <HI>confute</HI> all you have already said For in the first place, if it be <HI>unlawful,</HI> for every particular <HI>private Subject</HI> to <HI>Resist</HI> the <HI>Su∣pream Powers,</HI> it will likewise follow, that it will be also <HI>unlawful,</HI> for a <HI>whole Nation.</HI> For a <HI>whole Nation,</HI> is only a <HI>Systeme</HI> or Collection of <HI>particular Persons,</HI> and <HI>Universals</HI> have no <HI>real Being</HI> in Nature, but on∣ly in our <HI>Ideas:</HI> So that if it be <HI>unlawful</HI> for every <HI>particular Person</HI> to <HI>Resist,</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> himself, in case he is <HI>injured,</HI> and <HI>opprest,</HI> it must be also <HI>unlawful</HI> for a <HI>whole People,</HI> which consists of <HI>individuals</HI> to make such <HI>Resistance</HI>; and it is a Rule in <HI>Logick,</HI> that <HI>nothing can be affirmed of Individuals, which may not also be affirmed of the whole Species.</HI></P>
<P>So likewise if you grant, That the <HI>Primitive Christians</HI> ought not to have <HI>Resisted</HI> the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> in case of <HI>Persecution</HI> for <HI>Religion,</HI> I think it will likewise as well prove, that they ought <HI>not</HI> to <HI>Resist</HI> upon any <HI>account whatsoever,</HI> since certainly, there cannot be <HI>greater Wrongs,</HI> or <HI>Violences</HI> committed in the World by <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> than to allow them an <HI>Irresistible Power</HI> of putting those to <HI>death</HI> that bear <HI>witness</HI> to the <HI>Truth</HI> of the Gospel, since a <HI>whole Nation</HI> may be as well thereby <HI>destroyed,</HI> if they prove firm to the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, and that the <HI>Prince</HI> continue <HI>obstinately Cruel.</HI> And you might as well argue that
<PB N="273" REF="149"/>
<HI>Patient Suffering</HI> without <HI>Resistance</HI> ought not to be exercised in this Case, because it is <HI>destructive</HI> to <HI>Mankind,</HI> and the <HI>Quiet</HI> of a <HI>Civil Socie∣ty,</HI> as to argue from the same Reason that a <HI>whole Nation</HI> is not obli∣ged to <HI>suffer</HI> without any <HI>Resistance</HI>; when their <HI>Lives, Liberties</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> are <HI>invaded</HI> by the <HI>Supream Powers.</HI> So that if the <HI>Primitive Christians</HI> might <HI>not Resist</HI> the <HI>Roman Emperours,</HI> when they made so <HI>great</HI> a <HI>part</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> and were so <HI>vast</HI> a <HI>multitude</HI> in the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> in the time of <HI>Tertuliian,</HI> as that he tells the Emperour <HI>Seve∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> in his <HI>Apology</HI> for the <HI>Christians</HI> to this effect,
<Q>That had they a mind to profess <HI>open Hostility,</HI> and to practice <HI>secret Rev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nge,</HI> could they want <HI>numbers</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> or <HI>sorce</HI> of <HI>Arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>? Are the <HI>Moors,</HI> the <HI>Mar∣comans,</HI> or the <HI>Parthians</HI> themselves, or any one particular Nation whatsoever, <HI>more</HI> in <HI>number</HI> than they, who are <HI>spread o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI> the whole World? They are indeed not of <HI>your way,</HI> and yet they have <HI>silled</HI> all you have; your <HI>Cities, Islands, Castl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Towns, Assemblies,</HI> your very <HI>Tents, Tribes,</HI> and <HI>Wards,</HI> yea the <HI>Pallace, Senate</HI> and <HI>Place</HI> of Judgment.</Q></P>
<P>Nor need I to mention at large the famous Story of the <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>baean Le∣gion,</HI> who all of them suffered <HI>Death</HI> rather than they would either <HI>Sa∣crifice</HI> to <HI>Idols,</HI> or <HI>Resist</HI> the <HI>Emperour</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Forces,</HI> tho' they were between six or seven thousand Men, and might have <HI>sold</HI> their Lives <HI>dear enough.</HI> And if an <HI>Emperour</HI> may murder so many <HI>thousands</HI> without any <HI>Re∣sistance,</HI> I see no Reason why he may not put a <HI>whole Nation</HI> of <HI>Christi∣ans</HI> to death by the same Reason.</P>
<P>Nor will one of your Reasons which you bring for it, signifie any thing, that the <HI>Christians</HI> were to suffer without <HI>Resistance,</HI> be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause <HI>Pa∣ganism</HI> was then the <HI>Religion Established by</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> of the <HI>Empire</HI>; for if a <HI>Municipal Law,</HI> as this was, ought to be <HI>over-ruled</HI> by the <HI>Natural Law</HI> or <HI>self-defence</HI> when they happen to <HI>Clash,</HI> then the <HI>Christians</HI> who li∣ved under the <HI>Heathen Emperours,</HI> might <HI>lawfully</HI> have <HI>taken up Arms</HI> a∣gainst the <HI>Government</HI> because they were <HI>deprived</HI> of their <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> against all <HI>Equity</HI> and <HI>Humanity.</HI> For to <HI>persecute</HI> men so re∣markably <HI>Regular,</HI> and <HI>Peaceable,</HI> both in their <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Practises,</HI> is as manifest a <HI>Violation</HI> of the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> as is possible. And if it was <HI>Lawful</HI> for them to <HI>Resist,</HI> then they seem <HI>bound in Conscience</HI> to do it whenever they had a <HI>Probability</HI> of prevailing. For without doubt, it's a great fault for a Man to <HI>throw away his Life, impoverish his Family and encourage Tyranny, when he hath a fair▪remedy at hand.</HI></P>

<P>If you had a little better remembred, what I have already said on this Subject, you might have <HI>spared</HI> these <HI>Objections,</HI> for as to the first of them, it is rather a <HI>Logical Fallacy,</HI> than a <HI>true Answer.</HI> For in the first place, I have all along <HI>Asserted,</HI> that <HI>no Man ought</HI> to give up his <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>self defence,</HI> but in order to a <HI>greater good,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>publick Peace</HI> and <HI>Preservation</HI> of the <HI>Common-wealth.</HI>) And therefore, Dr. <HI>Fern,</HI> and others of your Opinion, do acknowledge, that <HI>David</HI> might have made use of <HI>defensive Arms</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> himself against those <HI>Cut-throats,</HI> that <HI>Saul</HI> send to <HI>take away</HI> his Life, tho' he might not have <HI>Resisted</HI>
<PB N="274" REF="150"/>
Saul's <HI>own person,</HI> and you your self have already granted, that <HI>no Man can want Authority to defend his Life against him that hath no Authority to take it away.</HI> So that if this <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Self-defence</HI> is sometimes <HI>suspended,</HI> it is onely in <HI>Submission</HI> to a <HI>Higher Law</HI> of preserving the <HI>publick Peace</HI> of the <HI>Common wealth,</HI> or <HI>Civil Society,</HI> which being once <HI>br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken</HI> and gone by a <HI>general Violence</HI> upon all mens <HI>Lives, Liberties</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> of that Nation, or Kingdom, that <HI>Obligation</HI> of maintaining the <HI>publick Peace</HI> being taken away, every Man's <HI>natural Right</HI> of not only <HI>defend∣ing</HI> himself, but his <HI>innocent Neighbour,</HI> again takes place. And there∣fore, <HI>your Logical Maxim,</HI> that <HI>nothing</HI> can be affirmed of <HI>Individuals,</HI> which may not be affirmed of the <HI>whole Species,</HI> signifyeth nothing in this Matter; for every <HI>Individual</HI> had before <HI>potentially</HI> a <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Self-de∣fence,</HI> tho they were under an <HI>Obligation,</HI> not to <HI>reduce</HI> it into <HI>Act,</HI> till the <HI>Bonds</HI> of that <HI>Civil Society</HI> were <HI>dissolved,</HI> and then it is true, they do not then <HI>Resist</HI> to maintain that <HI>Civil Government</HI> which is al∣ready gone, but to get out of a <HI>State of Nature,</HI> and set up a <HI>New one</HI> as soon as they can.</P>
<P>But as to your <HI>second Objection,</HI> which I confess hath more weight in it, than the former; I shall make this <HI>Answer,</HI> that you your self have given a <HI>sufficient Reason</HI> why a <HI>whole Nation</HI> or <HI>Church,</HI> that pro∣fesses the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> cannot be <HI>destroyed</HI> by all the <HI>Malice</HI> and <HI>Persecution</HI> that can fall upon it by <HI>Persecuting Monarchs,</HI> for you tell us, that it is the <HI>special Priviledge of</HI> the <HI>Christian Church</HI> above the rest of Mankind that they are <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>peculiar Care,</HI> and <HI>Charge</HI>; and that he doth not permit any <HI>suffering,</HI> or <HI>Persecutions</HI> to befal them, but what he himself <HI>orders</HI> and <HI>appoints:</HI> And that it is a great Happiness, to have our <HI>Condition</HI> immediately <HI>alloted</HI> by <HI>God.</HI> So that it seems it cannot be in the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Cruellest Tyrant</HI> utterly to destroy <HI>Christianity,</HI> in any Country where it is truly taught, by all the <HI>Persecution</HI> that he can use. This was the <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Christian Religion</HI> whilst it was in its <HI>Infancy,</HI> and in which, we may observe more <HI>particular Declarations</HI> of God's <HI>Providence</HI> by <HI>Miracles,</HI> and the <HI>Divine Inspirations</HI> of his <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> than after it was grown up, and that <HI>all the World</HI> became <HI>Christians.</HI> In its <HI>Infancy,</HI> 'tis plain that <HI>Princes</HI> could not <HI>destroy</HI> it, because it was supported by <HI>Miracles,</HI> and <HI>supernatural</HI> Means, but in the <HI>other State,</HI> when <HI>Christianity</HI> was once grown up, settled and able to shift for it self, by being made the <HI>Religion</HI> of the <HI>Empire,</HI> and the greatest part of Mankind embracing it in those and other Countries, <HI>Princes</HI> then could <HI>not destroy</HI> it, if they would, because their <HI>Subjects</HI> had then a <HI>Right</HI> to it, and a <HI>Property</HI> in it, as much as they had to <HI>any thing</HI> else they enjoyed, and consequently might be <HI>preserved</HI> by the same <HI>Hu∣man Means.</HI> Thus during the <HI>State</HI> of the <HI>Iewish</HI> Church in the <HI>Wil∣derness,</HI> and for some time in the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> we find the Chil∣dren of <HI>Israel</HI> fed, and delivered from their <HI>Enemies</HI> by <HI>Miracles.</HI> But after they had been long settled in it, and had Renounced the <HI>Immedi∣ate Government</HI> of God, they were then left to <HI>preserve</HI> themselves by the same <HI>natural means</HI> with other Nations.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="150"/>And tho' I grant that such <HI>Persecutions,</HI> when ever they fall out, are very <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>judicial</HI> to the Peace and <HI>Happiness</HI> of those <HI>Nations</HI> that la∣bour under them; Yet this is no <HI>sufficient Reason</HI> against <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient-suffer∣ing</HI> for Religion without <HI>Resistance.</HI> For since our <HI>Saviour</HI> is the <HI>Au∣thor</HI> of our <HI>Salvation,</HI> and hath ordained that it-shall be <HI>propagated</HI> not by <HI>Force</HI> or <HI>Resistance,</HI> but by <HI>Sufferings,</HI> and that he hath promised us an <HI>Eternal Weight of Glory,</HI> for our submitting our <HI>Wills</HI> and <HI>Natural Affections</HI> to his <HI>Divine Commands,</HI> it is not for us to <HI>dispute</HI> the Rea∣son of it, since that he who pleased to bestow upon us so great a Benefit without our Desert, might propose it to us upon what Con∣ditions he pleased, tho' never so hard to be performed. Yet is this to be so understood, as that this <HI>Suffering</HI> for the Testimony of <HI>Christ</HI> may serve for that <HI>great End</HI> for which he ordained it, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Propagation of his own <HI>true Religion,</HI> by our bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing <HI>Testimony</HI> to it, in our <HI>couragious</HI> and <HI>patient Suffering,</HI> which in a Kingdom or Nation, where <HI>Christianity,</HI> or <HI>any true Prosession</HI> of it, is become the <HI>general,</HI> and <HI>Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>onal Religion,</HI> cannot now be supposed to be <HI>necessa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</HI> And this may serve also for an <HI>Answer</HI> to your last Reply; For tho' I own, that the <HI>Municipal Laws</HI> of <HI>Common wealths</HI> cannot <HI>abrogate</HI> any of our <HI>Natural Rights</HI>; but only in order to some <HI>greater good</HI> or Be∣nefit tending thereunto, yet certainly, the <HI>Revealed Law of God</HI> may, and doth in some Case <HI>abridge</HI> us of divers of those <HI>Rights,</HI> which Men by the <HI>Law of Nature</HI> might have made use of.</P>
<P>But as for your <HI>Quotation</HI> out of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> tho I have good Rea∣son to question the very <HI>matter of Fact,</HI> since I can hardly believe, that how <HI>numerous</HI> soever the <HI>Christians</HI> might be, or whatever <HI>mis∣chief</HI> they might have done privately by setting the <HI>City on fire</HI> in the Night time, which he also mentions a little before, as one of the ways by which they might have <HI>revenged</HI> themselves; Yet do I not think, that they were then either for <HI>Strength</HI> or <HI>Number</HI> sufficient to have made any <HI>Considerable Resistance,</HI> if they would, against the <HI>Pretorian Bands,</HI> and other <HI>standing Legions</HI> which were then, if not all, yet for the greatest part <HI>Heathens</HI>: The most part of the <HI>Christians</HI> of those times, consisting of the <HI>meaner</HI> and <HI>mechanical Sort</HI> of People altoge∣ther <HI>undisciplined,</HI> and <HI>unarmed,</HI> and so perhaps these <HI>Christians</HI> were under <HI>no other Obligations, to Non resistance,</HI> then what the <HI>particular Providence</HI> of God, had brought them to, as these <HI>French Protestants,</HI> who remain still in <HI>France,</HI> are now under, that is, <HI>Obligations</HI> of <HI>Fear,</HI> and not of <HI>meer Conscience.</HI></P>
<P>And as for your Example of the <HI>Thebaean Legion,</HI> tho' it is true they might have sold their <HI>Lives dear</HI> before they had been killed, yet would this <HI>Resistance</HI> have served them to little purpose against the <HI>Rest</HI> of the <HI>Army,</HI> which might consist of 30, or 40000 men, all <HI>Heathen,</HI> and Head∣ed by the <HI>Emperour</HI> himself. But what if after all <HI>this stir</HI> about this Sto∣ry, it should <HI>not</HI> be <HI>true</HI>? for <HI>Eusebius</HI> and <HI>Socrates</HI> who lived nearer the time in which this Action is supposed to be done, make <HI>no mention</HI> at all of it; tho' they had very <HI>good occasion</HI> to do it. The <HI>first writer</HI> that
<PB N="276" REF="151"/>
ever made <HI>any mention</HI> of this Story was <HI>Eucherius</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Lyons,</HI> who did not write this <HI>Act</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Martyrs</HI> till above 150 years after the thing was done, and he is also followed by one <HI>Ado</HI> in his <HI>Martyrology,</HI> who lived likewise some time after him, when writing of <HI>Legends</HI> began to grow in <HI>Fashion.</HI> But granting all the matter of Fact to be as you relate it, it proves <HI>no more</HI> than what I have already granted, that, the <HI>Christians</HI> were at that time <HI>obliged</HI> to <HI>lay down their lives,</HI> for the <HI>Testi∣mony</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> rather than to make any <HI>Resistance</HI>; but that this <HI>Precept</HI> is of a <HI>Constant,</HI> and <HI>Eternal Obligation</HI> when the <HI>Ends</HI> for which it was <HI>ordained,</HI> are no longer of <HI>any use,</HI> and when our <HI>Religion</HI> is <HI>established</HI> by such <HI>Laws,</HI> as the <HI>King</HI> himself cannot <HI>abrogate</HI> or <HI>dispense</HI> with, I ut∣terly deny: And certainly, if you were not very much <HI>blinded</HI> with the <HI>Prejudice</HI> of these <HI>Notions</HI> of <HI>Passive-Obedience</HI> and <HI>Non Resistance,</HI> you would not leave <HI>all</HI> the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>England</HI> at the Mercy of a <HI>Popish King</HI> to be <HI>dragooned</HI> out of their <HI>Lives, Liberties</HI> and <HI>Estates</HI> as the <HI>Protestants</HI> have been in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> whenever the <HI>King</HI> shall please to put them to that <HI>severe Tryal.</HI></P>

<P>You have given me a very long, and I wish I could say a sa∣tisfactory Answer, and I see, provided it would serve your turn, you do not value how much you <HI>vilifie</HI> the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of the <HI>Primitive Chri∣stians</HI> by making them not of <HI>Ability</HI> to make any <HI>considerable Resistance</HI> if they would. Tho' <HI>Tertullian</HI> expresly affirms the contrary, and so you likewise take upon you to follow the <HI>Example</HI> of a <HI>late D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctor</HI>; and to Question the Truth of the Story of the <HI>Thebaean Legion,</HI> which tho' it might not be committed to writing before <HI>Eucherius</HI> published it, yet might be very well have received a <HI>faithful account</HI> of this matter either by <HI>Tradition,</HI> or by some <HI>Private Memorials</HI> that might be kept of it in <HI>that Church</HI>; since they suffered this <HI>Martyrdom,</HI> not far from <HI>Octodurum</HI> a place now called <HI>Martinach in Valla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> a part of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and not far from <HI>Lyons,</HI> so that he might very well have a <HI>sufficient Information</HI> of such a <HI>remarkable Action</HI> as this was.</P>
<P>Nor doth what you say, savour less of a <HI>Latitudinarian</HI> Principle, whilst you maintain, that a <HI>Patient Submission</HI> to the <HI>Supream Powers</HI> is not of <HI>constant,</HI> and <HI>Eternal Obligation</HI> in all Circumstances which is <HI>con∣trary</HI> to the <HI>opinion</HI> of the <HI>Primitive Fathers,</HI> and also of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> But if St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Doctrine be true, that we are <HI>not to do the least Evil that Good may come:</HI> And if our <HI>Saviour</HI> hath enjoined us, <HI>not</HI> to <HI>resist</HI> the <HI>Supream Pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs</HI> upon any account <HI>whatsoever,</HI> and also to <HI>lay down our Lives</HI> for the <HI>Testimony</HI> of the Truth, we ought certainly to <HI>observe</HI> his <HI>Commands,</HI> let the <HI>Consequence</HI> be what it will, tho' it were to the <HI>total Destruction</HI> of a <HI>whole Church,</HI> or <HI>Nation:</HI> Since <HI>God</HI> if he pleases may by the <HI>just Course</HI> of his Providence lay such <HI>severe Iudg∣ments</HI> upon us, who can also infinitely reward us for our <HI>Patient Suffe∣ring</HI> of them, in the Life to come.</P>

<P>I think I may without any Crime, Question the Truth of <HI>Ter∣tullian</HI>'s account of the <HI>Power</HI> the <HI>Christians</HI> had to make any <HI>considerable

Resistance</HI> in his time, for sure, he may be out in such a Nice matter of Fact: Since he could be guilty of such gross <HI>Errours</HI> in point of <HI>Do∣ctrine,</HI> for before he turned <HI>Mortanist,</HI> he was like our <HI>Quakers,</HI> and thought <HI>all Resistance</HI> of what kind soever <HI>unlawful</HI>; and therefore, he tells us in his <HI>Apologetick, Idem sumus Imperatoribus qui &amp; vicinis no, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and a little after, <HI>Quodeunque enim non licet in Imperatorem, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d nec in quenq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m,</HI> and he likewise condemned <HI>all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light</HI> in time of <HI>Persecution,</HI> as you may see in the Treatise he writ upon that Subject.</P>
<P>And as for the bare <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Primitive Christians,</HI> they are not of any general <HI>binding Example</HI> to us, unless the <HI>Principle</HI> they go upon be true, <HI>since</HI> I doubt not but many of them <HI>suffered Death</HI> out of a <HI>pure desire</HI> of <HI>Martyrdom</HI> of which <HI>Sulpitius Severus</HI> tells us, they were <HI>more Covetous,</HI> than Men were in his time of <HI>Bishopricks,</HI> in so much, that it was a common thing even for <HI>Women,</HI> and <HI>Boys</HI> to offer themselves to <HI>voluntary Martyrdom</HI> that the <HI>Council</HI> of—was forced to make a <HI>Decree</HI> on purpose to <HI>forbid</HI> it.</P>
<P>And as for the <HI>Truth</HI> of the Story of the <HI>Thebaean Legion,</HI> it not being recorded by any <HI>Writer</HI> of the <HI>Age</HI> in which it is said to have been done; I think a Man may very well question its <HI>reality</HI> without any <HI>Suspicion</HI> of <HI>Heresie:</HI> And when I can see those Arguments answered by you, or any Body else, which the Learned Doctor you mention hath brought against it, I will give more credit to it than now I do. But you may call me a Person of <HI>Latitudinarian</HI> Principles as much as you please in this matter, until you are able to prove to me by <HI>better Ar∣guments</HI> than you have done hitherto, that the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> in Case of <HI>Persecution</HI> for <HI>Religion,</HI> is of <HI>Constant,</HI> and <HI>Eternal Obligation,</HI> unless it be in the <HI>same Case</HI> in which the <HI>Primitive Christians,</HI> were ob∣liged to <HI>suffer,</HI> rather than <HI>resist</HI>; and till this be done, I fear not fal∣ling under St. <HI>Pau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s Censure of <HI>doing Evil, that good may come of it</HI>; and unless God had in <HI>down-right Terms</HI> commanded it, I will <HI>never Believe,</HI> but that I may have a very good <HI>Right</HI> in such a <HI>Government</HI> as ours to <HI>de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end</HI> my Life, against any one that would <HI>take it away</HI> upon the bare score of <HI>Religion</HI>; nor can I think it a Doctrine <HI>suitable</HI> to the <HI>Iustice,</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> of God to <HI>ordain</HI> a <HI>whole Nation</HI> to fall as a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to the <HI>Cruelty,</HI> or <HI>Superstition</HI> of any one, or more Men.</P>
<P>But since you are pleased to urge me with <HI>Examples</HI> of <HI>Primitive Chri∣stians,</HI> who chose to <HI>die,</HI> rather than <HI>Resist,</HI> or <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> against their <HI>Prince,</HI> pray give me leave likewise to tell you a <HI>few stories,</HI> wherein these <HI>Pri∣mitive Christians</HI> have not shew'd themselves, so <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aunch</HI> in this matter as you would make them.</P>

<P>Since you cannot deny the <HI>matter of Fact,</HI> you strive to <HI>extenu∣ate</HI> it▪ by their <HI>hatred</HI> to <HI>Constantius</HI> for his <HI>Apostacy</HI> from the <HI>Catholick Faith</HI>: and the <HI>severe,</HI> and <HI>rigid Treatment</HI> of <HI>Constantius:</HI> But if their ha∣tred to Him▪ because he was an <HI>Arian,</HI> could make them <HI>joyn</HI> with <HI>Iuli∣an</HI> to <HI>rebel</HI> against him, pray tell me why they might not have <HI>rebelled</HI> also against <HI>Iulian,</HI> after he had declared himself an <HI>Apostate</HI> from the <HI>Christian Faith</HI>? could they have had such another <HI>Leader</HI> as <HI>Iulian</HI> himself? But he reigned too <HI>small a time,</HI> and was too <HI>constantly</HI> himself at the <HI>Head</HI> of his <HI>Army,</HI> to give them any <HI>opportunity</HI> to serve <HI>him</HI> as he had served his <HI>Predecessor.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed this Army of <HI>Iulians</HI> was but <HI>too obedient</HI> to him, since we find that tho' they had been <HI>Christians</HI> before, yet at the time of <HI>Iulian</HI>'s Death, they were then in Profession <HI>Heathens,</HI> for you will find in all the <HI>Historians,</HI> that when after the Death of <HI>Iulian,</HI> they chose <HI>Iovian</HI> Emperour, he at first <HI>refused</HI> it, saying, that he, being a <HI>Christian,</HI> would not command <HI>Heathens,</HI> whereupon they <HI>conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed</HI> themselves to be <HI>all Christians,</HI> but certainly, this had been a very <HI>im∣pertinent Objection,</HI> had they been publickly known so at that time.</P>
<P>And tho' I grant, <HI>Iulian</HI> countenanced the doing of a great many <HI>vi∣olent things</HI> towards the <HI>Christians:</HI> Yet it is certain, that he never made any <HI>Sanguinary Laws</HI> against them, but rather <HI>forbid</HI> them to be <HI>put to Death,</HI> or to suffer any <HI>hardship</HI> on the account of their <HI>Religion</HI>▪ tho' I confess the <HI>Heathens,</HI> because they thought it would be <HI>acceptable</HI> to him, put many <HI>Christians</HI> to death by <HI>Force,</HI> and <HI>Violence:</HI> So that however he might be <HI>pleased</HI> with it, and <HI>connive</HI> at it, Yet did he never <HI>enact</HI> it by any <HI>publick Law,</HI> or <HI>Edict,</HI> or if he had, do I allow the <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> a Liberty to have <HI>taken Arms,</HI> and <HI>resisted</HI> him upon the account of <HI>Religion.</HI> For tho' I own the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> had been <HI>establish'd</HI> by <HI>Law,</HI> by <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, yet was it not so <HI>throughly settled</HI> as to forbid the <HI>free</HI> and <HI>open Profession</HI> of the <HI>Pagan Superstition</HI>; the <HI>Hea∣thens</HI> being admitted to all <HI>Offices,</HI> and <HI>Commands,</HI> as well as the <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI>

and might freely perform all the <HI>Rites</HI> of their <HI>Superstition, pub∣lick Sacrifices</HI> to their <HI>false Gods</HI> only excepted; so that if <HI>Constantine</HI> by his <HI>Edict</HI> could without any <HI>Rebellion,</HI> shut up the <HI>Heathen Temples,</HI> and give the <HI>Christians</HI> the <HI>publick Liberty</HI> of Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir <HI>Religion,</HI> why should not <HI>Iulian</HI> have the <HI>like Prerogati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is <HI>Power</HI> was a∣like <HI>Supr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am,</HI> and <HI>absolute,</HI> to recall those <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icts,</HI> and to make quite <HI>con∣trary ones,</HI> if he had so pleased?</P>

<P>I cannot deny, but the carriage of some <HI>Christians</HI> of those times, even of those who are called <HI>antient Writers,</HI> or <HI>Fathers,</HI> might be too <HI>undutiful,</HI> and may be attributed to the <HI>Morose, Monastick</HI> tem∣per of the <HI>Father</HI> you have quoted, tho' a great deal of this sort of

<HI>carriage</HI> may be attributed to that <HI>Christian Zeal,</HI> which the <HI>Iews</HI> called the <HI>Spirits of Fortitude,</HI> and the <HI>Greeks</HI> call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which we render <HI>Boldness</HI> of <HI>Confidence,</HI> and which did often transport them to say those things to <HI>persecuting Kings,</HI> or their <HI>Governours,</HI> which had been <HI>insuf∣ferable</HI> to any man else on another occasion, and this was not only in <HI>words</HI> but <HI>Actions</HI> too.

<P>I do not tell you I quote them for our <HI>Imitation,</HI> but only to let you see, that the <HI>Actions</HI> of those you call <HI>Primitive Christi∣ans,</HI> and <HI>Fathers,</HI> are not by your own Confession to be the <HI>only Pat∣tern</HI> for us to follow; so that indeed their <HI>Practices,</HI> can signifie no∣thing to us, unless the <HI>Principle</HI> they acted by, were suitable to the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>right Reason</HI>; unless you will have <HI>no Precedents</HI> to be good, but what shall suite with <HI>your Humour,</HI> and those <HI>Principles</HI> you have already imbibed, and if <HI>Babylus</HI> the Martyr, might without any sin, shut the <HI>Emperour</HI> out of the Church by <HI>Force,</HI> and that <HI>Valenti∣nian</HI> was commended for <HI>striking</HI> the <HI>Emperours Priest</HI> on the Face, I think here are by your own Confession <HI>two</HI> sufficient <HI>Primitive Ex∣amples</HI> of <HI>Resistance,</HI> both of the <HI>Emperour</HI>'s <HI>Person,</HI> as also of those <HI>commissioned</HI> by him, as certainly this <HI>Priest</HI> was, or else he could have had <HI>no Right</HI> to have exercised his <HI>Idolatrous Worship,</HI> after the <HI>Temples</HI> had been shut up under <HI>Constantine,</HI> and <HI>Constantius.</HI></P>
<P>But I now desire your Patience to let you see, that not long after these times, the <HI>Christians</HI> as well Souldiers as others, were not so <HI>through, paced</HI> in these Doctrines of <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Non-resistance,</HI> as you would make them, for it was by the <HI>Rebellion</HI> of the <HI>Christian</HI> Legions in <HI>Britain,</HI> that <HI>Maximus</HI> took the boldness to <HI>Rebel</HI> against the Emperour <HI>Gratian,</HI> and making himself <HI>Emperour,</HI> marched into <HI>Gaul</HI> against him, where the poor <HI>Prince</HI> being also <HI>deserted</HI> by his <HI>Chri∣stian Army,</HI> and forced to <HI>fly away,</HI> with a few followers, was not long after murdered by <HI>Andragathius,</HI> after which this <HI>Maximus</HI> had so good Success, that he possessed himself, not only of <HI>Britain,</HI> but <HI>Spain, Gaul,</HI> and part of <HI>Germany,</HI> and was also acknowledged for <HI>Emperour</HI> by all the Subjects in those <HI>Provinces</HI> as well <HI>Clergy, as Laity,</HI> tho' the

<P>And farther, to let you see that <HI>the common People</HI> of these <HI>Primi∣tive</HI> Times, tho' they were <HI>not able</HI> to make <HI>Emperours</HI> so well as the <HI>Army,</HI> yet they were not so <HI>streight-laced,</HI> as not to <HI>Resist</HI> the <HI>Empe∣rours</HI> Orders, whenever they thought they <HI>entrenched</HI> upon their <HI>Re∣ligion,</HI> or that they went about to <HI>persecute</HI> them for it; I can give you a <HI>great many Examples</HI> out of <HI>Ecclesiastical History,</HI> of which I will only here set down some few:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ch.</HI> 30.</NOTE> The first is out of <HI>Socrates, Eccl Hist.</HI> Book 2<HI>d.</HI> when the Emperour <HI>Con∣stantius</HI> at the Instigation of <HI>Macedonius</HI> the <HI>Arian</HI> Bishop, had perswaded him to send <HI>some Bands</HI> of Soldiers into <HI>Paphlagonis,</HI> to terrifie the <HI>Peo∣ple</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>punc; and make them turn <HI>Arrians.</HI> The Inhabitants of <HI>Mantinium,</HI> en∣flamed with a Zeal for the <HI>Orthodox Religion,</HI> marched against the <HI>Sol∣diers,</HI> with a good Courage, and having provided themselves with the <HI>best Arms</HI> they could, they gave them Battle, in which <HI>few,</HI> or <HI>none</HI> of the <HI>Emperour's Soldiers</HI> escaped. And tho' I confess, (the Historians say) these <HI>People</HI> were most of them <HI>Novatians</HI>; yet this Action ought not to be condemned only for that Cause, since they were rather lookt upon as <HI>Schismaticks,</HI> than <HI>Hereticks,</HI> and were in all things else, except that one point, <HI>about reconciling the lapsed,</HI> very <HI>Orthodox,</HI> but in all other things were <HI>more strict</HI> and <HI>scrupulous,</HI> than the <HI>Catholicks</HI> themselves.</P>

<P>Since you your self do allow <HI>All,</HI> or however most of these <HI>Actions</HI> to be <HI>unlawful,</HI> I think you might very well have spared the mentioning of them; since I grant, that about the End of the <HI>Fourth Century,</HI> when these things happen'd, not only the <HI>common People,</HI> but also the <HI>Clergy</HI> began to grow very <HI>corrupt</HI> in their Manners. And therefore, I cannot much value <HI>any Precedents,</HI> that you can bring in that time, to justifie <HI>Resistance</HI> in <HI>Christians,</HI> unless you could have shewn me any, <HI>before</HI> the time of <HI>Constantine,</HI> which I am sure you are not able to do, much less <HI>any Authority</HI> from any of the <HI>Primitive Fathers,</HI> which justifieth <HI>Resistance</HI> of the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> upon any ac∣count <HI>whatsoever.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a very hard matter to satisfie you by <HI>Quotations,</HI> for be∣fore the time of <HI>Constantine,</HI> it is evident, the <HI>Christians</HI> were not on∣ly <HI>weak, dispersed</HI> and <HI>disarmed,</HI> but had also the <HI>Laws</HI> of the <HI>Empire a∣gainst</HI> them. And I have already granted, That <HI>Self-defence</HI> against <HI>Per∣secution</HI> upon account of <HI>Religion</HI> was <HI>unlawful</HI>; but when, in the time of <HI>Constantine</HI>'s Son and Successor, the <HI>People</HI> having the <HI>Law on their side,</HI> stood upon their <HI>defence</HI> against those that would have <HI>taken away their Lives,</HI> as in the Examples I have brought of the Inhabitants of <HI>Paphlagonia,</HI> then the Instances come <HI>too late,</HI> and the Age is grown so <HI>corrupt,</HI> that they are no longer <HI>Primitive</HI> Christians, than they ob∣serve your Doctrines. But as for express Precepts, or Testimonies out of the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and <HI>Fathers,</HI> to justifie <HI>Resistance,</HI> I think it is very need∣less to bring any, for the great Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> shews us very well, that it is the intent of the Scripture to deliver us all the <HI>Credenda,</HI> and <HI>Agenda</HI> necessary to Salvation, but in <HI>other Matters,</HI> within the <HI>compass</HI> of our <HI>Reason,</HI> it is enough if we have <HI>evident Reason</HI> for them, <HI>Scripturâ non contradicente</HI>; and if the Scripture doth <HI>not forbid</HI> such <HI>Resistance,</HI> for <HI>Self-defence</HI> (as I hope I have now proved to be <HI>Lawful</HI>) I do not va∣lue whether there be any <HI>Express Authority,</HI> to be quoted out of the <HI>Fathers</HI> for it, or not. For whatever the <HI>Scripture</HI> leaves <HI>free,</HI> I think the <HI>Fathers</HI> have no Power to <HI>forbid.</HI></P>

<P>I see it is to no purpose, to argue longer with you from Primitive Examples, or Testimonies; And therefore, I come now to the last thing I proposed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">H. <HI>p.

<P>I pray Sir, give me leave to interrupt you, for I must tell you, I will not be concluded by any thing that the <HI>King,</HI> or <HI>Church</HI> in those times did publish concerning <HI>matters of Faith,</HI> or <HI>Practice,</HI> since unless it were in that one <HI>Political,</HI> rather than <HI>Religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Article,</HI> concerning the <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Supremacy,</HI> the Church in all other <HI>Speculative</HI> and <HI>Practical</HI> Doctrines, was as much <HI>infected</HI> with <HI>Pop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry</HI> as it was before.

<P>I shall comply with your desires, since you will have it so▪ And therefore, I shall begin with the 39 <HI>Articles</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. P.O. ch.</HI> 1.</NOTE> where in the 37 <HI>Article,</HI> (as they were past under Queen <HI>Elizabeth Anno</HI> 1562) you may find it runs thus.
<Q>The Queen's Majesty hath the Chief Power in this Realm of England, and other her Do∣minions, unto whom the Chief Government, of all the Estates of this Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical, or Civil in all Causes doth appertain, and is not, nor ought to be subject to any foreign Iurisdiction.</Q></P>
<P>It is true, this Doctrine is not limited to the <HI>particular Case</HI> of <HI>Sub∣jects taking up Arms,</HI> but it seems to me by two necessary Consequen∣ces, to be <HI>deduced</HI> from it; First, Because if the <HI>Pope,</HI> who pretended by a <HI>Divine Right,</HI> had <HI>no Power</HI> over <HI>Kings,</HI> much less have <HI>the People</HI> a∣ny such Power, who pretend to an <HI>Inferiour Right,</HI> that of <HI>Compact.</HI> Secondly, Because the <HI>Article</HI> makes <HI>no distinction,</HI> but excludes all <HI>other Power,</HI> as well as that of the <HI>Pope.</HI> And in truth, the Plea is the same on either side, the <HI>Pope</HI> says, as long as the <HI>Prince</HI> Governs according to the <HI>Laws of God,</HI> and the <HI>Church</HI> (of which <HI>He</HI> is the <HI>Interpreter,</HI>) so long the <HI>Censures</HI> of the Church do not <HI>reach him</HI>; and say the <HI>People,</HI> as long as the <HI>Prince</HI> governs according to the <HI>Laws of the Land,</HI> (and of the meaning of those Laws, <HI>they</HI> themselves will be the <HI>Interpreters</HI>) so long are they <HI>bound to be obedient</HI>; but as soon as the <HI>King</HI> doth any thing that may <HI>contradict</HI> the <HI>Pope,</HI> then he is (deservedly, say the <HI>Romanists</HI>) <HI>excommunicated, deposed,</HI> and <HI>murdered</HI>; and when he <HI>usur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> upon the <HI>Peoples Liberties,</HI> then he ought to be <HI>deposed</HI> by the <HI>People.</HI> The

<P>I must confess this is the <HI>first time,</HI> that ever I knew any Man go about to prove <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> out of the 39 <HI>Articles</HI>; and indeed I should have thought you might have deduced any thing else from these Articles, as well as that. But let us see, how, <HI>what</HI> I have sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this <HI>Discourse,</HI> can come within the <HI>Contents</HI> of this <HI>Article,</HI> which only says, that the <HI>King,</HI> or <HI>Queen</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> is <HI>Supream Governour</HI> over all Persons, as also in all Causes, whether <HI>Ec∣clesiastical</HI> or <HI>Civil,</HI> and is not <HI>subject</HI> to any <HI>foreign Iurisdiction</HI>; from whence you raise <HI>this Argument,</HI> that if the <HI>Pope,</HI> who claims by a <HI>Di∣vine Right,</HI> hath <HI>no Power</HI> over our <HI>Kings,</HI> much less have the <HI>People,</HI> who can pretend to no <HI>such Right,</HI> as he does, but only that by <HI>Compact.</HI> Now pray tell me, whether this be <HI>conclusive</HI>: I assert, that the <HI>People</HI> have by the <HI>Law of God</HI> and <HI>Nature,</HI> a <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> them∣selves, against the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> in case they are violently Assaulted in their <HI>Lives, Liberties</HI> or <HI>Estates.</HI> Now I would very fain have you prove to me, how <HI>Resistance</HI> for <HI>Self-defence,</HI> doth <HI>subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct</HI> a <HI>Prince</HI> to any <HI>Iurisdiction,</HI> either <HI>Foreign</HI> or <HI>Domestick,</HI> and whether the <HI>People</HI> can have <HI>no Right</HI> to <HI>Resist</HI> such Violence, unless they have also an <HI>Autho∣ritative Power</HI> over them▪</P>

<P>It is not worth while, to dispute this any longer with you to so little purpose;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. P. O. p.</HI> 3, 4.</NOTE> And therefore, I shall come to the <HI>Canons</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> and in particular, those of the year 1640, which I look upon as a full Explanation of the <HI>Belief</HI> of our <HI>Church</HI> in this Point, where you may see in the <HI>first Canon,</HI> these two plain <HI>Propositions,</HI> among others.
<Q>First, <HI>That the most Sacred</HI> Order of Kings, is of Divine Right, being the Ordi∣nance of God himself, founded in the Prime Laws of Nature, and clearly Established by express Texts, both of the Old and New Testaments.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Secondly, For Subjects to bear Arms against their Kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bo. Sparrow</HI>'s <HI>Collection of Canons,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>p.</HI> 347.</NOTE> offensive or defensive upon any Pretence what∣soever, is at least to resist the Powers, which are or∣dained of God: And tho' they do not invade, but on∣ly resist, St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells them plainly, <HI>they shall re∣ceive to themselves Damnation.</HI></Q>
From which you may plainly see, that this <HI>Convocation,</HI> which consisted of as <HI>great Men,</HI> as I think, had been for <HI>divers Ages,</HI> do clearly maintain <HI>Monarchy</HI> to be of <HI>Divine Right,</HI> and <HI>Resistance</HI> to be in <HI>no Case lawful.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should grant the <HI>Canons</HI> of this <HI>Convocation,</HI> to be a good Proof of the <HI>Iudgment</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> were it not for <HI>two very good Reasons,</HI> I have against them. The one I will tell you pre∣sently, and the other I will keep a while to my self; In the <HI>first place</HI> therefore, I suppose you cannot but very well know, that this <HI>Convo∣cation</HI> sate and passed these <HI>Canons,</HI> which likewise received the <HI>King</HI>'s
<PB N="283" REF="155"/>
<HI>Confirmation,</HI> after the <HI>Parliament</HI> (that was summoned, together with <HI>this Convocation</HI>) was <HI>dissolved:</HI> And, I suppose, you know that by the <HI>Law of England,</HI> the <HI>Convocation</HI> having from all times been look∣ed upon as an <HI>Appendix</HI> to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> was <HI>till then</HI> always <HI>dissol∣ved</HI> with it. For which Reason <HI>all Acts,</HI> and <HI>Proceed∣ings</HI> of this <HI>Convocation</HI> were <HI>condemned,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Rush. <HI>Collect.</HI> 2<HI>d. part</HI> 2. vol. <HI>f.</HI> 1365.</NOTE> and declared <HI>null</HI> and <HI>void,</HI> by the <HI>Long Parliament</HI>▪ that began to fit the <HI>lat∣ter End</HI> of the same Year. And which is more, was like∣wise <HI>condemned</HI> by the <HI>first Parliament</HI> after the <HI>Restaurati∣on</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the second. And therefore, I think, I have very little Reason to own <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Canons</HI> as <HI>Conclusive.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, I might reply to what you have now said, that that very <HI>Parliament,</HI> which first <HI>condemned</HI> these <HI>Canons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. P. O.</HI> ch. 2.</NOTE> afterwards ruined the <HI>Monarchy it self.</HI> In the next place that in old time the <HI>General,</HI> or <HI>Provincial Sy∣nods</HI> were <HI>not Dependant</HI> upon the <HI>Assembly</HI> of the <HI>States</HI> at the same time. And I likewise farther Answer, that <HI>these Canons</HI> were made, and <HI>confirmed</HI> in a <HI>full Convocation</HI> of both Provinces of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> and the making of <HI>Canons</HI> being a work <HI>proper∣ly Ecclesiastical,</HI> these <HI>Canons</HI> were made by the <HI>Representatives</HI> of the <HI>whole Clergy</HI> of this Kingdom. 2. The <HI>Canons</HI> were confirmed by the <HI>King</HI> (which was all that was of old required in such Cases) and tho' the <HI>Convocation</HI> sate after the <HI>Dissolution</HI> of the <HI>Parliament,</HI> yet this is not <HI>without President</HI> even in the Happy Days of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> not to look back unto <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, or the <HI>Primitive</HI> times. And as for your <HI>Objection</HI> that these <HI>Canons</HI> were <HI>reprobated</HI> since the Restitu∣tion of <HI>Charles</HI> the II. I say, that I quote them not as <HI>Law,</HI> but as the <HI>known Sense</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI> at that time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your <HI>first Answer</HI> in behalf of <HI>these Canons</HI> is altogether <HI>Invidi∣ous.</HI> For it was not this <HI>Parliament</HI> that ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned the <HI>Monarchy,</HI> but only the <HI>Rump</HI> or <HI>Fag end</HI> of it, after it had suffered divers <HI>Violences,</HI> and <HI>Exclusions</HI> of Members by <HI>the Army,</HI> and that the House of Lords (be∣ing by this <HI>Iunto</HI> voted <HI>useless,</HI> and <HI>dangerous</HI>) were shut out of doors; nor is your <HI>second Answer</HI> any more true, for antiently in the <HI>Saxons</HI> time, the <HI>Wittena Gemot,</HI> or <HI>Great Counsel,</HI> and the <HI>General Synod</HI> made one and the <HI>same Assembly</HI> consisting both of <HI>Clergy-men,</HI> and <HI>Lay men</HI> and then all matters of <HI>Ecclesiastical Discipline</HI> were <HI>enacted</HI> and <HI>confirm∣ed</HI> by the <HI>King,</HI> as also the <HI>Spiritual,</HI> as well as <HI>Temporal States</HI>: Nor can you shew me <HI>an Example</HI> of any <HI>General,</HI> or <HI>Provincial Synod</HI> which met <HI>independently,</HI> and <HI>without</HI> the <HI>States of the Realm,</HI> until after the Reign of <HI>Henry the first,</HI> when the <HI>Popes</HI> took upon them to <HI>encroach</HI> up∣on the <HI>Royal Authority,</HI> as also upon our <HI>Civil Rights,</HI> and by his <HI>Le∣ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> to call <HI>Synods,</HI> and make <HI>Ecclesiastical Constitutions,</HI> in which nei∣ther the <HI>King,</HI> nor the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> had any thing to do. And
<PB N="286" REF="156"/>
tho', I grant, that upon the <HI>Reformation</HI> the King was <HI>restor'd</HI> to <HI>those Rights</HI> as <HI>Supream Governour</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> which the <HI>Pope</HI> had before <HI>usurped,</HI> yet is not this Act of the <HI>Supremacy</HI> to be so understood▪ as to give the <HI>King all that Power,</HI> which the <HI>Pope unjustly</HI> took upon him to <HI>execute</HI> before, for that had been to make their Case no better than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was before; and therefore, this Act of the <HI>Supremacy</HI> being only an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Restoration</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> to his <HI>Pristine Rights</HI> (of which that of <HI>Cal∣ling Synods</HI> and <HI>Convocations</HI> was one of the <HI>Principal</HI>) the King could not <HI>call</HI> nor <HI>continue</HI> those <HI>Assemblies</HI> in any <HI>other form,</HI> or after any <HI>other manner,</HI> than they were held before the <HI>Popes Usurpation,</HI> in taking upon him to call such <HI>Independant Synods,</HI> and notwithstanding what you tell me, I am confident you cannot shew me <HI>any Precedent</HI> of a <HI>Convo∣cation</HI> so turned into a <HI>Synod</HI> as this was in all the <HI>Reigns</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>But as for your last reply, that you quote not these <HI>Canons,</HI> for a <HI>Law</HI> that <HI>obliges</HI> the <HI>Church,</HI> but as the <HI>Sense</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI> at that time; if they do not now <HI>oblige</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> neither in Point of <HI>Belief,</HI> nor <HI>Practice</HI> as you may seem to grant, it signifieth no more to me, what was the <HI>Sense</HI> of the <HI>greatest part</HI> of the Members of that <HI>Convoca∣tion</HI> in this matter, nor doth it any more shew me what is the <HI>true Doctrine</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> than if I should tell you, that be∣cause in the <HI>Reign</HI> of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the <HI>Major part</HI> of the <HI>Bishops,</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI> of our Church were <HI>rigid Calvinists</HI> in the <HI>Interpretation</HI> of that Article about <HI>Predestination,</HI> that therefore <HI>Calvinism</HI> was then the <HI>Do∣ctrine</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> but is not so now. And therefore we ought not to take that for a <HI>Doctrine</HI> of any <HI>National Church,</HI> unless the <HI>Synod,</HI> or <HI>Assembly</HI> that declares such <HI>Doctrine</HI> be solemnly, and <HI>Lawful∣ly assembled</HI> according to the <HI>Laws,</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> of that <HI>Nation,</HI> or <HI>Coun∣try</HI> wherein they are so declared.</P>

<P>Since you so much contest the <HI>Authority</HI> of these <HI>Canons,</HI> I shall no longer insist upon them, but I shall here shew you out of the Books of <HI>Homilies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H.

Christ</HI> taught us plainly that even the <HI>wicked Rulers</HI> have their <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> from <HI>God</HI>; and therefore, it is <HI>not Lawful</HI> for their <HI>Sub∣jects</HI> to <HI>withstand</HI> them, altho' they <HI>abuse</HI> their Power. Let us be∣lieve undoubtedly (good Christian People) that we may <HI>not obey Kings,</HI> if they command us any thing <HI>contrary to Gods Commandments,</HI> in such a Case we ought to say as the Apostle: <HI>We must rather obey God than Man</HI>; but nevertheless in that Case we must not <HI>in any wise,</HI> withstand violently, or <HI>Reb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> against <HI>Rulers,</HI> or make <HI>any Insurrecti∣on,</HI> Sedition, or Tumults either by <HI>force of Arms,</HI> or otherwise against the <HI>Anointed of the Lord,</HI> or any of his <HI>appointed Officers,</HI> but we must in such a Case <HI>patiently</HI> suffer <HI>all Wrongs and Injuries,</HI> referring the Judgment of our Cause only to God.</Q>
And see part the third of the same <HI>Homily.</HI>
<Q>Ye have heard before of this Sermon of good order, and Obedience manifestly proved both by <HI>Scriptures</HI> and <HI>Examples,</HI> That all <HI>Subjects</HI> are bound to <HI>obey</HI> their <HI>Magistrates,</HI> and <HI>for no cause</HI> to <HI>resist,</HI> or withstand, or <HI>rebel,</HI> or make any <HI>Sedition</HI> against them, yea altho' they be <HI>wicked men.</HI></Q></P>

And this Doctrine is more strictly inforced in the second part of that <HI>Homily,</HI> from the Example of King <HI>David</HI> in his Carriage towards <HI>Saul,</HI> from which it will appear, that they did not suppose <HI>David</HI> to have used so much as <HI>defensive Arms</HI> against him, as you may see by this Passage in it:
<Q>That when for his most painful, true and faithful Service King <HI>Saul</HI> yet rewarded him not only with <HI>great unkindness,</HI> but also sought his <HI>Destruction,</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> by all means possible, <HI>David</HI> was fain to save his Life not <HI>by Rebellion,</HI> or any <HI>Resistance,</HI> but by <HI>flight,</HI> and hiding <HI>himself from the Kings sight.</HI></Q>
From all which <HI>Passages</HI> out of the <HI>Homilies,</HI> I think, we may draw these plain <HI>Conclusions.</HI> 1. That as well <HI>Evil,</HI> as <HI>Good Governours</HI> are to be <HI>obeyed</HI> as <HI>God's Ordinance.</HI> 2. That therefore they are <HI>not</HI> to be <HI>resisted</HI> for <HI>any cause,</HI> tho' they <HI>abuse</HI> their Power <HI>never so Tyrannically.</HI> 3. That the <HI>People</HI> are <HI>not to judge</HI> when the <HI>Prince</HI> thus <HI>abuses</HI> this Power, so as thereby to make <HI>any disturbance.</HI> 4. That not only <HI>Offensive,</HI> but also <HI>Defensive Arms,</HI> if made use of against him, are <HI>utterly unlawful,</HI> and also against God's express Command.</P>

<P>I grant these <HI>Homilies</HI> seem to be very strictly penned against <HI>all Resistance,</HI> and ought to be (like all discourses of this Nature) <HI>Positive,</HI> and <HI>General,</HI> and perhaps if I were to preach a <HI>Sermon</HI> to the <HI>Common People</HI> on this Subject, it should be much to the <HI>same Purpose,</HI> and yet for all that I might not believe, that it was <HI>absolute∣ly unlawful</HI> for a <HI>whole Nation</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> themselves in Case of such <HI>extream Violence,</HI> or <HI>Oppression</HI> as I have already supposed, for when <HI>Preachers</HI> speak to <HI>Vulgar Auditors,</HI> they are not bound like <HI>Casuists</HI> to tell them all the <HI>reserved Cases</HI> in which they may be <HI>dispensed with</HI> in their Duty, lest they might use <HI>this Christian Liberty for a Clos't of Maliciousn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss</HI> (as the Apostle tells us.) Thus if a <HI>good Preach∣er</HI> makes a Sermon against <HI>Stealing,</HI> or <HI>Murder,</HI> he may very justly tell the <HI>People,</HI> (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Authors of these Homilies do) that they ought not <HI>in any wise,</HI> or for <HI>any Cause</HI> to commit <HI>Theft,</HI> or <HI>Murder</HI>; without telling them all those Cases of <HI>meer Necessity,</HI> in which it may be <HI>Lawful</HI> to make use of the <HI>Goods</HI> of <HI>another,</HI> and also to

commit <HI>Homicide</HI>; as when a Man is <HI>forced</HI> to take <HI>Victuals</HI> tho' with∣out the <HI>owners consent</HI> for meer <HI>Preservation</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> or to kill a <HI>Thief,</HI> or any <HI>other</HI> Man that <HI>assaults</HI> him, to save his own Life. So tho' the <HI>Authors</HI> of these Books of <HI>Homilies</HI> do say, that we may not <HI>in any wise,</HI> and <HI>for no Cause</HI> withstand Violently, or <HI>Resist</HI> the <HI>Su∣pream Pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs,</HI> but that we must <HI>suffer patiently</HI> all Wrongs, and Inju∣ries, referring the <HI>Iudgment</HI> only to <HI>God</HI>; yet since they have not <HI>particularly</HI> put the Case as I have now done, <HI>viz.</HI> what is to be done in Case a <HI>whole Nation,</HI> or <HI>People</HI> are about to be <HI>destroyed,</HI> ruined or <HI>enslaved,</HI> and made <HI>Heathens,</HI> or <HI>Papists,</HI> by the <HI>unjust,</HI> nay <HI>illegal Vio∣lence</HI> of the <HI>Supream Pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs</HI>; we may rationally suppose, that since they were good Men, and never intended to urge these things fur∣ther, than what the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and <HI>Fathers</HI> have already done, that they never really intended that a <HI>whole People,</HI> or <HI>Nation</HI> together with the <HI>Religion established</HI> should be thus <HI>ruined,</HI> and <HI>destroyed,</HI> rather than that <HI>such Resistance</HI> should be made.</P>

<P>I confess, this is the <HI>strictest Passage</HI> of any in the whole Book, yet doth not this <HI>expressly reach the Case</HI> here put; or if it had, do I think my Self, or any Body else, <HI>obliged</HI> because of one, or two <HI>unwary Passages</HI> in this Homily, which perhaps neither the <HI>Parliament</HI> nor <HI>Convocation</HI> closely considered the <HI>evil Consequence</HI> of, or so much as <HI>knew they</HI> were there; things of this kind usually passing such <HI>great Assemblies</HI> by the <HI>Lump,</HI> as relying upon the <HI>Testimony</HI> of some <HI>Lead∣ing Bishops</HI> or <HI>Clergy men,</HI> without considering the Book of Homilies <HI>strictly,</HI> Or reading over the <HI>whole:</HI> So that the <HI>Parliament</HI> might ve∣ry well declare, that they contained <HI>sound Doctrine,</HI> and <HI>nothing contra∣ry to the Word of God,</HI> without asserting the <HI>literal Truth</HI> of every <HI>par∣ticular passage</HI> in them, much less that <HI>all,</HI> that is <HI>contained there∣in</HI> is to <HI>believed upon pain of Damnation</HI>; and therefore, I must beg your pardon, if I cannot suppose that <HI>all Resistance</HI> whatsoever, tho' in the most <HI>necessary</HI> Cases of <HI>Self-defence</HI> which I have now pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, is <HI>absolutely unlawful,</HI> and <HI>rebellious</HI>; or that the <HI>Fathers</HI> of our Church

ever intended to lay so <HI>hard a Yoak</HI> upon the Neck of this Nation, <HI>which neither they, nor their Fathers were ever able to bear,</HI> much less that there is thereby <HI>taken away</HI> from this <HI>Nation, defending</HI> those <HI>funda∣mental Rights,</HI> and <HI>Priviledges,</HI> which are <HI>essential</HI> to the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Government,</HI> and which as it distinguisheth it from a <HI>Despotick Mo∣narchy,</HI> So it doth the <HI>Subjects</HI> likewise from those of <HI>other Nations</HI>; for if the <HI>Scriptures</HI> themselves were <HI>never</HI> intended to <HI>alter Civil Consti∣tutions,</HI> much less certainly can either our <HI>Canons,</HI> or <HI>Homilies</HI> do it. And therefore, to deal freely with you, if the <HI>Canons,</HI> and <HI>Homilies</HI> had been <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver so express</HI> on your side; yet as long as no such <HI>Conse∣quence</HI> can be drawn from the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> I should not much va∣lue what they say, unless you can prove the <HI>Church of England</HI> to be <HI>infallible.</HI> And for this, I have the sixeenth and twentieth <HI>Article</HI> of the <HI>Church of England</HI> (made in the Year 1562.) to bear me out. The former of which concerning the <HI>sufficiency</HI> of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> for Salvation runs thus, <HI>The Holy Scripture contains all things necessary to Salvation. So that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any Man, that it should be believed as an Article of Faith, or be thought necessary or requisite to Salvation.</HI> Therefore if I have plainly proved by <HI>sufficient Autho∣rity,</HI> that your Doctrines of <HI>Passive-Obe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ience▪</HI> and <HI>Non Resistance</HI> are not expresly found in <HI>Scripture,</HI> nor by necessary Consequence may be <HI>rationally deduced</HI> from thence, they cannot be required of any Man to be <HI>believed,</HI> or practiced as necessary to Salvation. And therefore, if either this <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>any other,</HI> imposes such a <HI>Burden</HI> upon me, I am not <HI>obliged</HI> to bear it: And this, the latter of these Articles of the <HI>Authority of the Church</HI> expresly asserts in these Words: <HI>It is not Lawful for the Church to ordain any thing contrary to Gods Word Written,</HI> &amp;c. (after which it follows thus.) <HI>So besides the same, it ought not to enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of Salvation.</HI> Where Note that <HI>besides the same,</HI> is to be understood any thing, that is not found therein, or may be proved thereby, by necessary Consequence as was said before; and if the <HI>whole Church</HI> it self cannot do this, certainly no <HI>Particu∣lar Church</HI> can.</P>

<P>Methinks Sir, it is a <HI>great Presumption</HI> in you, and those of your Party to make your selves the <HI>sole Interpreters</HI> of those Places of <HI>Scripture,</HI> which so expresly <HI>forbid</HI> all <HI>Resistance</HI> of the <HI>Supream Pow∣ers,</HI> and then, when you have <HI>wrested</HI> the <HI>Scriptures</HI> to your own Mind, to cry out, that you are not <HI>bound</HI> to <HI>believe</HI> these <HI>Christian Doctrines,</HI> because you suppose they are <HI>contrary</HI> to Men's <HI>humane Rea∣son,</HI>

and the too great Love they have to their own concerns, which is but the same way of reasoning, which the <HI>Socinians,</HI> and <HI>Arians,</HI> make use of against our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s <HI>God head</HI>; because their <HI>narrow Understand∣ings</HI> cannot comprehend it▪ But besides all this, I could shew you out of the <HI>best Writers</HI> of the <HI>Reformed Religion,</HI> both in this, and other <HI>Protestant Churches,</HI> who interpret these Places of <HI>Scripture,</HI> against <HI>all Resistance</HI> in the same Sense, as our <HI>honest Homilies</HI> have done, but I find it grows late, and I have not time now to shew you them, or if I had, do I believe you would be much <HI>Edified</HI> by them; since you make so <HI>slight</HI> of the <HI>Authority</HI> of our <HI>Homilies.</HI></P>

<P>You are very much in the Right of it, and indeed, I do not desire you should put your self to that trouble, for the <HI>Papists</HI> them∣selves, will not own any thing for a <HI>Doctrine</HI> of their <HI>Church,</HI> which is not <HI>expresly</HI> found in the <HI>Council of Trent,</HI> or the <HI>Catechism,</HI> compo∣sed according to its Decrees, and therefore, will not be <HI>concluded</HI> by the <HI>Sermons,</HI> or <HI>Theological Treatises,</HI> of any of the <HI>Divines</HI> of their <HI>own Church,</HI> as to any thing, or matter in <HI>debate</HI> between us. And I think, I that am a <HI>Protestant,</HI> may certainly claim alike <HI>Christian Liberty,</HI> especially, since I am very <HI>sensible</HI> upon what account, <HI>too many Men</HI> have carried these <HI>Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Non-Resistance,</HI> to so great a heighth, as they have done of late years: But since you tell me, that so many <HI>Learned Writers</HI> both of this, and other <HI>Protestant Churches,</HI> have been of your Mind. So I could also (if I had a mind to <HI>Cap Quotations</HI> with you) produce a sufficient number of places out of <HI>Lu∣ther, Calvin, Zuinglius,</HI> and other <HI>first Reformers,</HI> as also of our <HI>own Writers</HI> at home, who have in many places of their Works allowed <HI>Resistance</HI> for <HI>self-defence,</HI> in case of <HI>Intolerable Violence,</HI> and <HI>Oppression</HI> to be <HI>Lawful,</HI> and of these I can give you a <HI>Large Catalogue,</HI> whenever you please to command me.

<P>I value not much, what <HI>Luther, Calvin,</HI> or any other <HI>violent Men of that sort,</HI> may out of <HI>Passion,</HI> or <HI>Inadvertency,</HI> have written on this matter, and yet I can shew you a Passage out of <HI>Calvin</HI>'s <HI>Insti∣tutions,</HI>, which expresly <HI>forbids Subjects,</HI> or private Persons to <HI>take up Arms</HI> against the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> as you may see by his own words, in the fourth Book, cap. 20. <HI>Ne{que} enim si ultio Domini est essraenata Domi∣nationis correctio ideo protinus de mandatam nobis arbi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>remur.

<PB N="292" REF="159"/>
ever your Thoughts may be of it, yet that they thought it <HI>absolute∣ly Unlawful,</HI> for the <HI>Subjects</HI> of this Realm to <HI>take up Arms</HI> against the <HI>King,</HI> or those who acted by his <HI>Authority,</HI> upon <HI>any Account whatsoe∣ver</HI>; and therefore, I must needs confess to you, that I look upon these <HI>Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Non-resistance,</HI> as the <HI>distin∣guishing Characters</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> from all <HI>other Churches.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' I do not much value the <HI>Opinion</HI> of <HI>Divines</HI> in matter of <HI>Po∣liticks,</HI> since most of them that I have met with have been very <HI>unhappy,</HI> when they have undertaken to <HI>meddle with that Trade</HI>; Yet I doubt not, but I can shew you, that some <HI>Learned Men</HI> of our <HI>Church</HI> have not thought <HI>all Resistance</HI> to be <HI>unlawful,</HI> in case the main, and <HI>Fun∣damental Constitutions</HI> of our <HI>Government,</HI> shall happen to be <HI>assaulted,</HI> or <HI>our selves</HI> in respect of our <HI>Liberties,</HI> and <HI>Estates,</HI> like to be redu∣ced to <HI>absolute Vassalage,</HI> and <HI>Slavery.</HI> And therefore, if your Divines will own <HI>Resistance,</HI> where by the <HI>Constitution</HI> of the Government it is <HI>allowed,</HI> to be <HI>Lawful,</HI> I think I can also prove, that it is not only <HI>lawful,</HI> but <HI>necessary,</HI> in some Cases in <HI>our own,</HI> for the <HI>Preservation</HI> of the <HI>Original Constitution</HI>; and if this should prove so, I know not what your <HI>distinguishing Character</HI> of the <HI>Church of England</HI> will signifie, unless you will make it necessary for <HI>particular Churches</HI> to have other <HI>distinguishing Characters,</HI> than the <HI>Scripture</HI> requires, or the <HI>Constitution</HI> of the <HI>Government</HI> will allow of; and if so, I doubt the <HI>Church of Eng∣la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> would get as <HI>little Credit</HI> by such <HI>distinguishing Characters,</HI> as the <HI>Calvinist</HI> Churches abroad do by making <HI>absolute Predestination</HI> one of the <HI>Terms</HI> of their <HI>Communions,</HI> the <HI>Scriptures</HI> (without their <HI>rigid Inter∣pretation</HI>) teaching no such Doctrine. But as for your <HI>Quotation</HI> out of <HI>Calvin,</HI> it amounts to no more than what I have all along granted, <HI>That single private Subjects, ought never to take up Arms, or resist those in Power,</HI> but when the <HI>good</HI> of the <HI>whole Common-wealth</HI> requires it. And therefore, he in the same Book, places a <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Resistance</HI> in <HI>Subordinate popular Magistrates,</HI> whereby you may see he grants the <HI>thing lawful,</HI> but will not leave the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>judging</HI> only in the <HI>common People,</HI> or <HI>Mobile,</HI> and so far I confess he is in the Right, tho I grant those <HI>Magistrates</HI> are in respect of the <HI>Monarch,</HI> as much subject as the <HI>People.</HI></P>

<P>I should be glad to know what <HI>Divines</HI> of <HI>our Church</HI> they are, who have granted <HI>Resistance</HI> of the <HI>Subjects</HI> of this Kingdom, to be <HI>in any Case Lawful,</HI> for if there are any such, I confess they are <HI>Authors unknown</HI> to me, nor do I know any, but one, who was seem∣ingly in the <HI>Communion</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> who hath asserted this Doctrine in his Book of <HI>Iulian</HI> the <HI>Apostate</HI>; But you see he was pre∣sently <HI>confuted,</HI> by those <HI>learned Men</HI> of our <HI>own Church,</HI> who under∣took him, and I think have so well performed it, that I cannot tell
<PB N="293" REF="159"/>
whether it hath been more for their Eternal Glory, or his Dis∣grace</P>
<P>But as for what you say, against making <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> the <HI>dis∣tinguishing Character</HI> of our Church, I confess, indeed, it is very bad for a <HI>Church</HI> to hold <HI>evil</HI> or <HI>indifferent distinguishing Doctrines,</HI> but it is as certain, that it is very convenient for a <HI>Church</HI> to have <HI>distin∣guishing Doctrines,</HI> provided they be <HI>good ones,</HI> unless a <HI>Church</HI> can be <HI>obliged</HI> to <HI>Err</HI> for Company; and to avoid <HI>distinction,</HI> which will not very well agree with the Text, that <HI>forbids us to follow a Multitude to do Evil,</HI> nor with the Practice of the <HI>Primitive Christians,</HI> when the <HI>Orthodox</HI> were so few in comparison, that had there not been some <HI>Names of Note</HI> among them, they would hardly have been reckoned <HI>a Number.</HI> But it agrees admirably well with the <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>Po∣pery,</HI> thus to <HI>avoid Distinction,</HI> which hath its <HI>Numbers</HI> to boast of, when nothing else is to be said.</P>
<P>But there is <HI>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism,</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> reproves the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> because one cryed, he was of <HI>Paul,</HI> and another of <HI>A∣pollos,</HI> a third of <HI>Cephas,</HI> and the fourth of <HI>Christ</HI>; And must not then those that held <HI>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism,</HI> necessarily <HI>distinguish</HI> themselves, from all that held <HI>more than one</HI>? And if some would say, they were of <HI>Paul,</HI> and some of <HI>Apollos,</HI> and some of <HI>Cephas,</HI> might not <HI>others distinguish</HI> themselves from them, by saying they were of <HI>Christ</HI>?</P>
<P>But by this Doctrine, you pretend we <HI>distinguish</HI> our selves from all <HI>other Churches</HI> in the World, and so from the <HI>Catholick Church</HI>; and therefore, you cannot comprehend, why any one should value a Doctrine, so much on that score; but you may comprehend, if you please, that it was <HI>never pretended</HI> that <HI>this Doctrine</HI> is taught <HI>no where,</HI> but in our Church. And as I hope I have proved, that it was taught in the <HI>Primitive Church,</HI> and is taught in other <HI>Protestant Churches</HI> at this day; But this is evident, by fatal Experience, that <HI>Passive Obe∣dience,</HI> is the <HI>distinguishing Character</HI> of the <HI>Church of</HI> England, <HI>by Law Established</HI>; whereby it is <HI>distinguished</HI> from the <HI>Separate Congregations</HI> among us, both of <HI>Fanaticks,</HI> and <HI>Papists,</HI> and to justifie this <HI>Distinction,</HI> we have the <HI>express Testimony</HI> of <HI>several</HI> of our <HI>Princes,</HI> since the <HI>Re∣formation,</HI> and of the <HI>Laws</HI> themselves too, that are <HI>still in force,</HI> which abundantly shew how <HI>dangerous</HI> the <HI>Principles</HI> of other <HI>Perswasions</HI> are to the <HI>State,</HI> as well as to the <HI>Church</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Yet if <HI>other Churches</HI> have not so well <HI>preserved</HI> this <HI>Doctrine</HI> in its Purity, as ours hath done, as we would not provoke them to a comparison, so we have no Reason to be ashamed of it. But that many among them have taught <HI>this Doctrine,</HI> might be proved from the <HI>Writings</HI> of many of the most
<PB N="294" REF="160"/>
<HI>Learned,</HI> and Pious <HI>Foreign Divines,</HI> and particularly from a Book of a <HI>French Protestant</HI> lately written,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Traité du Pou∣voir absolu des Souverains,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Cologne,</HI> 1685.</NOTE> who in the midst of <HI>Persecution,</HI> writes in <HI>defence</HI> of <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> when he at the same time suffered, what we have feared.</P>

<P>Tho' I confess at a time, when it was made <HI>criminal</HI> for any Man <HI>publickly</HI> to <HI>maintain,</HI> that it was <HI>lawful</HI> to <HI>Resist,</HI> in case the King should go about to <HI>introduce Popery,</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Government,</HI> among us by <HI>Force,</HI> and that whosoever went about to assert the <HI>Lawfulness</HI> of such <HI>Resistance,</HI> was sure to meet (if not with <HI>Punishment</HI>) at least with <HI>loss of Preferment,</HI> and <HI>Disgrace</HI>; when the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> ran so <HI>High,</HI> both in the <HI>Press</HI> and <HI>Pulpits,</HI> it was no won∣der if <HI>any</HI> of <HI>our Church,</HI> who consulted their <HI>own Safety,</HI> durst stem so <HI>violent a Current</HI>; and yet even in these times, the Learned Dr. <HI>Falco∣ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> in his Treatise of <HI>Christian Loyalty, Chap.</HI> 5. <HI>Sect.</HI> 2. doth, tho' <HI>cau∣tiously,</HI> allow <HI>Resistance</HI> in such <HI>great Cases,</HI> as of a <HI>Prince's Alienating his Kingdom,</HI> or of <HI>destroying his People</HI> in an hostile manner, to be <HI>Law∣ful,</HI> if ever it should happen; But out of a needless fear, lest this <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Resistance</HI> may be made use of as a Pretence <HI>for Rebellion,</HI> will not allow it can scarce seem <HI>possible ever to happen</HI> in a King. <HI>Com∣po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> towards, his <HI>whole Dominions.</HI> But I think I have already proved the <HI>possibility</HI> of it, and why they may not do the same in an <HI>absolute Empi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> where the <HI>Prince</HI> would make them <HI>Slaves</HI> and <HI>Beg∣gars,</HI> by <HI>invading</HI> their <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Properties,</HI> I can see no Reason, but think, I have given very good ones for it.</P>
<P>But as for the <HI>other Person</HI> you mention, who did <HI>openly</HI> in Print <HI>op∣pose</HI> this <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Resistance,</HI> whether <HI>He,</HI> or his <HI>Opponent,</HI> had the bet∣ter in this Dispute. I leave to the <HI>indifferent Readers,</HI> who I believe will acknowledge, that the <HI>Author</HI> of that <HI>Treatise,</HI> did not so much forfeit his <HI>Reputation,</HI> by asserting a <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Defence,</HI> where the <HI>Re∣ligion,</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> are <HI>Established by Law,</HI> and became a part of the <HI>Civill Constitution,</HI> as his Opponent did, by introducing an <HI>Arbitrary Imperial Power</HI> in this Nation, <HI>unknown to our Laws,</HI> whereby a few <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Red Coats,</HI> either of <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or a <HI>Foreign Nation,</HI> should have by the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Commission,</HI> an <HI>irresistible Power</HI> over the <HI>Lives, Liberties</HI> and <HI>E∣states</HI> of all <HI>Protestants.</HI> But since he went about to make us all <HI>Slaves</HI> by his <HI>Imperial Law,</HI> I do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all envy him so generous a Perfor∣mance: And yet for all that, <HI>I had much rather have that man's Reputa∣tion, whom he appyled tho with all his Suffering, than the Gentlemans, tho' attended with all his Learning and Preferments.</HI></P>
<P>But as for what you say in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <HI>Doctrine of Passive Obe∣dience,</HI> and <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> in all Cases whatsoever; it signifies little, since it is grounded upon a <HI>wrong Supposition,</HI> for you still take that for <HI>gran∣ted,</HI>
<PB N="295" REF="160"/>
which is the <HI>Question</HI> yet to be proved, that because the <HI>Primitive Christians</HI> were against <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sistance,</HI> in case of <HI>Persecution,</HI> therefore, this must needs <HI>extend to whole Nations,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Common we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lths</HI> in all States, and Conditions whatsoever: which, whether you have well proved, or not, I leave it to your <HI>own Conscience</HI> to <HI>judge</HI>; for my own part, I can∣not say you have convinced me, with what you have said on this Sub∣ject: So that if <HI>these Doctrines,</HI> as you have put them, are neither <HI>good</HI> in <HI>themselves,</HI> nor <HI>necessary</HI> to be <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lieved,</HI> nor <HI>practised</HI> in all Cases, I doubt <HI>God</HI> may justly ask those, who either practise or impose them on others, <HI>Who hath required these things at your hands</HI>? And as for those Divines of <HI>Foreign Churches,</HI> who you say, have writ for <HI>these Doctrines,</HI> as well as ours, as I know not <HI>who</HI> they are, nor in <HI>what manner</HI> they have <HI>defended them,</HI> so do I not much <HI>value their Opinion</HI>; since there are <HI>many more</HI> altogether as Learned, and Pious, as they, who have held the <HI>Contrary</HI>; Nor are <HI>all Divines</HI> who maintain <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> and <HI>Non-resistance</HI> of your side, who write (which I also allow) that for particular <HI>Private Subjects,</HI> to <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sist Prin∣ces</HI> in <HI>Revenge</HI> of <HI>private Injuries,</HI> and <HI>Rebel</HI> against the <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> for not being of their own Religion, or to take upon them to call <HI>Princes</HI> to an <HI>Account,</HI> or pass <HI>Iudgment</HI> upon them, or <HI>punish</HI> them for their Actions, is altogether <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>unlawful:</HI> Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doth it not therefore follow, that they have maintained <HI>all Resistance</HI> to be <HI>unlawful,</HI> in <HI>any Case whatsoever</HI>; tho' perhaps, if you were to make use of their Authority, you would produce them of your own side.</P>
<P>To conclude, I own my self for <HI>Non-resistance,</HI> in that <HI>limited Sense</HI> I have now given, as far as it extends to <HI>particular, private Men:</HI> Yet that this Rule doth <HI>not extend</HI> to the <HI>whole Civil Society,</HI> or People, And therefore, altho' in my own <HI>private Capacity,</HI> I ought to <HI>submit,</HI> to, and <HI>suffer</HI> the <HI>greatest Injustice,</HI> rather than <HI>Resist,</HI> and <HI>disturb Govern∣ment,</HI> yet when the <HI>Main Foundations</HI> thereof are once begun to be <HI>pulled up:</HI> As I am an <HI>English Man,</HI> I think I am <HI>more obliged,</HI> by all Ties, both <HI>Sacred</HI> and <HI>Civil</HI> to <HI>defend,</HI> and maintain the <HI>Government,</HI> or <HI>Con∣stitution,</HI> of which I am a <HI>Member,</HI> than I am to <HI>obey</HI> the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>per∣sonal Commands</HI>; and that being the <HI>Primary</HI> Obligation ought to be dis∣charged in the first place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall no longer compare, whether the <HI>Divines</HI> that write <HI>for,</HI> or those that write <HI>against Resistance,</HI> are the wiser, or more Learn∣ed; since you your self, it seems, at last are feign to own a <HI>limited Non-resistance,</HI> which you will have extend to <HI>private Persons,</HI> but not to the <HI>whole Civil Society,</HI> or People; But I think I may venture still to maintain, that the <HI>Supream Power,</HI> where ever it is placed, must be <HI>Irresistible,</HI> and that a <HI>whole Civil Society,</HI> or <HI>People,</HI> who are not in∣vested with part of the <HI>Soveraignty,</HI> can have <HI>no more Right</HI> to <HI>Resist,</HI> than <HI>single Persons</HI>: For to say, that <HI>whole Societies</HI> have a Power to
<PB N="296" REF="161"/>
<HI>Resist,</HI> and that <HI>particular private Persons,</HI> as Members thereof, have it also, is such a <HI>Diminution</HI> of <HI>Supream Power,</HI> as can never be <HI>consistent</HI> with it, for all <HI>Inferiours,</HI> whether <HI>Private Persons,</HI> or <HI>whole Societies</HI> can have <HI>no Power,</HI> but what is derived from the <HI>Supream,</HI> and there∣fore, if they have a <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>Resist,</HI> even that must be deri∣ved from the <HI>Supream Power,</HI> and so <HI>that Power,</HI> must <HI>destroy it self.</HI></P>
<P>But as for what you alledge in your <HI>Iustification,</HI> that <HI>Resistance</HI> may be <HI>Lawful,</HI> to avoid <HI>Subversion</HI> of the <HI>Government:</HI> To this I may reply, that if <HI>Subjects</HI> be no longer in <HI>Subjection,</HI> to the <HI>Supream Pow∣ers,</HI> the <HI>Government</HI> is hereby <HI>destroyed</HI> for what more <HI>manifest Subver∣sion</HI> can there be, than this, That <HI>Subjects are now no longer in Subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction, nor Governours can be no longer able to Govern</HI>? So that this Argument tends only to prove, that <HI>Subjects</HI> may <HI>Subvert</HI> the <HI>Government one way,</HI> rather than suffer the <HI>Soveraign Power</HI> to do it <HI>another.</HI> So that upon the whole matter, if the <HI>Government</HI> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st be <HI>Subverted,</HI> you would have <HI>no body,</HI> have the <HI>doing</HI> of it but <HI>your selves.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>However false your <HI>Premises</HI> are, and however weak the Proofs that you have brought for them, yet I see you are resolved to stick close to your <HI>Conclusion,</HI> (i. e.) <HI>That all Supream Powers are absolutely Irresistible.</HI> In which Dispute, whether you or I, have been in the <HI>wrong,</HI> I dare appeal to any <HI>indifferent Iudge</HI>; for I think I have suf∣ficiently made out, that <HI>Resistance,</HI> by the <HI>whole People,</HI> or <HI>Major part</HI> of it, against a general, and <HI>Intolerable Tyranny,</HI> is no <HI>Diminution</HI> of <HI>Supream Civil Power,</HI> nor <HI>inconsistent</HI> with it; nor is your Reason for your Opinion, any truer than the rest, that <HI>Private Persons,</HI> whether taken <HI>single,</HI> or in a <HI>whole Civil Society,</HI> can have <HI>no Power,</HI> but what is derived from the <HI>Supream,</HI> which is by no means so, for every <HI>pri∣vate Man</HI> of the <HI>Society,</HI> then acts by a <HI>Power precedent</HI> to it, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Natural Power</HI> of <HI>Self-Preservation,</HI> or <HI>Defence</HI>; which no man ever <HI>ab∣solutely</HI> gave up neither for himself, nor his <HI>Children,</HI> when he became a <HI>Member</HI> of that <HI>Common-wealth:</HI> Tho' he was obliged for the <HI>Peace</HI> of the <HI>Government,</HI> or <HI>Civil Society,</HI> to suspend that Right in order to a <HI>great∣er Good,</HI> which once failing, upon the <HI>Dissolution</HI> of the <HI>Government,</HI> every Man's <HI>Original Right</HI> takes place.</P>
<P>As for what you say against my Notion, that <HI>Resistance is Lawful, when it may prevent the Subversion of the Government,</HI> your Reply to this is really <HI>Equivocal,</HI> and consists in that false, or <HI>wrong Notion,</HI> you have of the <HI>Nature</HI> of our <HI>English Government,</HI> which you suppose only con∣sists in the <HI>Preservation</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Personal Pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> without any re∣spect to the <HI>Laws,</HI> or <HI>Fundamental Constitutions</HI> of the Kingdom, and that as long as the <HI>People</HI> are in <HI>Subjection,</HI> whether to <HI>Legal Govern∣ment,</HI> or <HI>illegal Force</HI>; it is all one, the <HI>Government</HI> is still <HI>preserved,</HI>
<PB N="297" REF="161"/>
which is a <HI>great mistake,</HI> for the <HI>King</HI> receiving his <HI>Power</HI> from the <HI>Law,</HI> and having <HI>no Authority</HI> but what <HI>that gives him,</HI> when he <HI>overthrows the Fundamental Constitutions of the Kingdom, he doth himself destroy the Government.</HI> And therefore, when in that Case the <HI>People</HI> do <HI>resist,</HI> it is ei∣ther to <HI>maintain</HI> it, or else to <HI>restore</HI> it to the state that it was in before; so that it is not the <HI>People,</HI> in this Case, who have <HI>subverted</HI> it, but the <HI>King.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It now grows late, and it is high time to give over, but if you please to give me another Meeting, I doubt not but to show you, that by the <HI>Original Constitution</HI> of this Government, the <HI>King</HI> not only hath the <HI>sole Supream Power,</HI> but that by <HI>several Acts</HI> of Parliament <HI>all Resistance</HI> of the <HI>King, or those Commissioned by him,</HI> is <HI>absolutely</HI> a∣gainst the <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>fundamental Constitutions</HI> of this King∣dom; and that they are <HI>all</HI> by our Laws <HI>Rebels</HI> that dare presume to make such <HI>unlawful Resistance</HI>: And I desire, that you would give me a <HI>patient bearing</HI> in this matter, because I have so great a Kindness for you, that I would not have you lye under so <HI>dangerous an Errour,</HI> which may happen to prove <HI>fatal</HI> to your <HI>Happiness,</HI> not only in the <HI>World to come,</HI> but also to the <HI>Safety</HI> of your <HI>Self,</HI> and <HI>Family</HI> in this Life, if you should offer to put in practice, what you have here maintained.</P>

<P>Sir, I give you many thanks for your <HI>kind Intenti∣ons</HI> towards me, since I do believe it proceeds from that <HI>real Friendship</HI> you have for me, tho' as for the former of those Judgments you mention, I hope I shall have no Rea∣son to be <HI>afraid</HI> of it; for any thing I can yet see from <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Arguments</HI> you have hitherto urged: But as for what may happen to me in this Life, I hope I have as little Reason to fear it, since I believe this <HI>great Revolution</HI> will not only <HI>Iustifie,</HI> but for the future <HI>defend</HI> those <HI>Arms</HI>

<P>I confess, Sir, that you have now too much the advantage of me during these times of <HI>Anarchy,</HI> and <HI>Con∣fusion</HI>; but yet I hope one day to see this <HI>unhappy Nation again recovered from this sad Apostacy</HI>; into which I con∣fess too many have lapsed, and then I doubt not, but these <HI>Primitive,</HI> and <HI>Loyal Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> will be again <HI>restored</HI> to their former In∣tegrity, and Vigour.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir, all I can say to you is, that I see you are not only <HI>in Love with Slavery,</HI> but also with <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se that would bring it in upon us</HI>; yet however I think: I may give you this <HI>good Advice,</HI> that if you are <HI>not pleased</HI> with what hath been <HI>already done,</HI> since you have had no hand in the doing of it, you would be contented quietly to <HI>sit still,</HI> and <HI>enjoy</HI> those <HI>Benefits,</HI> that may thereby accrue to the <HI>whole Church,</HI> and <HI>Nation</HI>; since I thereby expect a <HI>firmer Settlement</HI> of the <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> as also of our <HI>Civil Liberties,</HI> than we <HI>ever yet enjoyed.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for your Advice, and you know as my humour is not to be Troublesome, or Clamorous against that which is not in my Power to help, so on the other side, I heartily wish that <HI>the Prince may now agree with his Majesty upon such Terms, as may prove for the good of the Church, and security of the State.</HI> But pray tell me, when I may be so happy as to see you here again, that we may fully resolve this last Question?</P>

<HEAD>THE Bookseller's Advertisement to the READERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author has order'd me to beg your Par∣dons on his behalf, that he hath made bold in this Discourse to deviate from the method he at first proposed for the subject of the ensuing Dia∣logue, since instead of treating of the <HI>Original</HI> of <HI>Civil Authority,</HI> and in what sense it is <HI>derived</HI> from <HI>God,</HI> and in what from the <HI>People</HI> (as he promised in his <HI>Epistle</HI> to the first Discourse) he hath now made the <HI>Su∣preme Legislative Power,</HI> and the <HI>Fundamental Con∣stitution</HI> of our Government, together with the <HI>Anti∣quity</HI> of <HI>Great Councils</HI> or <HI>Parliaments</HI> in this Nation (whether they always consisted of Bishops, Barons, or Temporal Lords and Commons or not) the Subject of this as well as of the ensuing Dialogue; so that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se grand Questions taking up two entire Discourses, had the Author persued the Method he at first proposed, he could not have brought his <HI>whole design</HI> within the compass of <HI>Eight Dialogues,</HI> as he at first intended, and still hopes to do; and therefore to ease you of the trouble of buying, or rea∣ding
<PB REF="165"/>
more Discourses on these Subjects, then what he takes to be absolutely necessary, he hath reduced all that he had prepared for the Fifth Discourse upon the Subject above mentioned, into the two last Dialogues, wherein he de∣signs to treat of the <HI>Justice,</HI> and <HI>Lawfulness</HI> of the late <HI>Revolution,</HI> and the Settlement of the Crown upon their present M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jesties, where the then Questions he intended to treat of will properly enough fall in.</P>
<P>But it is time to speak somewhat concerning this present Discourse, since it treat of a <HI>Question</HI> to be decided only from the <HI>History</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI> of this Nation. And the Author bids me assure you, that he hath lay'd down no∣thing therein on either side, but what he hath produced good Authorities for; either from the Histories and Go∣vernments of our own or other Neighbouring Nations, or from the Colle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ions of our <HI>English Saxon</HI> Laws, and an∣cient as well as modern Writers upon the Laws of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and lastly from our <HI>Statutes</HI> or <HI>Acts of Parlia∣ment</HI> since the <HI>reputed Conquest,</HI> which he found ne∣cessary to these Subjects, without omitting any Authority that he judged material to be urged on either side.</P>
<P>But as for the <HI>Quotations</HI> themselves, I hope they are truly cited, for the Author assures me upon the word of a Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tleman, that he is not conscious of any unfair dealing in that kind, either by any wilful omission, or concealment; and as for the Books, Chapters or Pages here quoted, if there be any error or mistake of that kind, I pray impute it to the Press, and not to the Author as well in this, as all the rest of these Discourse; since he could not be in Town to correct them himself, but he intends God willing) to rectifie all such mistak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s by a Table of <HI>Errata</HI> at the end of the whole work, to which he intends also to add an <HI>Exact Index</HI> of all the <HI>Principal Matters</HI> that are deba∣ted in it; but though I take the Author for an honest
<PB REF="165"/>
Gentleman, and one who scorns the mean advantage of a false Quotation, yet since many Writers (like <HI>Monte∣banks</HI>) are apt to cry up their own sincerity even when they deceive you most; the best advice I can give you is, that if you have the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st distrust of any thing here quoted, you consult the Authors or Books themselves, from whence he hath transcribed them, and then you will be best able to judge how far you may trust him another time.</P>
<P>As for those <HI>Parliamentary Records</HI> here cited, they are either such as have been already Printed from the Rolls in the <HI>Tower,</HI> or other Offices at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and so are allowed for <HI>Authentic,</HI> or else are s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch as have not yet been made publick, as for which as well as the former, if you have the least distrust of any of them, I leave you to search the Records themselves, which are I hope now commu∣nicated without any reserve to all that are willing to take the pains to consult them; I have no more to add; but to assure you (not from my own, but better Iudgments) that you will find more in this <HI>small Treatise</HI> than ever was yet publisht at once (or perhaps at all) upon these <HI>impor∣tant Subjects.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note.</HI> If the Author hath made one of his Opponents call the Entrance of King <HI>William 1.</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> and his taking the Crown upon the same condition as his <HI>English</HI> Predecessors, a <HI>Conquest</HI>; it may be under∣stood in the <HI>largest Acceptation</HI> of that word, and for Brevity sake only.</P>

<P>YOU are welcom Sir, I pray set down by the Fire; I was thinking before you came in, of the <HI>best method</HI> of managing this <HI>Impor∣tant Question,</HI> whether by the <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Constitutions</HI> of this Kingdom, it can in any Case whatever be <HI>Lawful</HI> to <HI>Resist</HI> the <HI>King,</HI> or those that Act <HI>by Ver∣tue of his Commissions.</HI> I shall therefore proceed in the next place, to the Proof of the <HI>Second Proposition,</HI> in the Argument I at first proposed, or to speak <HI>Logically,</HI> the <HI>Minor</HI> in the <HI>Syllogism, viz.</HI> That the King of <HI>England</HI> is the <HI>Sole</HI> Supream, or <HI>Soveraign Power</HI> in this Kingdom; and therefore is <HI>irresistible,</HI> and that not only as to his <HI>own Person,</HI> but also with respect to <HI>all</HI> such who act by his <HI>Orders</HI> or <HI>Commissions,</HI> though the things commanded be in themselves <HI>Illegal.</HI></P>

<P>I will not deny any of those Authorities, you have now made use of: Since, <HI>Titles alone are no proofs of Power</HI>; for it is very well known, that the <HI>Germane Emperor,</HI> yet, notwithstanding that great Title, is not therefore <HI>Vn∣accountable, or Irresistible</HI>; Since the Colledge of the Princes Electors may <HI>Depose</HI> him for <HI>Male-administration,</HI> or for <HI>Violating</HI> any of the <HI>Fundamen∣tal Constitutions</HI> of the Empire. And Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> hath very well observed in his Titles of Honour, that this Supremacy or Freedom from all Subjection is not only challenged by our <HI>English</HI> Soveraigns; but also by the Kings of <HI>Denmark, Sweden</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI>: The former of which, yet was so far from be∣ing an absolute Monarch, that before the Reign of this King's Father, he might have bin <HI>Deposed</HI> for <HI>Tyranny,</HI> for Misgovernment by the <HI>Estates of the Kingdom,</HI> as the King of <HI>Poland</HI> may at this Day: And therefore these Ti∣tles may indeed, prove a Freedom from all Foreign Jurisdiction; but doth not prove that the King is Endued with an Absolute Soveraign Power with∣in the Kingdom, as you may see in these Examples I have now given you.</P>

<P>If you are not Satisfied with these Proofs; I doubt not but to give you other Authorities, both out of Antient and Modern Lawyers, as also Acts of Parliament, which sufficiently declare, where the Supream or Soveraign Power Resides.

<P>I do not desire at this time, to enter upon this Question, concern∣ing that Power; which I know <HI>some Parliaments</HI> have pretended too, of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bing</HI> and <HI>Resisting</HI> the King by force, if they supposed <HI>He Invaded the Fun∣damental Rights</HI> and L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies (as they call them) of the Nation; and that fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two Reasons: First, because it is not pertinent to our present purpose, of proving that the King is not the Sole Supream Power, as also▪ because you very well know, that both Houses did in 13 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. by an Act of Parliament concerning the <HI>Militia,</HI> Solemnly Renounce all Coercive Power over the King, or any Right in either, or both of the Two Houses, of making Of∣fensive or Defensive War against him. But if you have a mind hereafter to
<PB N="310" REF="172"/>
course further on this Subject I doubt not, but to prove to you from divers other Passages out of <HI>Bracton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. D. L. p.</HI> 41.</NOTE> and that old Treatise called <HI>Fleta,</HI> that it was no <HI>Political Superiority</HI> in the <HI>Curia Ba∣ronum</HI>; but only a <HI>Directive Power</HI> or moral Superiority, which they had of Ad∣vertizing the King of any Arbitrary Proceeding, or Injustice he should hap∣pen to do; and by Complaint, Admonition and Entreating to impose upon him to amend the same, <HI>according to his Oath,</HI> but not by Coaction, or Con∣straint; And in this Sense they may be said (in a Moral way) to put the <HI>Bridle of the Law</HI> upon him, which may be called <HI>Civil Resistance</HI>; but as for <HI>Military Resistance</HI> against an Unjust King, it is as <HI>Inconsistent</HI> with our <HI>English</HI> Govern∣ment, as with any other Monarchy in the World.</P>
<P>But you very much mistake, if you suppose that the King of <HI>England</HI> is not Supream;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H.D.L. p.</HI> 29.</NOTE> because he is <HI>Limited by Laws,</HI> which realy is no Objection; Because a <HI>Soveraign</HI> without any Di∣minution to his Soveraignty, may be <HI>limited</HI> in the Exercise of his Soveraign Power, either by his <HI>own Acts,</HI> or <HI>Condescensions,</HI> or else by those of his <HI>Pre∣decessors,</HI> under whom he claims. This is so certain, that there is no Su∣pream Power in Heaven, or in Earth, which is not limited and confined in the exercise thereof. Thus the Omnipotent Power of God himself, is limited by his own Wisdom, Goodness and Justice, which are himself: So likewise the <HI>Powers</HI> of all Absolute <HI>unlimited Monarchs</HI> are only so <HI>comparatively</HI> with respect to <HI>positive Laws</HI>; but as for the <HI>Laws of God and Nature,</HI> which bind their Consciences as firmly, as any <HI>Civil Laws,</HI> they are bound to observe them, and exercise their Soveraign Power within those Limits, which they set and prescribe. For whether they have their <HI>Supream Power</HI> from <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> as we say, or from the <HI>People,</HI> as you alledge it; it is all one as to this matter, for they can have <HI>no Right</HI> neither from God, nor the People to make <HI>Vnjust</HI> and <HI>Tyrannical Laws.</HI> And this Political Limitation of their Power in the exercise of it, doth no more destroy the Essence thereof, than its flowing in Pipes or Channels, destroys the Essence of a Spring, since it is still the same, whether it runs confined through Pipes, or flows free and unconfined through the open field. The Application is obvious.</P>
<P>But as for the precedent words in this place of <HI>Bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton,</HI> which seems to in∣timate, that the King ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Authority to the Law. He there only means the <HI>King,</HI> in Opposition or Contradiction to a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> who makes his Will, his Law; according to that of Chancellor <HI>For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>escue, Rex est ubi bene regit, Ty∣rannus, dum populum sibi oredi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um violentâ opprimi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dominatione, quod hoc sanxit Lex humana quod Leges ligant Suum Latorem.</HI> Where you may observe, that this Author makes a King's governing well, <HI>i. e.</HI> according to Law, a mark of Distinction from a Tyrant, who oppresses his Subjects by a violent Domineer∣ing over them. And though he here supposes the King to be <HI>obliged</HI> by the <HI>Laws,</HI> yet that this <HI>Obligation</HI> is only <HI>Moral,</HI> appears by what immediately fol∣lows, when he says, <HI>the Laws do oblige their Legislator.</HI> Now if the King be the <HI>Sole Legislator</HI> (as He here seems to intimate) He must also be the <HI>Sole Su∣pream Power,</HI> and if so, cannot be accountable to, or under, the <HI>Coercion</HI> of any <HI>Superior Power</HI>; for then he would not be <HI>Supream,</HI> as you your self have granted long since.</P>

<P>Since you are not willing to enter upon that <HI>Ancient Power</HI> which you cannot deny; but the <HI>Great Council</HI> formerly had, of putting a <HI>Bridle</HI> upon the <HI>King,</HI> and Restraining his Actions, in Case he <HI>Invaded</HI> the Rights or Liber∣ties of the <HI>People</HI>: I shall not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sist farther upon it now, for the Reasons you have given; only I must make bold to tell you thus much, that if they have not a Power of defending their just Rights, if forceably Invaded by the King, it would be all one; as if they had none at all: Tho' I grant, that what you have said concerning the <HI>Limitation</HI> of the Exercise of <HI>Soveraign Power,</HI> that it doth not <HI>Derogate</HI> from the <HI>Absoluteness</HI> of the Power it self, is very true in all such Limitations; which proceed from the <HI>Intrinsick Nature</HI> and <HI>Perfection</HI> of the Being, in which it <HI>Resides,</HI> as in your Example of God's <HI>infinite Power,</HI> being <HI>Limited</HI> by his <HI>other Attributes.</HI> So likewise all Human Powers (I own) are limited by the Revealed Laws of God, or those of Na∣ture: But as to positive Laws, you your self assert, that absolute Monarchs are only obliged by them, as long as they please; and consequently, that they may alter them, or Derogate from them, as oft as they think good, as the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors could revoke any Priviledges or Immunities they had formerly granted to particular Persons, Cities, nay to Tributary Kings, or Common-Wealths; and all this very justly, because as all such Grants were made only for the publick good of the Empire: So they being the sole Judges thereof, when ever they found such Confessions to prove prejudicial to it, they might justly alter or revoke them. Now if the <HI>Power of our Kings be</HI> as <HI>absolutely Soveraign,</HI> as that of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors: and <HI>only limited</HI> by their own <HI>free Grants</HI> or <HI>Condescensions</HI> to the People, and not from any Pow∣er <HI>ab extra</HI>; Such Grants or Condescensions, though never so Solemnly past into Laws in the Parliament, or Assembly of the States, are still no more than positive Laws: And then if the King is the <HI>Sole Soveraign Power</HI> (unli∣mited by any thing, <HI>ab extra</HI>) how can He so tye up his own Hands, as that he may not Break or Rescind all those Concessions he had made, and those limitations which he had put upon himself, if he think, or declare it is for the better benefit of the Common-Wealth so to do. I cannot Comprehend, if He be by the Original Constitution, the sole Lawmaker and Judge of what is for the publick Good? Much less can I understand, how he can oblige his Successors (who must still be supposed as Absolute Monarchs as himself) to observe them. And therefore if all our <HI>Civil Rights</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> were no other than what you would have them (the <HI>free Condescensions,</HI> or <HI>Self-Limitations</HI> of Soveraign Power) I desire you would shew me what security we can have for the Enjoyments of them, longer than the King pleases: For it seems plain to me, that when ever He shall fancy the Liberties and Properties of the Subjects (both which you suppose were derived from him) to be injurious to, or inconsistent with, his Prerogative, or Soveraign Pow∣er, he may lawfully Disannul, or revoke them; and in what Case we then should be (considering how things had like to have gone lately) I leave any indifferent Man to Judge.</P>
<P>Nor Is your Interpretation of <HI>Bracton</HI>'s words, <HI>Lex facit Regem,</HI> &amp;c. Any more than an absolute Wresting of them, from their true meaning, which is not (as you would have it) to Distinguish a King that governs by Law,
<PB N="312" REF="173"/>
from a Tyrant that makes his Will his Law; for every absolute Monarch that doth so, is not a Tyrant, provided he direct his Actions according to the Laws of God and Nature; as you your self assert, and a Prince may as well govern thus, as the Great <HI>Turk, Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and all the <HI>Eastern</HI> Monarchs do at this Day, who are not counted <HI>Tyrants</HI> in so doing; But cer∣tainly you will say, that He would make a very Scurvy <HI>English</HI> King, who would observe no other Rule. Nor do you less wrest <HI>Fortescue's</HI> words, when you render them, <HI>Rex est, ubi bene regit, Tyrannus,</HI> &amp;c. Supposing the meaning of it to be, that this Author makes a King's governing (that is, say you) according to Law, the only thing to Distinguish him from a Tyrant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whereas he says no such matter: but only <HI>Rex est, ubi bene regit,</HI> which he may do without any Set Laws, as well as with them, as the first Kings you suppose did before they were limited by Laws.</P>
<P>But as for <HI>Fortescue's</HI> supposing the King to be the <HI>Sole Legislator,</HI> that word <HI>Sole,</HI> is of your own Addition; for if he had said so, he would have con∣tradicted himself, as I shall shew you presently; It is true, the King hath a great share in the <HI>Legislative,</HI> yet hath he two other Bodies to joyn with him by a Concurrent or Cooperative Power in it: And I think I have all the Ancient Lawyers of <HI>England</HI> on my side. To begin therefore with <HI>Ranulph de G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anville,</HI> who was Chief Justicear in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, He gives us in his Prologue to his Treatise of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> this Te∣stimony. <HI>Leges namque Anglicanas lice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on Scriptas.

When he speaks of the Anti∣ent manner of making Laws in <HI>England,</HI> he says; <HI>Quae quidem fuerint appro∣bate concensu utentium, &amp; Sacramento R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gum confirma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ae non possunt mutari, at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> destrui fine communi consensu utentium, &amp; consilio eorum. quorum consilio, &amp; Consensu fuerint promulgata.</HI> Where you may see these Ancient Authors plainly declare, that nothing hath the force of a Law in this Kingdom, but what is approved of, and consented to, by all Orders of Men, either by them∣selves, or their Representatives: And which is very Remarkable, <HI>Bracton</HI> supposes the King's Authority, or Royal Sanction of a Law, may precede the Consent of the Great Council; which quite destroys that Notion, That it is the Kings giving his last Assent, which gives it the Essence and Vigour of a Law.</P>
<P>And with these more Antient Sages of the Law, <HI>Fortescue</HI> also agrees in his 9th Chap. <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Laudibus Legum Angliae,</HI> where he says; <HI>Rex Angliae Po∣pulum guberna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> non mera potes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to Regid sed politica, Populus &amp; enim ijs Legib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> guber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tur quas ipse fert,</HI> &amp;c. What follows, is word for word the same with what <HI>Bracton</HI> had before in his first Chap and therefore needs not to be Repeated, so likewise in the 18 Chap. speaking of the <HI>Absolute Legisla∣tive Power</HI> of Kings in some other Kingdoms, he thus proceeds: <HI>Sed non Sic

<P>I shall not much concern my self with what your Common Lawy∣ers, either Ancient or Modern have writ upon this matter; much less what Sir <HI>Edward Coke,</HI> a known Enemy to the Kings Prerogative, doth maintain: Since I have as good, or a better Authority than he,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 3. <HI>a. b.</HI></NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Year-Book of 22 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3.

And though at this Day, I grant that <HI>Custom</HI> hath made the Assent of the Lords and Commons necessary to the <HI>passing of all Laws,</HI> yet it is still the King's word, or <HI>le Roy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le veul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that makes them so; and I much doubt, whether even <HI>this</HI> were <HI>part</HI> of the <HI>Ancient Constitution</HI> of this Kingdom, or not, or proceeded at first from the Gracious Favour and Permission of former Kings, as I could shew by the whole Series of Councils, in the <HI>Saxon</HI> times, if it were not too tedious to mention them particularly, there∣fore I shall only Select some of the most Remarkable.</P>

Then in the first Chapter the King speaks in the first person plural, <HI>We Bid or Command, that all our People shall after hold fast, or observe these Laws and Dooms.</HI> From this Preface, you may observe: I. That Kings are the Gift of God, and that <HI>Gods Gift</HI> signified the same with <HI>Dei Gratia,</HI> they are not the Creature of the People, 2. That Princes or the better Government of their People, in the Setling of Laws in Church and State, did then Consult, Deliberate, and Advise with their Bishops, Noblemen, and eminently Wise Men of their King∣doms; whom for their Wisdom, they Honour'd with publick Imploy∣ments in their Dominions. 3.

that those that he liked not, with the Council of his Wits, he had Re∣jected; and those he liked, he had or commanded to be holden. And we may observe, that the King here speaks in the <HI>Single Person,</HI> that He himself <HI>Collected</HI> or <HI>Chose,</HI> aad also <HI>Rejected</HI> what Laws he pleased. The next material illustration where: the <HI>Legislative Power</HI> then Resided may be found in the Laws of King <HI>Edward the Elder,</HI> where after the Charge given to the Judges; the first Law begins, <HI>I will, and so in others</HI>; in the fourth, it is thus expressed: <HI>Edward the King, with his Wits, that were at</HI> Exeter, <HI>strictly enqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing by what means it might be better provided for Peace and Tranquility, &amp;c.</HI> In the 2d. and 3d.

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive the Authority of our Ancient Lawyers, is a little too hard for you to answer with your usual Distinctions; and therefore you seemingly deny their Authority, though in effect, you grant it as I shall shew you by and by: But as for your Quotation out of the <HI>Year-Book,</HI> which you think sufficient to Counterballance all the Authorities I have brought; I think I may much better question the Judgment of those that gave that Opinion, since I can shew you, that you your self can∣not allow it in all points for Law; For in the first place, it is not there said, that it was so judged by all the Lords and Judges who were ap∣pointed to hear the Cause there mentioned; but only <HI>Fuit dit, que le Roy,</HI> &amp;c. By which it seems to have bin the private opinion only of some one, or more of the Lords and Judges there present; For it is not said, <HI>fuit adjuge.</HI> And if you will have it to have bin the Opinion of them all, pray read what follows after. <HI>Fuit dit quen temps le Roy</HI> Henry, <HI>&amp; devant, le Roy fuit implede comme Seroit auire homme de People. Mes</HI> Ed. <HI>Roy son fils ordeign que home sueroit vers Roy per Peticion, Mos unques Roys ne seront adjugez Si non per eu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> melmes &amp; lour Iustices.</HI> So that if the former part of it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Law, the latter must be so too, and then it will directly <HI>contradict</HI> what you have quoted before out of <HI>Bra∣cton.</HI> That in the time of <HI>Henry the</HI> 3d, (in which he lived) there lay <HI>no Remedy</HI> against the King, but only by <HI>Petition</HI>: Whereas this Opinion, makes him before the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>First</HI> to have been liable to the same <HI>Legal Process</HI> with <HI>other Men.</HI> But notwithstanding this Passage in the <HI>Year-Book,</HI> may very well bear a legal Interpretation, only by supplying what is indeed to be understood after the Words, <HI>non pas les Peers, &amp; le Commune</HI> [viz. <HI>Sans assent du Roy</HI>] which as it was then true, So I hope it will ever be so.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="175"/>But I think I can give you a much better Authority than this <HI>Year-Book,</HI> to prove, where the Power of <HI>Making</HI> and <HI>Dis∣pensing</HI> with <HI>Laws,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 21.</NOTE> doth truly reside, <HI>viz.</HI> The Solemn Declaration of the King, Lords and Commons, in the 25th. <HI>Henry</HI> 8. (a Prince as Jealous of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Prerogative, as any of his Predecessors) where in the Preamble, read these words:
<Q>It standeth therefore with Natural Equity, and good Reason, that in all and every such Human Laws made within this Realm, or induced into this Realm by the said Sufferance, Consents and Custom, your Royal Majesty, and your Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, Representing the whole State of your Realm, in this your High Court of Parliament have full Power and Authority, not only to dispense with those, and all other Humane Laws of this your Realm, as the Quality of the persons, and matter shall require. And also the said Laws, and every of them to Abrogate, Annull, Amplifie and Diminish, as it shall seem to your Majesty, and the Nobles and Commons of your Realm, present in your Parliament, Meet and Convenient for the Wealth of your Realm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
Whereby you may plainly see, that the Power of Making, Abrogating, and also Dispensing with Laws, is by this Act ascribed joyntly to the <HI>King,</HI> and the <HI>Two Houses</HI> of Par∣liament.</P>
<P>But though I do not affirm, that they have a <HI>Co-ordinate Power</HI> with the King in making Laws, yet they have a <HI>Co-operative Power</HI> therein, which yet is no more than your <HI>Co-operation</HI>; for what is a <HI>Co-operation,</HI> but a Power of <HI>working together</HI>; and how can three Distinct Bodies work together, without each contribute their share, to produce the Intended effect.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I may have bin too unwary in my expression; but pray answer the Authorities I have brought from our Ancient <HI>English Saxon Laws</HI>: Wherein it seems plain to me, that the <HI>King</HI> had then the <HI>Sole Legislative Power.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant he had a <HI>chief share</HI> in the <HI>Legislative Power</HI>; but not the <HI>Sole Power,</HI> that is, He could make no Laws, but in the <HI>Great Council,</HI> and by their <HI>Consent</HI>; And this you might have seen as well as I, if you had not slyly past by what made against you; and therefore in the first place, to begin with your Instance of <HI>Offa's</HI> giving that Boon to the <HI>Roman</HI> School, I think the Authority you bring for it, is very Slight; for though I own that <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> who writes his Life, Relates this Donation, to have been made at <HI>Rome,</HI> without mentioning any <HI>Con∣sent</HI> or <HI>Confirmation</HI> of his <HI>Great Council</HI>: Yet this seems but an imper∣fect account of the matter, and according to the usual way of the Wri∣ters of those times, who are not so exact in such matters, as they should be: And therefore, though <HI>Offa</HI> did give, or vow these Pence at <HI>Rome</HI>; yet the Gift might receive its force from the <HI>Consent</HI> of his <HI>Great Coun∣cil,</HI> after he came home: Since all his Laws, and the Acts of his Coun∣cils are lost, unless it be one, which Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI> hath given us from such Remains as have bin saved out of the <HI>Libraries</HI> of several <HI>Monaste∣ries</HI>

at their <HI>Dissolution</HI>; And this contains no less, than the <HI>Consent</HI> and <HI>Confirmation</HI> of his <HI>Great Council</HI> Assembled at <HI>Calcuith, Anno</HI> 940. for the Foundation and Endowment of the Abby of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> as also that of another Council at <HI>Verulam</HI>; for the Conferring of divers other Lands of his own to that Monastery. Now I leave it to any indiffe∣rent Man to judge: Whether that <HI>King</HI> who could not bestow his <HI>own Demesnes</HI> upon the Church, without the <HI>Consent</HI> of the <HI>Common-Council</HI> of the Kingdom, could give away at once, the 30th, <HI>Peny</HI> of all his <HI>Subjects Estates</HI> for ever, <HI>without</HI> their <HI>Consents</HI>: I am sure the Donation of the same sort of Pence by King <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Confessor,</HI> which is now to be found among the Laws of King <HI>William</HI> the First, is said to be granted, <HI>Communi Confilio Regni,</HI> and that the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings could not bestow their Lands upon Religious Uses:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spel. <HI>Concil.</HI> 1 <HI>vol. p.</HI> 340.</NOTE> See Sir <HI>H.

<P>I beg your pardon, if I have bin somewhat long in answering your Example of King <HI>Offa.</HI> But I will now shew you, that they could no more make Laws, than dispose of their own, or their Subjects Estates, without their Consent, and which you your self might ea∣sily have seen, if you had pleased to have Consulted Sir <HI>Henry Spel∣man,</HI> as Diligently as you have done Mr. <HI>Lambard</HI>; for there you might have found that about the Year 712.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spel. <HI>Con.

<P>From all which it manifestly appears, that under the <HI>English Saxon</HI> Kings, the Legislative or Enacting Power, was in the Council of the <HI>Sa∣pientes</HI> or Wites, Conjunctly with the King; and that none of these <HI>Sax∣on</HI> Kings could pass any Laws, or make any considerable Alteration in the State, without, not only the <HI>Advice,</HI> but <HI>Consent</HI> of their <HI>Great Coun∣cil</HI>; which then consisted of their Bishops, Great Lords, principal Free∣holders, and the Representatives of Cities and Towns, as I shall prove another time, and was not left to the King, <HI>ad libitum,</HI> to call whom he pleased thereunto. And as the word <HI>Decretum,</HI> signifies <HI>Decree</HI> or <HI>Order</HI>: So likewise may the word <HI>Consilium</HI> here signifie something more than <HI>bare advice,</HI> viz. <HI>Agreement,</HI> or <HI>Appointment,</HI> which if you please to peruse any ordinary Dictionary, you may presently satisfie your self in.</P>
<P>But before I Dismiss this Argument: I cannot but Remark upon your instance, of King <HI>Edmunds</HI> making Laws <HI>alone,</HI> because he there speaks in the <HI>first Person plural</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.</HI> Goldmans <HI>Dictionary.</HI></NOTE> whereas if you will but Consult the <HI>Proem</HI> to those Laws once again, you will I doubt not be satisfied of the contrary, for the words are, that <HI>having aske advice of the Council or Assembly of Clergy and Laicks▪ that is seemed good to them all, as well as to the King, and therefore we thus Ordain,</HI> by which it appears, that the last words wherein the <HI>Ordaining part</HI> Resides, refer as well to the <HI>whole Assembly,</HI> as to the <HI>King.</HI></P>

<P>The Government of our <HI>English Saxon</HI> Kings, is, I confess, very dark and obscure; for according to our <HI>Ancient Historians,</HI> they seem to have bin <HI>very absolute</HI>; though when we come to look in o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws</HI> themselves, I confess they seem rather to have bin <HI>limited</HI> Kings than <HI>ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e</HI> Monarchs, though whether that <HI>Limitation</HI> proceed∣ed from the <HI>Original Constitution</HI> of the Government, or their own <HI>free consent</HI> and <HI>Concessions</HI> is a very great question, though I rather en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>line to the former; and shall give you my Reasons for it, when we come to Discourse on that Subject; but in the mean time, I must tell you in Re∣ply to what you have said, that if we consider the time; not long after the <HI>Conquest,</HI> you will find the <HI>Supream Legislative Power,</HI> to have bin then <HI>wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly</HI> in the <HI>King</HI> (as it is so still) notwithstanding some Ambigu∣ous expressions to the Contrary; or else our <HI>Kings</HI> would <HI>not be,</HI> what I think they really are, <HI>Absolute Monarchs.</HI> But to descend to times less obscure,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H.

It might as well be said of him, as in the flourishing, and best times of the <HI>Roman Emperors: Quod Prin∣cipi placuit, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gis habet Vigorem,</HI> that whatsoever the King Willed, did pass for Law.

But as the Subjects found the Yoke to be too heavy and insupportable; so they addressed themselves in their Petitions to the <HI>Kings</HI> their Sove∣raigns, to have that Yoke made easier, and their burden lighter, especially in such particulars, of which they were most sensible at the present time. By this means they obtained first to have the Laws of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Con∣fessor</HI>; and by the same (that is to say, by pouring out their Prayers and Desires unto them) did they obtain most of the <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Statutes,</HI> which are now remaining of the time of <HI>K. Henry the Third</HI> and <HI>K. Ed. I.</HI> From whom a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> also from <HI>Hen. I.</HI> and <HI>K.

And when the <HI>Kings</HI> were pleased to call their <HI>Estates</HI> together, it was not out of an opinion, that they could not <HI>part</HI> with their Power or <HI>dispense</HI> their Favours as they thought good, or abate any thing of the <HI>Soverity</HI> of their <HI>former Government</HI> without the <HI>approbation</HI> and <HI>consent</HI> of their People; but out of a just Fear, least any one of the <HI>three Estates</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mean the <HI>Clergy Nobility</HI> and the <HI>Commons</HI>) should <HI>insist</HI> on any thing which might be prejudicial to the <HI>other two.</HI> The <HI>Commons</HI> being always on the <HI>Craving Part,</HI> and <HI>Suffering</HI> as much perhaps

<P>I confess you have given a plausible Account concerning the Go∣vernment of <HI>William I.</HI> whom you call the <HI>Conqueror</HI>; whereas if it be more exactly lookt into, it will be found, that he had <HI>no more Power</HI> of <HI>making Laws</HI> without the <HI>Consent</HI> of his <HI>Great Council</HI>▪ than <HI>any</HI> of his <HI>Predecessors</HI>; Neither had he any such <HI>Despotical Power</HI> as you imagin over the <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Fortunes</HI> of all his Subjects; for whether we consider them as <HI>Normans, French</HI> or <HI>Flemmings,</HI> or whether as <HI>English,</HI> it will be all one; For if as Dr. <HI>B.</HI> supposes, these latter were quite turned out of their Estates, and that they were by him <HI>wholely</HI> given to the former; then these <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> being <HI>Conquerors,</HI> together with him would never have <HI>sub∣mitted</HI> to any <HI>other Government</HI> than what they enjoyed in their <HI>own Coun∣tries,</HI> each of which was then governed by <HI>Kings</HI> or <HI>Dukes</HI> together with a <HI>Great Council,</HI> or <HI>Assembly of the Estates</HI>; and we find, that when succeed∣ing <HI>Kings</HI> would have oppressed and tyrannized over their Heirs and De∣scendants, they together with the <HI>old English</HI> took up Arms, and <HI>defended</HI> their <HI>Liberties,</HI> and never laid them down, until they had obtained their <HI>Iust Rights</HI> and <HI>Liberties</HI> contained in the <HI>Great Charters</HI> of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d. And which (as <HI>Math. Paris</HI> himself tells us in the Reign of King <HI>Iohn</HI>) <HI>contained for the greatest part the Ancient Laws and Customs of the King∣dom</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An.</HI> 1215.</NOTE> And therefore by the Statute, called <HI>Confirmatio Chartarum,</HI> 25th. <HI>Ed.</HI> 1st. it is adjudged in full Parliament, <HI>That the Great Charter, and Charter of the Forest, shall be taken as Common Law.</HI> So that they were not any <HI>new Grants,</HI> but rather <HI>Confirmations</HI> of their <HI>Ancient Rights</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> as my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> very well observes in his excellent Preface to his 2d. <HI>Institutes,</HI> where he tells us, <HI>that Magna Charta is for the most part declaratory of the Principal Grounds of the Fundamental Laws of</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>and for the Residue, is Additional to supply some Defects of the Common Law</HI>; so that the Learned Chancellor <HI>Fortescue,</HI> had very good Reason to affirm in his Treatise, <HI>De <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>audibus legum Angliae,</HI> that it was then Governed in all King's times, by the same Laws and Customs, as it is now, with whom likewise agrees one of his Learned Successors,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 24. <HI>p.</HI> 110.</NOTE> the late Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> in his Survey of the <HI>Levi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>than,</HI> when he tells us, <HI>that those Laws and Customs which were before the Conquest, are the same which this Nation or Kingdom have bin ever since governed by to this Day.</HI></P>
<P>And as for the Laws of <HI>Edward the Confessor,</HI> though it is true, that <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conqueror</HI> Re-granted and Confirmed them; Yet was it no
<PB N="322" REF="178"/>
more than what he was obliged in conscience and honour to perform and observe, since he was admitted to the Crown by the <HI>General Consent</HI> of the <HI>Clergy, Nobility,</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> and at his <HI>Coronation</HI> (as well as af∣terward) <HI>swore</HI> to observe the Laws of <HI>King Edward</HI>; And by the way, tho these Laws are called the Laws of <HI>King Edward,</HI> yet <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury</HI> long since observed, <HI>That they were called his Laws, Non qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulit, sed quas observaverit,</HI> that is, he had only <HI>collected</HI> them into one body, and <HI>ratified</HI> them with the <HI>Assent</HI> of his <HI>Great Council.</HI> And that these <HI>Laws</HI> were more than once <HI>sworn</HI> to, and <HI>confirmed</HI> by <HI>King William</HI> himself, appears by the Story of <HI>Frederick</HI> Abbot of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> who frighted him into a <HI>confirmation</HI> of them by <HI>Oath,</HI> for fear of a <HI>general In∣surrection</HI> of the People: So that if he, or his Son <HI>Rufus</HI> made any <HI>Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ches</HI> upon their <HI>Liberties,</HI> they were, as it were, <HI>ex post liminio</HI> restored to them by the <HI>Magna Charta's</HI> of <HI>Hen.</HI> I. <HI>K. Stephen, K. Hen.</HI> II. <HI>K. Iohn,</HI> and <HI>K. Hen. the</HI> III. And those <HI>oppressions</HI> contrary thereunto, are <HI>branded</HI> by all Historians as <HI>Notorious Perjuries,</HI> and <HI>Wrongs</HI> to the Subjects.</P>
<P>But that King <HI>William the First</HI> altered <HI>nothing material</HI> in the <HI>Funda∣mental Constitutions</HI> of the Government, whatever he might do in some <HI>less material Customs,</HI> or <HI>Laws</HI>; which he brought with him out of his <HI>own Country,</HI> appears plainly by this, which you cannot deny that he <HI>of∣ten</HI> assembled his <HI>Great Council</HI> (as his <HI>English</HI> Predecessors had done) and that in <HI>them</HI> were dispatched all the <HI>Great Causes</HI> and <HI>Complaints</HI> of the Kingdom. And for this I will give you the Testi∣mony of two very ancient Historians.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hist. Ang. Script. X.

<P>I pray give me leave to interrupt you a little. I will not deny but that the <HI>Conquerour</HI> did often assemble <HI>Great Councils</HI> of his <HI>Bishops,</HI> and <HI>Great Lords</HI> commonly called in Historians <HI>Principes,</HI> or <HI>Primates,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.</HI></NOTE> yet I think I may boldly affirm that there were no <HI>Englishmen</HI> in those <HI>Councils,</HI> or that they made <HI>any Laws</HI> for the <HI>Benefit</HI> of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> who were kept under by those <HI>Nor∣mans</HI> who then enjoyed their Estates; much less was there any such thing as <HI>Commons</HI> either by <HI>themselves,</HI> or their <HI>Representatives</HI> in those Assemblies, which then consisted wholly of the King's <HI>Feudal Tenants in Capite,</HI> and of no other as Dr. <HI>B.</HI> hath very plainly shewn us: And when King <HI>William</HI> made <HI>Laws,</HI> it is much to be doubted whether he made them so much as with the <HI>Consent</HI> of his <HI>Great Council,</HI> or not; for the
<PB N="323" REF="178"/>
Title to the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Copies of his Laws runs thus, put into <HI>English,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I.E.M.G. pag.</HI> 206.</NOTE> <HI>These are the Laws and Customs which</HI> William <HI>the King granted to all his People of</HI> England <HI>after the Conquest or Subduing of the Land: They are the same which</HI> Edward <HI>the King his Kinsman before him observed.</HI> In this Preface we have only to note, that the <HI>Laws</HI> are expressly said to be the <HI>King's Grant,</HI> and the <HI>Supplemental Laws</HI> writ in the <HI>Red Book</HI> of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> are by way of <HI>Charter,</HI> or Grant, thus, <HI>Wilhelmus Rex Anglorum,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Omnibus hominibus suis Francis, &amp; Anglis, salutem,</HI> and all along the <HI>Au∣thoritative parts</HI> are expressed by <HI>Statuimus, volumus, interdicimus, probi∣bemus, praecipimus.</HI> So that by these Expressions in his Laws, the <HI>absolute soveraignty</HI> of the <HI>Conqueror</HI> in the point of <HI>Law-giving</HI> is manifest. I shall content my self with a very few Authorities, because the matter is so plain; <HI>Ordoricus Vitalis</HI> saith thus, <HI>Eamque</HI> (i. e. <HI>Eng∣land</HI>) <HI>Gulielmus Rex suis Legibus commodò subegit.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 853.</NOTE> And <HI>Ead∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> Contemporary with the Conquerour in his History, thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 6.</NOTE> <HI>Vsus atque leges, quas patres sui, &amp; ipse in Normannia sole∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, in Anglia scribere volens.

<P>And tho we have no <HI>particular account</HI> of what Laws his Son <HI>William Rufus</HI> made, yet we may presume according to the Testimony of Histo∣rians, that he was altogether as <HI>absolute</HI> in those Councils he called as his Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eadmer. Hist. Novel. L.</HI> 1.</NOTE> as may be seen in <HI>Eadmerus</HI> his account of his Transactions with Archbishop <HI>Anselm.</HI> So that it is certain he governed by his <HI>own absolute Authority,</HI> raising what money he pleased upon his Subjects: 'Tis true, that in the Reign of his Successor <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>First,</HI> the People found some <HI>lit∣tle relaxation,</HI> by reason of the <HI>Charter</HI> he made them, containing seve∣ral <HI>mitigations</HI> of the severity of the <HI>Feudal Laws,</HI> as also those of <HI>Forests,</HI> yet even these are said to be <HI>made,</HI> by his <HI>own single Grant</HI> and <HI>Authority,</HI> tho I confess it was granted in a <HI>great Council.</HI> So likewise in <HI>Florence</HI> of <HI>Worcester,</HI> we find that in 28<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Hen.</HI> I. <HI>That King confirmed the Acts of a Synod or Council of the Clergy of the Province of</HI> Canterbury,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 503.</NOTE> <HI>and gave his Royal Assent to them.</HI></P>

<P>I beseech you, Sir, give me leave now to answer what you have already alledged out of our <HI>Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> for the <HI>Supreme</HI> and <HI>Absolute Pow∣er</HI> of our <HI>Kings,</HI> before we proceed further to less obscure times. And therefore I must tell you, that you have in this long speech of yours, made use of all the <HI>Artifice</HI> of an <HI>Advocate</HI> for a <HI>Party, viz.</HI> in <HI>urging</HI> all that can any way make for you, and <HI>slyly passing</HI> over whatsoever may make against you.

<P>But whether <HI>these Laws</HI> were not intended as well for the benefit of the <HI>English</HI> as <HI>Norman</HI> Subjects, I appeal to this Title it self; tho you have omitted part of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V.

I mention this only by the by in answer to what you have said.</P>
<P>But to return to what I am chiefly concerned to speak of, The <HI>King's sole Legislative Power</HI> in the first place. I shall not deny, but as this <HI>King∣dom</HI> is a <HI>limited Monarchy,</HI> so it is suitable to the <HI>Honour and Dignity</HI> of the <HI>Monarch,</HI> that all <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Constitutions</HI> should run in <HI>his Name,</HI> and

And tho he might do many <HI>Arbitrary</HI> and <HI>Illegal things</HI> to the prejudice of the <HI>Old English</HI> Liberties, yet this was no more his <HI>Right,</HI> nor any more to be quoted as a <HI>precedent,</HI> than his <HI>Seizing</HI> upon the <HI>Bishops,</HI> and <HI>Abbots Lands,</HI> and violently taking away the <HI>Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> out of <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Monasteries</HI> (as Historians tell us he did) could give him a <HI>Right</HI> to them.</P>
<P>I have not much to observe upon the Reign of <HI>William Rufus,</HI> since we have none of his Laws left us, if ever he made any. But thus much we plainly find from the <HI>Historians,</HI> and especially <HI>Eadmerus,</HI> that he call∣ed divors <HI>Great Councils</HI> of all the <HI>Nobility</HI> of the Kingdom; especially about his difference with <HI>Anselm.</HI> whom it is plain he could <HI>not condemn</HI> without the <HI>Consent</HI> of this <HI>Great Council.</HI> But to come to the Reign of <HI>King Henry the First,</HI> it appears plainly by <HI>W. Malmsbury</HI> and <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> that he was <HI>Elected</HI> and <HI>Crowned</HI> King by the <HI>Common Suffrages,</HI> and fa∣vour of the <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>People</HI>; and certainly that <HI>Council</HI> whose <HI>Vote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> could <HI>make</HI> a <HI>King,</HI> was also <HI>necessary</HI> to all <HI>such Laws</HI> as he was to make: And you your self have granted, that this <HI>Charter</HI> of his was made in a <HI>Great Council</HI>; and it appears in <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> as also in the Laws of this King published by Mr. <HI>Lambard,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. P. R. C.

<P>As for <HI>Henry the Second</HI>'s Reign it is apparent by the Laws of this King in <HI>Spellman</HI>'s Councils, that he granted his Charter in a <HI>Great</HI> or <HI>General Council,</HI> and consequently they must likewise give their <HI>Assents</HI> to it, as well as to that of his Grandfather <HI>Henry</HI> the First. And tho in the <HI>Constitutions</HI> of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> the King <HI>alone</HI> is said to have made, on <HI>decreed</HI> them, yet nothing is plainer than that the King could <HI>not make</HI> them, <HI>without the advice</HI> and <HI>consent</HI> of his <HI>Great Council,</HI> or else to what purpose were they to be <HI>called</HI>; and if their <HI>Assent</HI> was <HI>necessary,</HI> cer∣tainly they had also a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd</HI> in <HI>making those Constitutions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="180"/>But that the King could not <HI>condemn</HI> any <HI>Peer,</HI> or <HI>Great man</HI> of the Kingdom in those days, without a <HI>Legal Tryal</HI> in the <HI>Great Council</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> I need go no further than a Council Summoned by <HI>Hubert</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as the King's Commissioner in his absence, where <HI>Log. Hoveden</HI> tells us, that having shewed the Letters of Earl <HI>Iohn,</HI> to the Bishops, Earls and Barons, <HI>per Commune Concilium Regni definitum est, quod Comes Iohannes dissaisietur,</HI> which interprets that passage you have quoted out of the same Author, that the <HI>King</HI> in a <HI>Great Council</HI> disseized <HI>Gerard Canville,</HI> and others, that is by the <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>Sen∣tence</HI> of the said <HI>Council.</HI> And so likewise in the same sense is to be un∣derstood, those words you mentioned, <HI>the King appointed to be given him, constituit sibi dari,</HI> two Shillings on every Plough-land; that is, he desi∣red it to be given him by them. For if he could have taken it <HI>without their Consent,</HI> to what purpose did he propose it there? if he could have <HI>absolutely demanded</HI> it, why should he only <HI>request</HI> or <HI>desire</HI> it of them?</P>
<P>So likewise for the <HI>Great Council</HI> in King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s time, nothing is more plain, than that they were <HI>parties</HI> to <HI>all the Laws</HI> that were made in his time, and that even the <HI>Great Charter,</HI> was a <HI>Statute</HI> to which their <HI>As∣sent</HI> was likewise <HI>necessary,</HI> I shall shew you by and by, when I come to speak of the <HI>Great Chrrter</HI> of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, and the several <HI>Confirmations</HI> of it by his Successors. But if either <HI>William Rufus,</HI> King <HI>Iohn,</HI> or any other King, ever <HI>levyed</HI> any <HI>Taxes</HI> upon the People, <HI>with∣out consent</HI> of the <HI>Great Council,</HI> or <HI>Parliament,</HI> it was <HI>contrary</HI> to our <HI>ancient Laws,</HI> and the <HI>Liberties</HI> of the Subjects, and particularly to the 55<HI>th.</HI> Law of <HI>William</HI> the First (part of which I have already cited) it begins thus, <HI>Volumus etiam ac firmiter praecipimus &amp; concedimus, ut omnes liberi homines totius Monarchiae Regni nostri praedicti habea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, &amp; teneant terras suas, &amp; p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssessiones suas, bene &amp; in pace libere ab omni exactione injusta, &amp; ab omni Tallagio; ita quod nihil ab ois exigatur, vel capiatur, nisi Servitium suum liberum, quod de jure nobis facere debent, &amp; facere tenentur, &amp; prout statutum est eis,</HI> &amp;c. So that whatsoever was done at any time <HI>contrary</HI> to this Statute, was <HI>illegal,</HI> and consequently ought not to be quoted as <HI>any part</HI> of the <HI>King's Prerogative.</HI> But that the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of <HI>England</HI> had divers Rights and Liberties before the time of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> and of his granting that Charter, appears by its conclu∣sion, in these words,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In</HI> Mat.

<P>Tho I do not allow of your notion of the <HI>Conqueror</HI>'s not being properly and really so, as I shall shew you another time, when I shall more particularly consider that Argument of the <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Conquest</HI> in King <HI>William,</HI> and all his Successors; therefore I do at present readily assent to your Proposal, and it was the very thing I was coming to. And therefore I shall begin with the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, which begins thus, <HI>Know ye, that We of our Meer and Free Will have given these Liberties.</HI> The Statute <HI>de Scaccario Anno</HI> 51 <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. begins thus, <HI>The King commandeth that all manner of Bayliffs,</HI> &amp;c.

And in the first Chapter 'tis said, <HI>The King hath Ordained, and Esta∣blished these Acts.</HI> And tho I grant that in divers Statutes of this King, at in this of <HI>Westminster,</HI> it is recited that the King by the advice of his <HI>Counsel</HI> or <HI>Assent</HI> of the <HI>Archbishops, Bishops, Earls, Barons,</HI> &amp;c. have Made, Provided, Ordained, or Establisht such and such Laws; yet it is plain, that the <HI>Enacting</HI> or <HI>Decreeing part</HI> is <HI>wholly</HI> ascribed to the <HI>King</HI> in all those Statutes wherein such words are found, as I shall make it ap∣pear more plainly by the Statute of <HI>Act on Burnel</HI> made in 13 <HI>Edw.</HI> I. where it is said, <HI>The King by himself, and all his Council hath Ordained and Established.</HI> And in the Statute of <HI>Westminster,</HI> 3.18 Edw.

<P><PB N="329" REF="181"/>But if we come to the Reign of his Son <HI>Edw.</HI> 3d.

<P>In answer to <HI>those Authorities,</HI> you have now brought; I doubt not, but I shall give you others of as great weight, that prove the <HI>direct contrary</HI> to what you now Assert. To begin with your Instance of <HI>Mag∣na Charta,</HI> I shall shew that those <HI>Charters</HI> that were granted and con∣firmed by <HI>Henry</HI> 3d. were not his <HI>Acts</HI> or <HI>Grants alone</HI>; but the Grants also of the <HI>whole Kingdom,</HI> Represented in <HI>Parliament.</HI> We have two Express Declarations for the one,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mem.</HI> 38.</NOTE> in the 25th of King <HI>Edw.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Where is to be found in the <HI>Parliament Roll</HI> of that Year, a <HI>Confirmation</HI> of the <HI>Great Charter</HI> of <HI>Li∣berties</HI> and <HI>Forests,</HI> in these Words which I shall render to you in <HI>En∣glish,</HI> out of the <HI>Old French,</HI> for your better understanding. <HI>Know ye, that the Honour of God, and Holy Church, and for the profit of our whole Realm: We have granted for us, and to our Heirs, that the Great Char∣ter of Franchises and Forests, which were made by the Common Assent of the whole Realm, in the time of King</HI> Henry <HI>our Father, should be held in all Points, without any Blemishment.</HI> So likewise we find <HI>ano∣ther Confirmation</HI> of those Charters in the <HI>Parliament Rolls,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">N. 50.

<PB N="331" REF="182"/>
no reason, especially if we consider, that <HI>that Charter</HI> was first drawn up by the <HI>Barons</HI> in the Form, in which we find it; and was past by that <HI>King,</HI> under his <HI>Great Seal,</HI> in that vast <HI>General Council,</HI> or As∣sembly at <HI>Running-Mead.</HI> And certainly, whoever can <HI>draw up a Law,</HI> and can offer it to a <HI>Prince to Confirm,</HI> and <HI>without which consent</HI> of theirs, it would <HI>not be good,</HI> must necessarily have a <HI>share</HI> in the <HI>making</HI> of it.</P>

And for the Proof of this, I shall begin with one of the Antientest Statutes we have left us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 <HI>H.</HI> 3.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Merton,</HI> in the Preamble of which, it is recited, <HI>Provisum est in Curia Domini Regis apud Merton, where after the parties that were present at the making of the Laws,</HI> it concludes thus in the Latin Copies, <HI>ita provisum est &amp; Concessum tam a praedictis Archiepiscopis, Episco∣pis, Comitibus, Baronibus quam ab ipso Rege, &amp; aliis,</HI> where you see the <HI>Providing</HI> and <HI>Enacting Part</HI>▪ is Ascribed to the <HI>Bishops, Earls</HI> and <HI>Ba∣rons,</HI> as well as to the King, who is here mentioned almost last of all. And though I confess that there was then no <HI>Set Form</HI> of <HI>Penning</HI> of <HI>Statutes</HI> in that honest and plain Age, when <HI>Parliaments</HI> did not last <HI>so many Days,</HI> as they do now <HI>Weeks,</HI> and that the King's Judges and Council, drew up the Acts after the Parliament was up, in what Form they pleased; sometimes leaving out any mention of the <HI>Bishops,</HI> some∣times of the <HI>Temporal Lords,</HI> and most commonly of the <HI>Commons</HI>: Yet that they did <HI>all</HI> give their <HI>Consents</HI> to such Acts, appears by the Statute of <HI>Westminster</HI> the 1st. which you have already Cited <HI>where the Assent of the Arch-Bishops, Bishops,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Counts, Earls, Barons, and all the Commonalty of the Land,</HI> is expresly mentioned. So likewise the Statute of 51. of King <HI>H.</HI> 3d. concerning Measures, begins thus. <HI>Per ordina∣tiones totius Regni Angliae fuit mensura Domini Regis composita.</HI></P>
<P>But farther to convince you, that in the Opinion of the Lord Chan∣cellour, and those Learned Judges who framed the <HI>Writs</HI> that were issued out upon any of these <HI>Antient Statutes,</HI> you will find that they who lived in those very times, believed that those <HI>Statutes</HI> were made, <HI>not</HI> by the <HI>K. alone</HI>; but by him and the <HI>Common Council</HI> of the Kingdom, which <HI>Writs</HI> as you may see in the <HI>Register of Writs,</HI> run thus. <HI>Rex Vicecom.</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Salut. Si A. fecerit,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>tunc summonias,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>B. quod sit coram Iusticiarijs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Regist. Brev. p.</HI> 174. <HI>&amp; dein. per tot. Titulum Brevia de Sta∣tuto.</HI></NOTE> &amp;c. <HI>Ostensuris quare, cum de Commu∣ni Concilio Regni Nostri Angliae provisum sit,</HI> &amp;c. as you may see in the Writs Granted upon the Statutes of <HI>Magna Charta, Marlbridg, Merton, Glocester,</HI> &amp;c. which have all of them this, or the like Recitals, <HI>cum de Statuto, or juxia formam Statuti, de Communi Concilio Regni nostri Ang. inde provisi.</HI> The like Instance I could give you, upon the Statute of <HI>Marlbridge,</HI> and divers other <HI>Old Statutes,</HI> in which the
<PB N="332" REF="183"/>
<HI>King</HI> by the Statute it self, seems <HI>only</HI> to have <HI>Enacted</HI> it, and yet you may see, that our <HI>Sages of the Law,</HI> were very well Convinced, that those <HI>Statutes</HI> were made <HI>not</HI> by the <HI>King alone</HI>; but by the <HI>whole Com∣mon Council of England</HI>: So that there is no avoiding the Conclusion, that the <HI>Great Council</HI> or <HI>Parliament</HI> had then a <HI>Great Share</HI> in the <HI>Legisla∣tive Power,</HI> unless you can suppose the <HI>King alone,</HI> to have bin the <HI>whole Common-Council</HI> of the Kingdom, mentioned in these Writs.</P>
<P>But as for the rest of your Instances of <HI>Edw.</HI> 2d. and <HI>Edw.</HI> 3ds times: I think I can shew you, that there is <HI>no General Rule</HI> to be drawn from some <HI>few Examples</HI>; For though it is very true, that the first of <HI>Edw.</HI> 2d. begins thus, <HI>Our Lord the King hath granted,</HI> &amp;c. Yet it is plain by the Statute it self, that it was made <HI>in,</HI> and <HI>by, Parliament.</HI> The like I may say of the rest of the Statutes of this King's Reign, though they do not all agree in Form, as you may see by the Statute of <HI>Sheriffs</HI> 9th. Edw. 2d. <HI>Our Lord the King by the Assent of the Prelates, Earls, Ba∣rons and other Great Estates, hath Ordained and Established.</HI> And though you would fain draw some <HI>mighty Consequence</HI> from those Phrases in the Statutes of <HI>Edw.</HI> 3d. and many of his Successors, <HI>by the Assent of the Lords, and at the Request of the Commons, as if the</HI> Consent of the <HI>latter,</HI> were not as <HI>necessary</HI> as the <HI>former</HI>: Yet indeed it is a meer <HI>difference</HI> in <HI>Form,</HI> and proceeds only from hence, that <HI>that Estate</HI> which found it self <HI>griev∣ed,</HI> always <HI>Petitioned</HI> the King for Redress; and <HI>which</HI> amounted to as much as a <HI>Consent</HI>: For you shall always find, that the <HI>Petitioning Part</HI> still refers to that Body which was then oppressed, without giving any <HI>other Assent</HI>: For certainly their <HI>Requesting</HI> to have an Act made, doth necessarily express their <HI>Consent.</HI> And to prove what I have now said by Examples, pray see the 8th of <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 1. Where it is Recited in the Preamble, <HI>that our Soveraign Lord the King, Willing Graciously to pro∣vide for the Security and Quiet of the said Prelates and Clergy, at the Sup∣plication of the said</HI> Prelates, &amp;c. <HI>and of the Assent of the Great Men and Commons aforesaid, hath Ordained and Establishs't,</HI> where you may see that the <HI>Assent</HI> of the <HI>Prelates,</HI> is not here at all mentioned; because it was <HI>needless,</HI> as being made at their <HI>Request.</HI> And if <HI>Praying</HI> and <HI>Requesting,</HI> should destroy the <HI>Legislative Power,</HI> I doubt whether <HI>Edw.</HI> 3d. did not give away his, when in his 14th. Year, in a Statute concerning the Sub∣sidy of Wools: The Preamble runs thus, <HI>nevertheless the King prayeth the Earls, Barons and all the Commonalty, for the Great Business which he hath in Hand,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>that they would grant him some Aid upon Wools, Lea∣ther,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Where upon Deliberation being bad, the said Prelates, Barons and Commons of the Kingdom, have Granted him</HI> 40 <HI>Shillings to be taken on every Sack of Wooll.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the Matter, to let you see that not only the <HI>Commons</HI> but also <HI>the Lords</HI> have bin oftentimes <HI>Petitioners,</HI> as well as the <HI>Commons,</HI> Pray see these Authorities. The 1 is the Statute of Provisors 27 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3d. runs thus. <HI>Our Soveraign Lord the King, with the Assent and Prayers of the Great Men, and the Commons of the Realm of</HI> England, <HI>hath ordained,</HI> &amp;c. And in the 4th. of <HI>Ed.</HI> 4th. <HI>i. e.</HI> It is Recited thus. <HI>The King by the As∣sent,
<PB N="333" REF="183"/>
Advice, Request and Authority of his Lords Spiritual, Temporal and Commons, &amp;c.</HI> hath Ordain'd and Establisht in the Preamble of the Sta∣tute of 1. <HI>Edw.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 4. it is thus. <HI>Wherefore the King our Soveraign Lord, minding and entirely desiring—at the Humble Petition, and Suit of the Lords and Commons in this present Parliament Assembled, doth Declare, Or∣dain and Enact, by the Assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament Assembled, and by the Authority of the same.</HI> And that the <HI>Assent</HI> of the <HI>Commons,</HI> was always <HI>necessary</HI> to the <HI>making of Laws,</HI> not as bare Petitioners, but as <HI>Assenters</HI> too, as well as the Lords, appears by this <HI>Protestation,</HI> or Declaration of the <HI>Commons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>N.</HI> 46.</NOTE> to <HI>Edw.</HI> 3d. which is still to be found in the <HI>Parliament Rolls</HI> of 51. of that King; which I shall read to you in <HI>English,</HI> out of the <HI>Law-French</HI>; which perhaps you are not used to; <HI>Also the said Commons do Petition our Lord the King, that no Statute or Ordinance may be made, or Granted at the Petition of the Clergy, unless it be by the Assent of the Commons; Neither that the said Commons should be obliged by any Constitution, which they may make for their Advan∣tage, without the Assent os the said Commons: For they will not be obliged to any of your</HI> (viz. the Kings) <HI>Statutes or Ordinances made without their Assent.</HI></P>

<P>I do not deny, but that the <HI>Assent</HI> of the <HI>Commons,</HI> as well as <HI>Lords,</HI> hath bin allowed as <HI>necessary</HI> for a long time: But whether the <HI>Consent</HI> of <HI>either,</HI> at first was so, is a great doubt, since we find the <HI>first Ancient Statutes</HI> (as I have already observed) to have bin made <HI>wholy</HI> by the <HI>King alone</HI>: And I think the <HI>most Ancient Laws,</HI> are the <HI>best Interpreters</HI> of the <HI>Original Legislative Power</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F.F.G.I p.</HI> 50.</NOTE> And thence it appears, that <HI>many Provisions, Ordinances</HI> and <HI>Proclamations</HI> made heretofore <HI>out of Parliament,</HI> have bin always acknow∣ledged for <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Statutes.</HI> We have among the <HI>Printed Statutes</HI> to this purpose, one called the <HI>Statute of Ireland,</HI> Dated at <HI>Westminster,</HI> the 9th. of <HI>February,</HI> 14 <HI>Hen.</HI> 3d. Which is nothing but a <HI>Letter</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> to <HI>Gerard, Fitz Maurice,</HI> Justiciar of <HI>Ireland.</HI> The Explanations of the Statute of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> made by the <HI>King,</HI> and his <HI>Iustices only,</HI> were received <HI>always</HI> for <HI>Statutes,</HI> and are still <HI>printed</HI> with them: Also the Statute made for the <HI>Correction</HI> of the 12th. <HI>Ch.</HI> of the Statute of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> was Signed under the <HI>Great Seal,</HI> and sent to the <HI>Iustices of the Bench,</HI> after the manner of a <HI>Writ Patent</HI>; with a Certain <HI>Writ closed,</HI> Dated by the <HI>King's Hand</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> 2 <HI>Mai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 9 <HI>Edw.

So that in the Old Statutes, it is hard to Distinguish <HI><UNCLEAR>what</UNCLEAR> Laws</HI> were made by <HI>Kings in Parliament,</HI> and <HI>what out of Parliament,</HI> especially, when Kings called the <HI>Peers only</HI> to Parliament, and of those how many, or <HI>whom they pleased</HI> (as it appears <HI>Anciently</HI> they did) it was
<PB N="334" REF="184"/>
no easy matter to put a <HI>Difference</HI> between a <HI>Council-Table,</HI> and a <HI>Parli∣ament,</HI> or between a <HI>Proclamation</HI> and a <HI>Statute.</HI> Not but that I own in Old Times, there was a Distinction between the <HI>Kings Special,</HI> or <HI>Privy Council,</HI> and the <HI>Common-Council</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom</HI>; and yet his <HI>Special Council</HI> did Sit with the <HI>Peers</HI> in <HI>Parliament,</HI> and were as <HI>part</HI> thereof, and were of <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Extraordinary Authority</HI> there, as may appear by divers <HI>Acts of Parliament,</HI> some of which I have already Recited, as the Statute of <HI>Westminster I.</HI> Where it is said: <HI>These are the Acts of</HI> Edward, made at his I. Parliament, <HI>by his Council.</HI> The Statute of <HI>Acton Bur∣nel,</HI> 13 <HI>Ed.</HI> 1st. hath these words: <HI>The King for himself, and by his Coun∣cil, hath Ordained and Established</HI>: And in <HI>Articulis Super Chartas,</HI> there are these Provisions. <HI>Nevertheless, the King and his Council do not intend: And both the King and his Council, and all they t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at were present, Will and Intend, that the Right and Prerogative of his Crown, shall be saved to him in all things.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>Stat.</HI> 2. <HI>preamb.</HI></NOTE> And before these, the <HI>Com∣mons</HI> often <HI>Petitioned</HI> the King: As 1 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3d. where <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was confirmed, the Preamble is thus: <HI>At the Request of the Commonalty by their Petition made before the King, and his Council in Parliament by the Assent of the Prelates, Earls and Barons,</HI> &amp;c. I could give you many more Examples of this Kind, but that it is needless, only these may suffice to let you see, That the <HI>King's Council</HI> had a <HI>Great Authority</HI> in those times, and perhaps was <HI>more Ancient</HI> than the Great Council it self.</P>
<P>Yet I cannot forbear to give you one or two Author<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es more to prove▪<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I.E.M.G. p.</HI> 234.</NOTE> that the <HI>King</HI> with the Advice and Consent of a Council of his <HI>Earls, Barons,</HI> and other <HI>Wise Men,</HI> hath sometimes taken upon him to <HI>Rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Statutes</HI> made in a <HI>Precedent Parliament,</HI> as contrary to the Laws and Customs of this Realm; and to his Prerogatives, and Rights Royal, though Granted by him in manner of a Statute. And for this,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pult. p.</HI> 111.</NOTE> you may see the Statute of 15th. <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d. at large in <HI>Pulton's</HI> Collection. So likewise in the Preface of the Statute of <HI>Westminster,</HI> 20 <HI>E.</HI> 3. that We, <HI>viz.</HI> The King by the Assent of our Great Men, and other Wise Men of our Council▪ have Ordained, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Where you may observe, that here is no mention either of Lords Temporal or Commons. I could give you more Examples of this kind, were it not too tedious. From which sta∣tutes, it seems plain to me, that this <HI>King</HI> did sometimes <HI>Exercise</HI> a <HI>Prerogative</HI> of <HI>Making</HI> and <HI>Repealing Laws, without Consent of Par∣liament.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, I desire you to take notice that these words you so much rely upon <HI>(viz.) by the Authority of this present Parliament,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H.S.B.D. p.</HI> 721.</NOTE> <HI>and be it Enacted by the King, Lords and Commons,</HI> as if they were <HI>three Co-ordinate Estates,</HI> was never in use, till the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> 6th, and <HI>Hen.</HI> 7th. two <HI>Notori∣ous Vsurpers.</HI> And that the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Single Answer</HI> to the <HI>Lords and Com∣mons Request,</HI> is a Sufficient <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> without any mention of
<PB N="335" REF="184"/>
the <HI>Concurrent Authority</HI> of the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> Enacting the same the President I gave you of King <HI>Charles's Answer</HI> to the <HI>Petition of Right,</HI> may suffice, though you have not vouchsafed to give me any Return to it. So that I think these Instances may serve instead of many Arguments; for the proof of this Truth, <HI>that the Legislative Power</HI> (as We Phrase it now) <HI>is wholy and solely in the King, although Restrained in the Exercise and vse thereof, by constant Custom unto the Counsel and Consent of the Lords and Commons</HI>: For <HI>Le Roy le veult,</HI> or the King will have it so, is the <HI>Imperative Phrase,</HI> by which the <HI>Propositions</HI> of the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> are made <HI>Acts of Parliament.</HI> And let the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> Agitate, and <HI>propound</HI> what Laws they please for their <HI>Ease</HI> and <HI>Benefit</HI> (as generally <HI>all Laws</HI> and <HI>Statutes</HI> are more for the <HI>Ease</HI> and <HI>Be∣nefit</HI> of the <HI>Subject,</HI> than the <HI>Advantages</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>) yet as well now, as formerly, in the time of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, only, <HI>quod Principi placet, Legis habet Vigorem,</HI> nothing but that which the <HI>King</HI> pleases to <HI>al∣low</HI> of, is to pass for <HI>Law</HI>: The <HI>Laws</HI> not taking their <HI>Coercive force</HI> (as Judicious <HI>Hooke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> well observes) from the <HI>Quality</HI> of such as <HI>Devise</HI> them;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H.D.L. p.</HI> 49.</NOTE> but from the <HI>Power</HI> that giveth them the <HI>Strength of Laws.</HI> So that to Determine the matter <HI>Logically</HI>: The <HI>Legislative Power,</HI> is either <HI>largely</HI> and <HI>im∣properly,</HI> or <HI>Strictly,</HI> and <HI>Properly</HI> taken: <HI>Largely</HI> taken, it signi∣fies <HI>any Power,</HI> which hath the <HI>Authority</HI> to provide the <HI>Materials</HI> of a <HI>Law,</HI> and to Judge what is <HI>Iust, Convenient</HI> or <HI>Necessary</HI> to be <HI>En∣acted</HI>; and to declare when any Matters duly prepared, are made and granted into a Law; and this <HI>Ministerial</HI> sort of <HI>Legislative Power</HI> impro∣perly so called, the <HI>two Houses</HI> have, and Exercise yet by <HI>Authority</HI> front the <HI>Grown</HI>: But then the <HI>Legislative Power,</HI> is <HI>Strictly</HI> and <HI>Properly</HI> taken for the <HI>Power of Sanction,</HI> or for that <HI>Commanding, Ordaining, Power,</HI> which gives <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>Being</HI> to the <HI>Law,</HI> and <HI>force</HI> to oblige the <HI>Con∣science</HI> of the <HI>Subject</HI>; and this is <HI>radically</HI> and <HI>Incommunicably</HI> in the <HI>King,</HI> as Soveraign. And therefore (as I have already said) all the <HI>Ancient Acts,</HI> run in the <HI>King's Name alone</HI>; And from the <HI>Legislative Power</HI> thus properly taken, the <HI>Laws</HI> are <HI>properly</HI> called the <HI>King's Laws,</HI> and the Violation of them is punishable as such.</P>

<P>You have made a very long Speech, and taken a great deal of pains to perplex a Question in it self very easy to be Resolved; and to which I need return you <HI>no other Answer,</HI> then what <HI>Bracton</HI> tells us, in his 3<HI>d.</HI> Book, cap. 9. <HI>de actionibus Nibil aliud potest Rex in terris su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, cum sit Dei minister, &amp; vicarius, nisi id solum quod de Iure potest, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> quod dicitur, quod Principi places, legis habet vigorem, quia sequ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in fine legis; cum Bege reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a quae de Imperio ejus la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a est</HI> i. e. <HI>non qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quid de voluntate Regis te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere praesumptum est, sed quod consilio Magistratuum suo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an Rege Authoritatem praes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, &amp; bab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a super ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deliberat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one.</HI> So that you see in the time when this Author Writ, the <HI>King</HI> could do <HI>no more</HI> by his <HI>Prerogative.</HI> then the <HI>Law</HI> allowed him to do; and though it is true, it is his Will, and Authority that gives Vigour to the Law, yet this only, as it is declared in Parliament, and in those Acts which had before received the Consent of his Great Council, here called the
<PB N="336" REF="185"/>
Kings Magistrates: And therefore you have done what you can, to con∣found the difference between the <HI>Kings Declaration,</HI> or <HI>Writs</HI> Explaining and Enforcing the <HI>Common Laws</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> or else Interpreting <HI>former Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> already made; which was a <HI>Prerogative</HI> often exerci∣sed by the <HI>King</HI> and his <HI>Council in Parliament,</HI> which then consisted of <HI>all,</HI> or <HI>most</HI> of the <HI>Iudges,</HI> and <HI>Great Officers</HI> of the Kingdom, of which, I shall speak more at large, by and by: And I confess we are much in the Dark, because our <HI>Ancient Parliament-Rolls</HI> are almost all lost, and con∣sequently the Statutes therein contained: So that we have almost no∣thing left of them, but such <HI>Copies</HI> or <HI>Remains,</HI> as were preserved by <HI>Iudges</HI> and <HI>Lawyers</HI> in those and Succeeding times, whilst they were still in Being. And therefore I think I may at present boldly affirm, that if that, which you call the Statute of <HI>Ireland,</HI> was not founded upon some <HI>former Statute</HI> not now in being, it was <HI>no Act of Parliament</HI> at all; but only the <HI>King's Writ,</HI> to the Chief Justiciar of <HI>Ireland,</HI> Commanding and Enforcing the <HI>Common Law</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> in the Case of <HI>Coparceners,</HI> to be observed in <HI>Ireland.</HI> The like I may say to the <HI>Explanation</HI> of the Statute of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> which might be no more than the <HI>Interpretation</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> and his <HI>Iustices,</HI> of the Sense of <HI>some Articles</HI> in that Statute; and this for its <HI>Greater Authority.</HI> Exemplified under the <HI>Great Seal,</HI> and so sent to all the Courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and often to the Sheriffs of all the Counties in <HI>England,</HI> yet without altering that Statute in some Points, as you would have it. The like I may say of the Statute of <HI>Acon Bur∣nel</HI>; and therefore it is very rashly done, to conclude, that though we have not the <HI>Original Acts</HI> and <HI>Records</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> of that time, that therefore such Statutes were made by the <HI>King alone,</HI> in his <HI>Privy Coun∣cil</HI>; So that I must still continue of the same Opinion with the Great <HI>Selden</HI> in this Point, who in his <HI>Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Clausum,</HI> tells us. <HI>It is most cer∣tain, that according to Ancient Custom, no Answer is given either by the King, or in the King's Name to any Parliamentary Bill, before that Bill, whe∣ther it be brought in first by the Lords, or by the Commons, hath past both Houses, as is known to all that are versed in Parliamentary Affairs.</HI> Which if it hath bin the <HI>Fundamental Law</HI> of this Kingdom, it signifies very lit∣tle, in what Form the Law is express't, whether in the <HI>King's Name only,</HI> as giving the <HI>last Assent</HI> thereto, or else as his <HI>Concession</HI> to the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Common's</HI> Petition, as long as you grant that their <HI>Assent</HI> was <HI>necessary</HI>; For sure, whosoever Petitions another to do a thing, which he cannot impose upon him without his Request, must give his consent to the Doing it, unless you can prove, that it could be done whether the Petitioner would or not: And this by the way, will serve to answer an Objection; which though you insist much upon it, is scarce worth it, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>King's Answer</HI> to the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons Petition of Right,</HI> which was indeed <HI>no Grant</HI> or <HI>Concession</HI> of any <HI>New Rights</HI> or <HI>Priviledges</HI> from the <HI>King</HI> to the <HI>People</HI>; But only a <HI>Declaration</HI> of several <HI>Ancient Rights</HI> and <HI>Liberties</HI> of the Subjects, which had been very much <HI>broken</HI> and <HI>infringed</HI> of late; and therefore the <HI>King's Answer</HI> was very proper, <HI>soit Droict faict comme est desire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="185"/>The next mistake you fall into proceeds from your confounding the <HI>King's extraordinary Council</HI> in <HI>Parliament,</HI> with the <HI>King's Special,</HI> or <HI>Privy Council,</HI> and in a manner making this a <HI>fourth Estate</HI>; by whom, as well as by the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> Laws are often made; whereas indeed neither the one nor the other is true. For tho I grant that there is often made mention in our <HI>Ancient Statutes,</HI> or <HI>Records</HI> of the <HI>Kings Council</HI>; yet this is not to be understood of his <HI>Privy Council,</HI> but of a <HI>Special Council,</HI> with whom our King's formerly sate during the <HI>time of Parliament,</HI> and before whom, and to whom we find by <HI>divers Records</HI> that both the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> did often <HI>Petition,</HI> as you your self do truly affirm.

<P>I am so far from thinking this Discourse you have now made to be at all tedious, that I give you many thanks for it, since it gives me a light into many things which I confess I did not know before, and I shall better consider the <HI>Authorities</HI> you have now given me, and if I find they will hold, shall come over to your opinion in that point, tho I am not as yet satisfied as to the <HI>Legistative Power</HI> of the <HI>two Houses,</HI> and there∣fore pray proceed to answer the rest of the Presidents I have brought on that Subject.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall readily comply with your Commands; and therefore to come to those Statutes of the 15<HI>th.</HI> and 20<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. which you sup∣pose to have been <HI>repealed</HI> by that King <HI>without</HI> the <HI>Consent</HI> of the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Common<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>; I grant indeed that the Statutes you mention were <HI>inten∣ded</HI> to be <HI>repeal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> by the King, <HI>without Assent of Parliament</HI>; Yet was this <HI>not done,</HI> by <HI>himself,</HI> and his <HI>Council alone</HI> as you suppose, but by a <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Earls, Barons</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> which the Kings of <HI>England</HI> in
<PB N="339" REF="186"/>
those days were wont to call upon <HI>emergent occasions,</HI> and for the doing of that which they thought Parliaments could not so speedily perform; as in this <HI>pretended repeal</HI> of the Statute you mention: And tho I grant this was a <HI>great br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch</HI> upon the <HI>fundamental Constitutions</HI> of the Kingdom, yet that it was done in such a <HI>Great Council,</HI> as I have now mentioned, I refer you to this <HI>pretended Statute</HI> its self, and to your recital of it. And that the King often called such <HI>Great Councils</HI> appears by an <HI>agreement of Ex∣change,</HI> made for the Castle of <HI>Berwick</HI> between King <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. in the fifth year of his Reign, and the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> where the King promiseth to deliver to the Earl, Lands and Tenements to the value of the Castle, by these words (which I shall render out of <HI>French</HI> from the <HI>Original</HI> which remains in the Tower), <HI>By the advice and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssent of the Estates of the Realm, and of his Parliament</HI> (<HI>so that the Parliam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt happen before the Feast of St.</HI> Lucie) <HI>otherwise by the Assent of his Great Council, and other Estates of his said Realm, which the King will cause to be assem∣bled before the said Feast, in case the Parliament do not happen,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And yet notwithstanding this <HI>high strain</HI> of <HI>Prerogative</HI> King <HI>Edw.</HI> III. himself was not satisfied with this <HI>repeal</HI> of those Statutes you have men∣tioned, but in the next Parliament held in his 17<HI>th.</HI> year he procured a <HI>formal</HI> and <HI>Legal repeal</HI> of them, as by the <HI>Parliament Rolls</HI> of that year,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Numb.</HI> 23.</NOTE> remaining in the Tower, doth plainly appear. And which I could give you at large, did I not fear to be too ted<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous. But I think it fit to let you know this, because most ordi∣nary Readers seeing <HI>no more</HI> appear in Print in our <HI>Statute Books,</HI> are apt to imagin, that the Kings of <HI>England</HI> in those days did often take upon them without <HI>Authority</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> to <HI>make</HI> and <HI>repeal</HI> Laws. But as for your next Instance of the Statute of <HI>Edw.</HI> III. it is much weaker: since, tho I confess that in the <HI>Preface</HI> to these Acts, there is only men∣tion of the <HI>Great Men,</HI> or <HI>Grantz</HI> (as it is in our old <HI>French</HI>) and other <HI>wise Men</HI> of our Council, yet I shall prove at another time that under this word <HI>Grantz</HI> were meant the <HI>Lords</HI> in Parliament, as by the <HI>wise men</HI> of our Council are understood the <HI>Commons.</HI> And therefore it seems most reasonable to interpret the sense of many <HI>ancient Statutes</HI> wherein the <HI>King alone</HI> is said to <HI>make</HI> and <HI>ordain</HI> Laws, by those <HI>later</HI> or <HI>more modern</HI> ones, wherein the <HI>King</HI> by the <HI>Consent</HI> of the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Com∣mons,</HI> or by <HI>Authority of Parliament,</HI> is said to have <HI>Ordained</HI> them: Since the true Stile and Meaning of <HI>ancient Laws,</HI> which were penned with the <HI>greatest brevity,</HI> ought to be still Interpreted by the <HI>Modern ones,</HI> and not the <HI>Modern</HI> ones by the <HI>Ancient.</HI> So that I am of the Learned Mr. <HI>Lambard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> opinion, who in his <HI>Arcb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion,</HI> or Discourse upon the High Courts of Justice in <HI>England,</HI> expressly tells us,
<Q><HI>That whether the Laws are said to be made by the King,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 269. <HI>E∣dit.</HI> 1635.</NOTE> <HI>and his Wise Men, or by the King and his Council, or his Com∣mon Council</HI>; or by the King, his Earls, Barons, and other Wise Men, or after such other like Phrases, whereof you meet with many in the Volumes of Parliaments: It comes all to this one Point, namely, That the <HI>King,</HI> his <HI>Nobility,</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> did
<PB N="340" REF="187"/>
<HI>Ordain</HI> and <HI>Enact</HI> the same. And which is more if you shall find any <HI>Acts of Parliament</HI>▪ seeming to pass under the Name and Authority of the <HI>King only,</HI> as there be some that have that shew indeed; yet you must not by and by judge that it was established <HI>without the Assent of the other</HI> Estates.</Q></P>
<P>As for the rest of your Insinuations, rather than Arguments against the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of those Expressions, <HI>Be it Enacted by Authority of Parlia∣ment,</HI> or <HI>Be it Enacted by the King, Lords and Commons</HI>; which bear so hard upon you, to prove that these <HI>last</HI> have a <HI>share</HI> in the <HI>Legislative,</HI> that they were introduced in the Reigns of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and VII. two U∣surpers, and but in the <HI>Nonage</HI> of the former, I think I shall be able to shew you that you are very much out in your account, for I will shew you much <HI>ancienter Authorities,</HI> wherein the <HI>same words</HI> or others equi∣valent have been used in our <HI>ancient Statutes.</HI> And first pray call to mind the Statute of <HI>Measures</HI> already recited, where it is said, <HI>That by the Con∣sent of the whole Realm of</HI> England, <HI>the Measure of our Soveraign Lord the King was thus made, &amp;c.</HI> which certainly must mean the <HI>Assent</HI> of <HI>all the Estates</HI> assembled in Parliament. And my Lord <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> tells us in his <HI>Third Institutes</HI> of an <HI>ancienter Record</HI> that he had seen of the 7<HI>th.</HI> of this King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 27.</NOTE> wherein it was <HI>En∣acted by the King, the Lords Spiritual, Temporal and Commons.</HI> But since I have given you Presidents enough of Statutes which are said to be made or ordained, <HI>by the King with the Assent of Lords Spiritual and Tem∣poral, and Commons</HI>; I will shew you one, where the King is not at all mentioned; and that is in <HI>Rastal</HI>'s Statutes, 4 <HI>Hen.</HI> 4▪ <HI>cap.</HI> 24. concern∣ing <HI>Aulnage of Clothes,</HI> wherein it is said, <HI>to be ordained, and accorded by the said Parliament,</HI> without any mention at all of the <HI>King.</HI> And to let you see that these fatal words you except against were in use before the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. pray see 9 <HI>Hen.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 4. <HI>concerning</HI> the <HI>Misprision of Clerk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in writing,</HI> which runs thus, <HI>The King hath now declared, and or∣dained by Authority of this Present Parliament that the Iustices, &amp;c.</HI> which must certainly refer to the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> unless you can make the <HI>King alone</HI> to carry the <HI>whole Parliament</HI> in his own person. But whereas that Phrase had began from <HI>Vsurpation</HI> it would have been first found in the Statutes of <HI>Henry</HI> the 4<HI>th.</HI> But to let you see that <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th.</HI> tho no Usurper, yet did not think that these words did abate any thing of his <HI>Royal Prerogative,</HI> pray see in the 4<HI>th.</HI> of that King, <HI>Cap.</HI> 1. where∣in it is recited, <HI>That the King by the advice, assen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, request and authority of the Lords Spiritual and Temporall, and Commons in Parliament assembled hath ordained and established</HI>: But <HI>that by Assent of Parliament, and by Authority of Parliament,</HI> is all one and the same, since the <HI>Assent</HI> of Parliament makes its <HI>Authority</HI>; Pray see the express Judgment in this point of the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Crew,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 104.</NOTE> and Justice <HI>Doderidge</HI> given in the Great case of the Earldom of <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> reported in Judge <HI>Iokes</HI>'s Reports.</P>
<P>To conclude, tho I do not deny His Majesties <HI>Negative Vote</HI> to <HI>all Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> yet this <HI>Prerogative</HI> can be concluded only from his giving
<PB N="341" REF="187"/>
his <HI>last Assent</HI> to a Law, for when a Bill begins from himself, the <HI>two Houses</HI> have likewise a <HI>Negative</HI> upon him, which is evident, in an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Pardon,</HI> which proceeds from the <HI>King</HI> first, and sent down to the <HI>Parlia∣ment,</HI> this neither the <HI>Lords</HI> nor <HI>Commons</HI> can <HI>add,</HI> or <HI>alter</HI> one tittl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to; yet may they notwithstanding his <HI>prior Asent,</HI> refuse the <HI>whole Bill</HI> if they please; tho already past under the <HI>Great Seal.</HI> And tho I likewise grant, that it is the <HI>Le Roy le Veult,</HI> that by yielding the highest, and last Assent gives the <HI>Enacting force</HI> to the <HI>Law,</HI> and thus the King may in a <HI>Logical sense</HI> be said thereby to make the Laws according to that known Maxim, <HI>Quod dat formam, dat esse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ei</HI>; Yet this does not hinder but in a <HI>Legal sense</HI> ac∣cording to the express declaration of our old Lawyers, and Acts of Par∣liament, the <HI>Laws</HI> owe their <HI>obligation</HI> to the <HI>joint consent</HI> of <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Parliament,</HI> and his giving his <HI>last assent,</HI> or <HI>form</HI> to the <HI>Law,</HI> no more proves his <HI>sole Legislative Power</HI> than it would do, that of the <HI>Lords</HI> or <HI>Commons,</HI> if either of them by the <HI>Constitution</HI> of the <HI>Government</HI> were to give their <HI>Asents last</HI> thereunto. So that I think upon the whole matter, no man can reasonably deny but that <HI>Legally</HI> the <HI>Two Houses</HI> of Parliament have also <HI>their share</HI> not only in <HI>framing,</HI> but <HI>Enacting</HI> of all Bills that shall pass; for otherwise they would signifie no more than the <HI>Committee</HI> of <HI>Estates</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>England</HI> in relation to <HI>Ireland</HI>; the former of which <HI>draws up</HI> all Bills that are to pass in the <HI>Parliament</HI> of that <HI>Kingdom</HI>; and the latter must <HI>approve</HI> or <HI>reject</HI> all Bills that shall pass in the Parliament of <HI>Ireland</HI>: Whereas the <HI>Authority</HI> of our <HI>Parliament</HI> consists in their <HI>consenting</HI> to, and <HI>Enacting</HI> together with the <HI>King</HI> all Sta∣tutes whatsoever. And this Distinction I think may very well reconcile <HI>Bracton,</HI> with <HI>Fortescue,</HI> the former of which says, <HI>Quod leges ligant suum L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>torem</HI> (meaning the King) and the latter (in the place I have already cited) affirms, that the <HI>People</HI> are governed by those Laws, <HI>quas ipse fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> which they themselves make; and this I think is to ascribe to the <HI>King</HI> as <HI>much Power</HI> as is requisite to a <HI>Civil Soveraign,</HI> and yet to leave a <HI>suf∣ficient share</HI> to the <HI>People</HI> to secure themselves from <HI>Tyranny.</HI></P>

<P>I must beg your pardon if I cannot be satisfied with your <HI>division</HI> of the <HI>Legislative Power</HI> beiween the <HI>King</HI> and the <HI>Two Houses</HI> of Parlia∣ment, since it is against the sense of our old Lawyers <HI>Glanville</HI> and <HI>Bra∣cton,</HI> who as you your self confess make the <HI>King</HI> the <HI>Sole Legislator.</HI> And tho I confess <HI>Fortescue</HI> gives the <HI>People</HI> a <HI>share</HI> in it, yet he is but a <HI>Mo∣dern Author</HI> in comparison of the other two, and writ to support the <HI>V∣surped Title</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth. So that I cannot comprehend how the <HI>Two Houses</HI> can have <HI>any share</HI> (properly speaking) in the <HI>Legislative Pow∣er,</HI> without falling into that old error of making the <HI>King one of the three Estates,</HI> and so <HI>co-ordinate</HI> with the other <HI>two</HI> whereas; if the King be a <HI>Monarch,</HI> that signifies in <HI>Greek</HI> the Government of <HI>one person,</HI> where∣as by giving the <HI>Two Houses</HI> a part in the <HI>Legislative,</HI> you divide it into <HI>three several shares.</HI> Whereas there is so <HI>close</HI> a <HI>conjunction</HI> between <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Parts</HI> of <HI>Soveraign Power</HI>▪ that the <HI>one</HI> cannot be <HI>separated</HI> from the <HI>other,</HI> but it will <HI>destroy</HI> the <HI>form</HI> of the Government, and only set up an <HI>Irregular Commonwealth</HI> in its place, which will scarce be able to hold

long together, without falling into <HI>perpetual quarrels,</HI> and disputes a∣bout the <HI>Encroachments</HI> upon each other's <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Priviledges.</HI></P>
<P>But it appears as well by the whole Tenor of our <HI>Laws,</HI> as also by divers <HI>Express Statutes,</HI> that the <HI>King</HI> is the <HI>Sole Supream,</HI> or conse∣quently the <HI>Sole Legislative Power</HI>: The first of these I shall prove from the common Indictments of Treason, Murder, Felony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which run always, <HI>Encounter la Corone, &amp; la dignitie de Roy,</HI> and the Process against such Offences, are called the <HI>Pleas of the Crown</HI>; because they are against the <HI>Crown</HI> and <HI>Dignity</HI> of the <HI>King.</HI> So that it is not the <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> which is <HI>Violated,</HI> but the <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, this Opinion is contrary to the <HI>express Declaration</HI> of divers of those <HI>very Parliaments,</HI> which you pretend have <HI>Exercised</HI> a <HI>Share</HI> in the <HI>Legislative</HI>: For you cannot deny, that many of our <HI>Ancient</HI> as well as <HI>Modern</HI> Statutes, were made and drawn up in the <HI>Form</HI> of a <HI>Petition</HI> from the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> or both of them to the <HI>King.</HI> And it is very strange, that <HI>one Fellow</HI> in the <HI>Supream Power,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid p.</HI> 32.</NOTE> should so humbly Petition the <HI>other.</HI> But 2. Though time hath altered the <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Petitioning</HI> into <HI>Bills,</HI> yet both <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> have bin often used to call the King, <HI>Our Dread Soveraign, Our Soveraign Lord, Our Liege Lord,</HI> and the like, and to Stile themselves, <HI>We your Majesty's most Humble and Faithful Sub∣jects,</HI> or <HI>most Dutiful and Obedient Subjects</HI>; and in that Humble Stile, to <HI>beseech</HI> him to <HI>Enact</HI> such and such things, which sure they could have done <HI>alone,</HI> had they bin <HI>Co-ordinate</HI> with him in Law-making: Lastly, if they were <HI>Co-partners</HI> with him in the <HI>Supream Power,</HI> how came they to declare (as they did in the <HI>Preamble</HI> to the Statute of the 25th. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. which you your self have quoted) <HI>that the Realm of England</HI> is an Empire, Governed by one <HI>Supream Head</HI> and <HI>King,</HI> unto whom the <HI>Body Politick</HI> of the Nation, Compacted of <HI>several Sorts</HI> and <HI>Degrees</HI> of <HI>People,</HI> divi∣ded in Terms of <HI>Temporality</HI> and <HI>Spirituality,</HI> owe and bear next unto God, a <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Humble Obedience</HI>? Now how came they here far∣ther to declare this <HI>Supream Head of the Clergy</HI> and <HI>Laity</HI> to be furnished <HI>with Plenary, Whole and En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire Power by the Goodness and Sufferance of Al∣mighty God.</HI> Certainly they can have <HI>no share</HI> in it, if it be <HI>Plenary, Wholy,</HI> and <HI>Entirely in him,</HI> or how came they in the 1st. Statute of Queen <HI>Eliz. c.</HI> 7. (being a <HI>Recognition</HI> of the Queens <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>premacy</HI>) to ac∣knowledge that <HI>all Power Temporal</HI> and <HI>Spiritual,</HI> was Deducted from her, <HI>as the Supream Head, and that they were her most Faithful and Obedi∣ent Subjects,</HI> and that they did in Parliament Represent <HI>the Three Estates of this Realm,</HI> and that <HI>She was the only Supream Governour thereof</HI>: Which was pursuant to a Statute to the same purpose, in the 2d <HI>Ed.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 2. wherein it is declared, <HI>That all Authority of Iurisdiction Spiritual and Temporal, is divided and Deducted from the Kings Majesty, as Supream Head of these Churches and Realms.</HI> Not to mention the <HI>Oath of Supremacy</HI> it self, <HI>That the King or Queen's Highness is the only Supream Governour of this Realm</HI>: Which these Statutes would never have acknowledged, had it

<P>I thank you Sir, and I desire I may answer what you have now said, before you pass to another Head, for I doubt the time will not give us leave to Discourse much further on this Subject to Night. In the first place therefore, I must tell you, that the <HI>main Foundation</HI> of your last Arguments, is founded upon a <HI>Supposition,</HI> which I altogether disown, <HI>viz. Co-ordination</HI> or <HI>Division</HI> of the <HI>Soveraign Power,</HI> between the <HI>King,</HI> and the <HI>Two Houses.</HI> For I have always supposed, that the <HI>King</HI> con∣tinues still <HI>Supream,</HI> and that (as the <HI>Modus tenendi Parliamentum declares</HI>) He is <HI>Principium, Caput &amp; Finis Parliamenti</HI>; that is, he can <HI>call and Dissolve</HI> Parliaments when he pleases; and likewise, that the <HI>Executiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> part</HI> of the Government, rests <HI>solely</HI> in Him, as also the <HI>Power</HI> of ma∣king <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI>: And even in the <HI>Legislative</HI> it self, that the <HI>King</HI> hath more eminently (though <HI>together</HI> with the <HI>Parliament</HI>) a <HI>Supream Enacting Power,</HI> without which, it cannot be a <HI>Law.</HI> This being consi∣dered, you will find, that here is <HI>no Division</HI> of the <HI>Legislative Power</HI>: Since neither the <HI>King,</HI> nor the <HI>Two Houses,</HI> have it <HI>Solely</HI> and <HI>Com∣pleatly</HI> in themselves; but it is <HI>joyntly</HI> Executed by them <HI>all three,</HI> as one <HI>Entire Politick Body</HI> or <HI>Person.</HI> So that neither can <HI>they</HI> make any Law <HI>without</HI> him, nor <HI>He</HI> Enact any <HI>without</HI> their <HI>Consent</HI>; and he by giving his <HI>Consent last,</HI> gives it the <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Sanction</HI> of a Law, and he is there∣in the <HI>Supream, i. e.</HI> the <HI>Last,</HI> or <HI>Vltimate Power</HI> (in the true Sense of that word) nay, the <HI>only Supream Power,</HI> unless you could suppose <HI>two Supreams,</HI> that is, <HI>two Highest Powers</HI> at once in the same Kingdom: But that for all this, the <HI>Two Houses</HI> are not <HI>Subject</HI> to the King in matters relating to <HI>Legislature,</HI> may hence farther appear, that the <HI>King</HI> cannot <HI>Command</HI> them to give him <HI>what Mony,</HI> or to pass <HI>what Laws</HI> he pleases: Since if he should go about to do so, they might (as I suppose, you your self will grant) <HI>Lawfully</HI> Disobey him; which they could not do without <HI>Apparent Disloyalty,</HI> and High Disobedience, were they in this, as they are in other indifferent things, <HI>Subject</HI> to his Commands, when <HI>Legally</HI> issued.</P>
<P>But to return you a more particular Answer, to what you have said to prove the <HI>King</HI> to have the <HI>Sole Legislative Power</HI> As to what you pretended I have quoted out of <HI>Glanville,</HI> if you please better to con∣sider of it, you will not find, that he gives the <HI>King</HI> any more than an <HI>En∣acting Power, together</HI> with his <HI>Great Council.</HI> For though he tells us, <HI>quod Principi placet, Legis habet vigorem</HI>; yet mark what follows; <HI>eas Scilicet quas super dubijs in consilio definiendis Procerum quidem consilio, &amp; Principis antecedente A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thoritate consta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> esse promulgatas.</HI> Where by the last <HI>consilio</HI> is meant, some what more than <HI>meer Advice,</HI> as I have alrea∣dy
<PB N="344" REF="189"/>
proved. But as for <HI>Bracton,</HI> it is true he agrees with <HI>Glanville,</HI> in making the <HI>Kings Authority,</HI> necessary to the <HI>Essence</HI> of a <HI>Law</HI>: Yet he is <HI>more express</HI> than the other in making the <HI>Advice</HI> and <HI>Consent</HI> of the <HI>Great Council</HI> or Common-wealth, also <HI>necessary</HI> to its being, as you may re∣member by these words, <HI>Cum Legis vigorem habeat quicquid de C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsilio &amp; de consensu Magnatum, &amp; Reipublicae communi Sponsione, Authoritate Prin∣cipis praecedente, juste fueri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> definitum.</HI></P>
<P>But further to let you see, how much you are out in your Argument, whereby you would prove from the <HI>Form</HI> of our <HI>Indictments</HI> of Treason, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That the <HI>King</HI> hath the <HI>Sole Legislative Power</HI> of the Kingdom. I shall shew you, that all our <HI>Ancient Laws,</HI> as well <HI>Common</HI> as <HI>Sta∣tute,</HI> do declare the contrary: Since <HI>divers A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts</HI> of Parliament have ex∣presly affirmed, that such and such Offences were <HI>Trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> not <HI>only</HI> a∣gainst the <HI>King,</HI> but against the King and the <HI>whole Realm</HI> too; Pray take these instances, see the Statute 1 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 1. Wherein <HI>Hugh de Spencer, both the Father and Son, are by the King and Parliament declared Traitors and Enemies of the King, and of his Realm</HI>: See likewise 28 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 7. Wherein the Crown is setled by Act of Parliament, <HI>on the Heirs of his Body, begotten on Queen</HI> Jane, <HI>or by any other after Marriage, and that the Offenders that shall interrupt such Heirs in their Peaceable Succession, they with their Abbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tors, Maintainers,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>shall be declared and adjudged, High Traytors to the Realm.</HI> And therefore divers <HI>Ancient Indictments</HI> in <HI>Stanfords</HI> Pleas of the Crown are laid <HI>contra pacem Regis &amp; Regni.</HI> And that the <HI>Parliament</HI> hath <HI>reserved</HI> to it self a <HI>Power,</HI> by the Statute of the 25th. of <HI>Edw.</HI> 3d. to Determine what Crime shall be Adjudged Treason, besides Conspiring to kill the King, and those other Offences specified in the same Statute; you may Consult the Statute at large. But that these <HI>Offences</HI> can be <HI>no other</HI> than an endeavour to <HI>alter the Govern∣ment,</HI> or <HI>Fundamental Laws</HI> of the Kingdom, I think is evident, since all Offences relating to the Lives, or Honour of the King, Queen, and their Eldest Son are there particularly specified, and it was by Virtue of this Statute, that the Late unfortunate Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> was first <HI>im∣peached</HI> by the <HI>Commons,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Attainted</HI> by <HI>Act of Parliamen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> in the Year 1641. but whether justly or not, it is not my Business now to determine, it is sufficient that it was then granted by the <HI>King him∣self,</HI> that if the Earl was really <HI>Guilty</HI> of <HI>Destroying</HI> the <HI>Government,</HI> and Introducing an <HI>Arbitrary Power,</HI> he might have bin deservedly Con∣demned.</P>
<P>But that the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Making</HI> and <HI>Dispensing</HI> with Laws, is particu∣larly applyed, not only to the <HI>King,</HI> but to the <HI>Lords Spiritual, Tem∣poral</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> pray remember the Preamble of the Statute I have already cited of the 25th. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 21. wherein it is so expresly decla∣red, as also by the 24th. of this King. <HI>Chap.</HI> 12. the Preface of which Statute, runs thus: <HI>And whereas the Kings most</HI> Noble Progenitors, and the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> of the said Realm, at divers an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sundry Par∣liaments, as well in the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> 1st. <HI>Edward</HI> 3d. <HI>Richard</HI> 2d. <HI>Henry</HI> 4th. <HI>&amp;c. made</HI> sundry <HI>Ordinances, Laws,</HI> Statutes and Provi∣sions,
<PB N="345" REF="189"/>
for the entire and sure Conservation of the Prerogatives, Li∣berties and Preheminences of the said Imperial Crown of this Realm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where pray note, that the making of all these Statutes, is as∣cribed to the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> as well as to the <HI>King</HI>: Which is also farther acknowledged by the said King <HI>Henry,</HI> when in a Set Speech to the Parliament, Reported by <HI>Crompton</HI> (in the Case of Errours) he said these words, <HI>We being informed by our Iudges, that We at no time stand so highly in our Estate Royal, as in the time of Parliament, wherein, we as Head, and you as Members, are Conjoyned and knit together into one Body Politick.</HI> And sure then, if the King's <HI>Simile</HI> be true, whatsoe∣ver <HI>Functions</HI> are performed by the <HI>whole Body,</HI> must be done by the Mem∣bers, as well as by the <HI>Head.</HI> I shall Sum up all I have said into this Syllo∣gism, That <HI>Power</HI> which cannot make or <HI>Enact</HI> any <HI>new Law,</HI> without the <HI>Advice</HI> and <HI>Consent</HI> of <HI>two other</HI> Bodies, is <HI>not</HI> the <HI>Sole Legislative Power.</HI> But the <HI>King</HI> is that <HI>Power which cannot,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Ergo,</HI> the <HI>King is not the Sole Legislative Power.</HI></P>

<P>I shall not longer Dispute this Question with you: Since I own the <HI>two Houses</HI> have Claimed for some Ages past, a <HI>Share</HI> in the <HI>Legislative,</HI> tho' in a <HI>large</HI> and <HI>improper Sense,</HI> as you your self do partly grant: And though for the more just and equal Course, our Kings have for a long time admitted the 3 <HI>Estates, viz.</HI> the <HI>Lords Spiritual, Temporal</HI> and <HI>Com∣mons,</HI> into a <HI>seeming Share</HI> of the <HI>Legislative Power</HI>: Yet this was not by <HI>Constraint,</HI> nor by any <HI>Fundamental Constitution</HI> of the Government, as you suppose; but only from their own <HI>meer Grace</HI> and <HI>Favour,</HI> to make <HI>Laws</HI> by the <HI>Consent</HI> of the <HI>whole Realm,</HI> because that <HI>no one part</HI> thereof, should have any Cause to <HI>complain</HI> of <HI>partiality</HI>: And though I grant the <HI>King</HI> is bound to observe these Laws when made, by vertue of his <HI>Coronation-Oath,</HI> so as that he cannot <HI>alter</HI> them <HI>without their Consent,</HI> yet is he still <HI>above the Law,</HI> by Virtue of his <HI>Absolute Monarchical Power,</HI> and is not <HI>Subordinate</HI> to it, or so bound by it, as to be <HI>Responsible</HI> to the <HI>People,</HI> for any <HI>Breach</HI> committed by him upon it; for that were <HI>Dero∣gatory</HI> to the <HI>Soveraign Power,</HI> and <HI>inconsistent</HI> with the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Mo∣narchy</HI>; and were to set up the <HI>Law</HI> (which is but a <HI>Creature</HI> of the <HI>Prince</HI>'s <HI>making</HI>) above his <HI>Soveraign Authority</HI>: And this would make our <HI>Monarchy,</HI> a Kind of Government which would <HI>neither</HI> be <HI>Monar∣chical,</HI> nor yet a <HI>Republic,</HI> but some <HI>Mungrel</HI> thing made up of <HI>both.</HI> So that I take the <HI>Notion</HI> of a <HI>mixt Monarchy,</HI> to be a Contradiction <HI>in ad∣jecto</HI>: A <HI>limited Monarchy</HI> I confess there may be either by the Mo∣narch's own <HI>Voluntary Grant</HI> or <HI>Consent,</HI> as in this Kingdom, or else on <HI>Conditions</HI> imposed upon a Prince by others, either by a <HI>Foreign Power,</HI> as in <HI>Tributary</HI> and <HI>Feudatary</HI> Kingdoms, or else by the <HI>Natives</HI> of the same Country, as in some <HI>Elective Kingdoms</HI> and Principalities; but then such <HI>Limitations</HI> of Monarchical Power, represent a Prince as it were fet∣tered, and who <HI>cannot Act</HI> as he would, and ought for the <HI>Advantage</HI> and Wellfare of his <HI>People,</HI> if he had his Liberty, and the <HI>full Exercise</HI> of his <HI>Soveraign Power</HI>: And therefore in most Governments limited after this manner, the <HI>Soveraignty</HI> still remains in the <HI>Senate</HI> or <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ople</HI> that
<PB N="338" REF="190"/>
Elected him; which makes me think it <HI>Solecism</HI> in Politicks to affirm, that a <HI>Monarch</HI> (properly so called, and still continuing so) could be thus <HI>limited</HI> by <HI>Laws,</HI> or <HI>Fundamental Constitutions,</HI> as you call them at the <HI>first Institution</HI> of the Government: For if he were thus limited, <HI>that Power</HI> that could thus <HI>limit</HI> him, must be either <HI>Superior</HI> or <HI>Inferior</HI> to him. <HI>Superior</HI> it could not be, because both the <HI>Prince</HI> and the <HI>People</HI> that could put those <HI>Conditions</HI> or <HI>Limitations</HI> upon him, could not be his <HI>Superiors</HI> in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> before they made him <HI>King,</HI> neither could they be his <HI>Inferiors,</HI> because an <HI>Inferior Power,</HI> can never <HI>limit</HI> a <HI>Superiour</HI>: And since all our <HI>Laws,</HI> (as well as the <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance</HI> and <HI>Supremacy,</HI> we take to the King) do own him to be the <HI>Sole Supream Go∣vernour of this Realm</HI>; I cannot understand how this <HI>Limitation</HI> can con∣sist with the <HI>King's Supremacy</HI>; for if he be thus <HI>limited</HI> and <HI>restrained.</HI> how is he <HI>Supream,</HI> and if Restrained by <HI>some Law,</HI> is not the <HI>Power</HI> of that <HI>Law,</HI> and of <HI>them</HI> that made <HI>that Law, above</HI> his own <HI>Supream Power</HI>? And if by the Direction of such Law only he must Govern, where is his <HI>Supream Power</HI>? So that when the <HI>Law</HI> must Rule and Govern the <HI>Mo∣narch</HI> as a <HI>Superior,</HI> and not the <HI>Monarch</HI> the <HI>Law,</HI> he hath at best, but a <HI>Gubernative</HI> and <HI>Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cutive Power.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, if this <HI>Power</HI> of the Prince, were <HI>Limited</HI> at the <HI>Original Con∣stitution,</HI> there must be a <HI>Power</HI> appointed in some <HI>Council</HI> or <HI>Senate</HI> (call it a <HI>Parliament</HI> or <HI>Assembly</HI> of the <HI>States,</HI> or by what Name you please) whose business it must be, to see them exactly kept and perform∣ed▪ Now these Men must either have a <HI>Power</HI> barely of <HI>Advising</HI> the Monarch, and perswading him to observe these <HI>Fundamental Limitations,</HI> or else they must also have a <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Forcing</HI> or <HI>Compelling him,</HI> if he will not hearken to their <HI>Advice</HI> and <HI>Remonstrances</HI>: if they have no more than the <HI>former Power,</HI> that you say, signifies nothing, since the King may refute to hearken to them if he pleases, and may do what he will notwithstanding; but if they have also a <HI>Coercive Power</HI> over him, and may <HI>Resist</HI> or punish him for his Transgressions, he will then cease to be a <HI>Monarch</HI>: Since he cannot be so, who is <HI>accountable</HI> to any <HI>Power,</HI> either <HI>Equal</HI> or <HI>Superior</HI> to himself; And this our late Parliaments have bin well aware of, when they <HI>Renounced</HI> all <HI>Coercive Power</HI> over the Person of the <HI>King,</HI> and any <HI>Right</HI> of making <HI>War,</HI> either <HI>Offensive</HI> or <HI>Defensive</HI> a∣gainst him: So that besides the History of matter of Fact, which I can further give you, to prove, our <HI>Kings</HI> to have bin at first <HI>Absolute Mo∣narchs</HI>: I think the very <HI>Hypothesis</HI> of a mixt or <HI>limited Monarchy</HI>▪ labours under such insuperable Difficulties and Absurdities, that I cannot con∣ceive how <HI>those Limitations</HI> by which we find the <HI>King's Prerogative</HI> now Restrained, could ever proceed from any <HI>Higher Cause,</HI> than the <HI>free Grants</HI> and <HI>Concessions</HI> of the <HI>Kings Predecessors,</HI> confirmed by his own <HI>Coronation-Oath</HI>: Which though I acknowledge, he is bound to observe, and that if he breaks it, he commits a great Sin against <HI>God</HI>: Yet it is only <HI>He,</HI> that must punish him for so doing, since the <HI>Oath</HI> is not made to the <HI>People,</HI> but to <HI>God alone.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding what you have now said, I hope I am able to shew you, that all your Arguments against a <HI>Mixt</HI> or <HI>Limited Mo∣narchy,</HI> are more subtile than true: For as to your first Argument from the word Monarch, I grant indeed, that strictly speaking, the Word <HI>Monarch</HI> and <HI>Monarchy,</HI> signifie a <HI>single Ruler,</HI> and the Government of <HI>one alone</HI>: Yet in Common Acceptation, or according to the <HI>Laws,</HI> and <HI>Constitutions</HI> of several other Kingdoms, besides <HI>England,</HI> as in the Em∣pire, in <HI>Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> the Emperor, and those Kings have bin called <HI>Monarchs,</HI> and those Kingdoms <HI>Monarchies</HI>; though by the <HI>Ori∣ginal Constitution</HI> of those Governments, <HI>those Princes</HI> have not bin in∣vested with a <HI>pure Imperial Authority,</HI> such as that of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors of Old: Yet since they had the <HI>Executive</HI> and <HI>Gubernative part</HI> of the Government committed to them, and that they were lookt upon as the <HI>Heads</HI> of those Kingdoms, and that the <HI>Government</HI> did therein partake more of <HI>Monarchy,</HI> than of any <HI>other Form,</HI> those Princes have bin al∣ways reputed (and that justly) <HI>Monarchs,</HI> notwithstanding there was a very great mixture of <HI>Aristocracy</HI> in the Empire, and in <HI>Denmark,</HI> and both of <HI>Aristocracy</HI> and <HI>Democracy</HI> in <HI>Sweden.</HI> The like may be said of <HI>England, France,</HI> and those Kingdoms in <HI>Spain,</HI> that were instituted by the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> the <HI>Francs</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> after the Ancient <HI>Go∣thic Model</HI> of Government. And though I grant this sort of mixt Mo∣narchy, is not to be Reduced to any of the three distinct Kinds of Govern∣ment layd down by <HI>Aristotle,</HI> yet are they not for all that, to be Condem∣ned, but rather the more approved of, since by <HI>this mixture,</HI> they were capable of <HI>diverse Benefits,</HI> and free from <HI>several Mischiefs,</HI> which are incident to any of those Forms of <HI>Monarchy, Aristocracy</HI> or <HI>Democracy,</HI> when exercised <HI>purely,</HI> and without any such <HI>mixture</HI>: And that this, as to <HI>England</HI> it self, is no Invention of the <HI>Common-Wealth-Men</HI> (as you call them) you may read King <HI>Charles</HI> the 1st's Answer to the 19 Propositions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 96.</NOTE> sent him by the Parliament, for the words are Remarkable. <HI>This Kingdom, says he, is mixt of Monarchical Aristocratical, and Democratical Government, and that so wisely, that we have all the Conveniences, and none of the Inconvenien∣ces of any of those Forms taken single.</HI></P>
<P>Nor doth this at all <HI>Derogate</HI> from the Nature of the <HI>Monarchy,</HI> nor make any <HI>Division</HI> between the <HI>necessary Functions</HI> of Soveraign Power: For I have already granted, that the <HI>executive</HI> or gubernative part, is <HI>wholy</HI> in him, as also the <HI>Power</HI> of making <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI>; and as for the <HI>Legislative,</HI> as long as the <HI>King</HI> hath a <HI>Negative</HI> Vote in all Laws that pass, and that they cannot be made without his <HI>Royal Sanction,</HI> the <HI>Legislative Power</HI> is not divided, as I have already proved.</P>
<P>But as for your other Argument against a Prince's being <HI>limited</HI> by the <HI>Original Constitution</HI> of Government, tho as I yield it is more <HI>Subtile,</HI> so it is also more <HI>Sophistical</HI> and fallacious than the <HI>former.</HI> For your <HI>Dilemma,</HI> by which you would prove the Absurdity of that Nation, will not do, because a <HI>Prince</HI> at the <HI>Institution</HI> of the Government, may be <HI>limited</HI> by those who are neither <HI>Superior,</HI> nor <HI>Inferior</HI> to himself:

but only <HI>equal</HI> in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> as I suppose the <HI>People</HI> to be with a <HI>King,</HI> before he was <HI>made</HI> so by them; And that <HI>Equals</HI> may thus <HI>limit</HI> each other, you your self will not (I suppose) deny in the Case of <HI>Princes,</HI> who are <HI>Equals</HI> in the <HI>State of Nature</HI>: As Queen <HI>Ma∣ry</HI> (for Example) made such conditions with King <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> before she Marryed him, that if he offered to meddle with the <HI>Government</HI> of this Kingdom, <HI>without</HI> her <HI>Consent,</HI> it would be <HI>Lawful</HI> for her to <HI>part</HI> herself from him, and to send him <HI>home</HI> into his own Kingdom; and might she not with a <HI>Safe Conscience,</HI> have done so upon the <HI>Breach</HI> of the <HI>Conditions</HI> on his side? Apply this to the <HI>People</HI> in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> and the person they are about to make <HI>King</HI> before the <HI>Politick Marri∣age</HI> of a <HI>Coronation</HI> or <HI>Admission</HI> to the Crown, and see if they do not exactly agree, or whether the <HI>People</HI> can be blam'd, if they <HI>repudiate</HI> their <HI>Politick Husband,</HI> for <HI>Invading</HI> that <HI>part</HI> of the Government, which they had <HI>reserved</HI> to themselves? Nor doth this argue any <HI>more Superio∣rity</HI> in the <HI>People,</HI> over the <HI>King</HI> in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> than it doth for a <HI>Creditor</HI> in the like State, to <HI>compel</HI> by force, his <HI>Debtor</HI> to pay him a <HI>Sum of Money</HI> which he owed him, in case there were no <HI>Civil Iurisdiction</HI> for him to Appeal to. And let us farther suppose, a <HI>Coun∣cil</HI> or <HI>Parliament</HI> appointed, who may <HI>Remonstrate</HI> to the <HI>King</HI> his Trans∣gressions, or <HI>Violations</HI> of the Law: Yet this may be without any <HI>Coer∣cive Power</HI> over his Person, or of <HI>making War</HI> upon him; since the <HI>King</HI> may, if he please, remedy all these Disorders, by <HI>Redressing</HI> their <HI>Grievances,</HI> and <HI>punishing</HI> the <HI>Authors</HI> of them. So if he will <HI>wilfully persist</HI> in such <HI>Violations,</HI> as strike at the <HI>Fundamental Constitution</HI> of the Government, and do also go about to <HI>execute</HI> them upon the <HI>People</HI> by <HI>force,</HI> this being in effect, a <HI>making War</HI> upon them; I suppose they have then a <HI>just Right</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> themselves against his <HI>Tyranny.</HI> So that if these <HI>Rights</HI> or <HI>Priviledges</HI> we now enjoy, were not the <HI>meer Concessions</HI> of the <HI>King's Grace</HI> and favour, as you affirm, but <HI>reserved</HI> as <HI>part</HI> of their <HI>Birth-Right,</HI> at the <HI>Original Constitution</HI> of the Government (as I shall prove all our <HI>Fundamental Laws</HI> were) the <HI>People</HI> have then as <HI>much Right</HI> to <HI>defend</HI> them (their <HI>Allegiance</HI> to him being upon that <HI>Con∣dition,</HI> either <HI>express</HI> or <HI>imply'd</HI>) as any <HI>other Nation</HI> hath to <HI>defend</HI> their <HI>Lives, Liberties</HI> and <HI>Properties,</HI> against the <HI>Violence</HI> of the <HI>Supream Pow∣ers,</HI> or any <HI>Commissioned</HI> by them, as I hope I have already proved to you: So that notwithstanding all that you have said to the Contrary, I think the <HI>Notion</HI> of a <HI>mixt</HI> or <HI>limited Monarchy</HI> in the very <HI>institution,</HI> may be <HI>agreeable</HI> to Reason and <HI>practicable</HI> too, either in this or any other Kingdom: And when you can prove the contrary by History, or Matter of Fact, as you promise, I will give up the Cause.</P>

<P>You have <HI>Broached</HI> a parcel of <HI>Special Common-Wealth Notions,</HI> in which you are every way out: As first, in making the <HI>King's Authority</HI> de∣rived, either <HI>from,</HI> or <HI>by,</HI> the <HI>Peoples Consent</HI>: Whereas all our <HI>Ancient Lawyers</HI> call him <HI>God's Vicar</HI> or <HI>Lieutenant</HI> on Earth, and not the <HI>Peo∣ple's</HI>; and in the next place, in supposing he may be <HI>Resisted</HI> by <HI>Force of Arms,</HI> whenever the <HI>People</HI> shall think themselves <HI>Opprest,</HI> or their <HI>Fun∣damental
<PB N="349" REF="191"/>
Rights</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> as you call them <HI>invaded,</HI> it is contrary to the <HI>Express Declaration</HI> of the <HI>Parliament,</HI> by two serveral <HI>Statutes,</HI> in the 2d. Year of the late King <HI>Charles</HI>: And though you disclaim all <HI>Coercive Power</HI> of the <HI>two Houses</HI> over the <HI>King,</HI> yet it is only to place <HI>this Right</HI> of <HI>Resistance</HI> in a more <HI>fallible</HI> and <HI>ungovernable</HI> Body, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>whole People</HI> in their <HI>Natural Capacities,</HI> which as it is more <HI>consistent</HI> with your <HI>Principles,</HI> so it is more <HI>dangerous</HI> to all <HI>Supream Powers,</HI> as well <HI>Common-Wealths,</HI> as <HI>Monarchies,</HI> as I have partly shewed you already; and I hope may farther convince you, before I have done. But since I have not now time to shew you the <HI>falsity</HI> and <HI>absurdity</HI> of these <HI>Notions,</HI> and to urge the Statute at large, against <HI>Resistance in any Case Whatsoever</HI>: I pray go on in the Method you have proposed, and let me see how you can make out, that even our <HI>Parliaments</HI> do not <HI>derive</HI> that <HI>Priviledge</HI> they now enjoy of giving their <HI>consent</HI> to <HI>Laws,</HI> as also their <HI>very being,</HI> to the <HI>Gracious Concessions</HI> of our former <HI>Monarchs.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I shall do with all my Heart: But first let me tell you, that though I own the <HI>King</HI> to be <HI>God's Lieutenant</HI> in these his Dominions: Yet I must likewise aver, that it was <HI>only</HI> by the <HI>Consent</HI> and <HI>Voluntary Submis∣sion</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> of this Nation, that the <HI>first Monarch</HI> (begin where you will) could obtain that <HI>Title.</HI> And as for those <HI>Statutes</HI> you mention <HI>against all Resistance in any Case Whatsoever,</HI> I doubt not but to shew you, that it was never the <HI>intent</HI> of that <HI>Parliament,</HI> to <HI>debar</HI> us from all <HI>neces∣sary Resistance,</HI> and <HI>Self-defence</HI> in cases of <HI>illegal Violence,</HI> and <HI>intollera∣ble Oppression</HI>; unless you can suppose, they were resolved to <HI>alter</HI> the <HI>Government,</HI> and to put it into the <HI>King's Power,</HI> to <HI>destroy</HI> all our <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Liberties</HI>; and instead of a <HI>Lawful King,</HI> to Set up for a <HI>Lawless Ty∣rant,</HI> when ever he pleased.</P>
<P>But to come to the matter in Hand, I shall shew you that it is not at all <HI>impossible</HI> or <HI>improbable,</HI> that without any <HI>hinderance</HI> of that <HI>Power,</HI> which is <HI>necessary</HI> to the <HI>King</HI> as <HI>Supream,</HI> that he might for all that,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. T. M. h.</HI> 3.</NOTE> have bin <HI>limited</HI> as to the <HI>Legislative,</HI> at the <HI>first Institution</HI> of the Government, which I shall thus make out.</P>
<P>I do therefore in the first place suppose, that the <HI>English Saxons</HI> being a <HI>free People,</HI> after their <HI>Conquest</HI> of this Island, as well <HI>Nobles,</HI> as <HI>Commons</HI> did agree by their <HI>free consents,</HI> and <HI>publick Compacts,</HI> to set over themselves a <HI>Prince</HI> or <HI>Soveraign,</HI> and to <HI>Resign</HI> up themselves to him, to be go∣verned by <HI>such</HI> and <HI>such Fundamental Laws: Here</HI> is a <HI>Supremacy</HI> of <HI>Pow∣er</HI> set up, though <HI>limited</HI> as to the <HI>manner</HI> of its <HI>Exercise.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Then because in all Governments <HI>after Cases</HI> will arise, requiring an <HI>Addition</HI> of <HI>Laws,</HI> suppose them <HI>Covenanting</HI> with their <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>veraign,</HI> that if there be <HI>any Cause</HI> to Constitute any <HI>New Laws,</HI> he shall not by his <HI>Sole Power,</HI> perform that Work; but that they will <HI>reserve</HI> in themselves, a <HI>Concurrent</HI> or <HI>Co-operative Power</HI>: So that they will be bound by <HI>no Laws,</HI> but what they <HI>joyn</HI> with him in the <HI>making of.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. I suppose, that though the <HI>Nobles</HI> may <HI>personally conven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:</HI> Yet since the <HI>Commons</HI> being so <HI>Numerous,</HI> cannot meet together in <HI>Person,</HI> there∣fore
<PB N="350" REF="192"/>
for the doing of this Work, it be <HI>agreed,</HI> that every <HI>City of Consi∣derable Town,</HI> should have <HI>Power</HI> to <HI>Depute</HI> one, or more to <HI>Act</HI> for the <HI>whole Body</HI> in the <HI>Legislature.</HI> That the <HI>Nobles</HI> by <HI>themselves</HI> in <HI>Person,</HI> and the <HI>Commons</HI> by their <HI>Deputies</HI> Assembling there, may be <HI>Representa∣tively</HI> the <HI>whole Body</HI> of the Kingdom, with <HI>Power</HI> to <HI>execute</HI> that <HI>Autho∣rity</HI> reserved for establishing <HI>new Laws.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Since the <HI>Occasion,</HI> and <HI>need</HI> of making <HI>such Laws,</HI> and Expound∣ing the <HI>Old</HI> Ones could not be constant and perpetual, therefore we may farther suppose, for the avoiding of the inconvenience of three standing <HI>Co-ordinate Powers,</HI> they did not Establish <HI>these Estates</HI> to be <HI>constantly</HI> existent, but <HI>occasionally,</HI> as the Causes for which they were <HI>ordained,</HI> should require.</P>
<P N="5">5. Because a <HI>Monarchy</HI> was <HI>intended,</HI> and therefore a <HI>Supremacy</HI> of <HI>Pow∣er</HI> (as far as was <HI>necessary</HI>) must be reserved in <HI>One,</HI> it was concluded, that <HI>these Estates</HI> should be still <HI>Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mblies of his Subjects,</HI> and Swearing Allegi∣ance to him; and that all <HI>New Laws,</HI> which by agreement of these Pow∣ers, should be <HI>Enacted,</HI> should run in <HI>his Name,</HI> and be called <HI>his Laws,</HI> and they all <HI>bound to obey him in them,</HI> when thus Establisht.</P>
<P>And Lastly, it being supposed, that <HI>He</HI> who thus was to <HI>govern by Law,</HI> and for the <HI>furtherance</HI> of whose Government such <HI>New Laws</HI> were to be <HI>made,</HI> should best understand when there was <HI>need</HI> of them; and that the <HI>Convening</HI> and <HI>Dissolving</HI> of the <HI>Assembly</HI> of the <HI>Estates,</HI> was a <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Great Trust,</HI> it was put into the <HI>Prince's</HI> Hands, by Writ to <HI>Convocate,</HI> as also to <HI>Prorogue</HI> or <HI>Dissolve</HI> such meetings. But in Process of time, some <HI>Princes</HI> not caring much to have their <HI>Government</HI> lookt into, or to have <HI>any Power</HI> in Being but their <HI>own,</HI> taking Advantage of this Power, of <HI>Assembling</HI> these Estates, did <HI>more seldom then need Required,</HI> make use of it: Whereupon <HI>provision</HI> was made, and a <HI>time</HI> set by <HI>New Statutes,</HI> within which, an <HI>Assembly</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> was to be held: Now when you have made these <HI>true Suppositions</HI> in your Mind, you have the very <HI>Mo∣del</HI> and History of <HI>this Monarchy,</HI> and we shall easily find, what to an∣swer to the <HI>Arguments</HI> before produced on either side. For first, it is <HI>his Parliament</HI>; because an <HI>Assembly</HI> of <HI>his Subjects</HI> Convocated by <HI>his Writ</HI> to be <HI>his Council,</HI> and to assist him in <HI>making Laws</HI> for him to govern by: Yet <HI>not his,</HI> as <HI>other Courts</HI> are, as deriving their <HI>whole Authority</HI> from the <HI>King.</HI> So likewise his <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Assembling</HI> and <HI>Dissolving</HI> them, proves him thus far <HI>above</HI> them; because, though as to the <HI>time</HI> of their <HI>meet∣ing,</HI> it depends on him; Yet their Power and Authority <HI>quoad Specificati∣onem, i. e.</HI> the Being, Kind and Exercise of it, is from the <HI>Original Con∣stitution.</HI> For as to that, they expect <HI>no Commission</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> from him; but only for their <HI>meeting,</HI> to proceed to <HI>Act,</HI> but when <HI>met,</HI> they <HI>Acts</HI> according to the <HI>Original Rights</HI> of their <HI>Constitution</HI>: and those Acts proceed from their <HI>Conjunct Authority</HI> with, not from their <HI>Subordination</HI> to, the <HI>King</HI> in the <HI>Legislative,</HI> as also in laying of <HI>Taxes, &amp;c.</HI> on the <HI>People.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Oath</HI> of <HI>Allegiance</HI> indeed binds them, as his <HI>Subjects</HI> to <HI>obey</HI> him, governing according to <HI>Establisht Laws</HI>: But yet it supposes them to be
<PB N="351" REF="192"/>
built upon the <HI>Foundations</HI> of his <HI>Legal Government,</HI> and must not be in∣terpreted to <HI>Vndermine</HI> and <HI>Destroy</HI> it. He is hereby acknowledged to be <HI>Supream,</HI> so far as to Rule them by <HI>Laws</HI> already made, or to be made, but not <HI>without</HI> them. So that this is <HI>no Derogation</HI> to the <HI>Legislative Power</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI>: And I believe of these things, no unprejudic'd Man can make any Question. And herein consists the accurate Judgment of the <HI>Contrivers</HI> of this Form, that they have given <HI>so much</HI> into the Hands of the <HI>Soveraign,</HI> as to make him <HI>truly a Monarch</HI>; Yet have <HI>re∣served</HI> so much in the hands of the <HI>People,</HI> as to enable them to <HI>preserve</HI> their <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Liberties.</HI></P>

<P>I confess you have given a long and plausible account of the <HI>Ori∣ginal</HI> and <HI>Form</HI> of our Government, though if it come to be examined, I doubt it will prove a <HI>meer Romance,</HI> and not at all agreeable to true History, or Matter of Fact: Since if we look to the <HI>Eldest times,</HI> either after the <HI>Saxon</HI> or <HI>Norman</HI> Conquests, We shall find the <HI>Power</HI> of our <HI>Kings,</HI> to have bin still <HI>more Absolute,</HI> then they are now; And I think I could easily <HI>trace the Steps,</HI> by which the <HI>People</HI> have <HI>attained</HI> to all the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> they now enjoy, which as I do not grudge the <HI>No∣bility</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of this Nation. Yet they ought to exercise it with a <HI>due respect</HI> and <HI>Subordination</HI> to that <HI>Power,</HI> from which they were all at first <HI>derived,</HI> least if they should <HI>ascribe</HI> them to <HI>themselves,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> should be tempted to <HI>destroy</HI> those <HI>Great Priviledges,</HI> and taking away the very <HI>Being</HI> of <HI>Parliaments,</HI> to make <HI>Laws without</HI> them.</P>
<P>But to shew you farther, that this Notion of an <HI>independent Power</HI> in the <HI>two Houses,</HI> by the <HI>Original Constitution of</HI> the Government, is alto∣gether <HI>inconsistent</HI> with the <HI>King's Prerogative,</HI> appears from clear Mat∣ter of Fact, even as you your self have put it; For when <HI>Kings</HI> thought fit not to have their <HI>Power Controuled,</HI> you acknowledge they called <HI>Par∣liaments,</HI> less frequently than usual; and that thereupon there were <HI>divers Laws</HI> made, appointing <HI>certain times</HI> for their <HI>meeting</HI>; from whence it appears, that before this, the <HI>times</HI> of their <HI>meeting,</HI> were <HI>wholy</HI> left to his <HI>Discretion.</HI> Nay farther, that the <HI>King's Prerogative</HI> of <HI>Assembling</HI> them, or <HI>omitting</HI> it when he pleases, cannot be <HI>limited</HI> by any Act <HI>him∣self</HI> can make, appears from hence, that notwithstanding all those Laws that have bin made for <HI>Annual</HI> and <HI>Triennual Parliaments,</HI> our Kings have never thought themselves <HI>obliged</HI> to call Parliaments, <HI>of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner</HI> than they saw their <HI>own occasions,</HI> or the <HI>necessities</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> (which they them∣selves were <HI>Sole Iudges</HI> of) required: Nor did any <HI>Parliaments</HI> ever find <HI>fault</HI> with this, till that <HI>Rebellious one</HI> in 1641. which had the confidence to present to the King a Bill to be past, whereby it was not only <HI>Enacted,</HI> that there should be a <HI>Parliament</HI> every <HI>third Year</HI>; but that upon the King's <HI>omitting</HI> to issue forth <HI>Writs</HI> of Summons, the <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> nay <HI>Con∣stables,</HI> might <HI>Summon</HI> the Free-holders, and proceed to <HI>Election,</HI> and that the <HI>Lords</HI> might also meet <HI>without</HI> any <HI>Writs</HI> from the King; which was quite <HI>contrary</HI> to the <HI>Original Constitution,</HI> by which (as you your self grant) there could be <HI>no Parliaments,</HI> without his <HI>Summons,</HI> he <HI>be∣ing Principium, Capus &amp; finis Parliament</HI>: And if so, it seems wholy
<PB N="352" REF="193"/>
<HI>improbable,</HI> nay <HI>impossible</HI> to me, that your <HI>Two Houses</HI> should have by the <HI>Original Constitution,</HI> any Power of <HI>meeting</HI> or <HI>doing</HI> any thing, <HI>with∣out</HI> his Majesties <HI>Consent</HI> and <HI>Allowance</HI>; and we know, that at this day, the <HI>Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aker</HI> in the Name of the <HI>House of Commons,</HI> desires of the King. <HI>Liberty of Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ech</HI>: And King <HI>Henry</HI> 8th. and Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> did some∣times <HI>Rebuke</HI> the <HI>House of Commons,</HI> and sent to them to <HI>Desist,</HI> when they were about to <HI>pass</HI> any Bill they did not <HI>approve of,</HI> or to <HI>meddle</HI> with those things, which did <HI>not belong</HI> to them: Which plainly declares, that (contrary to your Affection) <HI>neither</HI> of the <HI>Two Houses</HI> have any <HI>Power</HI> to <HI>proceed</HI> upon any <HI>Business,</HI> or to <HI>pass</HI> any Bill which the King <HI>disapproves</HI> of: And though I grant, that they do not ask the Kings leave for the <HI>bringing</HI> in, or <HI>Passing</HI> of all <HI>Bills</HI> whatsoever in <HI>either House,</HI> or that the <HI>King</HI> can command them to give him <HI>what Money,</HI> or pass <HI>what Bills</HI> he pleases; Yet this <HI>Priviledge</HI> must needs proceed from his <HI>Grant</HI> or <HI>Con∣cession</HI> to the contrary: Whereby, though he hath discharged them from an <HI>Active Obedience</HI> to such Commands; Yet hath he not thereby <HI>divested</HI> himself of any of the <HI>Essential Rights</HI> of <HI>Soveraignty,</HI> or at all <HI>discharged</HI> them from a <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> or Submission to his <HI>Power,</HI> supposing the worst that can happen, that he should take away <HI>what share</HI> he pleased of the <HI>Subjects Estates,</HI> without their <HI>Consent</HI>; or make his <HI>own Edicts,</HI> and <HI>Proclamations</HI> to be observed for <HI>Laws</HI>: Since the <HI>King's</HI> Authority is <HI>prior</HI> to all others, and that (as the Statutes of <HI>Edward</HI> the 6th. and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; which I have already quoted, expresly declare,) <HI>All Power, Authority and Iurisdiction Spiritual and Temporal, is derived wholy from the King,</HI> so that unless your <HI>Legislative Power</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> be somewhat, that is <HI>neither</HI> an <HI>Authority,</HI> nor a <HI>Iurisdiction,</HI> it is by this very <HI>Body,</HI> acknowledged to be <HI>wholy derived</HI> from him: Nor have you yet answered this Argument, nor I believe, can you do it.</P>

<P>As for your History which you promise to give me, of the <HI>abso∣lute Power</HI> of our <HI>first Saxon,</HI> and <HI>Norman</HI> Kings: I desire you to de∣fer the speaking of it, till another time, it being now late: Yet I do not doubt but to prove, that what I assert concerning the <HI>limited Power</HI> of our <HI>Kings,</HI> even by the <HI>Original Constitution</HI> of the Government, is <HI>no Romance,</HI> but true History: Nor are the Reasons that you have now urged to the contrary, prevalent enough with me, to alter my Opi∣nion, for I think I am able to prove somewhat more than I but now As∣serted, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Wittena G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mote,</HI> or <HI>Great Council</HI> met constantly <HI>once a year,</HI> or oftner, <HI>when need was,</HI> under the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, without any Summons from them, as when we come to the particular History of this matter, I shall shew you more at large; And also, that for the <HI>first Hundred Years</HI> after the Coming in of the <HI>Normans,</HI> the <HI>Great Council</HI> or <HI>Parliament</HI> used to meet of Course at the <HI>King's Court,</HI> at <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three</HI> of the <HI>Great Feasts</HI> of the Year. without any other notice by <HI>Writ</HI> or <HI>Summons.</HI> The first mention we find of such <HI>Writs,</HI> being in King <HI>Iohn's Magna Charta</HI>: But that when these <HI>Assemblies</HI> became <HI>less frequent,</HI> by reason of the <HI>King' Discontinuing</HI> of them; and because of the case the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>People</HI> found, in being <HI>Discharged</HI> from so con∣stant

(for as for <HI>Henry</HI> 8th. I remember no Instance of it) who durst venture to <HI>Act</HI> thus. As for the desire of <HI>Freedom</HI> of <HI>Speech,</HI> it is but a <HI>Compliment</HI>: for how can the <HI>Grievances</HI> of the Kingdom be <HI>Redressed,</HI> without speaking <HI>freely of</HI> them? And if one <HI>Great End</HI> of Parliament was to <HI>Redress</HI> these <HI>Grievances,</HI> it were altogether in vain, for them to <HI>Attempt</HI> any thing in this Kind, if the <HI>King</HI> could Brow-beat them from it, when ever he pleased. But <HI>Bract on</HI> doth not only tell us, <HI>Rex habet Superiorem, Legem, &amp; Curiam suam Baronum, &amp;c.</HI> in the Place I have al∣ready Cited; but the Old Book called the <HI>Mirrour of Iustices,</HI> also teach∣es us the same Lesson in his 2d. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection,</HI> where speaking of the King's Power, he tells us, <HI>that though the King can have no Peer in the Land, yet nevertheless if by his own Wrong, he offends against any of his People, none of those that judge for him, can be both Iudge and Party. It is therefore</HI> agreeable to Right, <HI>that the</HI> King <HI>should have</HI> Companions <HI>to Hear and</HI> Determine <HI>in Parliaments, all</HI> Writs <HI>and</HI> Complaints <HI>concerning the</HI> Wrongs <HI>of the</HI> King, Queen, <HI>and their</HI> Children, <HI>and of</HI> them especially, <HI>of whose Wrongs they could not</HI> otherwise <HI>have</HI> Common Right. <HI>These</HI> Compa∣nions are therefore called Counts, after the Latin Comites, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Not can I think, that <HI>any King</HI> would have Erected a <HI>Court,</HI> to have <HI>Redres∣sed</HI> the Wrongs done by <HI>himself,</HI> or his Family, whether he would or not. But as for your <HI>main Argument,</HI> from the words of the Statutes of King <HI>Edw.</HI> 6. and Queen <HI>Eliz. That all Authority and Iurisdiction, as well Spiritual as Temporal, is derived from the King</HI>: I do own it true, that is, if meant of all <HI>Derivative Authority,</HI> such as that of all <HI>inferior Counts,</HI> as well <HI>Civil</HI> as <HI>Ecclesiastical.</HI> For I suppose, you your self will not affirm, that the <HI>Ecclesiastical Authority</HI> of Bishops, as to their <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>meeting</HI> in <HI>publick Synods</HI> or <HI>Councils,</HI> is derived from the Crown.

<P>I see you have a mind to <HI>wrest</HI> the <HI>true sense</HI> of this Statute, by a <HI>forced Interpretation</HI>; but I hope at our next meeting to prove to you, that our first <HI>Saxon</HI> and <HI>Norman</HI> Kings were <HI>Absolute Monarchs,</HI> and that not only <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> we enjoy, but also our <HI>Civil Properties</HI> were <HI>wholy derived</HI> from him; and if so, it will also ne∣cessarily follow, that <HI>all Difference</HI> and <HI>Distinction</HI> in <HI>Honour</HI> or <HI>Power,</HI>
<PB N="355" REF="194"/>
by which the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Temporal Lords</HI> can claim to Sit in <HI>Parliament,</HI> is <HI>wholy derived from</HI> those <HI>Kings</HI>: For as to the <HI>Commons,</HI> I need not go so high for their <HI>Original</HI>; since it is the Opinion of our <HI>best Antiquaries,</HI> and I think the Learned Dr. <HI>Brady</HI> hath sufficiently proved it against Mr. <HI>Petyt,</HI> that they are <HI>no Ancienter</HI> than the <HI>latter end</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3ds. or perhaps the 18th. of <HI>Edw.</HI> the 1sts. Reign. Nor do the Authors you have quoted for the <HI>Independant Authority</HI> of Parliaments (<HI>viz. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>acton</HI> and the <HI>Mirrour</HI>) mention any other than the <HI>Curia Baronum,</HI> or that of <HI>Counts</HI> or <HI>Earls,</HI> as the Author of the <HI>Mirrour</HI> hath worded it, by which can be meant no other than the <HI>House of Lords</HI>; for as to that of the <HI>Commons,</HI> had they bin then in <HI>Being,</HI> or had they had <HI>any thing to</HI> do in the Government, it is not likely, these <HI>Ancient Authors,</HI> as well as our <HI>Acts of Parliament</HI> of those times, would have <HI>omitted</HI> particularly to <HI>men∣tion</HI> them. So that the <HI>higher</HI> I go, and the more I look on the Hi∣story of our <HI>Ancient English</HI> Kings, the <HI>more Absolute</HI> I find their <HI>Power,</HI> and the <HI>less dependant</HI> upon the <HI>People</HI>: Therefore I have very great rea∣son to believe, that our <HI>first Kings</HI> were <HI>Absolute Monarchs,</HI> not only by the <HI>Original Constitution</HI> of <HI>Parliaments,</HI> but also that our very <HI>Liber∣ties</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> proceeded at <HI>first</HI> from their <HI>meer Grace</HI> and <HI>Pa∣vour.</HI></P>

<P>I know you have Asserted the same things more than once; All the Difficulty lies in the Proof. And therefore I would not have you be <HI>too positive,</HI> or rely <HI>too much</HI> upon the conciseness or <HI>Silence</HI> of the <HI>Anci∣ent Monkish</HI> Writers of those <HI>first times.</HI> For since as I own, they have <HI>never</HI> given us any <HI>exact account of</HI> our <HI>Ancient Civil Government,</HI> nor yet of the History of their <HI>own times</HI>: We are forced for the most part, to pick out the <HI>Truth</HI> from other <HI>Circumstanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> or such <HI>Passages</HI> as we can meet withal in their <HI>Ancient Laws</HI> and <HI>Customs,</HI> nay sometimes from those of their <HI>Neighbours,</HI> who lived under the <HI>same kind</HI> of Government and <HI>Laws,</HI> with our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ancestors, as proceeding from one <HI>Common Stock</HI> or <HI>Original,</HI> as I shall shew you before we have done. But since we are already in <HI>Possession</HI> of our <HI>Ancient Laws</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> and of a <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>Parliaments</HI> once <HI>every Year,</HI> or <HI>oftner if need</HI> be, by two <HI>Ancient</HI> Sta∣tutes yet in <HI>force,</HI> at farthest <HI>once</HI> every <HI>three Years,</HI> by a <HI>late Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> it ought to be your Task, to prove to me the <HI>Absolute Power</HI> of our <HI>first English</HI> Monarchs; and by what <HI>Steps</HI> and <HI>Degrees,</HI> they came to <HI>part</HI> with their <HI>Power,</HI> and to be thus <HI>limited</HI> as we now find them; and when you can shew me this, I do assure you, I will come over to your Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall observe the Method you prescribe; And therefore to be∣gin with the <HI>first Entrance</HI> of the <HI>English Saxons</HI> into this Island, I sup∣pose you are not Ignorant of so Common a piece of History, that all the <HI>Title</HI> they had to this <HI>Island,</HI> was by the <HI>Sword</HI> or <HI>Conquest</HI> of their <HI>first Princes</HI> or <HI>Generals,</HI> who being sent by <HI>Lot,</HI> together with the <HI>Ar∣mies</HI> that followed them out, of their <HI>own Country</HI>; because it was <HI>too narrow</HI> or barren, to sustain such great Multitudes, they came over hi∣ther to seek <HI>new Dwellings.</HI> Now whether these <HI>Princes</HI> were made <HI>Kings
<PB N="356" REF="195"/>
before</HI> they came over, or that they made themselves so <HI>immediately af∣ter</HI> their <HI>Conquest,</HI> will be all one; since if we consider them as <HI>Military Captains</HI> or Leaders of Armies, their <HI>Power</HI> was <HI>Absolute,</HI> as that of <HI>all Generals</HI> ever was, and must be by the <HI>necessary</HI> Laws of <HI>Military Discipline</HI>: If we look upon them as <HI>Kings</HI> or <HI>Princes</HI> (as it is very likely they were also <HI>before</HI> they came over) since they were certainly of the <HI>Blood Royal,</HI> all of them deriving their <HI>Pedegree</HI> from <HI>Woden</HI> their <HI>God,</HI> as well as <HI>first King,</HI> being thus made <HI>Kings</HI> by their <HI>Fathers,</HI> or other <HI>near Rela∣tions,</HI> there is no Ground to believe they <HI>owed</HI> their <HI>Titles</HI> to the <HI>Votes,</HI> or <HI>Suffrages</HI> of their followers: But after they had Setled a <HI>Heptarchy,</HI> or Seven Kingdoms in this <HI>Part</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> called <HI>England</HI>: We find them <HI>Governing,</HI> and Leading their <HI>People</HI> like <HI>Absolute Kings</HI> and <HI>Mo∣narchs</HI> over their <HI>little Principalities</HI>: And since each Kingdom was Con∣quered from the <HI>Britains</HI> under the Conduct, according to the <HI>Laws of Nations,</HI> and <HI>Right of Conquest, all the Lands</HI> of each Kingdom, belong∣ed to the <HI>Conquerors,</HI> who though they <HI>cantoned</HI> them out into <HI>shares</HI> to their <HI>Captains</HI> and <HI>Souldiers,</HI> according to each <HI>Man's Valour</HI> or <HI>Desert</HI>: Yet did this <HI>wholy</HI> proceed from their <HI>Bounty</HI> and <HI>Favour,</HI> who might have kept the <HI>whole</HI> to themselves, if they had pleased; and hence it is, that not only <HI>since</HI> the <HI>Norman Conquest,</HI> but also <HI>long before,</HI> all the Lands of <HI>England</HI> were holden of the <HI>King,</HI> as the <HI>Supream Lord</HI>: And if, so, I suppose you will not deny, but that according to your own Principle, all our <HI>other Priviledges</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> must have been <HI>derived</HI> from him, since you have already Asserted, that whoever is <HI>Lord</HI> of the <HI>Soil</HI> of a Country, he is so also over the <HI>Persons</HI> of the <HI>People.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before you proceed any farther, I pray give me leave to answer what you have now said, I doubt with greater shew and appearance of Truth, than the matter will justly bear, when well canvassed. But since I grant our <HI>earliest</HI> Writers are <HI>very short</HI>▪ in giving us the <HI>true Form</HI> or <HI>Original Constitutions</HI> of our Ancient <HI>Saxon</HI> Government, it is necessary we look into the <HI>Roman</HI> Authors who treat of the <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> of the <HI>Ancient German</HI> Nations a <HI>Stirp</HI> of whom our <HI>Ancient English Saxons</HI> certainly were, and in those Authors, you will find, that <HI>they</HI> as well as other Nations of the <HI>Gothic Original,</HI> were never Governed by <HI>Absolute Monarchs</HI>; but by <HI>Kings</HI> or Princes <HI>limited</HI> by the <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Common-Councils</HI> of their own Nations as were all those that <HI>descended</HI> from this <HI>Gothick Original.</HI></P>
<P>In the first place therefore, see what <HI>Tacitus</HI> says in his Book <HI>de Moribus Germanorum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Grotis Prolegomenain Historiam Go∣thicam.</HI></NOTE> who sufficiently proves, that it was a <HI>Fundamental Constitution</HI> of all the <HI>German</HI> Nations, to order all <HI>public Affairs</HI> in <HI>General Councils</HI> or Assemblies of the <HI>whole People.</HI> Wherefore the same Author there tells us, <HI>De Minoribus rebus Principes con∣sultant, de Majoribus omnes; it a tamen, ut eaqubque quorum penes Plebem Ar∣bitrium est apud Principes praetractentur.</HI> As also that in <HI>this Council,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 4.</NOTE> they Tryed <HI>Great Offenders</HI> for <HI>Capl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Crimes.

Nec Regibus infinita, aut libera Potestas, &amp;c.</HI> And speaking of the manner of their holding these <HI>publick Councils,</HI> after silence commanded by the Priests, <HI>Mox Rex</HI> (saith he) <HI>vel Princeps,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 11.</NOTE> <HI>prout aetat cuique, prout No∣bilitas, prout decus Bellorum, prout facundia est, audiuntur, authoritate suaedendi magis quàm jubendi potestate: Si displicuit Sententia, fremitu aspernantur; Sin placuit, frameas concutiunt. Ho∣noratissimum assensus genus est armis laudari.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>pag.</HI> 634.</NOTE> So that you may here see their <HI>Kings</HI> had <HI>no Negative Votes</HI> in their <HI>Councils,</HI> whatever they might have <HI>afterwards</HI> among the <HI>English Saxons</HI>; and that <HI>they</HI> did not so much as <HI>preside</HI> in them, but the <HI>Priests</HI> you may see in the same place; <HI>Silentium per Sacerdotes, quibus tum coercendi jus est, Imperatum.</HI> And therefore it is altogether unlikely, that <HI>they</HI> should have had that <HI>Absolute Power</HI> you fancy over the <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Fortunes</HI> of the <HI>Peo∣ple</HI>: Since you plainly see, that they could neither make <HI>Peace</HI> nor <HI>War, Accuse</HI> or <HI>Condemn</HI> any Man, nor <HI>raise Taxes,</HI> without the <HI>Approbation</HI> or <HI>Consent</HI> of those <HI>Councils.</HI></P>
<P>Now since all the <HI>English Saxon</HI> Nations were from <HI>Germany,</HI> I leave it to the Judgment of your self, or any indifferent Person to consider, whether a <HI>People so free as this,</HI> who come over hither not as <HI>Subjects,</HI> but only as <HI>Volunteers</HI> under so many <HI>Captains</HI> or <HI>Generals,</HI> who went out meerly to seek <HI>new Habitations,</HI> should be so <HI>fond</HI> of a <HI>Government,</HI> they <HI>never knew</HI> at home, as to give these <HI>Captains</HI> (whom they made their <HI>Kings</HI>) an <HI>Absolute Despotick Power</HI> over their <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Estates</HI>; which they never could endure in their <HI>own Country</HI>; but that they were not <HI>then Kings,</HI> I thus prove. First of all, no <HI>Ancient Writer</HI> that I know of, ever mentioned any such thing, but rather the <HI>Contrary</HI>; for who will be∣lieve, that <HI>before</HI> it could be known what the <HI>Success</HI> would be, they should make meer <HI>Soldiers</HI> of <HI>Fortune,</HI> or Leaders of some <HI>Bands of Adventurers, Kings,</HI> before the <HI>Country</HI> they were to Govern was <HI>Conquered,</HI> or that they knew whether ever they should Arrive there or not? And as for the <HI>two first</HI> of these Princes that came over <HI>(viz.) Heugist</HI> and <HI>Horsa,</HI> our Histories make them <HI>Brothers</HI> in <HI>joynt Command</HI> over those <HI>Saxons,</HI> who were sent hither as <HI>Auxiliaries</HI> to the <HI>Britains,</HI> against the <HI>Picts</HI>; nor is <HI>Hengist</HI> ever called <HI>King,</HI> or the time of his <HI>Reign</HI> reckoned, till near <HI>Eight</HI> years after his coming over hither, <HI>viz.</HI> after the Death of <HI>Vortimer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Polychron. Rad. Higden An.</HI> 456.</NOTE> and the driving of <HI>Vortiger</HI> into <HI>Wales</HI>: And therefore I can give no account, how these Princes should become <HI>Kings,</HI> but by the <HI>Consent</HI> or <HI>Election</HI> of their <HI>Souldiers</HI> or <HI>Followers</HI>; for, as for themselves to Create themselves <HI>Kings,</HI> without the <HI>Consent</HI> of their <HI>Army</HI> or <HI>People,</HI> is altogether <HI>impro∣bable</HI> and <HI>absurd,</HI> and not at all to be relyed on upon your bare word for other Authority you yet give me none; But for the main part of your Assertion, that the <HI>first Saxon</HI> Kings were <HI>Absolute Monarchs,</HI> because <HI>all</HI>
<PB N="358" REF="196"/>
the <HI>Land</HI> was <HI>Conquered</HI> for them, and to their <HI>use,</HI> and that <HI>all Land was held of them,</HI> is altogether as <HI>precarious,</HI> our Histories being herein <HI>wholy Silent</HI>: But though we do not certainly know which way they <HI>divided</HI> their <HI>Conquest</HI> to their Followers; since Authors mention nothing of it: Yet this I think, I may <HI>positively</HI> Assert, that whatever was done in this Kind, by the <HI>first Saxon</HI> Kings, was not as <HI>Absolute Proprietors</HI> of the <HI>whole Country,</HI> but as <HI>publick Trustees,</HI> for those over whom they were sent, for since (as I have already observed) these <HI>People</HI> were utterly <HI>Strangers</HI> to a <HI>Despotick Government</HI> at home, it is altogether unlikely, that their <HI>Follow∣ers</HI> would confer upon them an <HI>Absolute</HI> and <HI>Vnlimited Power abroad,</HI> which they were never used to before: And therefore they could not be <HI>Kings</HI> by <HI>Right of Conquest,</HI> over the <HI>Estates</HI> or <HI>Persons</HI> of those who were <HI>fellow Conquerors</HI> with them, and set them up for what they were, nor yet over the <HI>Britains</HI>: Since they were either <HI>totally</HI> driven out into <HI>Wales or Cornwall,</HI> or else those <HI>few</HI> that were left, being <HI>reduced</HI> to a <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Ser∣vitude,</HI> were by Degrees <HI>Incorporated</HI> with the <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
<P>And though for want of <HI>Ancient Histories,</HI> as well as Letters, among so Rude and Barbarous a People, as these were at first, we have <HI>no Records</HI> up∣on what <HI>express Conditions</HI> these <HI>Captains</HI> were by them <HI>Elected</HI> to be their <HI>Kings</HI>: Yet thus much we may find out by those <HI>few Remains</HI> we have left us in <HI>Bede,</HI> and other <HI>Ancient Historians,</HI> that they had all of them the <HI>same Kind</HI> of <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI> with very <HI>little difference</HI> from each other,: Since we find in all the <HI>Several Kingdoms</HI> of the <HI>Heptarchy,</HI> there were the <HI>same kind</HI> of <HI>Wittena Gemots,</HI> or <HI>Great Councils,</HI> by whom they were <HI>Elected,</HI> and without whose <HI>Advice</HI> and <HI>Consent,</HI> their <HI>Kings</HI> could do <HI>nothing</HI> of Moment, either in <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>War,</HI> as any one that will but read those Laws that are left us, Collected by Mr. <HI>Lambard</HI> and Sir <HI>H.

<P>I own indeed, that our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ancestors, when they had <HI>Conquored</HI> this Kingdom, brought in their <HI>Saxon Laws</HI> along with them;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. p.</HI> 3.</NOTE> but it doth not from thence follow, that they brought their <HI>Popular Government</HI> in with them too: And those Assemblies <HI>Tacitus</HI> mentions, might be <HI>Councils</HI> of the <HI>German</HI> People in General, no not of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> which Name is not to be found in all that Author. But what if it be granted, that those <HI>People</HI> which were afterwards called <HI>Saxons,</HI> were governed by <HI>such Councils,</HI> was not this <HI>Government</HI> a <HI>Democracy</HI>?

In these Governments, no Man can doubt of the <HI>Suffrages</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> but under such as you mention, you would I think▪ scarce be contented to live, where the <HI>Priests</HI> bare so much sway, where there were <HI>no Cities</HI> or <HI>Great Towns,</HI> but only <HI>scattered Houses,</HI> and <HI>Habitations by Rivers, Fields and Woods, made of</HI> Dirt <HI>or</HI> Clay, <HI>Arms of Trees and Stubble,</HI> where there was <HI>no literature,</HI> especially among the <HI>common Peo∣ple,</HI> nor scarce <HI>Civility,</HI> where there was <HI>no Cloathing,</HI> but with Garments

made of <HI>Beasts Skins</HI>; No Food but Milk, Pulse and Flesh, without Art or Cookery, where there was <HI>no Propriety</HI> in Lands, <HI>no Money</HI> no Work for <HI>Lawyers,</HI> as you will find if you read on in <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and the 6th. Book of <HI>Cesar's Commentaries.</HI></P>
<P>And as for what you say concerning the <HI>beginning</HI> of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kingdoms in this <HI>Island.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. P. P.</HI> §. 19, 20.</NOTE> To this I Reply, that <HI>Hengest</HI> and <HI>Horsa</HI> and those other Leaders, who brought the <HI>Saxons</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> were all of them of the <HI>Royal Line</HI> of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> as appears by all our Historians, and so if not <HI>Kings,</HI> yet well able to <HI>Subsist</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Math.

<P>Nor is it probable, if they had made <HI>Articles</HI> with their Followers, that these <HI>Princes</HI> should have had such <HI>Absolute Authority,</HI> as they had over the <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Fortunes</HI> of their <HI>Subjects,</HI> in the more <HI>early times,</HI> almost all the <HI>Priviledges</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, being granted <HI>long since that time,</HI> nay, most of them since the <HI>Conquest</HI>; Yea, since the <HI>Barons Wars.</HI> But as for what you say concerning the <HI>Gothick</HI> or <HI>Vandal</HI> Kingdoms, since they relate nothing to <HI>our Government,</HI> I need not say any thing to them, nor doth it follow, that if their <HI>Kings</HI> were <HI>limited,</HI> or but upon <HI>Condition,</HI> that ours must be so too.</P>

<P>I see you would fain <HI>evade</HI> the Authority of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> concerning the <HI>People's having any share of the Government amongst the Saxons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Verstegan Restitution of decayed intelli∣gence. p.</HI> 23.</NOTE> because forsooth, that Nation is not <HI>particularly nam'd</HI> in his History; But tho the <HI>Saxons</HI> are not <HI>particu∣larly named</HI> by <HI>Tacitus</HI>: Yet the <HI>Angli</HI> are there mentio∣ned among those <HI>German</HI> Nations, who Worship't their Common Goddess <HI>Hertha,</HI> which that Author interprets to be <HI>Terra,</HI> the Earth: And you very well know, that from these <HI>Angli,</HI> or <HI>Angles,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Nation as well as name is derived. But tho <HI>Tacitus</HI> who lived about the beginning of the Emperour <HI>Trajans</HI> Reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tacit. de Mor. Germ. Vi. Ptol. in Tab.</HI> 4. <HI>Europ.</HI></NOTE> names not the <HI>Saxons,</HI> yet <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olomy</HI> who writ within 40 years after expresly menti∣ons them placing their Country not far <HI>North</HI> of the Ri∣ver <HI>Albis,</HI> and near the Place where all agree the <HI>Angli</HI> were Seated, so that they were either all one and the same Nation, or very little different.

<P>But since I see you cannot well tell how to <HI>evade</HI> this Testimony of <HI>Ta∣citus,</HI> but by affirming that the <HI>Government</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> was a <HI>Democracy,</HI> and that the <HI>People</HI> had the <HI>only Sway</HI> in it, is a great mistake, since he ex∣presly mentions their <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI>; and there only speaks of the man∣ner of Transacting all <HI>publick Affairs,</HI> in which it is true, the <HI>People</HI> (as it is very well known by our Ancient Histories) had formerly a <HI>greater Share</HI>
<PB N="360" REF="197"/>
than now: Yet doth he not thereby <HI>exclude</HI> the <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Nobility,</HI> from having also <HI>their Shares</HI> in it. And as for what follows in <HI>Tacitus</HI> of the <HI>Royal Power, auctoritate sua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endi, magis quam jubendi Potestate</HI>; I suppose you cannot deny, but that Priviledge yet remains to us, since the <HI>King</HI> cannot command the <HI>Parliament</HI> to make <HI>what Laws,</HI> or give him <HI>what Money</HI> he pleaseth; and therefore that doth not make it a <HI>Democracy,</HI> much less the <HI>Priests presiding</HI> in their <HI>Assemblies,</HI> which is no more to be wondred at, than that the Bishops have still Votes, and their <HI>share</HI> of <HI>Le∣gislature</HI> in the House of <HI>Peers</HI>: Or that a <HI>Bishop,</HI> when <HI>Chancellor</HI> or <HI>Keeper</HI> should be <HI>Speaker</HI> in the House of <HI>Peers.</HI> Or supposing that their <HI>Priests</HI> had more <HI>Power</HI> among them, than the <HI>Christian Clergy</HI> had after they were Converted, doth it therefore follow, that it was not the <HI>same Government,</HI> or that it must therefore be so <HI>intolerable,</HI> that I would not have bin <HI>willing</HI> to have <HI>lived</HI> under it? Since I must tell you, I am not against <HI>Civil Offices,</HI> though exercised by <HI>Clergy-men,</HI> as far as the <HI>Business</HI> of their <HI>Function,</HI> and the <HI>Canons</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> will permit. As for the rest which you object concerning the <HI>Barbarous</HI> living of the <HI>Ancient Ger∣mans,</HI> it either makes nothing to the matter in hand, or else against you; since it proves plainly, that <HI>Absolute Monarchy,</HI> was not the <HI>first Govern∣ment</HI> among all Nations, as you suppose. Nor doth it therefore follow, that because these <HI>People</HI> were <HI>Rude</HI> and <HI>Barbarous</HI>; therefore they had not the Wit to prefer <HI>Absolute Monarchy,</HI> before all other Governments, since their <HI>Conquerors</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> (who sure were a <HI>Civiliz'd People</HI>) did like∣wise as much <HI>abhor</HI> it.</P>
<P>But as for what you say against <HI>Hengist,</HI> and those <HI>other Leaders,</HI> who brought the <HI>Saxons</HI> into <HI>Britain,</HI> being <HI>Elected</HI> Kings by their Followers, is nothing but meer Guess, and Conjecture. For that they were <HI>not Kings</HI> at home, you your self grant; and whether they were able well to <HI>Subsist</HI> at home, or not, is nothing to the Purpose: It is plain, they thought they could <HI>mend</HI> their <HI>Condition,</HI> or else would <HI>never</HI> have <HI>left</HI> their <HI>Country.</HI> And tho it be granted, that <HI>Hengist</HI> with his Followers, came not over as <HI>Enemies,</HI> but <HI>Auxiliaries</HI> to the <HI>Britains</HI>; Yet it is not there∣fore more likely, that they were <HI>chosen</HI> by the King of their <HI>own Nation,</HI> than that their own Followers should afterwards <HI>Elect</HI> them, especially when the one is agreeable to our own Historians, and the other not: For <HI>Mattheus Florilegus</HI> tells us, that <HI>Horsus</HI> being slain, the <HI>Saxons Fratrem suum Hengislum in Regnum Cantiae sublimaverunt,</HI> that is, they <HI>Elected</HI> or Advanced him to be King, if I understand any thing by that word, and this agrees with the <HI>Polichronicon</HI> of <HI>Ranulph Higden,</HI> who places the begin∣ing of <HI>Hengists</HI> Reign, immediately after the Death of his Brother <HI>Hor∣sus,</HI> viz. <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 465. Eight years after the coming of the <HI>Saxons</HI> into <HI>Britain</HI>; and that the rest of the <HI>Saxons</HI> who came hither after, had <HI>no better</HI> Title then <HI>Election.</HI> I could farther prove, if the time would give me leave: For they that will read the <HI>Ancient Accounts</HI> of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Na∣tion, and what Government they had among them, long after the time of <HI>Cesar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus,</HI> will find that it was impossible, that they should be thus <HI>Created Kings,</HI> before they came over; since at that time, they had
<PB N="361" REF="197"/>
no such things as <HI>constant Kings</HI> amongst them, for in those times it was rather an <HI>Aristocracy,</HI> then a <HI>Monarchy</HI>; for as <HI>Iohannes Pomarius</HI> in his <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle sheweth us, for which I refer you to <HI>Verstegan,</HI> where this <HI>passage</HI> is made use of at large. <HI>Verstegan p.</HI> 68. So that if this were the Government of the <HI>Saxons</HI>; as low as the time of <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> I durst leave it to any <HI>indifferent person</HI> to judge, whether the <HI>first Saxon</HI> Kings in this Island, were made so by their <HI>own Princes before</HI> they came over, or were <HI>chosen</HI> by their Followers, since <HI>no Historians</HI> men∣tion the <HI>former,</HI> tho all of them agree of the <HI>latter</HI>: They commonly using this Phrase, <HI>Regem fecerunt,</HI> or <HI>elegerunt.</HI> And that all the <HI>first Kings</HI> of the <HI>Heptarchy</HI> were <HI>Elective,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. <HI>Earl of</HI> Stamfords <HI>speech at the General Quarter Sessions at</HI> Leicester, 1690. <HI>and the Notes thereupon. Vide</HI> Bromton <HI>f.</HI> 770. <HI>Chron. de Mailros. f.</HI> 137.</NOTE> nothing is more plain, since the <HI>Great Council</HI> of the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>People</HI> did not <HI>only Elect</HI> them, but often <HI>De∣pose</HI> them too, when they grew <HI>intolerable,</HI> through <HI>Tyran∣ny</HI> or Misgovernment, as may appear by the Example of <HI>Sigibert,</HI> King of the <HI>West-Saxons</HI> and <HI>divers others</HI> I could Instance in, who were Expelled this Kingdom (as <HI>Brompton,</HI> and other Ancient Chronicles tell us) by <HI>the Vnanimous Consent and Deliberation of the Nobility and People.</HI> Many like Instances I could give you in the <HI>o∣ther Kingdoms</HI> of the <HI>Heptarchy,</HI> but that it would be too tedious.</P>
<P>Nor doth your Reason signifie any thing, that it is not probable, that the <HI>first Princes</HI> were made <HI>Kings</HI> upon <HI>Condition,</HI> because of the <HI>Absolute Authority</HI> they had over the <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Fortunes</HI> of their Subjects; since it is altogether false in matter of Fact; none of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings being able <HI>alone</HI> to make <HI>Laws,</HI> or impose <HI>Taxes</HI> upon their People, <HI>without their Con∣sents</HI> in their <HI>Great Councils,</HI> much less to make <HI>War</HI> without it; for then the <HI>War</HI> tho begun by the <HI>King alone,</HI> must have signified little in an Age, when there were <HI>no standing Armies,</HI> nor <HI>Money</HI> in the <HI>Princes Power</HI> to pay them, there being then but <HI>little Coyn</HI> of any sort, and their <HI>Reve∣nues</HI> being mostly paid in <HI>Victuals.</HI></P>

<P>Pray Sir give me leave to interrupt you a little, I own indeed, that the <HI>particular Laws</HI> and <HI>Constitutions</HI> of each of the Kingdoms of the <HI>Heptarchy,</HI> are not particularly known, and perhaps <HI>some</HI> of their <HI>Kings</HI> might be <HI>Elective,</HI> and consequently liable to be <HI>Deposed</HI> by their <HI>People</HI>; whether by <HI>Right</HI> or <HI>Wrong,</HI> I will not now Dispute, but if we consider the <HI>State</HI> of things, after these <HI>Seven Kingdoms</HI> became reduced into <HI>one</HI>; you will find them much altered: And as <HI>Egbert</HI> our <HI>first Saxon</HI> Monarch, Reduced all those Kingdoms into <HI>one,</HI> So it is to be supposed, that having <HI>no Right</HI> to them, but by <HI>Conquest,</HI> and the <HI>Submission</HI> of their <HI>Kings,</HI> when overcome in <HI>Battle,</HI> both he and his Successors, must needs have become far <HI>more Absolute,</HI> than they were <HI>before,</HI> and if they were <HI>Elective before that time,</HI> did now certainly become <HI>Hereditary Monarchs</HI>; The Crown <HI>Descending</HI> from Father to Son, for divers Descents: And so Consequent∣ly, these <HI>Princes</HI> granted <HI>divers Priviledges</HI> and <HI>Liberties</HI> to the <HI>People</HI> of those Kingdoms they <HI>Conquered</HI>: And that they were no other than the

<HI>free Grants</HI> or <HI>Concessions</HI> of our <HI>former Kings,</HI> upon <HI>Petition</HI> or <HI>Request</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> and accepted by the <HI>Clergy, Nobility</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of the King∣dom in their <HI>Great Councils.</HI> For this I need go no farther than the <HI>Co∣ronation Oath,</HI> taken by the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> when the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> asks the King, <HI>Sir, will you grant and keep, and by your Oath, confirm to the People of</HI> England, <HI>the Laws and Customs granted to them, by the Ancient Kings of</HI> England <HI>your Predecessors, and namely the Laws and Customs and Liberties granted to the Clergy, and People by the Glorious King</HI> Edward <HI>your Predecessor?</HI></P>

<P>I doubt you will prove as much out in the account you give me of our <HI>King's Power,</HI> after the <HI>Seven Kingdoms</HI> were reduced into <HI>one,</HI> as you were <HI>before.</HI> For though I grant that the <HI>Title</HI> of the <HI>West-Saxon</HI> Kings over all the rest, proceeded from <HI>Conquest,</HI> and the <HI>Submission</HI> of the <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>People</HI> they Conquered, yet were they not all <HI>actually</HI> reduced <HI>into one Kingdom</HI> or <HI>Monarchy,</HI> till a good while after; the Kings of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and of the <HI>East-Angles,</HI> continuing in Being, till the <HI>Coming</HI> in of the <HI>Danes,</HI> as you will find by our <HI>Saxon</HI> Annals. And though tis true, the <HI>West-Saxon</HI> Kings made those Kings <HI>Tributary</HI> to them: Yet that they did not become <HI>more Absolute</HI> thereby, appears from the Testimony of our <HI>Ancient Histories,</HI> Since we find them <HI>Transacting</HI> all Affairs in their <HI>Wit∣tena Gemots,</HI> or <HI>Great Councils,</HI> as well <HI>after</HI> their <HI>Conquest,</HI> as they did <HI>be∣fore.</HI> And therefore we find in an Old Register of St. <HI>Leonard</HI> Abby in <HI>York</HI> (cited by Mr. <HI>Dodsworth</HI> in the <HI>Monast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on Anglic.</HI> put out by Mr. <HI>Dugdale</HI>) this Memo∣rable passage:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vol.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 367.</NOTE> <HI>Memorandum quod Anno Domini</HI> 800.

<P>Nor will your Inference from the <HI>Coronation Oath,</HI> prove of any great∣er Moment. For tho it be therein recited, that divers of the <HI>Laws, Li∣berties, &amp;c.</HI> we now enjoy, were granted by King <HI>Edw. the Confessor,</HI> and other Kings: Yet must it not be so understood, as if the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> had no <HI>Laws,</HI> or <HI>Civil Rights</HI> before his time; for that were to con∣tradict plain matter of Fact, and the Histories themselves I have alrea∣dy Cited. But why they were called <HI>his Laws,</HI> and <HI>his Customs: Will. of
<PB N="363" REF="198"/>
Malmsbury</HI> hath very well observed, when speaking of the <HI>good Laws</HI> made by <HI>Ancient Kings,</HI> and especially by King <HI>Ethelred,</HI> which were confirmed by King <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e,</HI> he hath this remarkable passage, <HI>In quarum custodiam etiam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unc temporis Bonarum. Sub nomine Regis</HI> Edwardi <HI>juratur, non quod ille Sta∣tuerit, sed quod observaverit.</HI> The like I may say for the Laws of divers other <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, which tho they go under <HI>their Names,</HI> Yet were made by the <HI>Assent</HI> of the <HI>Great Council</HI> of the Kingdom, as by the <HI>Titles</HI> of the <HI>Laws</HI> themselves in Mr. <HI>Lamberts</HI> and Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI>'s Collection of them, you may be satisfied if you please.</P>
<P>But for a Tast, pray see the <HI>Laws</HI> of King <HI>Alfred</HI> (which you Cited) which tho said to be made by him (as indeed it is true, he compiled them out of divers <HI>other Laws,</HI> formerly in force in the <HI>other Kingdoms</HI> of the <HI>Heptarchy</HI>) Yet that they were also shewn, and <HI>assented</HI> to by the <HI>Wittenae Gemots,</HI> pray see the Conclusion of these Laws, in Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI>: The words are Remarkable. <HI>Ego Aelfredus West Saxonum Rex, ostendi haec om∣nibus Sapientibus meis, &amp; dixerunt places ea custodiri.</HI> So that the calling them the <HI>Laws</HI> of King <HI>Alfred,</HI> or King <HI>Edward,</HI> doth no more prove, that <HI>they alone</HI> made them then our now Citing such, or such a Statute of K. <HI>Henry</HI> 8th. or King <HI>Charles</HI> the 1st. do therefore suppose, that <HI>those Kings</HI> made Laws by their <HI>own Sole Authority</HI>: such Phrases among <HI>Ancient Hi∣storians,</HI> as well as our selves at this Day, being used only for Brevity sake, and signifie no more then their <HI>Confirmation</HI> of them.</P>

<P>I shall not deny, but that our <HI>Ancient English</HI> Kings, did for the most part make no Laws, <HI>without the Consent</HI> of their <HI>Great Council</HI>: Yet I think I can give you an unanswerable Argument, to prove that the very <HI>Being</HI> and <HI>Constitution</HI> of <HI>Parliaments</HI> or <HI>Great Councils,</HI> did in the beginning, <HI>wholy</HI> proceed from the <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Favour</HI> of some of our <HI>Ancient Kings</HI>; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to which of them to ascribe, it is not easie to Determine. But if we may believe your own Author the <HI>Mirrour,</HI> he tells us almost at the ve∣ry beginning: <HI>That King</HI> Alfred, <HI>for the Good State of the Realm, caused to Assemble the Counts or Peers, and then ordained for a perpetual Custom, that twice in the Year, or oftner, for Business in time of Peace, they should Assemble at</HI> Lon∣don, <HI>to treat of the Government of the People of God, and how folks should keep themselves from offences, and live in quiet, and should receive Right, by certain vsages and Iudgments. And According to this Establishment, were made divers Ordinances by divers Kings, until the present King</HI> (viz.) <HI>Edw.</HI> 1st.</P>
<P>But to come to the proof of what I affirm, it is certain, that in those first times, the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings conferred all the <HI>Bishopricks</HI> and <HI>principal Ab∣beys</HI> in <HI>England, per Annulum &amp; Baculum,</HI> as <HI>Ingulf</HI> and <HI>Malmsbury</HI> expresly tell us. And as for the <HI>Earls</HI> or <HI>Aldermen</HI> of Counties, as also the <HI>Great Thanes,</HI> Judges or <HI>Noblemen</HI> of the Kingdom, they were <HI>only Offices</HI> held for life in those times, which the King might <HI>Discharge</HI> them of at his Pleasure: And hence we find the <HI>Titles</HI> of <HI>Aldermanus Regis,</HI> and <HI>Thanus Regis,</HI> so frequently to occur in our Ancient Histories and Charters: These comprehended under the general Name of <HI>Wites,</HI> were the only <HI>Constituent parts</HI> of the <HI>Great Council</HI> in those times; for as concerning those we now call the <HI>Commons</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> we do not so much as find the <HI>least
<PB N="364" REF="199"/>
mention</HI> of them, or any <HI>Representatives</HI> for them, till the latter end of the Reign of King <HI>Hen.</HI> 3d. or the middle of <HI>Edw.</HI> 1sts. Reign, as I think Dr. <HI>Brady</HI> hath Learnedly and fully proved in his <HI>last Edition</HI> of his Answer to Mr. <HI>Petyt's</HI> Treatise of the <HI>Rights of the Commons of</HI> England <HI>Asserted.</HI> Now if it plainly appears, that <HI>every part</HI> or <HI>Member</HI> of the Parliament, did Anciently receive their <HI>very Being,</HI> from the <HI>meer Grace</HI> and <HI>Concession</HI> of our <HI>Ancient Monarchs</HI>; can you, or any Reasonable Man assert, with any Colour of Truth, that our <HI>Great Councils</HI> or <HI>Parliaments,</HI> could be a <HI>part</HI> of the <HI>Fundamental Constitution,</HI> and as <HI>Ancient,</HI> as the <HI>Government</HI> it self? And if <HI>Parliaments</HI> did thus receive all <HI>that Authority</HI> they now Ex∣ercise from the <HI>Kings Bounty,</HI> can any Man doubt whether <HI>all the Rights</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> we now enjoy, <HI>are</HI> to be Ascribed to any <HI>other Original</HI>? For if the very <HI>Keepers</HI> (as you will have it) of these <HI>Liberties,</HI> did all proceed from the <HI>King,</HI> then certainly the <HI>things</HI> to be <HI>Kept,</HI> must do so too; and when you can answer this Argument I have now brought, I think I may safely promise you to be your <HI>Proselite,</HI> and to come over to your Opi∣nion.</P>

<P>I confess, this is the most <HI>plausible Argument</HI> you have hitherto ur∣ged, and if I can't answer it, I do likewise promise you to become your <HI>Convert.</HI> But tho granting that <HI>Parliaments</HI> might have received their <HI>Being</HI> from the <HI>Favours</HI> of our <HI>Kings,</HI> I might deny your <HI>Consequence,</HI> that therefore it will follow, that <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Liberties</HI> of the Sub∣jects of <HI>England,</HI> must do so too; since they might very well have <HI>reserved</HI> to themselves both <HI>Hereditary Properties,</HI> as also a <HI>Right</HI> to their <HI>Lives, Li∣berties</HI> and <HI>Estates,</HI> which the <HI>King</HI> should not take from them, <HI>without just Cause,</HI> and <HI>Legal Tryal</HI>; which when they found <HI>invaded</HI> by succeeding Prin∣ces, they might then (and not till then) find constant <HI>Great Councils,</HI> and <HI>Parliaments</HI> to be necessary for that End, and as the <HI>firmest Bullwark</HI> against the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of Succeeding Princes: But the Author of the <HI>Mirrour</HI> in the Section, before the place from whence you took your <HI>last Quotation,</HI> ex∣presly tells us, that upon the <HI>first Election</HI> of a King to Reign over the rest of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Princes, <HI>they first of all mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him to Swe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, that He would maintain the Holy Christian Faith, with all his Power, and would govern his People according to Right, without regard to any Person, and should be liable to suffer Right</HI> (i. e. <HI>Iudgment</HI>) <HI>as well as others of his People.</HI> And tho I do not give any Credit to all the Story he there relates, of 40 Soveraign Princes in this Island at once: Yet the Substance of it may be true, that this <HI>Election</HI> was made of King <HI>Egbert,</HI> by the 40 <HI>Earls</HI> or <HI>Counts</HI> of Pro∣vinces, which were afterward by King <HI>Alfred,</HI> called <HI>Shires.</HI></P>
<P>But that this Author ascribes the <HI>Beginning</HI> of <HI>Great Councils,</HI> to the <HI>first Institution</HI> of the <HI>Government</HI>; pray see what he there f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rther says. <HI>And tho the King can have no Peer in the Land, nevertheless, if by his own wrong,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fr. nequidant</NOTE> <HI>he offends against any of his People, none of those that Iudge for him, can be both Iudge and Party: It is therefore agreeable to Right, that the King should have Companions to Hear and Determine in Parliament, all Writs and Complaints, concerning the Wrongs of the King, Queen and their Children, of which Wrongs they
<PB N="365" REF="199"/>
could not otherwise have Common Right. These Companions are therefore cal∣led Counts after the Latin, C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI> Whereby you may see, that this Au∣thor and <HI>Bracton,</HI> who were <HI>Contemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aries,</HI> were of the <HI>same Opinion</HI> in this important Point. And I cannot imagine, how any <HI>Prince</HI> who had <HI>Power sufficient</HI> in his hands, to do what he <HI>pleased</HI> (as you suppose our <HI>English Saxon</HI> Monarchs to have had at the <HI>first</HI>) would ever, if they could have helpt it, have instituted a <HI>Court,</HI> one of whose <HI>chief Business<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> it was, to <HI>ex∣amine</HI> and <HI>redress</HI> the <HI>Wrongs</HI> and <HI>Oppressions</HI> of <HI>themselves,</HI> their <HI>Wives</HI> and <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<P>But besides all this, what you say might be somewhat likely, that our <HI>Parliaments</HI> or <HI>Great Councils</HI> did owe their <HI>Original</HI> only to the <HI>Kings</HI> good Will and Pleasure, did we not find the <HI>like Constitution,</HI> to have bin in all the <HI>Neighbouring Kingdoms</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> which have bin raised according to the <HI>Gothic Model</HI> of Government, upon the Ruins of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, now let us look into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and there we shall find this <HI>Institution</HI> as <HI>An∣cient,</HI> as any <HI>History</HI> or <HI>Record</HI> they have. If we pass into <HI>France,</HI> we shall find their <HI>Assembly of Estates</HI> or <HI>Great Council,</HI> to have bin as <HI>Ancient</HI> as their <HI>first Kings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Hottoma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Franco Gallia.</HI></NOTE> and to have had as <HI>much Power,</HI> as any where else in <HI>Europe</HI>: Since they not only <HI>frequently Elected,</HI> but also <HI>Deposed</HI> their <HI>Kings</HI> of the <HI>first Race,</HI> and disposed of the <HI>Succession</HI> of the <HI>Crown,</HI> as they thought fit. If we look into <HI>Spain,</HI> we shall find in the two greatest and most Considerable Kingdoms, <HI>viz. Castile</HI> and <HI>Arragon,</HI> the like <HI>Assemblies</HI>▪ the <HI>Power</HI> of which was <HI>so great</HI> in the latter, that they could even <HI>Depose the King</HI> himself, if he <HI>Tyranniz'd</HI> over, or <HI>Oppress't</HI> them; If we go more <HI>Northward,</HI> we shall find in the Ancient Kingdoms of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> that their <HI>Assembly of Estates,</HI> or <HI>Dyets, Elected</HI> their <HI>Kings,</HI> and could likewise <HI>Depose</HI> them, till those Kingdoms became <HI>Hereditary,</HI> which was but of <HI>modern times.</HI> I shall omit <HI>Poland,</HI> because perhaps you may dispute whether it is a <HI>Kingdom,</HI> or a <HI>Commonwealth.</HI> But if we pass into <HI>Hungary,</HI> which was Instituted by the <HI>Huns,</HI> a Nation of <HI>Gothic Ori∣ginal,</HI> we shall find not only the <HI>like Assembly of Estates,</HI> as in the <HI>other Kingdoms,</HI> but also, that they had a <HI>Magistrate</HI> called the <HI>Palatine,</HI> who was as it were the <HI>Conservator</HI> of the <HI>People's Liberties,</HI> and who could <HI>Re∣sist</HI> even the <HI>King</HI> himself, if he <HI>invaded</HI> them, and which is also very re∣markable in all these Kingdoms (except <HI>Denmark</HI>) the <HI>Representatives</HI> of the <HI>Cities,</HI> or <HI>Principal Towns,</HI> (which constituted the <HI>third Estate,</HI> or <HI>Com∣mons</HI> in those Kingdoms) had always a <HI>place</HI> in those <HI>Great Councils.</HI></P>
<P>So that to conclude, it is almost impossible to conceive, how these King∣doms I have now mentioned, could <HI>all agree</HI> to fall into the <HI>same sort</HI> of Government about the same time, unless it had proceeded from the <HI>par∣ticular temper,</HI> and <HI>Genius</HI> of the <HI>Germane</HI> and <HI>Gothick</HI> Nations, from which they were <HI>derived.</HI> Or who can believe, that <HI>all these Nations,</HI> and their <HI>Kings</HI> finding the like Conveniences from these <HI>Great Councils,</HI> and <HI>Incon∣veniences</HI> by the <HI>want</HI> of them, should all <HI>Conspire</HI> to set them up in each of these particular Kingdoms.</P>

<P>I will not deny, but that the <HI>Institution</HI> of <HI>Great Councils,</HI> or <HI>As∣semblies
<PB N="366" REF="200"/>
of the Estates,</HI> might be as <HI>Ancient</HI> as the <HI>Government</HI> it self, in se∣veral of those Kingdoms you mention, which were at <HI>first Elective</HI>; but what is that to <HI>England,</HI> where our <HI>Monarchy</HI> hath bin by <HI>Succession,</HI> from the <HI>first Institution</HI> of it, and not <HI>Elective,</HI> as you suppose. Nor do I much value the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Mirrour,</HI> as to the <HI>Great Antiquity</HI> he Ascribes to this Assembly of <HI>Counts</HI> or (Comites as <HI>Bracton</HI> calls them) and in which by the way, <HI>no Commons</HI> are mentioned.) And tho I grant the <HI>Iudicial Power</HI> of the House of <HI>Peers,</HI> is very <HI>Ancient</HI>: Yet that it <HI>wholy</HI> proceeded at first from the <HI>Indulgence</HI> of our <HI>Kings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F.F.O.I. p.</HI> 34.</NOTE> appears from hence, that there was always <HI>a necessity</HI> of the <HI>King's Presence</HI> in <HI>Parliaments,</HI> which is very well proved by Sir <HI>Robert Cotton,</HI> in a Learned Treatise written on that Subject; where∣in he proves, that in <HI>all Consultations</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> and <HI>Decisions</HI> of <HI>private Plaints,</HI> it is clear from all times, the <HI>King</HI> was not <HI>only present</HI> to <HI>Advise,</HI> but also to <HI>Determine.</HI> And whensoever the <HI>King</HI> is <HI>present,</HI> all Power of <HI>Iudging,</HI> which is <HI>derived</HI> from his, ceaseth, the <HI>Votes</HI> of the <HI>Lords</HI> may serve for matter of <HI>Advice,</HI> the <HI>Final Iudgment</HI> is only the <HI>Kings</HI>: But indeed of late years, Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> by reason of their <HI>Sex,</HI> being not so fit for <HI>publick Assemblies,</HI> have brought it <HI>out of use,</HI> by which means it is come to pass, that <HI>many things</HI> which were in <HI>former times</HI> acted by <HI>Kings</HI> themselves, have of late bin left to the <HI>Iudgment</HI> of the <HI>Peers</HI>; who in quality of <HI>Iudges Extraordinary</HI> are permitted for the <HI>Ease</HI> of the <HI>King,</HI> and in his <HI>Absence</HI> to <HI>determine</HI> such matters as were <HI>Anciently</HI> brought before the <HI>King</HI> himself, sitting in Person, attended by his <HI>Great Council</HI> of <HI>Prelates</HI> and <HI>Peers</HI>: And the <HI>Ordinances</HI> that are made there, receive their <HI>Establishment</HI> either from the <HI>King's Presence</HI> in <HI>Parliament,</HI> where his <HI>Chair of State</HI> is constantly placed, or at least from his <HI>Confir∣mation</HI> of them, who in all Courts, and in all Causes, <HI>is Supream Iudge.</HI> All Judgments are by, or under him, and cannot be <HI>without,</HI> much less <HI>against</HI> his Approbation: <HI>The King only, and none but He, if He were able, should judge all Causes (saith Bracton.)</HI> so that nothing seems plainer to me, than that the <HI>Iurisdiction</HI> which the House of <HI>Peers</HI> have hitherto exercised for the <HI>Hearing</HI> and <HI>Determining</HI> all Causes, as well <HI>Civil</HI> as <HI>Criminal,</HI> by way of <HI>Appeal,</HI> not only between <HI>Subjects,</HI> but also in all <HI>Accusations</HI> against the <HI>Lords</HI> themselves, proceeds <HI>wholy</HI> from the <HI>Kings,</HI> which may appear by an <HI>Ancient Precedent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Script. x An.</HI> 1041. <HI>Col.</HI> 937.</NOTE> mentioned by Abbot <HI>Brampton</HI> in his History. It is the Case between King <HI>Edw. the Confessor,</HI> and <HI>Godwin</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> whom the King <HI>accused</HI> for the Death of his Brother Prince <HI>Alfred,</HI> before the House of <HI>Peers,</HI> and there you will find, that after the Earl had put himself upon the <HI>Iudgment</HI> of the <HI>Kings Court,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> thereupon said: You Noble <HI>Lords, Earls</HI> and <HI>Barons (i. e.

it (the Historian there sayeth) <HI>He ratified all they had judged.</HI> I could give you many <HI>other Precedents</HI> of latter Date, were it not too tedious: But this is sufficient to shew, that what the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers</HI> acted in this matter, was by the <HI>King's Sole Will</HI> and <HI>Permission.</HI> I shall only conclude with one Precedent more, in Case of some what alike Nature.

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad your last Argument doth not prove so <HI>formidable,</HI> as you suppose, for to remove that out of the way. I must tell you, that you now very much <HI>mistake</HI> the Question, which is not only concerning the <HI>Iu∣dicial power</HI> of the <HI>Peers alone,</HI> but the <HI>Legislative Power</HI> of the House of <HI>Peers</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> taken together, which is the Subject of our <HI>present Dis∣pute.</HI> And therefore if I should grant you, that the <HI>Iudicial Power</HI> of the <HI>Peers</HI>▪ is derived <HI>wholy</HI> from the <HI>King,</HI> Yet would it not at all <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the <HI>Legislative Power</HI> of <HI>either</HI> of the <HI>Houses,</HI> which <HI>no Historian</HI> or <HI>Law-book</HI> that I know of (that is of any Credit or Antiquity) ascribes to the <HI>King's Favour,</HI> as you suppose. Nor is it true, that the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Peers</HI> can give <HI>no Iudgment,</HI> either <HI>Civil</HI> or <HI>Criminal,</HI> without the <HI>King's Con∣sent</HI> or <HI>Approbation,</HI> which is never so much as askt, let the Cause be what it will; nor is his <HI>Presence</HI> at such Judgments at all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but indeed you confound the <HI>King's Council</HI> in <HI>Parliament</HI> (where I have shewed you al∣ready, he sat and dispatched divers Causes in a Room or Chambe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, distinct from that of the <HI>Peers</HI>) with the House of <HI>Lords.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to your <HI>main Argument,</HI> that our <HI>Parliament</HI> must owe its <HI>Original</HI> to the <HI>King,</HI> because <HI>each of the Estates</HI> of which it consists doth so. This I hope will prove as weak, when throughly considered: For first of all, I could shew you, that <HI>those Councils</HI> could not owe their <HI>Original</HI> to the <HI>K.</HI> since the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings rather owed their <HI>Original</HI> to them, by whom they were most commonly <HI>Elected,</HI> as I could shew you out of our <HI>Ancient Historians,</HI> if it were now a proper time for it. But as for our <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Abbots, &amp;c.</HI> which anciently made so great a figure in our <HI>Saxon Great Councils</HI> (which I can shew you, were then both <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siastic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Assemblies</HI>) I have already proved out of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> that among the <HI>Ancient
<PB N="368" REF="201"/>
Germans</HI> (a part of whom our Ancient <HI>English Saxons</HI> were) their <HI>Priests</HI> (who were their <HI>Clergy</HI>) had a <HI>Considerable Authority</HI> in their <HI>Common Councils.</HI> And can any body believe, that a <HI>sort of People</HI> so <HI>Powerful</HI> and <HI>Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ile,</HI> as the <HI>Priests</HI> then were, would <HI>lose their Power</HI> after they came over into <HI>England?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 13.</NOTE> And we find in <HI>Bede</HI> that <HI>Edwin</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> consulted with a <HI>Council</HI> of his <HI>Great M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> and <HI>Priests,</HI> concerning his embracing the <HI>Chri∣stian R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ligi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> and when it was generally received, can any body think, that the <HI>Christian Bish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI> would not expect to <HI>Succeed</HI> in the <HI>same Stati∣on,</HI> which the <HI>Heathen Priests</HI> before held in their <HI>Coun∣cils</HI>? And that they enjoyed this Power very early, ap∣pears from hence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.</HI> Spel. <HI>Coun. p.</HI> 619, 620.</NOTE> that the same <HI>Ethelbert</HI> could not en∣dow the Church and Monastery of <HI>Canterbury, Sine Assen∣su Magnatum &amp; Principum tam Cleri quam Populi.</HI></P>
<P>But indeed you are as much <HI>mistaken</HI> in the manner of the <HI>Ancient E∣lections</HI> of <HI>Bishops,</HI> and <HI>Abbots</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> For tho I own that at the time of the <HI>Conquest,</HI> and somewhat <HI>before</HI> there might be <HI>no such Elections</HI> of them as the <HI>Ancient Canons</HI> required, Yet that this was not so at the <HI>first</HI> you may see in <HI>Bede's</HI> Ecclesiastical History, and other Historians, where it is often mentioned, that <HI>Bishops</HI> were <HI>chosen</HI> according to the <HI>Canons</HI> by the <HI>Archbishops</HI> and <HI>Bishops</HI> of the <HI>Province,</HI> and <HI>Abbots</HI> by their <HI>Convent</HI>: Nor was the Kings investing of them <HI>per annulum, &amp; Bacculum,</HI> then lookt up∣on as any <HI>Derogation</HI> to their <HI>Canonical Election,</HI> that being no more than either a <HI>Ceremony</HI> of investing them with their <HI>Temporalities,</HI> or a <HI>token</HI> of the King's <HI>Confirmation</HI> of the <HI>Election.</HI> And that this was so, appears by King <HI>Edgars</HI> Charter to the Abby of <HI>Glastenbury,</HI> wherein he retains to himself and his Heirs, <HI>jus tribuendi fratri Electo baculum pastoralem.</HI></P>
<P>But that which so much Scandalized both <HI>Ingulf</HI> and <HI>Malmsbury,</HI> was a Custom <HI>then</HI> in use, as also long <HI>before</HI> the <HI>Conquest,</HI> of confirming the <HI>Bi∣shop Elect</HI> in a full Synod or <HI>Parliament.</HI> And to this Custom, <HI>Ingulf</HI> re∣fers when he tells us, <HI>A multis annis retroactis nulla eras Electio Prelatorum merè Libera,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ingulph. Hist. fol.</HI> 509. <HI>b.</HI></NOTE> <HI>&amp; Canonica: Sed omnes Dig∣nitates tam Episcoporum quam Abbatum Regis Curia pro su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> complacentia conferebat.</HI> Where by <HI>Curia Regis,</HI> you must not understand the <HI>King's Court</HI> in the Sense it is commonly taken, but for the <HI>Great Council</HI> or <HI>Mikel Synod,</HI> as it was then called, and which dispatch∣ed <HI>Ecclesiastical,</HI> as well as <HI>Civil Affairs,</HI> in the same Sense as <HI>Curia Regis</HI> is used by <HI>Brompton,</HI> in the Case of King <HI>Edw.</HI> and Earl <HI>Godwin,</HI> which you but now cited. And in which Sense it is always used by <HI>Ingulph,</HI> when he speaks of the <HI>Great Councils</HI> under the two <HI>Williams</HI>: I will not be very tedious on this Subject, and shall therefore give you but <HI>one Authority</HI> on this Head, and it is that of <HI>Walslan,</HI> who was made Bishop of <HI>Worcester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 20.10.</NOTE> in the time of <HI>Edw. the Confessor,</HI> and that as <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> tells us, <HI>Vnanimi consensu tam Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri, quam to∣tius Plebis (Rege ut quem vellent sibi eligerent praesulem annuente) in Episco∣pum ejusdem loci eligitur.</HI> And then he goes on thus, <HI>Nam licet fratrum non deesset electio,</HI> Yet that there concurred to it, <HI>Plebis petitio Voluntas
<PB N="369" REF="201"/>
Episcoporum, Gratia Procerum, Regis Authoritas</HI>: All which amounts to no more, than that he was <HI>Elected, Chosen</HI> and <HI>Confirmed</HI> by the <HI>King,</HI> and all the <HI>Three Estates.</HI> For here is the <HI>Petition</HI> of the <HI>Commons</HI> joyned with the <HI>Good-will</HI> of the <HI>Lords,</HI> and both backt by the <HI>Kings Authority.</HI> Yet that all this did not hinder him from being invested <HI>per Baculum, &amp; Annulum</HI> as the Custom then was, may appear by the Speech this Bishop <HI>Wulstan</HI> made at the Tomb of <HI>Edward the Confessor,</HI> whither he went to re∣sign his <HI>Pastoral Staff</HI> after his being <HI>deprived</HI> of his Bishoprick, by Arch-Bishop <HI>Lanfrank,</HI> and the <HI>Synod.</HI> And the Conclusion of this Speech is remarkable, <HI>Tibi,</HI> (Scil. <HI>Edwardo</HI>) <HI>Baculum resigno qui d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>disti, Curam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orum dimitto quos mihi commendasti.</HI> A like Example I could give you of the <HI>Election</HI> of this Arch-Bishop <HI>Lanfrank</HI> himself in the Kings <HI>Curia,</HI> or <HI>Great Council</HI> not long after the <HI>Entrance</HI> of K. <HI>William</HI>; but for this I refer you to <HI>Eadmerus.</HI></P>
<P>But admitting that the <HI>King alone</HI> had in those days <HI>conferred</HI> all <HI>Bishop∣ricks,</HI> does it therefore follow, that his <HI>Nomination</HI> of <HI>Bishops</HI> in the <HI>Pursuance</HI> of that <HI>Trust,</HI> which the <HI>Kingdom reposed</HI> in him did likewise make them to <HI>derive all the Right</HI> they had to sit in the <HI>Great Council</HI> from the King's <HI>Sole Authority</HI>? you might indeed with as much Reason urge, that because the Emperour <HI>Theodosius</HI> (as likewise divers of his Pre∣decessours) did Nominate Bishops to Sees, therefore they did likewise receive from them <HI>all the Authority</HI> they had of <HI>appearing,</HI> and <HI>acting</HI> in <HI>General Councils,</HI> which I am sure you are too good a <HI>Church of England Men</HI> to affirm.</P>

<P>I must confess, I never did so closely examine the <HI>Ancient Form</HI> of con∣ferring of Bishopricks <HI>before the Conquest,</HI> as I find you have done, and I will better Examine your <HI>Authorities,</HI> and if I find <HI>this Custom</HI> to have been <HI>constant</HI> and <HI>uniform</HI> I shall come over to your opinion; tho' I doubt it will not prove to have been <HI>so general</HI> as you would make it, since by the <HI>Authority</HI> you have now brought out of <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> it appears, that it was the <HI>King</HI> who gave leave to this <HI>Election</HI> of Bishop <HI>Wulstan</HI> in the <HI>Great Council,</HI> which I am not yet convinc'd did then take upon them to <HI>meddle</HI> in <HI>Ecclesiastical matters</HI> without the <HI>Kings Consent</HI>: but since you have spoken enough concerning the <HI>Right,</HI> and <HI>Antiquity</HI> of the <HI>Bishops sitting</HI> in our <HI>Great Councils,</HI> it is time you now speak of the <HI>Right</HI> of the <HI>Peers,</HI> or <HI>Temporal Lords,</HI> which certainly could have <HI>no place</HI> there but from the <HI>Favour</HI> and <HI>Concession</HI> of our <HI>Kings</HI>: So that whether we consider <HI>those Lords</HI> in the <HI>Saxon</HI> time as <HI>Rulers</HI> of <HI>Counties,</HI> called in old English <HI>Earls</HI> or <HI>Aldermen,</HI> in Latin <HI>Duces,</HI> or <HI>Comites,</HI> or else as Judges or Coun∣sellors called in old <HI>Saxon, Wites,</HI> or <HI>Wisemen,</HI> in Latin <HI>Sapientes</HI>; or lastly as <HI>Thanes,</HI> in Latin <HI>Ministri,</HI> who were either <HI>Military Tenants,</HI> or <HI>Civil Ministers,</HI> or else <HI>Officers</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> in his Court, or other <HI>Employments,</HI> none of them were <HI>Hereditary</HI> in those times, but all of them either <HI>de∣pended</HI> upon the <HI>King's VVill,</HI> or else owed their <HI>Honours</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>states</HI> to his <HI>Favour,</HI></P>

<P>I hope, notwithstanding the Confidence you put in this part of the Argument, that it hath no more weight in it, than the former. For tho'
<PB N="370" REF="202"/>
I grant there was no such thing as <HI>Hereditary Earldoms</HI> before the <HI>coming</HI> in of the <HI>Normans</HI>; so that tho both the <HI>Earls</HI> and <HI>Aldermen</HI> might have places in the <HI>Great Councils, ratione officii</HI> (as the Earl Mareschal of <HI>England</HI> has at this day) and not by <HI>Tenure,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.</HI> Dugdale<HI>'s Preface to his Baronage of</HI> England.</NOTE> as they did <HI>after</HI> that time: Yet I very much doubt, whe∣ther they sate there only <HI>ratione officii,</HI> and not as <HI>Thanes,</HI> or by reason of their <HI>great Lordships,</HI> or <HI>Estates</HI> in Lands, but if they sate there as <HI>Earls</HI> or <HI>Alderm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI>; yet might they not be the <HI>only Persons</HI> that sate in those <HI>Councils</HI> by that <HI>Title</HI>: For there were besides these, <HI>Aldermen</HI> of <HI>Cities</HI> and <HI>Burroug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> who were <HI>E∣lected</HI> by those Places, and who it is very likely <HI>appeared</HI> for them as their <HI>Representatives</HI> in those Councils, until by <HI>Succession</HI> of time those Towns began to send <HI>two Burgesses</HI> in their stead, some <HI>Footsteps</HI> of which still re∣main in <HI>London,</HI> where the <HI>Aldermen</HI> of every <HI>Ward</HI> are first proposed to be <HI>Elected</HI> Parliament Men before any other, and it is certain that these <HI>Al∣dermen,</HI> in the most <HI>Ancient Cities,</HI> as <HI>London, York, Lincoln,</HI> &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. are not <HI>Elected</HI> by any <HI>Grant</HI> or <HI>Charter</HI> from the <HI>Crown,</HI> but by an <HI>immemo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial Right</HI> of <HI>Prescription.</HI></P>
<P>But admitting that these <HI>Earls</HI> or <HI>Aldermen</HI> appeared in these <HI>Coun∣cils,</HI> by reason of their <HI>Offices,</HI> or <HI>Dignities</HI> which the <HI>King</HI> conferred up∣on them, yet doth it not prove, that the very <HI>Office</HI> it self <HI>proceeded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> from him, since we find the <HI>Authority</HI> of those chief Men, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> calls <HI>Princes</HI> (and which Answer these <HI>Earls</HI>) to have been used among the <HI>Ancient Germans</HI> long before, when he tells us in the same Chapter, where we cited the rest: <HI>Iura per Pag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osque [Principes] reddunt, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enteni Singulis ex plebe Comites Consilium simul, &amp; auctoritas adsunt.</HI> Which exactly answers our <HI>County</HI> and <HI>Hundred Courts,</HI> under the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, wherein the <HI>Alderman</HI> of the County or his Deputy the <HI>Sheriff</HI> pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ided, and the <HI>Free Men</HI> of the County or Hundred were the <HI>Iudges</HI> of all mat∣ters of Fact. So that tho the <HI>King</HI> might appoint these <HI>Princes</HI> or <HI>Go∣vernours</HI> of <HI>Provinces,</HI> or <HI>Counties,</HI> yet doth it no more follow, that they owed their <HI>Being</HI> and Place in the <HI>great Council</HI> wholy to his <HI>Will,</HI> than (as I said before) supposing that the <HI>King</HI> had Anciently the <HI>Nom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nation</HI> of all the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Abbots</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> that therefore they must also owe their <HI>Place</HI> in our <HI>great Councils,</HI> or <HI>Synods wholy</HI> to them, since the <HI>King</HI> performed both of them as a <HI>Publick Trust</HI> committed to him by the <HI>Common Weal</HI> in the <HI>one</HI> case, as much as in the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>But indeed, I think the <HI>greatest part</HI> of the <HI>Members</HI> of this <HI>Assembly</HI> (besides <HI>Aldermen,</HI> and <HI>Burgesses</HI> for Cities and Towns) consisted of those <HI>Thanes,</HI> whose Names are often found in the <HI>Subscription</HI> of the <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient Charters</HI> of our <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings after the <HI>Principes, Duces</HI> and <HI>Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s,</HI> and that tho many of them might be the <HI>Kings Feudal Thanes,</HI> or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Grand Serjeanty,</HI> or <HI>Knights S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvice</HI> in Chief, as Mr. <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lden</HI> tells us in his <HI>Titles of Honour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Seld.

of <HI>Townships</HI> (afterwards) called <HI>Maunors,</HI> with Courts annexed to them under the Names of <HI>Sac</HI> &amp; <HI>Soc</HI>; which were the same with our <HI>Court-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> and <HI>Court-Baron</HI>: Especially if you please farther to consider, what a vast n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mber of <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or <HI>Free Tenants</HI> there were then, who held their Lands <HI>Discharged</HI> of all Services, but the <HI>Common Burthens</HI> and <HI>Taxes</HI> of the Nation, none but the Lands of the <HI>Kings Thanes,</HI> being held by <HI>Mili∣tary S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvices,</HI> before the <HI>Entrance</HI> of the <HI>Normans.</HI></P>
<P>So that whoever will but consider the <HI>Nature</HI> of our <HI>Saxon Councils,</HI> will find, that the <HI>Greatest part</HI> of the <HI>Persons</HI> that appeared there, did not owe their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to their being the <HI>King's Ministers</HI> or <HI>Officers,</HI> as you sup∣pose▪ but to their holding such <HI>Lands</HI> and <HI>Poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssions</HI> as Capacitated them, and gave them a <HI>Right</HI> to have <HI>places</HI> in those <HI>Great Councils</HI>: And that this was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we need go no further, than the <HI>Laws</HI> of King <HI>Athel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an,</HI> where you will find <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mility</HI> it self▪ annexed to an <HI>Estate</HI> in Land.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Lamb. p.</HI> 54.</NOTE> For if you will but be pleased to Consult King <HI>Athelston</HI>'s <HI>Laws,</HI> you will there find, that if a <HI>Villa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aus</HI> or <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eorl</HI> could so thrive, as to get an Estate of <HI>five Hides</HI> in Lands, he was reckon'd a <HI>Thane,</HI> i. e. a <HI>Gentleman</HI> or <HI>Nobleman,</HI> as they were promiscuoully reckoned at that time.</P>
<P>So that tho I suppose, there might not be in those times that <HI>exact di∣stinction</HI> between <HI>Peers</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> as there hath bin <HI>established</HI> since the coming in of the <HI>Normans</HI>; Yet was it the <HI>same thing</HI> in effect, since the <HI>Bishops. Earls</HI> or <HI>Aldermen</HI> of Shires (tho not enjoyed as <HI>Hereditary Ho∣nours</HI>) might make then the <HI>Greater Nobility</HI> or <HI>Peers,</HI> as the <HI>Thanes</HI> were the Less <HI>Nobility, Gentlemen</HI> or <HI>Freeholders</HI>; who all appearing in person, might together with the <HI>Aldermen</HI> or <HI>Burgesses</HI> of Towns <HI>Represent</HI> those which we now call the <HI>Commons</HI>; And supposing that then there were <HI>no Knights of Shires,</HI> yet these being then the <HI>only Proprietors</HI> of any <HI>con∣siderable Estates</HI> of Land in the Nation, might very well <HI>represent</HI> all their <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssals</HI> or <HI>Vnder-Tenents,</HI> as Tenents for years, and at Will, are at this day by the <HI>Knights of Shires,</HI> tho they have <HI>no Votes</HI> at their <HI>El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, tho I grant that the <HI>King's</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> are the <HI>Fountain</HI> of that <HI>Honour,</HI> which we call <HI>Peerage</HI>: Yet it is <HI>only</HI> in Pursuance of that <HI>Ancient Constitution,</HI> which their Ancestors brought out of <HI>Old Saxony</HI> and <HI>Normandy,</HI> along with them, as the <HI>firmest defence</HI> of <HI>Kingly Power</HI> against the Insolency and <HI>Encroachments</HI> of the <HI>Common</HI> or <HI>Meaner</HI> sort of People, as well as <HI>Tyranny</HI> in their <HI>Princes.</HI> And therefore in <HI>all Monarchies</HI> where there is no <HI>Hereditary Nobility,</HI> the <HI>Prince</HI> hath no <HI>surer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay</HI> to maintain his <HI>Power,</HI> than by <HI>Standing Armies,</HI> to whose Humours and Pactions, he is <HI>more Subject,</HI> and is also <HI>more liable</HI> to be <HI>Murdered,</HI> or <HI>Deposed</HI> by them (when discontented with him) than ever any <HI>limited Prince</HI> yet was, or can be by his <HI>Nobility</HI> or <HI>People</HI>: As I could shew you from a multitude of Examples, not only from the <HI>Roman,</HI> but <HI>Moorish, Arabick</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI> Histories; and therefore to constitute a lasting stable <HI>limited Monarchy</HI> (as ours is) it must be according to the <HI>Model</HI> I have here Proposed.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not contradict the <HI>latter part</HI> of your Discourse; but I must freely tell you, that if as (you your self grant,) there were <HI>no Knights of
<PB N="372" REF="203"/>
Shires</HI> in the <HI>Saxon</HI> times, I cannot see how those we call the <HI>vulgar</HI> or <HI>Commons</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> had then <HI>any Representatives</HI> in the <HI>Great Council,</HI> since those <HI>Thanes</HI> or <HI>Lords of Mannors,</HI> whom you suppose to have <HI>Represented</HI> their <HI>Tenants</HI> or <HI>Vassals,</HI> were never <HI>chosen</HI> by them, and consequently could not <HI>properly</HI> be their <HI>Representatives</HI>: But I think it will be easy enough to prove, that none of your <HI>Inferior</HI> or <HI>middle Thanes,</HI> but only the <HI>Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f</HI> or <HI>Superior,</HI> had <HI>places</HI> in those <HI>Assemblies.</HI> So that these <HI>Feudal Thanes,</HI> or such as held of the <HI>King in Chief</HI> by <HI>Military Service,</HI> were of the <HI>sam: Kind</HI> with them that were after the <HI>Norman</HI> times, <HI>Honorary</HI> or <HI>Parlia∣mentary Barons,</HI> and their <HI>Thainlands</HI> alone, were the <HI>Honorary Thainlands,</HI> and such as were afterwards <HI>Parliamentary Baronies.</HI> Nor can I find any <HI>Footsteps</HI> in our Ancient <HI>English</HI> Histories of <HI>Cities</HI> and <HI>Buroughs,</HI> sending any <HI>Representatives</HI> to those <HI>Great Councils</HI>: So that admit I should own at present, that the <HI>Bishops</HI> and some <HI>Great Abbots,</HI> had from the <HI>first Set∣ling</HI> of Christianity in this Island, an <HI>Indisputable place</HI> in the <HI>Great Coun∣cils,</HI> and likewise that the <HI>Earls, Aldermen</HI> or <HI>Great Nobility,</HI> had also <HI>Votes</HI> in those <HI>Assemblies,</HI> and that the <HI>Chief Thanes,</HI> or <HI>less Nobles,</HI> had also their <HI>places</HI> there, by reason of the <HI>Tenure</HI> of their Estates; yet certainly the <HI>House of Commons</HI> was of a much <HI>later Date,</HI> and owed its <HI>being</HI> either to the <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Favour</HI> of our <HI>Kings</HI> of the <HI>Norman</HI> Race, or else to those that had <HI>Vsurp't</HI> their Power: And this I think Dr. <HI>Brady</HI> hath very well proved against Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI>; and I think I could convince you also of the <HI>Truth</HI> of it by <HI>his,</HI> as well as <HI>other Arguments,</HI> were it not now too late to enter upon so long a Subject.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>HAving in my last Discourse treated of the <HI>Legislative</HI> Power of this King∣dom, as also the Ancient Constitution of our English Government by great Councils or Parliaments; (the former of which questions, I should scarce have dwelt so long upon, had I then known of a Learned Treatise now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be publisht on that Subject) I am at last arrived at the hardest, and most im∣portant, though perhaps in the Iudgment of some, the driest, and most unpleasant part of my Task, <HI>viz.</HI> Who were anciently the constituent Parts or Orders of Men who made up th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Assemblies; That the <HI>Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, and Chief Thanes, or Barons,</HI> were Principal Members, is granted by all Parties; but whether there were from the very Original of these Great Councils, (nay, till long after the coming in of the <HI>Normans</HI>) any Representatives for the <HI>Commons,</HI> as we now call them, in distinction from the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, is a doubt; which as it was (for ought I can find) first raised by an <HI>Italian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pol. Virgil.</HI></NOTE> who writ the History of <HI>England</HI> in the last Age, so hath it been continued by some Antiqua∣ries of our present Age; though the first that ever appeared to prove the contrary, was a Treatise published by <HI>James Howel</HI> in the <HI>Cottoni Posthuma,</HI> under the Name of Sir <HI>Robert Cotton,</HI> about <HI>1654.</HI> but whether it was his or no, I know not; only it was supposed to be so by Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> in his Preface to the Collection of Records, which he published under the Name of the same Author in <HI>1657.</HI> and after him this No∣tion of the Bishops, Lords, and other Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> being the Sole Representative for the whole Nation in those Councils, was next printed in the Second part of Sir <HI>Henry Spelman</HI>'s <HI>Glossary, Tit. Parliamentum</HI>; where King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter is made use of at the main Argument to prove that Assertion. The next who appear'd in Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt on this Question, was Sir <HI>Will. Dugdale</HI> in his <HI>Origines Juridiciales,</HI> who though he Transcribed the same Notion and Arguments from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-mentioned <HI>Glossary,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. 15.</HI></NOTE> yet allows the Commons of <HI>England</HI> to have been <HI>always after some manner</HI> represented in Parliament, though not by Repre∣sentatives of their own chusing; yet agrees with the Author of the passage in the <HI>Glos∣sary,</HI> that the Commons first began by R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llion in the <HI>49</HI>th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third.</P>
<P>Which Opinions being looke upon not only as Novel and Erron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous, but dangerous to the Parlamental Rights and Liberties of the People of this Nation, were opposed by <HI>William
<PB REF="205"/>
Petyt</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in his Treatise, intituled, The <HI>Rights</HI> of the <HI>Commons</HI> of <HI>England</HI> assertio; which was also seconded by the Author of the Treatise, called <HI>Jani Anglorum facies Nova</HI>; but it was not long before both these Books were animadverted upon by Dr. <HI>Brady,</HI> in two several Editions of his Answers to them; and these were again vindicated by the Author of <HI>Jani Anglorum, &amp;c.</HI> in another Treatise, intituled <HI>Jus Anglorum ab Antiquo</HI>; which hath not been yet answered.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in giving an account of these Authors, because the Controversie having been largely debated in them, I have for the saving your trouble of reading so many several Books, reduced all the material Arguments and Authorities man use of by both Parties in this weighty Controversie, into this Dialogue, and the next, since so copious an Argument could not be dispatch'd in a less compas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have not here given you all the Arguments and Authorities that are there made use of, but only the most material and indisputable; yet I hope I have used this Liberty with that sincerity and respect to those Learned Authors, that none of them shall have any just ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t to complain of any Partiality; And therefore I have as near as I could, confined my self to the Words of those Authors, as you will find by the Quotations in the Margin.</P>
<P>But I must own, that having had the happiness of a long and familiar acquaintance with Mr. <HI>Petyt,</HI> I have been furnished by him with divers Authorities (both Manus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>p: and Printed) not hitherto taken notice of by any on this Subject: And had I the like oppor∣tunity of being personally known to the <HI>Dr:</HI> I should have desired the same favour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for such Replies as he might perhaps make to them. Therefore all I can now do in this Case is, that if the Dr. or any Friend of his, shall think it worth their while to peruse, and impartially to consider these Discourses, and shall then remain unsatisfied with any of the Authorities or Arguments here made use of; if either he or they shall think fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> any Observations on them, and will communicate their Papers to the <HI>Publisher</HI> of these Di∣alogues, I do here ingage to take care that they shall be fairly and truly published with Answers to them, if they will admit of any, in an Appendix at the end of the whole Work, when it is finished.</P>
<P>I have little more to trouble you with, than to assure you, That all the Authorities here made use of from our <HI>English</HI> Historians and Records, are truly cited, without leaving out or concealing any thing that I thought made for or against either Opinion; but as for the Records, they are either such as having been sufficiently tried, have passed for current between the Dr and his Antagonists, or else such as I have seen and examined with my own Eyes, and considered the purport of them.</P>
<P>But I hope you will pardon me if I seem too prolix in the beginning of this Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>se, in the interpretation of divers Words and Phrases used by the Dr. and his Opponents in a quite different sense from our Ancient Historians, Records and Statutes; for if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ous use, and equivocal meaning of those Expressions be truly stated, and laid open accor∣ding to the several Ages in which those Authors lived, or such Laws were made, I reck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this great Dispute as good as half ended.</P>
<P>All that I shall farther desire of you is, carefully and diligently to peruse the Argu∣ments and Authorities, and to examine the truth of them your self, if you doubt of any thing in them, weighing and comparing Historian with Historian, and Record with Re∣cord, and sometimes both together, as the Subject-Matter requires, and then I kept you will be able to make a right and impartial Iudgment on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; For as I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in my Province fairly to report other mens Arguments and Notions, so it is yours to judge of them, which I heartily desire may be without any unjust Byass or Partiality to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Side.</P>

<HEAD>THE Sixth Dialogue BETWEEN Mr. <HI>FREEMAN</HI> a Gentleman, AND Mr. <HI>MEANWELL</HI> a Civilian.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, You are welcome; and since you were pleased to send me word, that you would come and sit with me this Evening, I have been looking over all the <HI>Saxon</HI> Councils, collected by Mr. <HI>Lambard,</HI> and Sir <HI>H. Spelman,</HI> and yet I cannot find in them any mention of Knights of Shires, or Burgesses for Cities or Burroughs; the only persons there mentioned, as Members of those Great Councils, being <HI>Arch∣bishops, Bishops, Abbots,</HI> and <HI>Great Lords,</HI> and <HI>Iudges</HI>; often called by the general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Names of <HI>Magnates, Principes, Proceres, Optimates,</HI> or <HI>Primates Regni,</HI> which were all comprehended under the <HI>Saxon</HI> Word, <HI>VVites,</HI> i. e. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tit.</HI> Wites. <HI>B.</HI> G.</NOTE> by whom (as Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI> shews us in his Glossary) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> meant only <HI>Senators,</HI> or Wise-men; that is, either <HI>Noblemen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Great Lawyers; VVite,</HI> in <HI>Somner</HI>'s <HI>Saxon</HI> Dictionary, being first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>endred <HI>Optimas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 66, 67.</NOTE> a Noble Man; and then <HI>Sapiens,</HI> a Wise-man. So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these <HI>VVites,</HI> or <HI>Sapientes</HI> (so often mentioned in our Ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Laws) when they are put alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Et Sparsim.</NOTE> signifie all the Ecclesiastic, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well as Lay-Members of the great Council, such as Earls, Al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>men, and Thanes, and Judges, as Dr. <HI>B.</HI> more particularly proves, in his Glossary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the end of his first Volume. But by <HI>Principes,</HI> and <HI>Optimates,</HI> can only be meant <HI>Nobles,</HI> or <HI>Chief Men,</HI> as the Word <HI>Princeps, Magnas,</HI> and <HI>Optimas</HI> do al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ys signifie in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue; That is to say, such of the King's great Offi∣cers, Noblemen, and Judges of the Kingdom, as he pleased to chuse out, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to his Great Councils, either for their great Wisdom or Estates, to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their Advice and Assistance for the making of Laws.</P>
<P>Therefore pray shew me where there are any Commons once mentioned in any of these Councils,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. P.</HI> 9, 10.</NOTE> or any that represented them.
<PB N="374" REF="206"/>
Here are indeed particularly mentioned, <HI>Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Ab∣bots, Aldermen, Wites, Great-men,</HI> and <HI>Chief-men,</HI> or <HI>Noblemen.</HI> These were all the Orders of men that were then the constituent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of those Great Councils, <HI>Wittena-Gemotes.</HI> And if the Commons, as now taken, and understood, were then Members of them, they must be com∣prehended amongst the <HI>Wites</HI> or <HI>Sapientes,</HI> the Wise-men. But that it cannot pro∣bably be so, I shall prove (1.) That most of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Laws, in their Prefaces are said to be made and ordained by their Kings, with the Advice and Assistance of their <HI>VVites,</HI> or Wise-men simply, without mentioning any particular Orders of men whatsoever. And when any Rank or Degrees of men are particularly men∣tioned, they are only the same before rehearsed, both Ecclesiasticks and Laicks (2.) I note, that it cannot be denied, but that in every one of these <HI>Wittena G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣motes, Micel Synods, Micel Gemotes,</HI> or <HI>Great Councils,</HI> where the Laws are said to be made only by the King, with the advice of his <HI>Wites</HI> or <HI>Sapientes,</HI> without particularizing any degrees of Persons, the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Abbots</HI> for the Spiritual Nobility, and the <HI>Eorls,</HI> or <HI>Aldermen</HI> and <HI>Thanes,</HI> for the Temporal, were present at the making of them; as also the Judges, if there were any of the higher Class, other than <HI>Bishops, Aldermen,</HI> and <HI>Gereves,</HI> or <HI>Praepositi.</HI> (3.) I note, that it follows from thence, that these all jointly were the <HI>Sapientes,</HI> where there are only <HI>Wites</HI> or <HI>Sapientes</HI> in general named, without reciting any particular Orders or Degrees of Men. Now if you can shew me from as good Authorities as I have here produced, that any of the Commons sate in these Great Councils, at least to represent the Body of the Commons among the <HI>Saxons,</HI> I will grant, that du∣ring the <HI>Saxon</HI> Government, the Freemen, or Commons of <HI>England,</HI> as now cal∣led, and distinguished from the Great Lords, were an essential constituent part of the Common Councils of those times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>To return you as short an Answer as I can, to those Authorities you now cite, I must in the first place premise, That tho I grant all <HI>Nobility</HI> among the ancient <HI>Germans, Saxons,</HI> and <HI>Franks</HI> (who were but so many Stirps or Branches of the <HI>Gothic</HI> Nation) were at first wholly Military; yet it is a very great mi∣stake, and savours of the Prejudices of the Age and Country we live in, to ima∣gine, that anciently there were the same Distinctions between Peers, or Noble∣men, and Gentlemen, (whom we now call Commoners) as there are now. For if we go but over into <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Germany,</HI> we shall find no difference there be∣tween the greater and the less Nobility; and a Gentleman is as noble as a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke, or a Marquiss. And if we pass farther, into <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> from whence most of the <HI>Danish</HI> Laws are supposed to come, it is certain, that but few years ago, there were no such Titles among them as <HI>Earls,</HI> or <HI>Barons</HI>; every Lord of a Town, or District, being that which they call an <HI>Adelman,</HI> or <HI>Nobleman.</HI> And so I suppose it anciently was among the <HI>English Saxons.</HI> The Word <HI>Athel,</HI> or <HI>A∣del,</HI> comprehending (to speak in our present Dialect) all Degrees, as well <HI>Noble∣men,</HI> as <HI>Gentlemen</HI>; And for this I can give you the Authority of an Ancient Author, <HI>viz. Paulus Warnefridus de gestis Longobardorum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 21.</NOTE> who speaking of these <HI>Adelmen,</HI> or <HI>Adelings,</HI> tell us; <HI>Sic and eos quidam Nobiles prosapia vocabantur.</HI> So likewise Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI> in his Glossary, <HI>Tit. Adelingi, Tit. p.</HI> 9, 10. writes thus, <HI>Anglorum legibus dici pro nobilibus in genere, quod nec dum apud Germanos antiquatum est, qui omnes nobiles</HI> Aedelmen <HI>vocant▪ a Sax∣onico Aedel pro nobili</HI>; And Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his Titles of Honour, makes the Word <HI>Aethelum</HI> to signifie all one,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 708.</NOTE> either Gentlemen
<PB N="375" REF="206"/>
or Noblemen. Besides, <HI>Adam</HI> of <HI>Bremen,</HI> and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 4.</NOTE> <HI>Nitardus</HI> like∣wise, both Ancient Historians, divide the <HI>Saxon</HI> Nation into three different Degrees, or Orders, <HI>viz</HI> into <HI>Athelings,</HI> i. e. <HI>Nobles, Fri∣lings,</HI> i. e. <HI>Freemen,</HI> and <HI>Lazzos,</HI> i. e. <HI>Villains, Bours,</HI> or <HI>Bondmen.</HI></P>
<P>Besides which <HI>Noblemen,</HI> or <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> there was likewise another sort of men, who tho of an inferior Rank, yet as Freemen, and having a considerable share of the Riches and Strength of the Nation in their hands, had likewise a Place in the Great Councils, as well as the former. And these were the Aldermen, or other Magistrates of Cities and Burroughs; and in this they resembled the <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Diets, whose constituent Members were, according to <HI>Gonterus,</HI> an Ancient <HI>German</HI> Poet,
<Q><L>Praelati, Proceres, missisque potentibus Urbes.</L></Q>
But since this is a Dispute about the Signification of Words, in what sense they were used in that Age we are now treating of, it will not be inconvenient to examine from the most Learned Glossarists, the Ancient Signification of those Words, which are in dispute between us. And therefore, since we are agreed about the meaning of all other Words except these <HI>viz. Aldermen, Thanes, Wites, Magnates, Optimates,</HI> and <HI>Principes, Preceres,</HI> or <HI>Primates,</HI> let us examine each of their Ancient Significations. To begin then with the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>-man, Alderman, which Word was of a very general Signification; For Sir <HI>Hen. Spel∣man</HI> in his Glossary, Tit. Alderman, tells us, that there was <HI>Aldermannus Regis, Comitatus, Civitatis, Burgi,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>de quorum potestate non facile est definire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In his Glossa∣ry Tit. Al∣derman.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Lambard</HI> renders the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>man, <HI>in Latin Senator,</HI> (i. e. <HI>one that had place in the Great Council</HI>) and so doth Mr. <HI>Somner</HI> in his <HI>Saxon</HI> Dictionary, from whence you may learn, that this Word is of a large signification, and might comprehend such as in latter times were called Commons,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tit. Alder∣man.</NOTE> to distinguish them from the Lords or higher Nobility, and could not exclude them.</P>
<P><HI>Verstegan</HI> renders this Word thus, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>So written in our ancient Language,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 326.</NOTE> <HI>is properly an Elder, or Senior; yet an</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>man, <HI>which we call now an Alderman, was such in effect among our Ancestors, as was the Tribunus Plebis with the</HI> Romans, <HI>that is, one that had chief Iurisdiction a∣mong the Commons, as being a Maintainer of their Liberties.</HI> And if so, such per∣sons must certainly have had a place in the Great Council as Commoners; and therefore must from the reason of the thing, signifie something more in those times than an Earl, or great Officer of the King only.</P>
<P>So likewise, that the Word <HI>Thane</HI> comprehended more than the Kings Great Feudal, or Military Tenents, may appear by these Inter∣pretations of it, which our Antiquaries have given us. The Indu∣strious Mr. <HI>Somner,</HI> in his Glossary at the end of the X. <HI>Scriptores,</HI> as also Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his Titles of Honour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 267.</NOTE> do both agree in the difference I now make between the Greater and the Less <HI>Thanes,</HI> the former being called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Thani Regii,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spel. <HI>Council. in Leg. Canu∣ti p.</HI> 69.</NOTE> the other called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Mediocres, vel Inferiores Thani</HI> Mid∣dle, or Less Thanes, who were <HI>Maneriorum Domini, Nobiles mi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es, Vavasores &amp; nonnunquam liberi tenentes</HI>; with whom Sir <HI>H.
<PB N="376" REF="207"/>
Spelman</HI> in his Glossary agrees, <HI>Thanorum duo erant genera, Majores quos Thain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Regis appellabant, nos Barones Regis, &amp; Thaini Simpliciter, seu Thaini Minores qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> iidem erant qui Barones Minores, hoc est Maneriorum Domini, Nobiles minores, &amp; non∣nunquam Liberi Tenentes nuncupantur.</HI> So likewise Mr. <HI>Lambard</HI> in his Glossary,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 223.</NOTE> thus, <HI>Thani autem appellatione viri interdum Nobiles, interdum liberae conditionis homines, interdum Magistratus atque sup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ministri notantur.</HI> And also in his Perambulation of <HI>Kent,</HI> saith, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, was usually taken for the very same that we call now from the <HI>Latin</HI> word <HI>Gentilis,</HI> a Gentleman, that is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>A man well born, or of good Stock and Family.</HI> So that I think nothing can be more evident, than that according to the Opinion of our best Criticks in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Tongue, the word <HI>Thane</HI> doth not always signify a great Lord, or Baron of Parliament, as he is now called, in distinction to an Inferior Nobleman or Gentleman. And that there were also Burgh <HI>Thanes, Thanes</HI> of Cities and Boroughs, will evidently appear from a Writ or Char∣ter of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sub Effigie Fau∣stinae. A.</HI> 3. <HI>F.</HI> 97. <HI>Ex Cartu∣lario Canobi</HI> Westmin.</NOTE> which is still to be found in Sir <HI>Iohn Cotton</HI>'s Library, in these words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Willem <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> alle mine <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> on <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which Charter with divers other of like nature, confirming the Privileges of that Mo∣nastery, were collected by a Monk of Westminster called <HI>Sulcardus,</HI> who lived not long after the Conquest.</P>
<P>In the next place, as for the word <HI>Magnates,</HI> though I grant it there often sig∣nifies Great men or Lords; Yet not only such as were Lords or Noblemen by Birth, but as I shall shew you by several Instances, as well before as after the <HI>Norman</HI> Entrance, that it likewise also comprehended the Gentry, or Inferior Nobility, and such as were eminent and considerable either in the Countries or Cities, for Interest, Office or Estate.</P>
<P>As for the word <HI>Optimates,</HI> I know it signifies the better, or best sort of men, yet not always great Noblemen, or Lords; For in <HI>Monastic Anglic. Tom.</HI> 3. we read of one <HI>Goda,</HI> who under <HI>Edw.</HI> the Confessor subscribed himself <HI>Optimatem, &amp; Ministrum Regalem,</HI> (i. e. <HI>Thane.</HI>) And lest you should apprehend that <HI>Optimas</HI> should always signifie the King's Thane, or <HI>Tenent in Capite, du Fresne</HI> in his Glos∣sary defines <HI>Optimates</HI> to be <HI>Vassalli Barones qui ab ullo Domino ratione Hominu nede pendet</HI>; but I shall speak more of this word <HI>Optimates,</HI> when I come to speak of the times not long after <HI>VVilliam</HI> the <HI>First.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, for the word <HI>Proceres,</HI> it doth not only signifie Men Noble by Birth, but <HI>Isidore</HI> (a <HI>Spanish</HI> Author in the Gothic-times) in his <HI>Origines, Lib.</HI> 9. <HI>Cap.</HI> 4. says thus, <HI>Proceres sunt Principes Civium</HI>; and that this word often signi∣fied in the ancient <HI>English Saxon,</HI> the Chief Magistrates of Cities or Burghs,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 56.</NOTE> appears by <HI>Alfrick</HI>'s ancient Glossary, where these words <HI>Pro∣ceres Primates, vel Primores,</HI> he thus renders <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> buph papa.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 420.</NOTE> And <HI>Du Fresne</HI> in his Glossary says also, <HI>Proceres app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣labantur qui in Civitatibus pracipuos Magistratus gerebant.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="207"/>As for the word <HI>Principes,</HI> any man that understands any thing of the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, knows that it doth not always signifie Princes, or Men Noble by Birth; but any Chief, or Principal Man remarkable by Place, Office or Dignity; and therefore we often read in <HI>Livy,</HI> and other <HI>Latin</HI> Authors of <HI>Principes Civitatis</HI>; and in this sense I suppose every Member of Parliament may be reckoned <HI>inter Principes,</HI> among the most Considerable or Chief Men of the Kingdom: So that when our ancient <HI>English</HI> Historians, (as well before as immediately after the <HI>Nor∣man</HI> Conquest) do often, after the <HI>Arch-Bishops▪ Bishops,</HI> &amp;c. add, <HI>&amp; caeteri to∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Regni Proceres, &amp; Optimates,</HI> or <HI>Principes,</HI> as Members of the great Councils of those times; Yet that these Writers did not then mean what you would under∣stand by these words, only Princes, Earls, or Great Lords, Mr. <HI>Sel∣den</HI> in his Titles of Honour teaches us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 605.</NOTE> when speaking of this word <HI>Principes</HI> (as the most comprehensive of any) says, that though <HI>Princeps</HI> in the Singular, were proper to every <HI>Earl</HI> or <HI>Alderman</HI>; yet in the Plural <HI>Prin∣cipes</HI> is more often applied comprehensively to others also of less, though of special Eminency, such as were <HI>Viri Primarii,</HI> or <HI>Thanes.</HI> And for this he refers us to the Charter of King <HI>Ethelwulf</HI> (as it is recited by <HI>W.</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury, Lib.</HI> 2 <HI>Cap.</HI> 2. And <HI>Ingulph</HI>) wherein that King granted Tithes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 862. <HI>edit. Frank.</HI></NOTE> and divers other Priviledges to the Church Abby of <HI>Malmsbury,</HI> which is said to be done <HI>Consilio Episcoporum, &amp; Principum snorum; as also</HI> of <HI>Hen. Hunt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 364. <HI>Edit. Ibid.</HI></NOTE> who relating the Election of <HI>Harold</HI> the Son of King <HI>Cnute,</HI> expresses it thus; <HI>Fuit magnum placitum apud</HI> Oxon∣ford <HI>ubi Leofricus Consul, &amp; omnes Principes eligerunt Heraldum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> As for the word <HI>Wites</HI> or <HI>Sapientes,</HI> there can be nothing in that word which can limit it only to Men Noble by Birth, since it signifies no more than the King's Great Council of Wise men or Senators, and might also well refer to the Chief Magistrates, or Representatives of great Cities and Boroughs. For <HI>Du Fresne</HI> in his Glossary tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tom.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 700.</NOTE> That among the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbards, Sapientes in Italia appellabant, &amp; Civitatum Cives Pri∣marii. quorum Consilio Respublicae gerebantur.</HI> Hieron. Rubeus <HI>Lib. Hist.</HI> Raven. <HI>Anno</HI> 1297.—<HI>Sed longe antea illud nomen abt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uit in aliis Longobar∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rum Civitatibus ut colligere liceret ex Ottone, &amp; Acerbo Morena in Hist. Rerum L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndevetium,</HI> &amp;c. Nor is this Authority inconsidera∣ble, since the <HI>Lombards</HI> were derived from the <HI>Goths,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Grotius Prole∣gomena in Histor. Gothicam.</HI></NOTE> from whom also the <HI>English Saxons</HI> had their Original, and had the like fundamental Constitution, and were governed by much the same Laws.</P>
<P>But that the Title of <HI>Wites</HI> or <HI>Sapientes,</HI> was often attributed to the <HI>Commons</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> I shall explain to you when I come to treat of the Antiquity of the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons,</HI> after the <HI>Normans</HI> Entrance; where I shall shew you, that divers Petitions were directed a <HI>tres Sages les Communes.</HI> And sure whosoever is chosen by a County, City, or Borough, as their Representative, and is by them thought wise enough to be trusted with their Purses, and to make Laws for them, may very well (I think) be called in Old <HI>English</HI> a <HI>VVite,</HI> or in our modern Dia∣lect, a <HI>Disercet</HI> or <HI>VVise man.</HI> But let this word <HI>VVites</HI> signifie what it will, yet it could never mean here <HI>great Lawyers</HI> or <HI>Iudges,</HI> as your <HI>Dr.</HI> will have it; since I very much doubt whether Law was then a Trade or Profession, or not; And that the <HI>Iudges</HI> in those days had not any more Voice in making Laws, than they
<PB N="378" REF="208"/>
have now, or any more to do in it than in the bare drawing of them up. I am very well satisfied, since if they had any such Power in those days, I do not believe our Kings would ever have let them have lost it, since it was so ad∣vantagious to their Prerogatives that they should keep it. I could give you di∣vers other Authorities, though of later date, to prove that the <HI>Commons</HI> were often included under the word <HI>Sapientes</HI> in our ancient Statutes and Records; but I refer those for the times after the Conquest; but I beg your pardon for being so prolix already, which the abuse your <HI>Dr.</HI> hath put upon these words, would not permit me to avoid. But now we have cleared most of the Terms in dispute between us, I hope we may proceed with greater Certainty.</P>

<P>Though your Discourse hath been long, yet since it is so essentially necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ry to the right understanding the matter in hand, I am well satisfied; and I shall more fully consider the account you give of these words another time; but a present give me leave to tell you, That suppose I should admit, that those words on which you have now given Interpretation of divers Authors, may some∣times be taken in the sense you have now put upon them; and that conse∣quently the <HI>Commons</HI> might be represented under some of those general Names; Yet am I not satisfied, how the <HI>Aldermen</HI> and <HI>Magistrates of Cities and Boroughs,</HI> could be included under this word <HI>VVites,</HI> since in the Auctuary to the 35▪ Law of <HI>Edw.</HI> the Confessor, 'tis said, <HI>Erant &amp; aliae potestates, &amp; dignitates,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. G. p.</HI> 67.</NOTE> <HI>per Provincias, &amp; Patrias universas, &amp; per singulos Comi∣tatus totius Regni constitutae, qui Heretoches apud Anglos vocabantur, Scilicet Barones, Nobiles, &amp; insignes Sapientes,</HI> &amp;c. And <HI>Gregory of Tours, Rodovicus,</HI> and many of the foreign, ancient Historians mention, <HI>Sapientes</HI> only as Lawyers, Counsellors, Judges, and among the modern foreign Lawyers, <HI>Hottomon and Calvin,</HI> say expresly they were such. But perhaps not of the Inferior Ran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, no more than the <HI>Saxons Sapientes</HI> were, of which their <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> only consisted. And we have at this day the <HI>Iudges,</HI> and <HI>King's Council</HI>▪ and other great Lawyers, that sit in the Lord's House, and are assistant to the Parliament, when there is occasion. Nor have you yet brought any proof, that the Cities or Towns then sent their Representatives to the great Councils in the <HI>Saxon</HI> times, by this, or any other Title. But as for the Knights of Shires, though I grant the Treatise called, <HI>Modus tenendi Parliamentum,</HI> mentions such Persons to have been present in Parliament in the time of K. <HI>Ethelred</HI>; yet by that word Parliament so often used by the Author of that Treatise, and divers other Cir∣cumstances, it may be easily perceived that the Author lived but about the time of <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. or <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. as Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his Titles of Honour, and Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> in his Animadversions to Sir <HI>E. Cook</HI>'s 4th Institutes, have very fully proved; so that admitting that your Thanes, or Lords of Towns, did then appear in those Coun∣cils for themselves, and their Tenants, yet could they not be properly said to be their Representatives, because (as I told you before) they were never chosen by them; whereas now the ordinary Freeholders, of forty Shillings a Year, and the Freemen and Inhabitants in Cities and Towns, have the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>test share in the Election of Knights, Citizens and Burgesses.</P>
<P>And as for those <HI>Thanes</HI> you mention, they, or those under whom they claim∣ed, owed their Estates wholly to the Grants of former Kings, and held their Pos∣sessions from them by some Tenure or other. And by virtue of this Tenure it was, that all the Lands of <HI>England</HI> were liable, even those that belonged to the
<PB N="379" REF="208"/>
Church, to those three Services, anciently called <HI>Trinoda Necessitas, viz. Expedi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, Castelli, &amp; Pontis extructio,</HI> that is, Military Service against a Foreign Enemy and the Repair of Castles and Bridges; and subject to the common Services of the Kingdom. And that the Earls and Chief Thanes did hold their Lands by Knights or Military Service, appears by the reliefs of the Earls and Thanes, ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rest in the Laws of King <HI>Cnut.</HI> in Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI>'s Councils. So that if all the persons who held those Lands, owed them wholly to the King's bounty, it seems plain to me that they must likewise owe their places in the great Council to the same Original.</P>

<P>I think what you have now farther urged will be of no great moment against my Opinion; for as to the Authority you bring from the Addition to that Law of <HI>Edw.</HI> the Confessor; it is plain by the word <HI>Barones,</HI> that it was added long since that time, that word not being commonly in use, till some time after the <HI>Norman</HI> Conquest. But letting that pass, it is plain by the rest of the Law, if you would have been pleased to have read it out, that these <HI>Heretoches</HI> (here called Barons) were no other than ordinary Gentlemen, or Thanes (which then answer∣ed the word Barones. And these (as this Law it self expresly tells us) were chosen by all the Freemen in the Folemote, or County-Court. And therefore tho I grant they might be men of Estates, yet there was no necessity of their be∣ing Lords, or Noble by Birth; nor is it likely that the people would have cho∣sen their Earls, or any other of the like Order to command them, when they had sufficient choice of Thanes or Gentlemen in their own Countrey, to command the Military Forces of it. And tho it is true these Gentlemen are called Nobles, and remarkable Wise Men, yet this (according to your own shewing) doth not exclude others, and those of a far different Profession, <HI>viz. Counsellors, Lawyers,</HI> and <HI>Iudges,</HI> all which, you suppose had then Places in the Great Council, as they have now in the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> House. And if this Word might comprehend both Sword-men and Lawyers, I cannot see why it may not also take in the better and richer sort of Citizens and Magistrates, who in that Age, as was notorious, were elected by their respective Corporations; And I have already proved that these were called <HI>Sapientes</HI> in other Countries; and I see no reason why they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny not have been called so here too. But that the King's Judges and Coun∣sellors could have no Votes in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Great Councils, I have already given a sufficient Reason to the contrary.</P>
<P>But I shall now farther shew you, That the Cities and Boroughs in the <HI>Saxon</HI> times being so much more numerous and considerable than they are now, must needs have had (according to the custom of those Times (a considerable share in those Great Councils▪ since in them consisted a great part of the Strength and Riches of the Kingdom; and were many more than they are at this day; for <HI>Bede</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the beginning of his History, <HI>That there were in</HI> England <HI>long before his time,</HI> 28 <HI>Famous Cities, besides innumerable Castles, and walled Towns of note</HI>; many of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.</HI> Holli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh <HI>Chro. p.</HI> 192, 193▪ <HI>where he sufficiently prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Assertion from diviri <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nc Authors</HI></NOTE> tho now extremely decayed, or quite mined, were then very considerable, the greatest and richest part of the Nation inhabiting in those times for the most part in Cities, or great Towns, for their greater benefit or security; and the grea∣ter part of the Lands of <HI>England</HI> in the <HI>Saxon</HI> times, and long after, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y incultivated, and over run with For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts and Bog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, so that the Inhabitants of those Cities and Boroughs being them so considerable for Estates in Lands, as well as other Rich<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ex∣cluded
<PB N="380" REF="209"/>
from having Places both in the <HI>Brittish,</HI> or <HI>Saxon</HI> Great Councils? what man of Sense can believe, that the Ancient and Potent Cities of <HI>London, T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nterbury, Lincoln,</HI> &amp;c. Should ever be excluded from having any hand in the Great Consultation of giving Money and making Laws, and for the publick defence of the Kingdom in the <HI>Saxon</HI> times, any more than they are now? And therefore we find, that in all the Kingdom of the <HI>German,</HI> or <HI>Gothick</HI> original, the chief Cities and Towns have still sent Deputies to the Diets, or Assemblies of E∣states, as I said but now.</P>
<P>In the next place, tho I do not positively assert, that there were Knights of Shires before the Conquest; yet am I not convinced that there were none. For tho I confess the Treatise you mention, appears to have been written since the coming in of the <HI>Normans,</HI> yet might the Substance of it have been much older than the times of <HI>Edw</HI> III. and <HI>Rich.</HI> II. or else certainly King <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. or his Chancellor for him, would never have been at the trouble of transmitting a Copy of this said <HI>Modus</HI> into <HI>Ireland</HI> under the Great Seal (which is thought to incroach so much on the Prerogative, had he not been very well informed of the Antiquity, as well as Authority thereof. And therefore it might very well be written about the Time of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. from some Ancient Historians and Records, not now extant, tho the Copies we have of it, may be of no longer standing than the time Mr▪ <HI>Sel∣den</HI> mentions.</P>
<P>But admitting that there were no Knights of Shires before the Conquest, and tho the <HI>Thanes</HI> (who I suppose made the greatest Figure in the <HI>Wittena Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er</HI>) were not Earls, or chief Thanes, that is, of the Greater Nobility, yet they were great Freeholders, and tho Commoners, yet Gentlemen, and of the Lesser Nobi∣lity, in the same sense as Gentlemen, or Knights of Shires are now. And the not elected by the Countries, yet might be as well esteemed their Representatives, as they are now of Freeholders, under 40 <HI>s. per Annum,</HI> Lease-holders and Copy-holders for years, who have no Votes at the Election of Parliament men; whereas these Thanes were then the chief (if not the only) Possessors of all the Free∣hold Estates in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Nor is it any material Objection to say that these Thanes might at first owe those Estates to the Grant of the First <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, and might also after a sort hold their Estates of them as Heads of the Commonwealth, by such Services as were setled by Publick Laws; yet does it not therefore follow, that they owed their very right of coming to the Great Council wholly to the Kings Favour. For in the first place it is to be considered, that tho the First <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings conquered this Island from the <HI>Brittains,</HI> yet those that assisted them being only Voluntiers, the chief Officers or Commanders of them, might not only deserve, but also capi∣tulate for their Shares in the Land so conquered. And these being given out by the King, according to each mans quality, condition, or desert, might constitute those who were called the King's Thanes, as those who held likewise under them, were the Middle Thanes or Vavassors. Supposing (till you can prove the contrary) that these had Places in the Great Council, as well as the other; and you might as well argue that they could have no Places there, but by the favour of their Lords. Whereas I have already proved, that an Estate of Five Hides in Land, of whomsoever holden, made a Thane or Nobleman of the Inferior Rank: And we find by the same Laws of King <HI>Athelstan,</HI> his <HI>Weregild,</HI> or Price of his Head, was valued but equal with that of a Mass Thanes or Priest, (<HI>viz.</HI>) at 2000 Thrym∣sas.
<PB N="381" REF="209"/>
So that a sufficient Estate in Land, did not only make a man a Gentleman, but also give him a place in the Great Council. And there were besides all these several <HI>Alodoril</HI>; who held their Lands, discharged from all Services, and could sell or dispose of them without the consent of the King, or any other inferior Lord, and are those mentioned in <HI>Domes</HI>-day Book; <HI>qui potuit ire cum terra que <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>but.</HI> Nor is your Argument conclusive, That because in those times as well as now, all Lands were held either mediately, or immediately of the King, and were chargeable with those three general Services you mention for the publick safety and good of the Kingdom, that therefore not only all mens civil properties, but also their right of coming to the Great Councils must wholly depend upon the King's will; Since I have already proved, that the first <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings by their conquest of the Kingdom, could not acquire the sole property of all the Lands thereof to themselves, tho they might be made use of as publick Trustees, to distribute them according to those mens qualities and deserts, who had helped them in the Conquest. So that when they were once possessed of such Estates, they had immediately thereupon a right to a place in the Great Council, the burthen of the Government lying chiefly on such as had Estates in Land.</P>
<P>And that many others besides the Kings Thanes, or Great Lords, had places in the Great Council of those times, appears as well by the name of <HI>Mycel Synods, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Wittena-Gemots,</HI> which are rendred by our Ancient Glossarists <HI>Numerosa,</HI> or <HI>Popu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sa Conventio</HI>; as also the Titles and Conclusions, to divers of the Titles of those Great Councils in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Times, where are often mentioned after the <HI>Comites, &amp; Proceres Terrae, aliorum fidelium infinita multitudo,</HI> which must certainly take in many more than the Kings Thanes, Judges, or other of his Great Men, who were then but a few in comparison of all the rest of the Freeholders of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not longer dispute the probability of what you say, all the diffi∣culty lies in the proof of the matter of Fact. For in the first place I deny that any other of a less Degree than the King's <HI>Thanes,</HI> of chief Tenents, had any Places or Voices in the old <HI>English</HI> Councils. Nor can you find (as you your self are forced to confess) in our <HI>Saxon</HI> Laws, or Ancient Historians of those times, any Representatives of the common people mentioned; such as are now, much less Citizens or Burgesses for any City or Burrough in <HI>England.</HI> And therefore what you say concerning the Riches or Power of the Cities and Towns before the Conquest, tho perhaps it might be true, yet doth it not therefore follow, that they must then send their Representatives to the Great Councils. Nor is it any Argument to prove that they did, because great Cities and Towns do or did lately send Deputies to the like Assemblies in other Countries, since our Govern∣ment might not only originally differ in that from theirs, but that also the send∣ing of those Deputies might be granted by some later Princes, long since the time of the first beginning of those Kingdoms, and I do believe will prove so, if closely look'd into.</P>
<P>And in <HI>Denmark</HI> (which you know was an Elective Kingdom) the Cities and great Towns never sent any Deputies to their Great Councils at all; and since the Government of <HI>England</HI> (as you your self grant) did very much resemble that, why might it not be so here too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think your Reply hath no more weight in it, than what you have already urged; For in the first place it lies upon your side to prove, that none but the
<PB N="382" REF="210"/>
King's or chief <HI>Thanes</HI> had any Places in the Great Councils of those times; and whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you can prove that, you may do something.</P>
<P>But what I have now brought to prove the great Antiquity of our Cities and Burroughs in <HI>England,</HI> is not so little to the purpose as you would make it; since it confirms that Right of Prescription, which all ancient Cities and Burroughs is <HI>England</HI> do claim of sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Members to Parliament; and therefore pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what Mr. <HI>Lambard,</HI> a Person whom all the Learned own extre∣mely knowing in the <HI>English Saxon</HI> Government tells us on this Subject,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 256. <HI>Pag.</HI> 257 &amp;c.</NOTE> in his Archeion in these Words.</P>
<P><HI>That whereas in the beginning of the Law,</HI> (viz. <HI>those made by the</HI> Saxon <HI>Kings he there mentions</HI>) <HI>all the Acts are said to pass from the King and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is</HI> Wisemen, <HI>both of the Clergy and Laity, in the Body of the Laws, each Statute being thus; And it is the advice of our Lord, and his</HI> Wisemen. <HI>So as it appears that it was then a received Form of Speech, to signifie both the Spirituality, and Laity (that is to say, the Greater</HI> Nobility, <HI>and the Less, or</HI> Commons) <HI>by this one Word</HI> Witena, <HI>i. e.</HI> Wisemen.</P>
<P><HI>Now as these written Authorities do undoubtedly confirm our Assertion of the continu∣ance of this manner of Parliament, so is there also unwritten Law or Prescription, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doth no less infallibly uphold the same. For it is well known, that in every Quarter of the Realm, a great many Burroughs do yet send Burgesses to the Parliament, which are never∣theless so ancient, and so long since decayed, and gone to nought, that it cannot be shewed that they have been of any reputation at any time since the Conquest, and much les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than they have obtained this Priviledge, by the Grant of any King succeeding the same. So that the Interest which they have in Parliament groweth by an ancient usage before the Con∣quest, whereof they cannot shew any beginning; Which thing is also confirmed by a contrary usage in the self same thing; for it is likewise known, that they of ancient demesne, do prescribe in not sending to the Parliament; for which reason also, they are neither con∣tributers to the VVages of the Knights of Shires, neither are they bound by sundry Acts of Parliament, tho the same be generally penned, and do make no exceptions of them. But there is no ancient Demesne saving that only which is described in the Book of Dooms∣day, under the Title of</HI> Terra Regis <HI>which of necessity must be such as either was in the hands of the Conqueror himself, who made the Book, or of</HI> Edward <HI>the Confessor, that was before him. And so again▪ if they of ancient Demesnes, have ever since the Con∣quest prescribed not to elect Burgesses to the Parliament then (no doubt) there was a Par∣liament before the Conquest, to the which they of other Places did send their Burgesses.</HI></P>
<P>From whence we may conclude, that the Learned Author did not only believe that the Lords, but that also the Inferior Nobility, and Representatives of Cities and Towns were included under the Word <HI>VVites,</HI> and also that these Place<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> claimed that Priviledge by Prescription, and not by Grant of any King since the Conquest, or before</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not deny but Mr. <HI>Lambard</HI> was a Learned Antiquary, yet there are others more in number, and perhaps of greater Learning, who do suppose, that no Cities or Burroughs sent Burgesses to Parliament, but since the Conquest; the I confess the time is not exactly agreed on, but whenever they began to appea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> there, it is certain they could have no right of coming, but from the King's Summons or Grants; since none but such Cities or Towns, that held of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King in Capite,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. B. Pag.</HI> 38.</NOTE> had anciently any place in those Assemblies, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them neither any other, but those whom the King pleased to
<PB N="383" REF="210"/>
call. And from thence proceeds that great Variety we find in the List of those Towns, which send Members to Parliament. But I shall omit speaking any thing farther of this at present.</P>
<P>But as for those middle inferior <HI>Thanes</HI> or <HI>Vavassours</HI> (as they were afterwards called) whom you suppose to have made so great a Figure in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Great Councils, I do not believe that they had any Votes there, and I hope I shall be able to prove to you by and by, that none but the King's Tenants in Capite appeared in those Meetings, from the time of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, to the 49 <HI>Hen.</HI> III. Now if it be true (as you suppose) King <HI>William</HI> made no alterati∣ons in the constituent parts of the Great Council of the Kingdom, after his con∣quest of it, it will likewise follow, that the same sort of persons, <HI>viz.</HI> Tenants by Knights Service, were the only Members of it before the conquest too. But if you have any express Authorities, out of our Ancient <HI>Saxon</HI> Laws or Histo∣ries, to prove that the Commons appeared at the Wittena Gemotes in the <HI>Saxon</HI> times, pray let us see them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall perform your Command immediately; but in the first place give me leave to tell you, that what you have said concerning Cities and Towns not sending Burgesses to Parliament, till after the Conquest, is a great mistake, built upon a false and precarious Hypothesis, that they all held in Capite of the King; the contrary of which, I shall make out, when I come to treat of that Question. So likewise is it as precarious, that none but the King's Tenants in Capite, had any Votes in our Great Councils, in the times immediately succeeding your Conquest, till the 49th. of <HI>Hen</HI> III. and that therefore it must have been so before the Conquest. For as I own that King <HI>VVilliam</HI> made no material alteration in the Government of the Kingdom, after his entrance, so I likewise affirm, that as well after as before that time (if not Knights of Shires, yet) all <HI>Thanes</HI> the or <HI>Barons,</HI> i. e. great <HI>Freeholders</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> had Places in that Assembly before 49th. of <HI>Hen.</HI> III.</P>
<P>But to proceed to the Authorities you desire, I shall begin with the first, and most ancient General Council we have left us in the <HI>Saxon</HI> times <HI>viz.</HI> that which was held at <HI>Canterbury, A. D.</HI> 605. by King <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> not long after the settle∣ment of Christianity in this Island; which is recorded by Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI> in his <HI>Brittish</HI> Councils, in these Words; <HI>An.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A P. Pag.</HI> 4.</NOTE> will you give me leave to answer your Questi∣ons, one by one as you go, for fear I should not only forget them, but also tire you with too long a Speech. In the first place there∣fore give me leave to tell you, that you are very much mistaken to suppose, that by the Word <HI>Populus,</HI> is here meant the common People, or Vulgar; Where∣as, when <HI>Clerus</HI> and <HI>Populus</HI> are used together, in our Ancient Writers of those times, it signifies no more than a Common Council of the Clergy and Peo∣ple or Laity, and not the Common People; for then the <HI>Lords,</HI> or Great Men
<PB N="384" REF="211"/>
would have been quite left out of this Council, as certainly they were not; and so when <HI>Clerus,</HI> and <HI>Populus,</HI> are used together, and thus contradistinguish∣ed, then they are expressive of two different Estates or Conditions of Men or Christians, the Clergy and Laity, or secular Men; and those were the <HI>Optimates Terrae,</HI> the chief Men of the Land before expressed. Neither was this, Council held under a sole <HI>Saxon</HI> Monarch, but under <HI>Ethelbert</HI> King of <HI>Kent</HI> on∣ly; and that but eight years after <HI>Augustin</HI>'s coming hither, and above two hun∣dred years before the Seven Kingdoms were united into one Monarchy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not at all concerned at this Answer, since I can prove, that by the Word <HI>Populus</HI> must be here understood somewhat more than <HI>Kings, Noblemen,</HI> and <HI>Iudges, viz.</HI> the Representatives of the <HI>Commons</HI> likewise; or else the <HI>Saxon Wite∣na-Gemotes</HI> were not what their Titles speak them to be, Common, or General Councils of the whole Kingdom; that is, of all the Estates or Orders of it there, but only a Convention of the Bishops and Great Lords. And therefore if the Word <HI>Clerus</HI> did then comprehend all the Clergy, both Superior and Inferior, <HI>i e.</HI> as well the Bishops as Abbots, Priors, Deans and Clerks, for the Secular Clergy, and Cathederal Chapters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I pray give me a Reason why the Word <HI>Populus,</HI> when put alone, must be wholly confined to your <HI>Earls,</HI> or chief <HI>Thanes,</HI> and may not also take in the Middle or Less <HI>Thanes,</HI> Freeholders, or Lords of Townships, and the Representatives of Cities and Burrough Towns; and why not with as much reason, as that the Word <HI>Populus</HI> amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI> took in the whole Body of the People of <HI>Rome,</HI> both <HI>Patricians,</HI> and <HI>Pleb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians,</HI> when as∣sembled in their <HI>Comitiis Centuriatis,</HI> to make Laws, or create Magistrates. The rest of your Argument is not very material; for tho I grant this Council was held before the Heptarchy was united into a Monarchy, yet I think it is very easie to prove, that as all the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kingdoms consisted of several Nations of the same Language and Original, so were they likewise under the same Form of Govern∣ment: And that Councils consisted of the same constituent Members, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I shall prove to you from the Kingdom of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> from which was the Foundation of our present <HI>English</HI> Monarchy. And for this I shall give you the Authority of <HI>Will.</HI> of <HI>Malmesbury,</HI> and <HI>H. Huntingdon,</HI> (who 'tis highly probable) had seen the ancient Histories and Records of those times) and they both agree in the Relation of the Deposition of <HI>Sigebert,</HI> King of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> for Ty∣ranny and Cruelty, <HI>Anno.</HI> 754. the Words are remarkable, which pray read; <HI>Unde in Anno secundo ipsius Regni congregati sunt Proceres, &amp; Populi Totius Regni &amp; provida deliberatione, &amp; unanimi consensu omnium expulsus est a Regno &amp; Kinewulfus sa∣tus ex Regio sanguine electus est in Regem</HI>; where you may observe a plain difference made between the Higher <HI>Nobility,</HI> here called <HI>Proceres,</HI> and the Representatives of the People here stiled <HI>Populi</HI>; as also from another Authority of a Great Coun∣cil, held under the same King <HI>Aethelbert,</HI> as it is mentioned by <HI>Roger Hoveden,</HI> Domestick to King <HI>Hen.</HI> II. in the 2d Part of his Annals; where among the Laws of King <HI>Edw.</HI> the Confessor, and which he writes to have been confirmed by King <HI>William</HI> I. you will find under the Title <HI>de Aptb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, &amp; de aliis minutis De∣cimis</HI> (which are there said to be given to the Clergy by former Kings▪ and par∣ticularly by this King <HI>Ethelbert</HI>) these Words; <HI>Haec ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Sanctus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prae∣dicavit, &amp; docu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t &amp; haec concessa sunt a Rege, Baronibus &amp; Populo.</HI> So that it <HI>Populus</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere doth not signifie an Order of Men, contradistinct from the Barons or Great Lords, it would have been a Tautology with a witness.</P>

Pag.</HI> 297, 298.</NOTE> but how and by what Words the Legislators were expressed near 500 years after the Law was made; or how they were rendred in <HI>Latin</HI> after the coming of the <HI>Normans</HI> transiently, and without design to give an account of them, can∣not be of much Validity to prove who they were; and that the Laws of King <HI>Edw.</HI> were made, or at least translated into <HI>Norman Latin,</HI> after the <HI>Norman</HI> Con∣quest, appears by the Word <HI>Comites,</HI> (besides <HI>Barones</HI> already mentioned) <HI>Mili∣te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Servientes,</HI> &amp;c. all <HI>Norman</HI> Words, and not known here, till their coming hither. He that will assert any thing from a single uncouth Expression in one Case, and upon one occasion only, brings but a slender Proof for that he says; so▪ will any man think, because 'tis said in one of King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Laws, (and per∣haps no where else concerning this King's Coronation) <HI>quod debet in propria persona <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>am Regno, &amp; Sacerdotio &amp; Clero, jurare ante quam ab Archiepiscopis, &amp; Episcopis Regni coronetur</HI>) That the Priests were not Clergy-men, nor the Clergy-men Priests; and that the Arch-Bishops and Bishops were neither. Many other un∣coath Expressions do often occur in the old Monks, which are to be interpreted according to the common usage and practice of the times in which they are de∣livered. And therefore seeing before the time of the Conquest, and for two, or near three Centuries of years afterward, the Commons (as at this day under∣stood) were not called, nor did come to Great Councils or Parliaments as I shall prove when I come to speak of those times); So that by <HI>Barones</HI> must be here meant the Great Barons, and by <HI>Populus,</HI> the <HI>Communitas Angliae,</HI> or which was then all one, the <HI>Communitas Baronum,</HI> the Less Barons, or Tenents in Capite; and the sense of the Words is farther confirmed by several undeniable Authori∣ties; wherein, by the <HI>Communitas Populi,</HI> must be understood not the Communi∣ty of the People or Commons, but the whole Body of the Less Tenants in Ca∣pite.</P>
<P>But to give you an answer why the Word <HI>Populus</HI> could not comprehend all sorts of people among the <HI>Saxons,</HI> as it did among the <HI>Romans,</HI> but only the No∣bility, (who were then, properly speaking, the only Freemen) is this, that none but the Nobility possessed any Lands in Fee-simple; all the rest of the meaner sort of people (then called <HI>Cheorl Folk</HI>) holding theirs in Villanage under their Lords or Thanes, being no better than meer Villains, or Costagers, and who were all bound to the Good Behaviour, every tenth Family being bound one for another, in the <HI>Sheriff</HI>'s <HI>Torne,</HI> or Court of <HI>Franc-Pledge,</HI> under their Head, or Tenth Man, called the Tything-man, who was to answer for them. So that the common People of <HI>England</HI> were not such a Free People, nor had any share in the Go∣vernment, as some suppose, there being I believe no such persons as our Yeo∣men or Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ers in those days.</P>

<P>Tho perhaps this Law might very well be transcribed from some old Cop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of King <HI>Aethelbert</HI>'s Laws not now extant, and in which there might be the Word <HI>Thanes,</HI> instead of <HI>Baronibus,</HI> which is but a Translation of it, in the sense i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which it was used not long after the Conquest.</P>
<P>Nor is it true which you affirm, that the Word <HI>Barones</HI> was never in use before the coming in of the <HI>Normans,</HI> in ancient Charters, as I shall prove to you by this Charter of King <HI>Edgar,</HI> to the Abby of <HI>Westminster,</HI> containing a confirmation of their ancient Charters and Priviledges, collected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the aforesaid <HI>Sulcardus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ex Cartula∣rio Caenob à West.

<P>And so likewise <HI>Populus</HI> for <HI>People</HI> or <HI>Folk</HI> in the <HI>Saxon</HI>; Yet take it (as you suppose) to have been writ not long before the time <HI>Hoveden</HI> writ his History, (which was above 80 years before the 49th of <HI>Hen.</HI> III.) This Author, or whoever else added this Passage to this Law about Tythes, did then suppose, that according to the custom then used, the People had Re∣presentatives in those Assemblies; which I shall prove from your own sense of these words; for if the word <HI>Populus</HI> signifies here another sort of men different from the Lords, then this word <HI>Populus</HI> must necessarily signifie some that were Commons, and not Lords by your own concession, and who also must represent others besides themselves; but it is highly improbable, that by this word <HI>Populus</HI> should be meant the <HI>Communitas Angliae,</HI> or the <HI>Communitas Baronum</HI>; for then since the word <HI>Baronum</HI> would have included all the Tenents in capite, both Great and Small, to what purpose should the word <HI>Populus</HI> have been added at all? Therefore I am so far from believing this way of expressing the several Estates of the Kingdom, to have been a Monkish Blunder, (as you suppose) that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was rather a common and ordinary way of Expression among the Writers of those Time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as well in Records as Histories, who then very well knew the People or Com∣mons, to be an Estate, or Constituent part of the Common Council of the King∣dom, quite different from the Lords, and in which sense it is recited in an anci∣ent Charter of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> That He being divorced, the New Queen was crowned,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot.

<P><PB N="387" REF="212"/>But I shall in the next place proceed to that Great Synod, or Council, that was called by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Elder, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 905. and is mentioned by <HI>Simeon</HI> of <HI>Durham,</HI> and other Authors quoted by Arch-Bishop <HI>Parker,</HI> the Compiler of the <HI>British</HI> Antiquities, in these Words? <HI>Plegmundus Cantuariensis Archiepiscopus, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> cum Rege Magnifico cognominato, Edwardo seniore Consilium Magnum Episcoporum.

<P>I shall now conclude with a few Words in reply to your Answer, why the Word <HI>Populus,</HI> could not among the <HI>Saxons</HI> take in all sorts of People, as well as amongst the <HI>Romans</HI>; for I cannot take it as a satisfactory answer, for these Rea∣sons: 1. Because, tho I should grant that the Vulgar sort of People were greater Slaves than they are now, and that they had no hereditary Properties in their E∣states, but at the will of their Lords; yet does it therefore follow, that all the Freemen of the Kingdom were Noblemen or Gentlemen, or else Villains, as now understood; since <HI>Nitardus</HI> tells us in the place above mentioned, that there were three sorts of people among the <HI>Saxons, Edelingi, Friling<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, &amp; Lazzi,</HI> i e. Gen∣tlemen or Noblemen Freemen, and Slaves or Villains; and this middle sort of men might also possess Lands in <HI>Allodio,</HI> or Free-Tenure, tho they did also de∣pend upon other greater men for Protection, and seem to be those who were after the Conquest called in <HI>Doomsday Book,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B P.

<P>I shall not at present dispute the matter farther with you concerning the Word <HI>Populus,</HI> since I shall refer speaking more about it, till I come to the times after the Conquest. And therefore to return to the Matter in hand; Had you but read a little farther in the same Leaf in the Author you have cited, you might have found who they were, whom King <HI>Edward</HI> the Elder called to this Council; The Words are these, <HI>Edwardus Rex Synodum Praedictam Nobilium Anglorum congregavit cui presidebat Plegmundus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<P>And to this effect <HI>Malmsbury,</HI> and the Manuscript in the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library cited by Sir <HI>William Dugdale,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Somner,</HI> from the Treasury of the Records, and Evidences of the Church of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> cited by Sir <HI>H.

(in the <HI>Saxon,</HI> Aldermen of the <HI>English</HI> Nation) that is, such as were usual∣ly called to such Councils, which were only the Nobles, and Great men, for ought yet appears from this Instance. But what if after all, there was never a∣ny such Synod called, and consequently no such Title to it. For it was said to have been assembled, by reason of a chiding Letter from Pope <HI>Formosus.</HI> Now this <HI>Formosus</HI> died, <HI>Anno</HI> 895. that is, ten years before this Council was supposed to be called.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see this Authority galls you, therefore I do not blame you to do what you can to be rid of it; but I shall not give it up for all that. For that this Word <HI>Populorum,</HI> then signified all the Lay-persons, who were actually <HI>Noblemen</HI> that is, of the Greater Nobility, I think is a great mistake; for to what purpose are all these different Words here heapt together, since the Word <HI>Proceres</HI> had don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as well alone in your sense, and at once comprehended all those <HI>Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> or <HI>Noble∣men,</HI> that you would only have to be there. But the Word <HI>Nobiles</HI> did not in those times, neither doth at this day in any other Countrey but <HI>England</HI>▪ signifie none but Great Lords, Barons, or Peers; since in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and other Coun∣tries, every private Gentleman is <HI>Nobilis.</HI> And I think the Middle or Less <HI>Thanes,</HI> might then as well be called <HI>Nobiles,</HI> as the Great ones. And the <HI>Alder∣men,</HI> or other Magistrates of Great Cities and Towns, might also very well be stiled <HI>Nobiles, ratione officii,</HI> for the time they acted in that Employment, and might also deserve the Name of Senators, as well as the Greater <HI>Aldermen,</HI> or Earls▪ And if there were no other Lay-Men, but your greater sort of <HI>Aldermen,</HI> then what becomes of your chief, or Kings <HI>Thanes,</HI> which you your self grant were constant Members of those Councils. Nor indeed doth the Word <HI>Senator</HI> only signifie such who were <HI>Noblemen</HI> by Birth, since among the <HI>Romans</HI> there were Se∣nators of the <HI>Plebeian</HI> as well as <HI>Patrician</HI> Order; as any man who hath but read <HI>Lucius Florus,</HI> may quickly see. But as for your Exception, That there was no such Council, because Pope <HI>Formosus</HI> is said to have died ten years before this Council was called, it is a bold Assertion to annihilate a whole Council, because of the mistake of the Date, or time of its meeting, or perhaps in the Name of the Pope, or King then reigning, especially when it was assembled upon so remarka∣ble an occasion, as the erecting of these new Bishopricks, which all our Histori∣ans ascribe to this Council.</P>
<P>But I shall now proceed to another Authority, and that is to the Great or Common Council held at <HI>Winchester Anno</HI> 853. where you will find in Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI>'s Councils;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 350.</NOTE> as also in <HI>Ingulphus</HI>'s History, that after the Bishops, Earls and other Great Men, or Thanes, who subscribed to the Law of Tythes, granted by way of Charter there mentioned, wherein these following Parties are mentioned, <HI>Aliorumque Fidelium infinita multi∣tudo qui omnes Regium Chirographum laudaverunt, Dignitates verò sua nomina Sub∣scripserunt</HI>; and the Learned Commentator upon King <HI>Alfred</HI>'s Life, published in <HI>Latin</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> is so well satisfied, that the Commons were meant by this Ex∣pression, that he hath this remarkable Observation upon this King's granting of these Tythes. <HI>Bis videtur Rex Decimas Ecclesiae concessisse. Primum Anno</HI> 844, <HI>&amp;</HI> 2▪ <HI>vero</HI> 855. <HI>vel ut alii</HI> 854, <HI>è tota Regione, &amp; cum Assensu omnium Nobilium, &amp; to∣tius Populi</HI>; where this Author rightly supposes, that the Words at the conclusion of this Council, did comprehend the consent of the People or Commons, as well as of the Lords, or Noblemen. Or else this reciting
<PB N="389" REF="213"/>
of this Word <HI>Populus</HI>; as distinct from the <HI>Nobiles,</HI> had been altogether in vain.</P>
<P>So that tho I do not affirm, that the meer Vulgar, or <HI>Plebeian</HI> sort of People. did appear personally in the Great Council of those times, any more than they do now, yet they were there by their Representatives, <HI>viz.</HI> either by Knights of Shires, as now, or else the chief Thanes, or Freeholders of the Kingdom; as al∣so by the Aldermen, or chief Burgesses of great Cities and Towns, who I sup∣pose did then represent those Politick Bodies, since all men could not appear there in person.</P>
<P>But I shall give you another Authority out of the same Author, <HI>viz.</HI> Arch-Bishop <HI>Parker</HI>'s <HI>British</HI> Antiquities,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 87.</NOTE> where when he re∣lates the calling of the Council of <HI>Calne</HI>▪ for the turning of Mar∣ried Priests out of Monasteries, and Cathedral Churches, and putting Monks in∣to their places; He tells us a remarkable Accident that then happened, <HI>viz.</HI> The falling down of the Room where the Council was assembled. So that there fell together all of a sudden; (pray take the words themselves out of the Authors there cited) <HI>Praesules, Proceres, Equites, Nobiles, pariter &amp; Ignobiles Corruerunt.</HI> So that you see here were other sorts of men present in this Council, beside the <HI>Prasules,</HI> (i. e. <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Abbots</HI>); and the <HI>Proceres,</HI> (i. e. the <HI>Earls</HI> and <HI>chief Thanes</HI>) <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Knights,</HI> or <HI>Inferior Thanes,</HI> Noblemen or Gentlemen; as also <HI>Ignobiles,</HI> those that were not Noble by Birth, such as were the Representatives of Cities and Burroughs; and of this opinion the Arch-Bishop himself seems to be; for at the end of this Relation, he makes this Remark; <HI>Sed nec hujus domus in qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ordinum, tam Conspicui Clarique viri, Consulto Convenerunt tam repentina rui∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe Diabolica carere potuit</HI>; Where by <HI>Omnium Ordinum,</HI> he must certainly mean the three Estates of the Kingdom, in the same sense as the word <HI>Ordines</HI> is used by <HI>Camden,</HI> and other <HI>Latin</HI> Writers, who call our Parliament <HI>Conventus Ordinum,</HI> that is, the Assembly of Estates.</P>

<P>I Pray give me leave to answer this Authority before you proceed farther; I must beg your pardon, if I cannot believe that all the persons whom the Hi∣storian relates to have perished by this Fall of the Council Chamber, to have been all of them actual Members of that Assembly, since there might have been there divers persons, who tho of an inferior Rank, might have been presents Auditors, or lookers on; it not being then the custom to hold those Councils so privately, as we do now, so that divers of the Common or Ordinary sort of People, called here <HI>Ignobiles,</HI> and perhaps of the Inferior Gentry too being there, might all partake of this common Ruin, and so pay dear for their needless curio∣sity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must beg your pardon if I do not assent to your opinion in this matter; for I cannot believe (unless you can shew me very good Authority for it) that e∣ver the common people, or <HI>Vulgus</HI> in the sense you take them, were let in only to gaze at such Assemblies. For what Room could have contained so great a croud, and if they were in those days so great Slaves, as the Gentlemen of your opinion please to make them, it is not likely that they should be admitted to croud into the Great Councils then, any more than now, when you allow them more liber∣ty, and greater priviledges than they then enjoyed. And therefore I think I may very well stick to the Arch-Bishops opinion, who supposes them to have been the
<PB N="390" REF="214"/>
whole Assembly of the Three Estates, who were all involved in this Ruin.</P>
<P>But letting this pass, I shall now give you an Authority of a Great Council held under King <HI>Ethelred,</HI> which will farther confirm our Sense of the Word <HI>Populus</HI>; which Council you may see in the 1st Volume of <HI>Monastic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Anglic</HI> contains a concession and confirmation of divers Priviledges to the Monastery of <HI>Wolverhampton</HI> in these Words;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vol.</HI> 1. <HI>Fol.</HI> 988. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.</NOTE> <HI>Haec decreta sunt Sigerich Archiepiscopi in placito coram Rege Ethelredo, &amp; Ebora∣censi Archiepiscopo, &amp; omnibus Episcopis, Abbatibus Regionis Britanni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, seu Senatoribus, Ducibus, &amp; Pop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lo Terrae</HI>: where it seems plain to me, that the <HI>Populus Terrae</HI> are here put as a distinct order of men from all the rest a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oregoing.</P>
<P>To come now to the time after the <HI>Danish</HI> Invasion, and the settlement of the Crown upon King <HI>Knute,</HI> who after he was made King, partly by Conquest, and partly by Election, yet altered nothing of the an∣cient Constitution And therefore <HI>Florence</HI> of <HI>Worcester</HI> tells us, that <HI>Anno</HI> 1017 being the first year of his Reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 619.</NOTE> he divided the whole Kingdom into four parts, and also <HI>foedus cum Principibus &amp; om∣ni Populo, Ipse &amp; illi cum Ipso parcus cess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>runt</HI>; Where you see the <HI>Populus</HI> or Com∣mons is put distinct by this Author from the Great Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Noblemen here cal∣led <HI>Principes</HI>; and this Council is called by Abbot <HI>Bromton</HI> in his Histo∣ry <HI>Parliamentum apud Oxoniam</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bromton Fol.</HI> 908.</NOTE> And also in his Charter to the Abby of <HI>Briadricesworth</HI> (since called St. <HI>Edmundsb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry</HI>) which is still to be seen in the Office of the King's Remembrancer of the Excheq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, it is thus recited, <HI>Ego Cnut Rex totius Albionis Insulae, &amp; aliarum Nationum plur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ma∣rum, in Cathedra Regali promotus, cum Consilio, &amp; Decreto Archiepiscoporum, Episco∣porum, Abbatum, Comitum aliorumque omnium Fidelium eligi Sanciend:</HI> Whence it plainly appears, that under the word <HI>Fideles,</HI> was then comprehended other persons of an inferior Rank, or Order to the Comites, or Earls, there mentioned; and these could mean no other, than the Representatives of the Commons, whom I have proved to have been present in these Councils.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot believe you have yet proved it; for tho I have hitherto omitted to give you my thoughts of this word <HI>Fidelium,</HI> yet I must now tell you once for all, that by this word is not here meant, or any where else in our <HI>Saxon</HI> Laws, to be understood the ordinary or common sort of People, or any that represented them, but only <HI>Tenants in Capite,</HI> or in <HI>Military Service,</HI> which were then called the King's Thanes, and were afterward the same with the <HI>Barones Minores,</HI> men∣tioned in King <HI>Iohn</HI>▪s Charter. But I shall plainly prove, when I come to it, that the word <HI>Fideles,</HI> after the Conquest, signified only the King▪s Tenants in ca∣pite, and were the same with the Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ites, whom we find to be witnesses after the Dukes, or Earls, to this Charter of King <HI>Cnute.</HI> And tho I confess this word <HI>Fideles,</HI> doth in a common, or larger acceptation, signifie all such Subjects as owe Fealty and Allegiance to the King; yet in a strict and Legal Signification (as it is here to be taken) it signifies only the Barons or Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> as Dr. <HI>B.</HI> hath very well shewed us in his Glossary. And therefore Sir <HI>Henry Spelman</HI> himself distinguishes between these and all other Subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gloss. Tit.

should have had a place in Parliament, and all the men in <HI>England</HI> above fourteen years of age, must have been there in person, which would have been a pretty large Assembly, and such a multitude, as no one place could have con∣tained them.</P>

<P>If what Dr. <HI>B.</HI> in his Preface to his <HI>Norman</HI> History, <HI>pag.</HI> 157. as also in his Answer to Mr. <HI>P. pag.</HI> 20. be true,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>pag.</HI> 156.</NOTE> that <HI>Fendal Te∣nures</HI> owe their Original to <HI>VVilliam</HI> the Conqueror, tho in other places he is of another mind; then certainly this word <HI>Fideles,</HI> must have been used in a larger sense, in the times before the Conquest, and must have extended to all those who were bound to take the Oaths of Fealty and Allegiance, in the <HI>Folk mote,</HI> or <HI>County Court:</HI> as they did long after the Conquest, and ought to do so still, if required; and therefore this word <HI>Fideles</HI> could be then no more limi∣ted to Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> in that time, than it is now; who tho I grant they could not all be present in the Great Council in person, yet they might be there by their Delegates (as well as they are now) and who might also consist of far greater numbers than they now do; since we find in the Council of <HI>VVinchester,</HI> (but now mentioned) that after the <HI>Dukes, Earls,</HI> and <HI>Great Men</HI> of the Kingdom, there is also added, <HI>alior<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mque fidelium infinita multitudo</HI>; which great multi∣tude sure must have signified somewhat more than your Chief <HI>Thanes,</HI> or <HI>Tenents in Capite</HI> alone; or else the words <HI>Comites,</HI> and <HI>Proceres,</HI> might very well have comprehended all the Degrees of Lay-men; And therefore I desire you to shew me by some better Authorities than you yet have done, that before the Conquest, the word <HI>Fideles</HI> must needs signifie <HI>Tenants in Capite</HI> and no other; But that it did not signifie only so after that time, I shall join issue with you by and by.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to my next Authority, which is from <HI>Ail∣rid,</HI> Abbot of <HI>Rievallis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Script.</HI> X. <HI>Col.</HI> 372.</NOTE> who lived not long after the Conquest, who, in his Life of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Confessor,</HI> relating the manner of that King's Election in his Mothers VVomb, tells us, <HI>How</HI> E∣thelred <HI>his Father called a Great Council about appointing a Successor,</HI> that hereupon says thus, <HI>Fit Magnus coram Rege Episcoporum Procerumque Conventus, Magnus Plebis P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lgique Consensus</HI>; VVhere you see apparently, that the Abbots made a distin∣ction between the Assembly of the Bishops and Great Lords, and that of the <HI>Plebs, Vulgus,</HI> or Common People.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray give me leave to interrupt you a little before you proceed to any fresh Authorities. I grant it is true, that the Abbot in the place you mention, tells such an idle Tale, that this <HI>Edward</HI> was chosen King whilst in his Mothers VVomb, and so his Father made the Nobility swear Fealty to him before he was born. He is the only Author of this Legend, that I know of; and sure you your self must own that it is a little too gross to be believ'd; and therefore I wonder that you should urge that to me for a sufficient Authority, for the People or Commons having any place in the Great Council in those times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, observe to what purpose I make use of this Authority; it is not to make good the Election of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Confessor</HI> in his Mothers VVomb, but only to prove who were then supposed (when this Abbot writ) to make up the con∣stituent parts of the <HI>Wittena-Gemot,</HI> or Parliament, in the <HI>Saxon</HI> times, which was then believed by all men, to consist of the <HI>Clergy, Higher Nobility,</HI> and <HI>Com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> unless you can suppose that the Abbot should mention the Commons by
<PB N="392" REF="215"/>
Prophecy. And granting that it was only according to the custom of his own time (which the Author of the Preface to the <HI>Decem Scriptores,</HI> makes to be about the middle of King <HI>Henry</HI> II. Reign) it will sufficiently prove the antiquity of the Commons in Parliament, to be near a hundred years older than the earliest time you assign for it, (<HI>viz</HI>) the 49th of <HI>Hen.</HI> III.</P>
<P>But I shall now conclude with the conclusion to King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor's third Charter to the Abby of <HI>VVestminster,</HI> in a great Council held in the last year of his Reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">vi. <HI>Spel.</HI> Coun. Fol. 625.</NOTE> as you will find it thus recited in Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI>'s Councils in these Words, <HI>Hanc igitur Chart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> meae donationis &amp; Libertatis, in die dedicationis praedictae Ecclae. reci∣tari jussi coram Episcopis, Abbatibus, Comitibus, &amp; omnibus, Opti∣matibus Angliae, omnique Populo audiente, &amp; vidente</HI>; where by the <HI>Optimates An∣gliae,</HI> I think can be understood no other than the <HI>Thanes,</HI> or <HI>Freeholders</HI> of all sorts, as well the Kings as others; as also the Deputies of great Cities and Bur∣roughs, the Words being <HI>Optimates Angliae (non Regis)</HI> and tho it is not likely that the <HI>Populus,</HI> who are here mention'd to be present, should be the Mob, or Common People, only admitted to stare and harken at such a great Assembly; yet since the Words are in respect of them only, <HI>audiente, &amp; vidente,</HI> I shall not insist upon the Word <HI>Populus</HI> here, as a part of this Common Council of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>But yet that the Word <HI>Populus</HI> does oftentimes refer to the Representatives of the Commons, I shall conclude with the Answer of K. <HI>Harold,</HI> the last <HI>Saxon</HI> King, to the Message of <HI>VVilliam,</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> demanding the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI>; and that <HI>Harold</HI> according to his Promise should marry his Daughter;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>VVill.

<P>Since therefore it is apparent that the Commons had a share in the Great Coun∣cils before the Conquest (as you call it) I desire that you would be pleased to shew me how they came to lose it after the coming in of the <HI>Normans,</HI> and to be so long without it, as until the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> III. or 18th of <HI>Edward</HI> I. If your Authors are to be credited.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess the Authorities you have brought out of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Coun∣cils, would seem to be of some weight, were I not sensible, that the Monks, who were the only Recorders of these Councils, are very short and careless in gi∣ving
<PB N="393" REF="215"/>
a true account of them, and if we go to the Councils themselves, we might be sufficiently convinced, that all those that are said to be present at them, could not have any Places or Votes in those Assemblies, as Members of them; for in some of them (as in this Example) we find the Queen to have been there, and to have given her consent to the King's Charters; and yet I suppose you will not allow the Queen to have been there as an Estate by her self, much less to have been a Member of any of the Three Estates.</P>
<P>The like we may say for those Abbesses we find mentioned to have been pre∣sent in divers of those Councils, and particularly in that of <HI>Winchester,</HI> you so much insist upon, wherein Tythes were granted; and these are said to have approved of the Royal Charter, as well as any of the rest; and sure you do not make Women to have had Voices in our great Councils in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Times. So that it appears plain enough to me, that persons being mentioned as present in these Assemblies, or being Witnesses to Charters there granted, do not make them to have been constituent Members thereof: And therefore since the <HI>Saxon</HI> times are so dark and obscure, and so little to be collected of certainty from what we find in the old Monkish Histories, and those Fragments of Laws and Charters they have left us; I think it is time that we pass over this to the next Period after the Conquest, wherein I doubt not but to shew you, that for above an hundred years after that time, none but the <HI>Bishops, Abbots, Earls, Barons,</HI> or <HI>Tenants in Capite,</HI> were summoned by the <HI>Great Council</HI> or <HI>Parliament</HI> till the time I have so often mentioned:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you do all you can to perplex very plain and evident Proofs; For as to the Queens being often present at the Great Councils of those times, it is no more than what was usual in these Elder times; and that in <HI>France</HI> as well as here, as any man that will but peruse the Charters of some of the Kings of <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 156. <HI>Pag.</HI> 158. <HI>Pag.</HI> 106.</NOTE> of the second Race, as they are in Father <HI>Mabilion de Re∣diplomatica,</HI> may easily satisfie themselves; and as for the Ab∣besses, whom we find sometimes mentioned to have been there be∣fore the Conquest, they might also according to the Custom of those times have appeared in Person in the Great Councils, in the Right of their Monasteries, and of those great Possessions they held, or else they might have been often represented by their <HI>Oecomi,</HI> or Stewards, who transacted all busi∣ness for them; and your own Civil Law doth always suppose, that what any Persons perform by their Lawful Proxies, it is said to be done by themselves; and that the Abbesses and Prioresses, did together with the other Spiritual Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> joyn to grant Scrutage upon the Knights Fees they held; I shall shew you before we have finished this Discourse. But since I think I have sufficiently proved, the Commons being in possession of this Right by a long Prescription, I shall now leave it to you to prove, that they did not enjoy it af∣ter the Conquest, and that not until the time you suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you are pleased to impose this Task upon me, I shall willingly submit to it; and therefore before I proceed farther, pray let us see how far we are agreed. In the first place I think you will grant, that till about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> I. Reign, there is no express mention made in our Records, or Hi∣storians, of any Representatives for the <HI>Commons,</HI> either by <HI>Knights</HI> of <HI>Shires, Ci∣tizens</HI> or <HI>Burgesses</HI> of Towns; much less the word <HI>Commons,</HI> mentioned by them
<PB N="394" REF="216"/>
in the sense it is now taken; For if we peruse <HI>Ingulph,</HI> or <HI>Eadmerus,</HI> or any other Ancient Historian of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, or his Sons time, when they have occasion to mention the Great Councils of that Age, we can find none mentioned (besides the Bishops) but <HI>Principes, Proceres, Primates,</HI> or <HI>Optimates Regni</HI>; or else in the following Age, under the Titles of <HI>Optimates,</HI> or <HI>Magnates Regni,</HI> by <HI>Matt. Paris,</HI> and <HI>Matt.</HI> of <HI>Westminster,</HI> who are often comprehended under the more particular Titles of <HI>Comites &amp; Barones,</HI> or <HI>Baronagium Regni,</HI> or else by the more general of <HI>Nobilitas, Universitas,</HI> or <HI>Communitas Regni,</HI> that is, the whole Univer∣sity, Community, or Body of the Kingdom, represented in Parliament, by the <HI>Bishops, Abbots, Earls,</HI> and <HI>Barons</HI> thereof. As for most of these words, I have given you my sense of them already, in the Times before the Conquest; and tho I grant there may be other Persons, sometimes mentioned after the <HI>Barons,</HI> as <HI>Milites, Liberi Homines</HI> or <HI>Tenentes,</HI> yet I think Dr. <HI>B.</HI> very plainly proves, by those Autho∣rities he produces in his Answer to Mr. <HI>P.</HI> as also in his Glossary at the end of it, that by all the Words before-mentioned, which are used in our Ancient Histori∣ans, can only be understood either the Greater Barons, or else the Less, who were <HI>Tenents in capite,</HI> and were a part of the <HI>Baronage</HI> or <HI>Nobility</HI> of those Times, and whose Votes did then conclude all their Subfeudotaries, or <HI>Mesne Tenents,</HI> who held of them; and these together with the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Abbots,</HI> &amp;c. did represent all degrees of Men in the Kingdom, and being often comprehended under the General Titles of <HI>Clerus</HI> and <HI>Populus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">vi. <HI>B. G.</HI></NOTE> or else <HI>Pleb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or <HI>Val∣gus</HI>; or else under these Titles, as yet more generally expressed by <HI>Regnum,</HI> and <HI>Sacerdotium,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Laity</HI> of the Kingdom; the Words <HI>Populus,</HI> and <HI>Plebs,</HI> or <HI>Vulgus,</HI> signifying no more in those days, in our Historians (when they treat of Parliamentary Affairs) than the <HI>Lay-Earls</HI> and <HI>Barons,</HI> with the other Less <HI>Tenants in capite</HI>: So that the Vulgar or Common People, neither by themselves, nor their Representatives had then any Place in our Great Coun∣cils: And therefore I think I may boldly affirm with Dr. <HI>B.</HI> first, That the Commons represented by Knights,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. Introduct.</HI></NOTE> Citizens, and Burgesses in Parliament, were not introduced, nor were one of the Three Estates in Parliament, before the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That before that time the Body of the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> or Free∣men (as now understood, or as we now frequently call them) collectively taken, had not any Share or Votes in making of Laws for the Government of the King∣dom, nor had any Communication in Affairs of State, unless as they were repre∣sented by the <HI>Tenents in capite.</HI> And these two Propositions I think I shall be able to prove by undeniable Evidence, drawn from our Ancient Historians, the Laws and Charters of our Kings, as also from those Parliament Rolls, Records, and Acts of Parliament, we have yet left us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have made a very bold challenge, and if you can make it out, I grant you will carry the day, and I shall then willingly submit to your Opinion; But since I find the greatest part of our Arguments do consist in the equivocal use of those words, by which I confess the Com∣mons in Parliament are generally expressed in our Ancient Historians: I shall in the first place shew you (to avoid all unnecessary dispute about words) that by every one of these Expressions you have mentioned▪ the Commons might very well be comprehended as well after the Conquest, as before. And therefore to take the words in the same order as you have recited them, I shall
<PB N="395" REF="216"/>
begin with the word <HI>Principes,</HI> which I have already proved signified before the Conquest no more than Chief, or Principal Men; and that it means no more after the Conquest, I shall shew you by several Authorities; and though I grant that word is most commonly used by <HI>Eadmerus,</HI> yet could it not be meant in the sense it is now understood, there being then never a Prince, nor so much as a Duke in <HI>England</HI>; but what was understood by this Expression in after-times, we must appeal to Historians. <HI>Mat.</HI> of <HI>Westminster,</HI> in his <HI>Flores Histor. Anno Dom.</HI> 1280.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 409.</NOTE> (being the 7th Year of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>First,</HI> which was but 15 years after the 49 <HI>Hen.</HI> 3.) thus reckons up the consti∣tuent parts of that Parliament, <HI>Rex, Pontifices, &amp; Principes Anglicani convenerunt in unum,</HI> &amp;c. Yet in <HI>Rot. Claus.</HI> 7. <HI>Edward</HI> 1. It is called a Parliament; and at which the Statute of <HI>Mortmain</HI> was Enacted. And that the Commons were there as well as they are now, I shall prove when I come to those times. But as for the word <HI>Proceres</HI> in the ancient Manuscript Chronicle of <HI>Walter</HI> of <HI>Coventry</HI> 9<SUP>o</SUP>. <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1225.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Bib.</HI> Cot∣ton.</NOTE> you'll find these words; <HI>Purificatione Beatae Mariae convocantur apud</HI> London <HI>Proceres Angliae ibique tractatu habito diffusiore cum Clero, &amp; Populo ibidem convocato Rex concessit Libertates tam Ecclesiae quam Regni, quam Forestae sicut Cartae suae inde confectae &amp; singulis Comitatibus liberatae plenius testantur ibidemque con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssa Domino Regi a Comitibus, &amp; Baronibus, &amp; Clero &amp; Populo ibidem praesentibus, Quintadecima omnium mobilium de Communi assensu, praeterquam de Ecclesiis.</HI></P>
<P>But as for the word <HI>Magnates, Mat. Paris</HI> in his History of this year relates it thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 223.</NOTE> <HI>Rex</HI> Hen. <HI>ad natale tenuit curiam suam apud</HI> Westm. <HI>Praesentibus clero &amp; populo, cum magnatibus Regionis solemni∣tate igitur ut decebat completa, Hubertus de Burgo ex parte ejusdem Regis proposuit coram Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, comitibus, Baronibus, &amp; aliis universis</HI>▪ &amp;c. But to give you the rest in <HI>English</HI>; The King here demanded the fifteenth part of all their movable Goods; upon which the Parties above mentioned, with one accord answered, That they would willingly yield to the King's desire, if He would confirm the great Charters. To which the King having assented, and sealed them; they grant∣ed the said Supply. From which we may observe, that as all the inferior Clergy were comprehended under the word <HI>Clerus</HI>; so must, by a like parity of Reason, the Commons be under <HI>Populus</HI>▪ or else it would have been an idle Tau∣tology when it is put, as it is here, distinct from <HI>Magnates.</HI></P>
<P>Now though there be no other persons expresly mentioned by these two Hi∣storians to have been at this Parliament of the Laity, but the Earls and Barons, comprehended by them under the general Names of <HI>Proceres, Populus &amp; Magna∣tes</HI>; yet do but read the conclusion to the great Charter of 9th <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. and you will find, that besides the Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Earls and Barons, there were also present, the Knights, Freeholders, and all others of the Kingdom, by their law∣ful Representatives, as I shall shew you more at large when I come to make use of this Charter, as an Argument to prove the Commons to have appeared in Par∣liament before 49 <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. So likewise the Statute of Fines made 27 <HI>Edward.</HI> 1. was ordained <HI>de Communi Concilio Regni,</HI> and yet no mention made either of the Assent of the Lords or Commons; and yet this Statute was made but 9 years af∣ter the 18th of that King. Since which time the <HI>Dr.</HI> himself acknowledges the Commons to have been always represented in Parliament, as they are at this day; and yet <HI>Mat. Westminster</HI> speaking of this Parliament, mentions it's Orders
<PB N="396" REF="217"/>
only in general words, thus; <HI>Dominica secunda Quadragesima citatis Magna∣tibus Regni apud</HI> Westmonasterium; and yet it is certain all the Estates of the Kingdom were there: So that it is not safe to conclude from the general, and equivocal Expressions either of ancient Statutes, or Historians, That the Commons were not in Parliament, because not particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>I could give you more Instances of the like Kind, but I will not tire you: But shall now proceed to shew, that notwithstanding the use you make of the Testi∣mony of <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> as to the sense of the word <HI>Magnates,</HI> yet, that all those Historians that writ immediately before or after him, and continue his History, do frequently make use of the word <HI>Magnates &amp; Primates,</HI> to signify the Com∣mons, as well as the Lords assembled in Parliament. And for the proof of this, I shall give the Testimonies of two approved Authors. The <HI>First</HI> is <HI>Thomas VValsing∣ham,</HI> in his History of <HI>England,</HI> who in <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1313. 6 <HI>Edw.</HI> 2. hath these words <HI>Reced<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns: (Rex) de Berewici partibus pervenit Eboracum, ubi magnum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Clero tenuit Concilium, &amp; Regni Magnatibus Universis.</HI></P>
<P>So likewise <HI>Mat.</HI> of <HI>VVestminster,</HI> in his <HI>Flores Histor.</HI> in the 24th of <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1296. relates a Parliament held at St. <HI>Edmondsbury,</HI> at which appear∣ed <HI>Primates, ac Magnates sui Regni,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>a quibus novum Tallagium postulavit,</HI> &amp;c. I could give you more of the same kind out of this Author, but I fear lest I should tire you; and therefore I shall conclude with the Testimony of <HI>Hen. de Knighton</HI> in his History, <HI>De Eventibus Angliae,</HI> where in 9 <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. he thus speaks concerning this King's granting the Great Charters, <HI>Post haec Rex Henricus concessis Magnatibus terra duas chartas, unam de Foresta, &amp; aliam de libertatibus, ob quam causam Communes Regni concesserunt quintam decimam partem Mobilium, &amp; immobili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI> From all which you may observe, that in the time when this Author wrote, it was generally believed, that this term <HI>Magnates</HI> comprehended all the Estates of the Kingdom, and likewise supposed the Commons (whom he here calls <HI>Communes,</HI> to have had a principal share, not only in the paying, but grant∣ing this great Tax. And forthe farther proof of this, pray see what <HI>VV. Malmes∣bury</HI> says in his History, when reciting the Speech of the Bishop of <HI>VVinchester,</HI> then the Pope's Legate, speaking of the <HI>Londoners,</HI> hath this remarkable passage, <HI>Londinenses, quì praecipui habebantur in Anglia sicut Proceres</HI>; so that if the chief Citizens of that famous City, were reckoned <HI>sicut Proceres,</HI> sure those they chose to represent them in Parliament, might much better deserve that Title. And thus likewise <HI>VValsingham,</HI> in his History in the 17th of <HI>Edw.</HI> 2. tells us, that he summoned to a Parliament at <HI>London, Regni Proceres, &amp; Praelatos ad Tractandum de variis Regni negotiis</HI>; but in the close Roll of this very year it ap∣pears by the <HI>Expensis Militum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. claus.</HI> 17. <HI>E.</HI> 2. <HI>m</HI> 24. <HI>dorso.</HI></NOTE> that the Commons were there, as as well the Lords. So that you see they were all then compre∣hended by our Historians under the general term of <HI>Proceru Regni.</HI></P>
<P>I come in the next place to the words <HI>Nobiles &amp; Nobilitas. VValsingham,</HI> 5 <HI>Edw.</HI> 2. gives us this account. <HI>Post Natale Dominicum convenit universa multitudo Regni nobilium ad Parliamentum</HI> Londoniis. Now what is here meant by this <HI>Multitudo Nobilium</HI> may be proved by the Parliamentary Writs of this year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Pryn's</HI> 2 <HI>part of the R. of Par. VV.</HI></NOTE> as appears by the close Roll of this year, wherein there are Writs of Summons for the Commons directed to the Sheriffs.</P>
<P>And that the House of Commons were often Stiled Noble in latter times ap∣pears by a Speech Recorded in the Rolls of Parliament 7th of <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. to be
<PB N="397" REF="217"/>
spoken by Sir <HI>Mich. de la Pool,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Parl.</HI> 7. <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. <HI>part</HI> 1. <HI>n.</HI> 1.</NOTE> then Lord Chancellor, to the Lords and Commons, which begins thus, <HI>Ydist vous</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> I say to you) <HI>Messeurs Prelats, &amp; Seigneurs Temporelx, &amp; vous mes Compaignons les Chivalers, &amp; autres de la</HI> Noble <HI>commune de Angleterre.</HI></P>
<P>And to prove that this Word was then used in this sense amongst Civilians, from whom we derive most of our Titles of Dignities, you may see in the large work of <HI>Barthol: Cassaanaeus,</HI> called <HI>Catalogus Gloriae Mundi,</HI> written on this subject; where, in his 8<HI>th. part, consid.</HI> 18. he hath this amongst other Com∣ments on the word <HI>Nobilitas; Nobilitas etiam causatur ex loco, quoniam civis ex urbe splendida oriundus, Nobilis est</HI>; for which he there gives many Authorities. And this Title he looks upon as due also to Countrey Gentlemen, living upon the Husbandry of their own Estates, or Annual Rents.</P>
<P>And that by the word <HI>Magnates,</HI> are often understood the <HI>Knights</HI> of <HI>Shires,</HI> commonly called in old <HI>French, Grantz des Countees</HI>; I can give you sufficient Authorities: Now this word <HI>Magnates</HI> is always rendred in our old <HI>French,</HI> by <HI>Grantz</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. R. C.</HI> p. 94, 95.</NOTE> For the proof of this, I desire you in the first place to take notice, that <HI>Rot.

<P>I must confess you have made me think more on this Subject, than per∣haps otherwise I should have done; yet I must observe, That most of the Quo∣tations you have made use of, concerning the meaning of the words <HI>Proceres, Magnates,</HI> and <HI>Nobiles, &amp;c.</HI> are from Authors who writ after the time that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Commons, as now Represented, to have been constantly Summoned to Par∣liament; so that they might very well, through haste or inadvertency, confound them with the Earls and Lords, and so stile them by the same Titles. For I will prove to you, before the conclusion of this Discourse, by undeniable Re∣cords, That by the words <HI>Magnates</HI> and <HI>Proceres,</HI> are understood the Bishops, Earls, and Barons, as distinguished from the Commons. But I think I can suffi∣ciently prove from <HI>Mat.

And I take this to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> evident and clear, that I cannot quit this Opinion, without you can shew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> better Reasons to the contrary, than hitherto you have done.</P>

<P>I see nothing will satisfie those who have once received a Prejudice; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> otherwise I think it may be proved sufficiently, from that Clause in <HI>Magna Chart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> I have mentioned, That other persons were there before the 49<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> besides your great <HI>Barons,</HI> and <HI>Tenents in capite.</HI> And as for the use of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> words you mention, in Historians after the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. nothing can be a plainer proof for me: For if those Historians did comprehend the Common under those general Words, or Phrases, we have been now disputing about, I de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sire to know why they might not have been likewise comprehended under th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same terms, by <HI>Mat.

But thus much I think is certain, That they were a sort of persons much above any other Lay-men of the Kingdom; since they held their Estates immediately from the King, and were so considerable, as that by the Constitutions of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> they were not to be Excommunicated without the King's leave; and so were then in some sort of the same Order, <HI>ratione Tenurae,</HI> with the great Barons or Peers, being commonly stiled <HI>Barones,</HI> and made up but one Estate or Order of Lay-men in Parliament. And from thence I sup∣pose proceeds that common Error of Sir <HI>Ed. Coke,</HI> that the Lords and Com∣mons did anciently sit together, and made but one House. Now if you have any thing to object against this Notion, pray let me hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you and I are come pretty near an issue in this question; for you confess that these lesser <HI>Tenents in capite,</HI> and whom you comprise under the word <HI>Barones,</HI> were not truly and properly <HI>Barons</HI>; and so far you are in the Right; but yet you will have them to be somewhat more than mere Commoners; as if there had been some Degree or Order of men in <HI>England,</HI> in those times, who were neither Lords nor Commons, but an Amphibious Race between both. But to prove that they were indeed no more than Commoners, and not Lords nor Pee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s at all, nor equal with them, we need go no farther than their way of Trial in cases of Treason or Felony, which was by mere Commoners, who were not Te∣nants <HI>in capite,</HI> as well as those that were; so that a person who was no Tenant <HI>in Capite,</HI> and might serve upon a Jury of Life and Death upon them; and as well as the Dr. in his Answer to Mr. <HI>P.</HI> as you asserted, that they only served <HI>in the Country upon all Iuries</HI>; and that before the time of King <HI>Iohn.</HI> So after all this noise of none but Lords and <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI> appearing for the whole Commons of <HI>England,</HI> we find by your own showing, that three parts in four of the Lay Members of that Council were as meer Commoners as our Knights of Shires, and Barons of the Five Ports at this day; nor can I see any reason why these latter might not be as well comprehended under the Word <HI>Barones,</HI> as the former, who were meer Commoners likewise; if we consider that it was nei∣ther Nobility, nor Birth, nor the King's Writs of Summons, but only the meer Tenure of their Lands that gave them a particular right to a Place in that As∣sembly in those Ages; or if a meer Citizen could get Money enough to pur∣chase such an Estate <HI>in capite,</HI> he was as good a Member of Parllament as the
<PB N="400" REF="219"/>
best of them all: So that the Question then amounts to no more than this, Whether the Commons of <HI>England</HI> were then represented by <HI>Tenants in Capite,</HI> or by Knights of Shires, and others, as they are now. But since you will have none Commoners, but <HI>Tenants in capite</HI> to have had places therein, pray tell me whe∣ther you allow that Priviledge to all who held <HI>in capite,</HI> or not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I allow it to all who held <HI>in capite</HI> by Knights Service, and who also enjoyed a whole Knight's Fee, or so much as was sufficient to render them able to sustain the Dignity of that Place; not but that the King had also a prerogative of summoning or omitting whom of them he pleased, to his Great Council or Parliament, till the Less <HI>Tenants in capite</HI> thinking it a wrong to them, it was provided by King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter, that all of them should be sum∣moned by one General Writ of Summons, directed to the Sheriff. But I ex∣clude from this Concil all Tenants by Petit Serjeanty, who tho 'tis true held of the King <HI>in capite,</HI> yet was it not by Knights Service. So likewise I exclude all Cities and Towns, tho the Citizens or Burgesses of divers of them held their Lands and Tenements by that Tenure; since being neither noble by Blood, nor having Estates sufficient to maintain the Port of a Gentleman, or Knight, they had no Right to appear there in Person among the other Tenants, who were owners of one or more Knights Fees. Yet do I not affirm, that the Commons were not after some sort represented in Parliament by their Superior Lords,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.</HI> 117. <HI>&amp; deim,</HI></NOTE> tho not as Commoners, since the Bishops, Abbots, and other Barons did then make Laws, and give Taxes, not only for themselves, but their Feudatory Tenents also, tho of never so great Estates; and Tenure <HI>in capite</HI> was then looked upon as the only true Freehold of the Kingdom, and the Tenents by it as the only true Freeholders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall shew you by and by the falsity of this Notion, but in the mean time pray tell me when a Great Council or Parliament was called, who repre∣sented those Persons, who you say did not appear there; and made General Laws, and granted General Taxes for themselves, and the whole Kingdom, when there was occasion. For I see you shut out the greater part even of these your true Freeholders from this Assembly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for the Tenents in Petit Serjeanty, I at present conceive (tho I am not sure of it) that many of them might hold Lands, and perhaps di∣vers Knights Fees, by Grand Serjeanty, or Knights Service also; since those E∣states which were given by the Conqueror to his Servants, to be held of him; by such and such Petit Services, might in process of time fall by Purchase, or De∣scent, into the hands of such Great Tenents <HI>in capite,</HI> as had sufficient Estates to maintain that Dignity; and as for the rest, they might, for ought as I know, before the Statute <HI>de Tallagio non concedendo,</HI> have been taxed by the Kings Writs, according to the proportion of the Knights Fees, or parts of Knights Fees, which they then held; and according to the Rate of the Sums imposed in Parliament, either by way of Aids, upon every Knights Fee; or else by way of Subsidy, by so much a yard, or Plow Land throughout all <HI>England</HI>; which has been the only way of taxing ever since that of Knights Fees hath been disused.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I find after all you have said, that scarce half your <HI>Tenents in capite</HI> had any Votes in Prrliament, either by themselves, or their Representatives; and so having Laws made for them, and being taxed at the King's Will, were as
<PB N="401" REF="219"/>
errant Slaves and Vassals, notwithstanding their Tenure <HI>in capite,</HI> as the meanest person of the Kingdom, who was taxed (as you would have it) at the Will of his Superior Lord; which, whether so great and powerful a Body of men would ever have sufferd, I leave to any indifferent person to judge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant this may now appear somewhat hard; yet since it was the receiv'd Law and Custom of the Kingdom, it was not then look'd upon as a grievance; and it was then no more unjust than it is now, that persons under forty Shillings a year, tho of never so good Estates in Money, or Stock; or that Tenants for years, or for the Life of another, should at this day have no Votes at the Electi∣on of Knights of Shires, and consequently be without any Representatives in Par∣liament of their own Choice, and yet be subject to all Laws and Taxes (tho ne∣ver so great) when made and imposed by the King in Parliament; And I am a∣ble to give you divers good Authorities to prove, that even <HI>London</HI> it self, and all other Cities and Towns which held of the King <HI>in capite,</HI> and were called his Demesnes, were often taxed by the King and his Council out of Parliament, before the Statute <HI>De Tallagio non concedendo</HI>; And I think Dr. <HI>B.</HI> hath proved this beyond exception, in his Animadversions upon Mr. <HI>A</HI>'s <HI>Iani Anglorum facies no∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI>; and he there gives us the Record it self of 39 <HI>Hen.</HI> III. now in the keeping of the King's Remembrancer of the Exchequer: <HI>That the King did that year</HI> (as he had divers times before) <HI>Talliate or Tax all his Demesne Lands in</HI> England, <HI>and then likewise demanded of the City of London</HI> the sum of 3000 Marks, in name of the Talliage or Tax so laid; And the Mayor and Citizens at last yielded, after a great Contest; It appearing upon search of the Rolls in the Ezchequer, that the Citi∣zens of <HI>London</HI> had been several times before so taxed in the Reigns of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> and the King himself; and so they payed at last the Sum which the King deman∣ded. By which you see, that the greatest and richest Cities and Towns in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> were taxed at the King's Will; nay, I think I am able to prove (were it now necessary) that the whole Kingdom was often taxed by the King and his Council only, before the granting of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s <HI>Magna Charta</HI>; and the Statute <HI>de Talla∣gio non concedendo,</HI> above mentioned.</P>
<P>But to return to the Matter from which you forced me to digress.</P>
<P>I think nothing is more plain, than that our Ancient Parliaments were only the King's Court Baron for the dispatch of the Publick Affairs of the Kingdom, and in which (as in the Lesser Courts Baroa, or Courts of Mannor, the Suitors or Tenents were, together with the Lord, or his Stewards, the sole Judges; So that at first, after the Conquest, it belong'd to the King alone, as the Supreme Lord of the Kingdom, to appoint or call which, or what sort of those Tenants be pleased, to attend him with their Aid and Advice, at his Common Councils, or Parliaments; And I think nothing is more evident (as I shall prove more at large from our Ancient Histories, Records and Statutes) then, that before the 49th <HI>Hen.</HI> III. and some years also after that time, none but the Bishops, Abbots, Earls, and Greater Barons, and some of the Less, called in King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter, the other <HI>Tenents in capite,</HI> then constituted the whole Body of the Parliament, under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Titles of <HI>Baronagium Angliae,</HI> or <HI>Communitas,</HI> or <HI>Universitas Baronagii Angliae</HI>; And for this I can give you so good Authorities, that nothing but more co∣gent and evident Proofs can bring me from this Opinion; And therefore I must tell you, I do not value those loose and inconsiderate Expressions of Historians either before or after that time.</P>

At this rate every Yeo∣man, or Petty Freeholder was a Baron; so that this Assembly might then consist of above 50 or 60 Thousand Persons; Since <HI>Spot</HI> in his Chronicle tells us, that <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror reserved to himself the service of about 60000 Knights Fees, which by the time, I suppose, might have been divided into many more lesser ones,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then you your self must also grant, that when all your Greater and Less Barons, or Tenents <HI>in capite</HI> appeared in Person, Parliaments were much more numerous than they are now; since according to the Dr.'s Catalogue, out of Dooms-Day-Book, (in his Appendix to the <HI>English</HI> History, Vol. 1.) of all the <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI> or Serjeanty that held all the Lands in every County of King <HI>William,</HI> they did (besides the Bishops, Abbots, Earls, and Barons) alto∣gether amount to about 700. and these in the 49th of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. by forfeiture, and new Conveyances from the Crown; or by those other ways you have now men∣tioned, might be multiplied into twice as many more, and those also of suffici∣ent Estates to maintain the Port of a Member of Parliament, or Knight; Since 15 Pounds a year was in the Reign of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> III. reckoned as a Knight's Fee, and he that had it, was liable to be Knighted: And if so, I pray according to your own Hypothesis, how could so great an Assembly be managed, as of about 3000 or 4000 Persons, without strange confusion and disorder? but upon our Principles there will follow no more Absurdities or Inconveniencies than in yours; for either these Barons of Counties, Burgesses and Inhabitants of Towns and Cities, were always represented by Knights and Citizens, as they are now; or else these Barons of Counties, appearing for themselves, were Lords of Man∣nors, or Freeholders of good Estates, who were not so numerous or inconsidera∣ble as you imagine; the Freehold Lands in <HI>England,</HI> being in those days but in a few hands, in comparison to what they are now. And for this Opinion I have Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI> of my side; who in the place already quoted, under <HI>Barones C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itatus,</HI> expresly tells us, <HI>Hoc nomine contineri videtur antiquis paginis, omnis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eodalium specier, in uno quovis Comitara degentium; Proceres nempè, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Domini, nèc non liberè quique Tenentes, hoc est fundorum proprietarii, Anglicè</HI> Freeholders <HI>ut Superiù<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dictum est.

<P>That the Earls and Greater Barons, both Spiritual and Temporal, toge∣ther with the Tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> then made the Body of the Baronage of <HI>England,</HI> I have very good Authority on my side; but that any Feudatory Barons or Te∣nants of a Lesser Degree, ever had any Places or Votes in those Assemblies, I think you can give me no sufficient Authority for it.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>P.</HI> is not at all to be blamed (as you make him) in these two Quota∣tions, since in that out of <HI>Camden,</HI> you cannot deny, but he hath truly quoted that Author, as it was in his First Edition; and if he afterwares altered it, it may very well be questioned whether he did not add the Word <HI>Superiores,</HI> ra∣ther out of fear of displeasing the Greater Nobility, (whom that Quotation had before Shockt) than out of any sense of his being in the Wrong; as it appears by the Words immediately following, when he tells us out of a nameless Manu∣script Author; <HI>That</HI> Henry <HI>III. out of so great a multitude of Barons, which was sedi∣tious and turbulent, called the best and chiefest of them only by Writ to Parliament.</HI> By which it plainly appears, that he supposed all those Less <HI>Barons,</HI> or <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI>
<PB N="405" REF="221"/>
tho no Lords, as now understood, who were thus excluded to have been only Nominal, and not Real Barons; and if so, Commoners; or else he must extend the Peerage of <HI>England</HI> to at least Three or Four Thousand Persons; For so many <HI>Tenents in capite</HI> might very well be at that time.</P>
<P>The same I may likewise say as to the Quotation out of Mr. <HI>Selden</HI>; for by the Words, <HI>quibus peculiaris in ordinum Comitiis locus est</HI>; 'tis plain he supposed that all the rest of those <HI>Tenents in capite</HI> were but meer Commoners; yet he no where affirms, that none but these appeared in Parliament for all the Commons of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>; for he very well knew the unreasonableness of that Suppositi∣on; Since besides these Barons or Tenants <HI>in capite,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 8.</NOTE> <HI>Bracton</HI> in his first Book tells us of divers other Orders of Men, of Great Dignity and Power in this Kingdom, about the time when you suppose this marvellous Al∣teration to have happened; His Words are these, <HI>Et sub iis (viz. Regibus) Duces, Co∣mites, Barones, Magnates, sive vavassores, &amp; Milites, &amp; etiam Liberi, &amp; Villani &amp; deversa Potestates sub Rege constitutae</HI>; and a little farther, <HI>sunt &amp; alti Potentes sub Re∣ge qui dicuntur Barones, hoc est Robur belli; sunt &amp; alii qui dicuntur Vavassores viri <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dignitatis.</HI> From which Words I desire you to observe, that he here makes the <HI>Magnates,</HI> and the <HI>Vavassores,</HI> or Feudatory Tenants to be all one, and also ranks them before the <HI>Milites.</HI> Now whether these <HI>Vavassores</HI> and <HI>Milites,</HI> who did not all hold of the King <HI>in capite,</HI> were men of so great Dignity and Power as these whom he here reckons immediately after the Earls and Great Barons, should have no Votes in Parliament, neither by themselves, nor their Representatives, is altogether improbable.</P>
<P>And agreeable to this of <HI>Bracton, Du Fresne,</HI> in his <HI>Lexicon Tit. Vavasor</HI> tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 1262.</NOTE> that <HI>Vavassorum duo erant ordines, sub majorum apellatione implectuntur, qui Barones apellantur, sub <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>norum vero, quos vulgò Va∣vassores dicunt; ut leges Henrici</HI> I. <HI>Reg. Ang. Thaines minores, respectu Thainorum ma∣jorum qui Baronibus aequiparantur.</HI> But that these Lesser Thanes or Vavassors were also stiled <HI>Barones,</HI> Sir <HI>H.

So likewise the same Author, a Leaf or two farther, speaking of the <HI>Barones</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> mentioned in the Charter of King <HI>Henry</HI> I. understands them, <HI>pro civibus praestantioribus qui socnas suas, &amp; consuetudines,</HI> i. e. <HI>Curias habue∣runt, &amp; Privilegia, eorum instar, qui in Comitatu Barones Comitatus dicuntur, &amp;c.</HI> Nor did this Title of Barones extend to <HI>London</HI> alone, but he also immediately tells us in the same place, <HI>Sic Barones de Ebaraco, de Cestria, de Warwico de Soe Feversham, &amp; plurium Villaram Regiis Privilegiis insignium, cum in Anglia tum in Gallia,</HI> &amp;c. and that Barons of Counties were no more than Lords of Mannors, I have just now proved; for <HI>Socna</HI> means no more than a Court Baron, or Court of a Man∣nor; So that here arises a plain distinction between the <HI>Barones Regis,</HI> the King's Great Barons or Tenants <HI>in capite</HI>; and these Lesser Barons, we now are here speaking of, called <HI>Medmesse Thegnes,</HI> and <HI>Burgh Thegnes,</HI> by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> till they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the Word <HI>Parliamentum,</HI> to signifie the Common Council of the Kingdom; who, tho no Peers, yet were <HI>Barones Regni,</HI> Barons or Noblemen of the King∣dom, according to the general acceptation of the Word <HI>Nobiles,</HI> in that Age; and is such made up the Body of the <HI>Baronage,</HI> called by <HI>Matt.

<P>I see you do all you can from the equivocal use of the Word <HI>Barones,</HI> to croud in new and unknown men into the Great Council of the Kingdom, <HI>viz.</HI> your <HI>Barons of Counties, Cities,</HI> and <HI>Towns,</HI> whom (since you dare not affirm there were then any Knights of Shires) you suppose to have served instead of them; and these you would have to be, not <HI>Barones Regis,</HI> but <HI>Reg∣ni,</HI> or <HI>Terrae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

But these are not the men who had ever any Place in our Great Councils, and I desire you would prove to me, that ever they appeared there before the Times I assign; and I would also have you inform your self of the Gentlemen of whom you borrow this Notion, if they can prove that there were any such kind of <HI>Tenure,</HI> as <HI>Tenura de Terra,</HI> or <HI>de Regno</HI>? or whether there was ever any man that held an Estate <HI>de Regno?</HI> Whether forfeitures or Es∣cheats were to the Kingdom? And whether Fealty was sworn, or Homage done to the Kingdom? Or whether an Earl was invested or Girt with the Sword of the County by the Kingdom? Or whether the ancient Ceremonies used at the Creations of Earls and Barons, were done by the Kingdom? Thus all the Barons of <HI>England</HI> held of the King, and thus all these things were performed and done to our Ancient Kings, and by them; which are most manifest Notes of the King's immediate Jurisdiction over the Barons, and that they were his <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI> and by consequence his Barons only, which you cannot deny; and of which Te∣nants <HI>in capite</HI> the Earls and Greater Barons always created by Investiture of Robes, or other Ceremonies, were summoned by particular Write, and the other Less Barons, or <HI>Tenants in capite</HI> ever since the 17th of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> were sum∣moned by one Common Writ, directed to the Sheriff of the County▪ since which time (if not some time before) I grant these Tenants <HI>in capite</HI> were not look'd upon as Barons or Peers of the Kingdom, properly so called; Yet did their Votes in Parliament still conclude, and charge their Tenants in the making and impo∣sing of Taxes or Laws, which they alone, together with the Bishops and greater Barons still, performed, until the Times I assign.</P>

<P>I see you are in a Wood, and do not know well under what Class to rank your <HI>Tenants in capite</HI>; for if they were at first all Lords or Peers, how could they serve upon. Juries in Hundred or County Courts? If they were meer Commo∣ners, then there were Commons in Parliament before the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> III. and why might not others as considerable Commoners, have Places in the Great Council as well as they▪ whether they were the Kings Barons, or <HI>Tenents in ca∣pite,</HI> or not? But in answer to this, you tell me, that we never had any <HI>Barons</HI> held by mean Tenure, here in <HI>England</HI>; this is plainly equivocal; for if you mean it of <HI>Baronies in capite,</HI> it is true; if of other <HI>Baronies,</HI> it is false by your own Confession; And Sir <HI>H. Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lman</HI> tells us, in the Title last quoted, that the Barons of <HI>Burford</HI> pleaded to hold of the King <HI>per Baroniam,</HI> and yet he was never any
<PB N="407" REF="222"/>
Baron of the Kingdom. Now I desire you to shew me, if he and such like Ba∣rons as himself, had no place in Parliament, who it was represented them there? And therefore in answer to your Dilemma, I grant that every Baron by Tenure, was a Tenant <HI>in capite</HI>; but every Tenant <HI>in capite</HI> was not a Baron; and this I think is so plain, that you your self cannot deny it.</P>
<P>But in answer to your next Question; I can answer it without asking the Gentleman, from whom you suppose I borrow the Notion, that there might be other Barons, or Lords of Mannors, who by reason of their Estates might have Places in Parliament (supposing Knights of Shires were not introduced till after <HI>Henry</HI> the II. or King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Time, when such Freeholders became too nume∣rous all to appear in person) and yet these might not be Barons by Tenure; And therefore all your Questions conclude nothing; For you suppose that which is still to be proved, That because all the Barons of <HI>England,</HI> properly so called, held of the King <HI>in capite,</HI> and were consequently his Barons; that therefore none but B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rons, and Tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> had any place in our Great Councils; which is the thing you only suppose, and I as positively deny.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir, since you put it to that issue, I hope I shall fully convince you, that none but the Persons I have mentioned were the constituent Members of the Common Council or Parliament, before 49th <HI>Hen.</HI> III or 18th <HI>Edw.</HI> I and who done gave assent to all Laws that were made, and all Taxes that were to be impo∣sed on themselves, and their Under-Tenants, who were then concluded by the Acts of their Superior Lords.</P>
<P>But not to wrangle with you any longer, about the signification of the Word <HI>Barones,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. Pag.</HI> 116.</NOTE> I grant there were Nominal or Titular Ba∣rons, very many, such as I have mentioned; nay, that there were several other Great Subjects, who had Tenants that held 5, 6, 7, 8 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nay more Knights Fees under them, and who had the Name and Title of Ba∣rons. But what is this to the purpose? I desire you would prove to me, by any direct proof, that these sort of men had any Voices, either by themselves, or their Representatives in our Great Councils, till after the time we allow them; and this (besides the Proofs I have already brought) I think is sufficient; Since it is plain, that the <HI>Barones Regni,</HI> or <HI>Terra,</HI> and the <HI>Milites,</HI> and <HI>Homines sui,</HI> are all one and the same Persons; that is, they were the King's Great Barons, or <HI>Tenents in capite</HI>; who alone constituted the Baronage, or University of the Baronage of <HI>England,</HI> or of the Kingdom, in our Great Councils, or Parliaments: And for the farther proof of this, I need go no farther than those very Ar∣guments your own Author,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. Pag.</HI> 111.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>P.</HI> hath made use of, in his Right of the Commons asserted; wherein he would prove from certain Letters that were sent from the Baronage, or University of the Baro∣nage of <HI>England</HI> to the Pope, against the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>'s Exactions here in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> And therefore I shall not bring only Fragments, Phrases, or single Words out of the Records or Histories which seem to countenance my Opinion▪ contrary to the true meaning of those Records, and the sense of the Histo∣rians, as some of your men do, but shall give you the Quotations out of those Authors whole, and entire; and shall make such reasonable Deductions from them, as I think you will have no reason to deny to be fairly raised from the Words themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="223"/>And also, as <HI>Matt. Paris</HI> relates, in the 29th <HI>Hen.</HI> III. the Earls, and Barons sent Letters to the Pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 658.</NOTE> then at the Council of <HI>Li∣ons,</HI> to complain of the Pope's Exactions; which Letters are said by this Author to be directed <HI>A Magnatibus, &amp; Universitate Regni Angliae.</HI> And tho it is also true, that in the same Year there were other Letters sent thither, from the same Parties, to the Cardinals there assembled, which are recited by the Old Manuscript to have sent Messengers to the Cardinals; and the Old Manuscript in the <HI>Cottonian</HI> Library; that they sent to the Cardinals, assembled at the Council of <HI>Lyons</HI>▪ Let<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers <HI>a Baronibus, Militibus &amp; universis Baronagii Regni Angliae per procuratores <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rogeram Bigod Comitem Norff.

Paris</HI> calls <HI>Viri Nobiles, &amp; discre∣ti</HI>; But this will make no difference, as I shall shew you by and by; And to these <HI>Matt.</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI> adds Mr. <HI>William Powic Clark,</HI> who seems to have been their Secretary.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding it will appear that all these Persons so sent, named <HI>Barones &amp; Milites▪ &amp; universitas Baronagii,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. Pag.</HI> 103.104.</NOTE> did not represent the Commons of <HI>England</HI> at all, but only the Great Earls, Barons, and Tenants <HI>in Capite.</HI> For first it appears from Sir <HI>W.

<P>Nor was this Earl, and the four Barons here mentioned, chosen or sent by the Baronage of the Kingdom assembled in Parliament to represent them at the Council of <HI>Lyons,</HI> but were only pitch'd upon by a Body of Military men, or Barons, at a Tornament intended to have been held at <HI>Dunstable</HI>; which was forbidden by the King, and these took upon them to warn Mr. <HI>Martin,</HI> the Pope's Clerk, out of the Kingdom; as appears by the Account <HI>Matt.

<P>And after this, in the 30th of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. when the <HI>Pope</HI> did not give satisfaction to their Grievances, the King called (as this Author tells us) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parliamentum generalissimum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt.

<P>The result of all these Conferences was, that yet for the Reverence due to the Apostolick See, they should again supplicate the Pope by Letters, to remove their intolerable Grievances, and insupportable Yoak. And this they do in separate Conferences. The Bishops write by themselves; the Abbots and Priors by them∣selves; and the Earls, Barons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by themselves, to the Pope; and if there had been any Commons, as at this day, they most certainly would likewise have wrote to the Pope, as well as the other Constituent Parts of this Parliament did.</P>

<P>I hope I shall be able to answer what you have now said: In the first place, tho I should grant that these Commissioners sent by the Baronage of <HI>England,</HI> were all of them Barons, and no Commoners among them; doth it therefore follow that the persons that sent them, must have been all Lords too? For if those Commissioners were all Peers, who represented your <HI>Barones minores,</HI> or Te∣nants <HI>in capite,</HI> (who, as you your self have granted, were no Lords at all) and why might not those Lords as well represent all the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> as they did these Lesser <HI>Tenants in capite</HI>? So that it seems plain to me, that these Words, <HI>Universitas Baronagii Angliae,</HI> must needs then comprehend somewhat more than your <HI>Barons,</HI> and <HI>Tenents in capite</HI> only; since the Words <HI>Barones &amp; Milites</HI> alone and sufficiently expressed all the Constituent Members of your Parliament, with∣out adding <HI>&amp; Universitas Baronagii,</HI> which would have been a Tautology, but that it was very usual for the great Lords in those days, to write Letters in their own Names, as also for all the Commons of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I shall shew you by and by, when I shall make use of two other Instances of a like nature, in the Reigns of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. and <HI>Edw.</HI> III. And therefore it is no good Argument to prove, that the Commons had no hand in this Message, or Letters, because they did not write by themselves; much less is it so, because it is not expresly mentioned by <HI>Matt. Paris,</HI> that the King consulted the Commons as well as the Bishops, Earls and Barons; that therefore they were not there. Since this Author writing very concisely, comprehends all the Lay Estates, un∣der the Words <HI>Comites, &amp; Barones,</HI> or else <HI>Magnates</HI> alone. So likewise <HI>Matt,</HI> of <HI>Westminster,</HI> when he mentions divers Parliaments in the Reign of <HI>Edw.</HI> I and <HI>Edw.</HI> II, expresses them under the same Title. And tho' this Author often mentions the Earls and Barons to have done this, or that; yet it is no Argument to conclude, that the Commons were not then there. And for this, pray take these Examples our of <HI>Matt. VVestminster,</HI> when <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1300. the 28th of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. he tells us, the King held his Parliament at <HI>Lincoln,</HI> where the <HI>Comites &amp; Barones</HI> demanded a Confirmation of the Great Charters, and they further askt; that the Deforestations made by the King should be con∣firmed; and then he tells us, that <HI>thereupon the Charters of Liberties and Forests, were again renewed; and being past under the Great Seal, were proclaimed be∣fore all the People, in every Country</HI>; Where you see that the Complains were made by the Earls and Barons; yet it is certain, that the Confirmation of these Char∣ters, must have proceeded from all the Estates; for the Bishops; and Abbots, and Priors, are there no more mentioned than the Commons, who were then as <HI>Barones, Majores,</HI> Constituent Members of this Parliament. So also <HI>Henry De Knighton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 2928.</NOTE> <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1301. the 30th. <HI>Edw.</HI> I. tells us
<PB N="410" REF="224"/>
of a Parliament this King held at <HI>Stamford,</HI> where met the Earls and Barons, <HI>and with great courage persisted until they had got the Charter of Forests fully granted and confirmed to them.</HI> Where note, that tho by way of excellency, the Earls and Barons (who then bore the greatest sway, are here only mentioned) yet it is certain, that the Commons were also summoned to this Parliament▪ Now if these Later Historians pass by the Commons, tho then Constituent Members of Parlia∣ment, without any one express Mention, why might not <HI>Matt. Paris</HI> do so too?</P>
<P>But that he did do so, appears very plainly from the Letters of the Parliament held in 30th <HI>Hen.</HI> II. to the <HI>Pope</HI> and Cardinals, being still at the council of <HI>Ly∣ons,</HI> to remove the intolerable Grievances above mentioned, That to the <HI>Pope</HI> is tecited at large by <HI>Matt.

And therefore nothing seems plainer to me, than that by these Words, <HI>Clerus &amp; Populus Universus,</HI> must be meant the inferior Clergy, and Commons, appearing by their Representatives in this Parliament, and that so became <HI>Generalissimum Parliamentum,</HI> as this Historian calls it.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray give me leave now to reply.</P>
<P>In the first place I must tell you, that the Instances you have brought out of <HI>Matt. VVestm.</HI> to prove that under the Words <HI>Comites</HI> and <HI>Barones, &amp; Baronagi∣um Angliae,</HI> were comprehended the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> and that after the time I allow them to have been there, will not do your Business.</P>
<P>And as to the Instance about the Pope's Nuncio, it seems to have been an Order of the Lords only; the Words being in <HI>Latin, de Assensu Comitum &amp; Baronum.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Third Instance, out of <HI>Knighton,</HI> He said indeed, that the <HI>Comites &amp; Barones</HI> met at the Parliament at <HI>Stamford</HI>; and that might very well be, since they alone then insisted upon the confirmation of the Charter of Forests.</P>
<P>But as for the Argument you draw from the Direction of this Letter to the Pope; The Learned Dr. in his Treatise against Mr. <HI>P.</HI> hath given us a very good Answer to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 106.</NOTE> to this effect; That tho it is true, that after the <HI>Barones, &amp; Proceres,</HI> there are divers other parties mentioned, yet was this Troop of Words put together in this Letter to no other
<PB N="411" REF="224"/>
purpose, than to make an Impression upon the Pope, and make him sensible what a general dislike the Nation had of his Exactions and Incroachments; and to induce him to a compliance with their Desires, the Multitude or Com∣mons not being any-ways parties, or privy to the writing of the Letters; For the clamour of the people was a great Argument used in all these Letters, to affect the <HI>Pope,</HI> how ungrateful his Impositions were to the Nation. But in this of the Temporal Barons more especially, who address themselves to the <HI>Pope</HI> by Petiti∣on, inforcing it by the clamour of the People, against those Injuries and Oppressi∣ons upon the whole Kingdom; It is to no purpose to repeat all that follows, only observe this Clause, <HI>Alioquin necesse est ut veniant Scandala Clamore popu∣li, tam Dominum Regem, quam nos intolerabiliter impellente</HI>; and the King likewise in his Letter to the Pope and Cardinals aggravates the matter, by the like Argu∣ments; as appears by this Clause, in his Letter to them; <HI>verum Clamorem incom∣perabilem Magnatum Angliae tam Cleri quam Populi non possumus obaudire.</HI> From this general Clamour of the People, and not from their being parties, it was that the beginning of the Letters from the Baronage, or the University of <HI>England,</HI> was stuffed with so many Words and Phrases, to awaken his Holiness, and in∣vite him to redress their Grievances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>In return to what you have said, I must tell you, that I am not convinc'd, that in the Parliament mentioned by <HI>Mat. VVestm.</HI> that the Demand for the Con∣firmation of the Charters was made by the Lords only; Since it is not likely that the Commons (who are there stiled <HI>Divites Plebis,</HI> and are said to have been grieved by their Infringement) should not have been parties to the Com∣plaint for their Redress; especially since we find that in all succeeding Parlia∣ments, the Commons are mentioned as most eager for the confirmation of these Charters.</P>
<P>But as for the most material part of your Answer to my Authority from the Parliament's Letter to the <HI>Pope,</HI> I know the Dr. endeavours all he can, to avoid the force of this Objection, by making the Parliament top upon His Holiness meer empty Words, instead of Matter; that is, according to the Dr.'s own Phrase, <HI>they only laid an airy Ambuscade to intrap him.</HI> But whether the Old Gen∣tleman was thus like to be catch'd, I give you leave to judge. For certainly both he and his Consistory of Cardinals, knew as well as the Parliament it self, what were the Constituent parts thereof, and they could quickly have answered them; that they put a meer sham upon his Holiness, in mentioning the Noble Inhabi∣tants of the Sea Ports, and all the rest of the people, both Clergy and Laity in their Letters; whereas they had nothing at all to do with the matter, nor had shown any dislike of his Holiness's Proceedings. For if they had no Representa∣tives in Parliament, how could it be known whether they were aggrieved or not? Or is it likely that the <HI>Pope</HI> had no Nuncio, or Friends among the Clergy, to give him an account of the Cheat they there put upon him? And they might as well have talked of the Clamours of the Tinners in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> as of those of the Inha∣bitants of the Sea Ports, if it was only put in to augment the Clamour, or to fill up the Number of the Complainants; if the people (I mean both Nobility and Commons) had not been parties of these Letters? But you your self have but now recited a Clause in the King's Letter to the <HI>Pope</HI> and Cardinals, which makes it plain it was so; when he tells them, that he could not stop his ears against the Clamour of the <HI>Magnates, tam Cler<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, quam Populi, i. e.</HI> as well of the Clergy, as
<PB N="412" REF="225"/>
of the Laity, as the Dr. renders it. So that these Words, <HI>Clamorem Magnatum,</HI> must signifie here the clamour of the whole people in Parliament; or else they signifie nothing at all.</P>
<P>And I may as well say that the <HI>Clerus</HI> and <HI>Populus</HI> never appeared in Parliament at all, but that these were also meer empty Words to frighten the <HI>Pope.</HI> But what say you to the next Precedent Mr. <HI>P.</HI> produces to prove that the Lords and Commons together have writ Letters to the <HI>Pope,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. R. C. Pag.</HI> 115.</NOTE> when he attempted to invade the Right of the Crown or King∣dom, <HI>viz.</HI> The Letter from the Parliament at <HI>Lincoln</HI> to the <HI>Pope,</HI> in the 29th of King <HI>Edw.</HI> I.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matt. Westm. Ann. Dom.</HI> 1301.</NOTE> wherein they assert the King's Superiori∣ty over the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and desire that his Holiness would desist from medling farther with it. VVhich Letter, tho subscribed by above a hundred Earls and Barons, as it was the custom of that Age, yet it is said expresly in the conclusion, <HI>In cujus rei Testimonium Sigilla tam pro nobis, quam pro tota Communitate praedicti Regni Angliae praesentibus su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pensa.</HI></P>

<P>Tho this Authority is after the time we acknowledge the Commons to have been summoned to Parliament, and therefore I need not speak particularly to it; Yet tho I grant your Argument hath some weight in it, since it here seems that the Lords did sign this Letter, for the Commons as well as them∣selves, I shall endeavours to answer it. I confess it appears very specious at first sight; but what if I shew you, that this Letter was written by the Lords only from <HI>Lincoln,</HI> after the Commons had been dismissed from thence by pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogati∣on or Adjournment. For tho it is commonly story'd, but erro∣neously) that this whole Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. Pag,</HI> 153.</NOTE> or at least the Temporal Lords and the Commons wrote to the <HI>Pope</HI> concerning the Juris∣diction and Superiority of the Kings of <HI>England</HI> over the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI>: Yet it cannot be so, for this Parliament met on the <HI>Octaves</HI> of <HI>Hilla∣ry,</HI> or the 20th of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> and sate but eight days; the Writs for the Commons Expences bear date <HI>Ianuary</HI> the 30th of the same Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">vi. <HI>Pryn</HI>'s 4th part of the Regist. of Parliament Writs.</NOTE> and the Letter to the <HI>Pope</HI> signed by the Temporal Lords for themselves, and the whole Community of the Kingdom of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> is dated <HI>Feb.</HI> 12<HI>th</HI> next following at <HI>Lincoln,</HI> after the Com∣mons had been discharged 14 Days. So that you see the Barons still continued to stile themselves the Community of <HI>England</HI>; and both Spiritual and Temporal Barons, and other of the King's Council, did stay and dispatch much Business, after all others were dismissed, according to the Te∣nor of the there recited Proclamation, and may be fully proved from the Pro∣ceedings of that Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liament, as they are to be found in <HI>Ryley's Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cita Parliamentaria.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 241, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> So that nothing seems plainer to me, than that the whole <HI>Community</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> for whom the Barons there named set their Seals to that Letter you mentioned, were the <HI>Community</HI> of the Barons only.</P>

<P>I confess Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> in his Animadversions upon my Lord <HI>Coke</HI>'s 4th Insti∣tutes was the first who started this Objection, That the Commons could not be present as parties to this Letter;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 9:</NOTE> Yet he still suppo∣ses that the Lords who stayed behind, and made a kind of a Great
<PB N="413" REF="225"/>
Council at <HI>Lincoln,</HI> signed it not only for themselves, but for the Commons al∣so, tho not actually there; and is not so extravagant as your Dr. to suppose, that by the Words in this Letter, <HI>Tam pro Nobis, quam pro tota Communitate,</HI> &amp;c. are to be understood the Community of Barons only; for that would have been a Tau∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ology indeed: For so the last Word <HI>Communitas,</HI> &amp;c. would have signified no more than that they subscribed for themselves, and themselves, and that the Word <HI>Cumma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tas Regni,</HI> (which I can prove to you by many Examples, did then signifie the Commons of <HI>England</HI>) must here mean more than your Community of the Earls and Barons. For pray take notice, that the Tenants <HI>in capite</HI> had now by your own concession left off to appear in Parliament in a Body, as being now repre∣sented by the Knights of Shires, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> very well observes in his Fourth Institute, that this Letter was sealed by above 104 Earls and Barons, by the assent of the whole Commonalty in Parliament; and Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> is so far convinced of this in his exact History of Papal Usurpations, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tiles this Letter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 893.</NOTE> <HI>The Memorable Epistle of the Earls, Barons, Great Men, and Commons of</HI> England, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But to shew you farther that there was no change, neither of the constituent parts of our Ancient Parliaments, nor of the Terms by which they are expres∣sed our Ancient Records, appears by a Plea among Mr. <HI>Ryley</HI>'s printed Pleas of Parliament, in 35th of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. where it is recited,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 376.</NOTE> that in a Parliament at <HI>Carlisle, Will. de Testa,</HI> the Pope's Clerk, was impeach'd, <HI>per Comites, Barones, &amp; alios Magnates, &amp; Communitatem totius Regni</HI>; concerning divers new and intolerable Grievances laid upon them by the Pope; Where you see there is no change of this Word <HI>Communitas,</HI> after the Commons were (as you suppose) certainly present in this Parliament; and why the same Word should not signifie the same thing in the beginning of this King's Reign as well as now, you had need give me very good Authority to prove the contrary against such clear evidence as this; But this Record goes on, and farther recites, that these Letters were sent to the Pope, <HI>Ex parte Communitatis praedictae,</HI> and in which, <HI>Clerus &amp; Populus dicti Regni</HI> set forth the said grievances to the full. Now as the Word <HI>Clerus</HI> here expresses all sorts of degrees of Clergy, as well Superior as Inferior, represented in <HI>Parliament</HI> and <HI>Convocation,</HI> so much <HI>Populus</HI> here sig∣nifie the Laity of both Orders, as well the Commons as Lords, since the Com∣mons were certainly present at this Parliament; and why the Word <HI>Populus</HI> should not signifie the same thing long before, I can see no Reason for it, but the Dr.'s bear Assertion.</P>
<P>And as for what you say, that the Commons could be no parties to this Let∣ter, because it appears by the Writs of Expences, that they were discharged before this Letter was written; admitting it were so, it makes nothing against my As∣sertion; For why could not the Commons agree upon the Substance of the Let∣ter, and leave the Lords to draw it up, and subscribe it for them, after they were gone home? And that it was so, appears by the Letter if self, which re∣cites, <HI>That the King had caused the Pope's Letter, In medio,</HI> or <HI>pleno Parliamento exhi∣beri, ac scriose nobis fecit exponi unde habito tractatu, &amp; deliberation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Diligenti super c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tentis in literis vestris memoratis, communis concors, &amp; unanimus omnium, &amp; singu∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m consensus suit,</HI> &amp;c. Now every one knows, that understands any thing of Par∣liamentary Affairs, that when any thing is said in an Act of Parliament, or other Record, to have been agreed upon in full Parliament, that is always understood to
<PB N="414" REF="226"/>
have been done, all the Estates being there present; Nor can I see any rea∣son why this Letter should not be called the Letter of the Commons, as well as of the Lords, since the very Statutes of that Age were often said to have been as∣sented to by the Commons, tho it is clear they, were not drawn up into form till after the Parliament was dismissed.</P>
<P>But that the Commons were certainly parties to this Letter, appears by a Record of the beginning of <HI>Edw.</HI> III. time, printed by Mr. <HI>Pryn,</HI> keeper of the Records of the <HI>Tower,</HI> (and which he tells us he found among the Rolls in the <HI>White-Town</HI>) which Record contains the Heads of a Defence compiled by the King's Council, in order to a stronger Defence against the <HI>Pope</HI>'s taking cognizance in the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> concerning the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Superiority over <HI>Scotland</HI>; in the conclusion of the 2d. of which Records,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pryn<HI>'s Exact History.

<P>I must freely tell you, I am not yet satisfied with the Sense you now put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon these Words, <HI>Universitas,</HI> and <HI>Communitas Regni,</HI> before the Commons were summoned to Parliament; for you your self must grant, that as the word <HI>Universitas Regni</HI> takes in the whole Representative Body of the Kingdom, so likewise the word <HI>Communitas</HI> signifies no more than the same whole Body or Community thereof. Therefore if I prove to you, that in those times this Univer∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y or Community consisted only of the <HI>Earls, Barons</HI> and <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI> that word <HI>Communitas Regni</HI> ought never to be interpreted by the <HI>English</HI> word <HI>Commo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lty</HI> or <HI>Commons</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> till after the time that I allow the Commons were admitted to make a constituent part of the Great Council or Parliament, nor al∣ways then neither; And Mr. <HI>P.</HI> in his Book which we have so often cited, hath done very unfairly to make the <HI>Universitas</HI> and <HI>Communitas Regni</HI> to comprehend the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> before they everappeared in Parliament at all; and so hath he likewise abused the Word <HI>Populus,</HI> as I have already observed, to signifie the Commons, when indeed there is no more thereby meant, than the whole As∣sembly of the Laity, which at that time consisted of no more than the Earls, Barons or other <HI>Tenants in Capite</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very well aware that the Word <HI>Populus</HI> often signifies the whole Bo∣dy of the Laity, yet not excluding the Commons, as I have already sufficiently proved; For then the word must signifie quite contrary to its genuine Significati∣on; instead of People, the Greater Nobility only; yet that when it is put after▪ as distinct from <HI>Magnates,</HI> it must mean the Commons, as now understood, I shall shew you by and by.</P>
<P>But that this word <HI>Populus</HI> does not always signifie the whole Body of the Nobility only,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 55.</NOTE> but takes in oftentimes the Commons too; pray see <HI>Matt. VVest.</HI> who tells us King <HI>Edw.</HI> I. in the 34th year of his Reign, making his Son a Knight, <HI>Pro hac melitia silii Regis concessus est Regi zomus Denarius a Populo &amp; Clero, Mercatores vero vices<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mum concesserunt</HI>; Up∣on which your Dr. in his Glossary very well remarks, that it is evident upon Record, who were the <HI>Populus</HI> meant by the Historian, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Comites, Barones &amp; alii Magnates, nec non Milites Comitatuum.</HI> So that unless the Knights of Shires were Lords, it is plain <HI>Populus</HI> takes in the Common<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too.

<P>And this is a Rational as well as Grammatical Interpretation; For as the Word <HI>Universitas</HI> is derived from the Adjective <HI>Universus,</HI> which signifies the <HI>VVhole, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Universal;</HI> So the Word <HI>Communitas</HI> is derived from the Adjective <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Common</HI> or <HI>General.</HI> So that these two Words when used simply in a Political <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Legal Sense, ought to take in the whole Body of the Kingdom, or all sorts and conditions of Freemen appearing themselves, or their Lawful Proxies or Re∣presentatives in Parliament.</P>
<P>But I have already sufficiently proved, that under those General words used in our Historians and Records, <HI>viz. Principes, Proceres, Nobiles, Magnates, Barones, &amp; alii de Regno,</HI> were then comprehended either all the considerable Freeholders, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lords of Manners, or else the Knights of Shires, Citizens and Burgesses: So that if the Sense of these Words have been sufficiently explained, I think no reasona∣ble man can have any cause to doubt whether these Abstract Words <HI>Nobilitas, U∣niversitas,</HI> and <HI>Communitas,</HI> should be taken for all Sorts and Degrees of men, when thus represented in the Great Council; or whether they shall be confined to the Greater or Lesser Nobility only, <HI>viz.</HI> the Great Lords, Bishops and <HI>Tenants in ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite</HI> as you would make me believe which requires stronger Proofs than what you have yet brought.</P>
<P>Besides which Sense of this Word <HI>Communitas,</HI> or <HI>le Commune,</HI> it is also more commonly used at this day, and often then too, in another more restrained and yet legal sense; and that is when it is used for the <HI>Commonalty</HI> or <HI>Commons</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> distinct from the Peers; and this may very easily be distinguished, by obser∣ving, that when it is taken in this Sense, it is always set after the particular enu∣meration of the other Orders of the Lords or Peers, <HI>viz.</HI> the Arch-Bishops, Bi∣shops, Abbots, Priors, Earls and Barons, or when it is put contradistinct to the Word <HI>Magnates.</HI> I shall give you some Authorities and Examples from Historians and Records of both these,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.

<P>I pray give me leave to answer your Authorities as you bring them, lest I not onely forget some of them, but also tire both you and my self with too long a Discourse.

<P>And from thence I collect, that besides the <HI>Barones Majores</HI> that came to this Great Council or Parliament, there were also the <HI>Tenants in Capite,</HI> according to the Directions and Law for Summons in King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter, who were com∣prehended under the Words <HI>tota Nobilitas, &amp; Milites</HI>; and that other Tenants but held of the <HI>Tenants in capite</HI> by Knights Service, were bound by their Acts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they all knew how many Knights Fees they held of the King <HI>in capite</HI>; and if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey had given any away to others, they held of them as they did of the Crown, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d answered a proportionable rate towards this Tax, for the Fees, Quantities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parts of Fees they held of them; about which there could be no mistake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Scutage was ascertain'd. So that in so Great an Assembly, where all the Nobility of <HI>England</HI> were called together by the King's Writ, and upon so great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> occasion and solemnity, as confirming the Great Charter of Liberties, after such an extraordinary a manner, it cannot be doubted, but besides the Barons, all the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in capite,</HI> both Great and Small, which were then very numerous, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resent, or at least, most of them; from whence it is not difficult to tell you to the <HI>Communitas</HI> were; after the <HI>Prelates, Barons</HI> and <HI>Magna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> they were no

<P>I hope I shall be well enough able to prove, that what you have now alledged is pure imagination, or in the Dr. Phrase, an airy Ambuscade, and quite contrary to the Sense of <HI>Matt. Paris,</HI> as also of the Lawyers and Historians of those Times. For in the first place, nothing is plainer, than that this Author by the Words <HI>Communitas Populi,</HI> must understand an Order of Men distinct from the <HI>Magnates</HI>; or else if the Word <HI>Magnates</HI> might have comprehended them all, it would have been to no purpose to have mentioned any more.</P>
<P>But to answer those Authorities you bring from <HI>Mat. Paris</HI>; As for the Word <HI>Nobilitas,</HI> since you still insist upon it, I have already proved that the whole Parlia∣ment, as well the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, as Commons, were both before and after this time comprehended under these words, <HI>Nobilitas Angliae</HI>; and if you yet doubt of it, I can give you a plain Authority out of <HI>VValsingham,</HI> for it is in his Life of <HI>Edw.</HI> II. <HI>Anno</HI> 1327. where relating the manner of that King's De∣position, he tells us, That when the Queen and Prince came to <HI>London,</HI> there then met <HI>Tota Regni Nobilitas,</HI> to depose the King, and chuse his Son in his stead; and then there was sent to the King, being Prisoner in <HI>Kenelworth</HI> Castle, on be∣half of the whole Kingdom, two <HI>Bishops,</HI> two <HI>Earls,</HI> two <HI>Abbots,</HI> and of every County three <HI>Knights</HI>; and also from <HI>London</HI> and other Cities and Great Towns (especially the Cinque Ports) a certain number of persons who informed him of the Election of his Son, and that he should renounce the Crown and Royal Digni∣ty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Proof is so plain, it needs no Comment.</P>
<P>As for the rest of your Argument, the strength of it chiefly consists in this, that the Tax there mentioned is said to be granted <HI>à Militibus,</HI> or <HI>Tenants in capite</HI> (as you would have it) of three Marks upon every Knight's Fee. But in the first place I desire you to take notice, that this Scutage is not Scutage Service, but a general Land Tax, or Manner of taxing according to Knights Fees, and which was continued long after <HI>Hen.</HI> III. Reign, as it appears by this Passage in Sir <HI>Henry Spelman</HI>'s Glossary, <HI>Tit. Scutagium; Edwardus primus habuit</HI> 40 <HI>Soli de quolibet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Anno Regni</HI> 13 <HI>Dom.</HI> 1285. <HI>pro expeditione contra VVallos.</HI> And it was also granted by the Lords and Commons after the 18th of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. when you and the Dr. sup∣poses the Commons to have then came to Parliament; and if so, I desire to know why a <HI>Militibus</HI> here mentioned by this Author, must only signifie <HI>Tenants in capi∣te</HI> by Knights Service, and not the Knights of Shires, since it is not here said a <HI>Militibus qui de Rege tenuerunt in capite</HI>; And therefore it is a forced Interpretation of the Dr.'s, and without any Authority, to limit these words <HI>Militibus, &amp; libere Te∣nentibus, &amp; omnibus de Regno nostro</HI> (which you omit with an, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) as also the <HI>omnibus Hominibus Liberis Regni nostri,</HI> only to the <HI>Arch-Bishops, Bishops</HI> and other Prelates of <HI>England,</HI> and to the Earls, Barons, Knights and Free Tenants, or Te∣nants in Military or Knight's Service; because they were only such as paid Scu∣tage; VVhereas you have already acknowledged that <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was granted to all the people of <HI>England,</HI> who had all a benefit by it, and who paid towards the aid there granted, as well as the <HI>Tenants in capite.</HI></P>
<P>But if Knights Fees alone were Taxed, and that by the Tenants <HI>in capite only</HI>▪ I desire to know by what Right all Tenants in Petit Serjeanty, and by Burgoge o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>occage Tenure (who made a greater Body of men in this Kingdom in
<PB N="419" REF="228"/>
those Times) could pay this Scutage, since they held not by Knights Service, but by certain Rents or other Services, and so not appearing in Person, could have no Representatives in this or any other Parliament of those Times. But if you will tell me they might pay according to the value that Knights Fees were then reckoned at, <HI>viz.</HI> for every 20 <HI>l.</HI> a years Estate, I desire to know how this could be called Scutage, or how the Tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> or other Lords from whom they held those Lands, could give away their Money for them? And in the next place I desire also to know how all the Cities and Burroughs in <HI>England</HI> could be char∣ged with this Tax; a great many of them (is you your self grant) holding of the King <HI>in capite,</HI> or else of Bishops, Abbots or other Mes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Lords by Soccage or Bargage Tenure So that this Tax, if granted only by the <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI> by Knights Service, could reach them, and no other persons; but if by this Word <HI>a Militibus</HI> may be understood Knights of Shires, then the Tax was general, as well upon Soccage Tenants, as those by Knights Service.</P>
<P>But for the other Words you insist upon, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Liberi Tenentes,</HI> which you translate <HI>Tenants</HI> by <HI>Military Service</HI>; if that had been the meaning of these words, then they had been altogether in vain, since you have already told me, that the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lites</HI> were so called <HI>non a Militari Cingulo, sed a Feodo</HI>; and if it were no Name of Dignity, then certainly the Word <HI>Milites</HI> would have served to comprehend all your <HI>Liberi Tenentes,</HI> or <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI> without any other addition. But that these Words <HI>Laberi Tenentes,</HI> do not here signifie <HI>Tenants</HI> by Military Service, pray see Sir <HI>Henry Spelman</HI>'s <HI>Glossary, Tit. Liber Homo, &amp; liber Tenens</HI>; where he there gives us a more general Signification of thesewords thus: <HI>Ad Nobilesolim spectabant isti <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, à majoribus ortos omnino Liberis</HI>; and then ends thus, <HI>vide Ingenuus, Legalis, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Francus, Tenens Liberè, alias Liber Tenent quo etiam sensu occurrit interdum Homo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>; which upon every one of these Titles he makes to signifie all one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the same thing, <HI>viz.</HI> an ordinary Freeholder. And therefore it is a very forced Interpretation of yours, to limit these Words <HI>Communitas Po∣puli,</HI> only to the Community or Body of the Earls, Barons, and <HI>Tenants in capite.</HI></P>
<P>Tho I confess you are very kind in one main Point, in únderstanding the <HI>Communitas Populi</HI> to mean the Community of the Lesser <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI> that were no Barons; and then do what you can, these Words must here signifie Meer Commoners, or Commons, unless you can shew us a Third Sort of Men, who, tho neither Lords nor Commons, yet had a place in Parliament. So that these Gentlemen, notwithstanding their Tenure, were no more Noble than their Feudatory Tenants, or Vavafors themselves; my, than the Knights of Shires are at this day: And then granting (as I doubt not but I shall be able to prove) that the Cities and Boroughs had then also their Representatives there; I pray tell me whether or no there were not Commons in Parliament before 49 <HI>Hen.</HI> III. or not? which is contrary to your Dr.'s Assertion in divers places of his Answer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Mr. <HI>P.</HI></P>
<P>And that the Word <HI>Populus</HI> must here signifie the Commons, and not the whole Body of the Laity, appears plainly by this place you have quoted; since it is restrained by your self, to mean not the whole Community of the Kingdom, but only the Community of Lesser Tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> who were not Lords. But that <HI>Matt. Paris</HI> doth also in another place take the Word <HI>Populus</HI> for the Com∣moners, and not for the whole Body of the Laity, pray again remember what
<PB N="420" REF="229"/>
he says in <HI>Anno</HI> 1225. where relating the manner how <HI>Magna Charta</HI> came to be confirmed in 9th <HI>Hen.</HI> III. he tells us <HI>Rex Henricus ad Natale tenuit Curiam suam a∣pud VVestm. Praesentibus Clero, &amp; Populo, cum Magnatibus Regionis</HI>; which pray let us put into <HI>English,</HI> and see if it will not prove what I say, <HI>viz.</HI> the Clergy and Peo∣ple being present with the Great Men of the Kingdom. Now if the Word <HI>Mag∣nates</HI> (as you affirm) did then comprehend all the Barons and <HI>Tenants in capite</HI>▪ to what purpose is the Word People put here as a distinct Member of this Parlia∣ment? But to shew you father that this Word <HI>Populus</HI> is not always to be un∣derstood for the whole Body of the Laicks, but Lords and Knights of Shires, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall shew you out of <HI>Walsingham, Anno</HI> 1297. 24th <HI>Edw.</HI> I. where he mentions a Parliament held at St. <HI>Edmundsbury, In quo a Civitatibus, &amp; Burgis concessa est Reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Octava, a Populo vero reliquo duodecima pars Bonorum</HI>: Where by <HI>Populus</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not only meant the Peers, but Knights of Shires, or <HI>Grands des <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> also.</P>

<P>I am not prepared at present to answer all the Queries and Difficulties that you can make or raise against the Dr.'s Arguments; yet I think I am able to give you a very satisfactory answer why all Tenants in Soccage should be boun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the Acts of those of whom they held their Estates. For since (as I have a ready proved) all the Land in <HI>England</HI> (except what belong to Religious Hou∣ses) was granted out by King <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> to be held <HI>in capite</HI> by Knights Service, and was again granted out by these Head-Tenants, to their Feudatory o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mesne Tenants by the like Services, there being very few Lands granted in Free Soccage at the first; And tho it is true that in process of time, ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of those Estates and Lands became Free Tenements,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<P>I think the Dr. hath given us full satisfaction as to this Re∣cord,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.</HI></NOTE>
in his Answer to Mr. <HI>P.</HI> the substance of which I shall here give you in short.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is certain, that at the making of this forced Peace <HI>Simon Mountford</HI> and his Faction then held the King and Prince, as also <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> the King's Brother, as good as Prisoners, and made them do what he pleased; and he carried the King and Prince along with him, until he had taken in all the strong places of the Kingdom; and when he had done, then he called this Parliament, which could not be one, in the sense it is now taken, since there was none there but the Earls, Barons, and Heads of the Rebels, which had the King and Prince in their power, and (as you your self set forth) were the same persons that sealed it for themselves and the other Barons, and the whole <HI>Commu∣nity</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> which Community must be the Community of the Barons and Great Men, or <HI>Tenants in capite</HI> by Military Service, and no other; for how can the Lords and Barons sign any thing for the Commons, as at this day understood? They did not then nor now do represent them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. Pag.</HI> 81. <HI>Fol.</HI> 217.</NOTE>But I shall give you another Authority to make this clearer, of some years before, related in <HI>Matt. Paris,</HI> viz. <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 12<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ 42<HI>d Hen.</HI> III. where Letters are said to be sent, <HI>a Communitate An∣gliae,</HI> to the <HI>Pope</HI> concerning <HI>Aymer de Valence,</HI> Bishop Elect of <HI>Wa∣chester,</HI> the Direction is thus, <HI>Sanctissimo in Christo Patri, &amp;c. Communitas Comitum Procerum, Magnatum, Aliorumque Regni Angliae cum subjectione debita, Pedum Osr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> &amp;c. And to put the Matter beyond all doubt, it is certain that these Letters were sealed by six Earls, and five Barons onely; <HI>vice totius Communitatis.</HI> I need <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> give you their Names, since you may find them in the Author himself, as also cited by the Dr. And as for <HI>H. Bigod,</HI> the Chief Justice, and the four Persons na∣med after him, they are proved by Sir <HI>VVilliam Dugdale</HI> in his Baronage of <HI>England,</HI> to have been the Greatest Barons in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Now pray let me ask you this Question; Did these Eleven Persons, all Great Earls and Barons, represent the whole <HI>Commons</HI> or <HI>Community</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> as at this day understood, or did they represent the <HI>Community</HI> of the <HI>Barons</HI> only, together with the <HI>Alios,</HI> the <HI>Milites,</HI> which held by <HI>Military Service</HI> of the Great <HI>Barons,</HI> and the Less Tenants <HI>in capite</HI>; for the whole <HI>Community</HI> here intended, must be one of them; take which you please, you'l lose the Cause; For certainly these Great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>Barons</HI> that sealed this <HI>Letter, vice totius Communitatis,</HI> were not chosen nor sent by the <HI>Commons</HI> to this <HI>Parliament</HI> or <HI>Meeting,</HI> nor were the <HI>Commons</HI> represen∣ted as at this Day by them, as you your self have already granted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I shall not need to make any long Reply to this Answer of you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ or rather of your Dr.'s since it is built upon the same false Supposition with the other, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Words <HI>Cum Communitate tot â Regni Angliae,</HI> must always mean only the <HI>Community</HI> of the <HI>Tenants in capite</HI>; which Supposition, if it be false in your former Argument, is also as falfe in this of the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> too; and therefore it is impertinent to repeat my Answer to it.</P>
<P>But if this were no true <HI>Parliament,</HI> because <HI>Simon Mountford</HI> had then the King and Prince in his power; This would likewise serve to unparliament that of the 49<HI>th</HI> of this King; from whence the Gentlemen of your Opinion date the first coming of the <HI>Commons</HI> to <HI>Parliament</HI>; since the King and Prince were as much
<PB N="423" REF="230"/>
in <HI>Simon Mountford</HI>'s power then, as now; and yet no man as I know of, ever questioned the validity of it, tho I cannot also omit, that you pass by in this <HI>Letter,</HI> the words <HI>Magnatum aliorumque Regni</HI>; under which Words, (as I have already proved) might very well be comprehended all the Knights of Shires as well as Citizens and Burgesses, unless the words had run thus (as they should have done to have made out your Assertion) <HI>aliorumque qui de Rege Tenent in capite.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to the main point you insist upon, which is, How these Great <HI>Earl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Barons</HI> could seal this Form of the Peace, and these <HI>Letters</HI> to the Pope, in the Name of all the <HI>Commons</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Before I answer to that, I pray give me leave to ask you one Question; You have already allowed that the ordinary <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI> (of which that numerous Body chiefly consisted) tho called by courtesy <HI>Barones Minores,</HI> were really no <HI>Ba∣rons,</HI> nor Peers of the Realm, and if so, were but Commoners. Now pray tell me how these Great Earls and Barons you mentioned to have signed this Peace, and this Letter to the Pope, could put their Seals for those who were no Barons themselves, by your own confession, and you cannot say they represented them, for they were as good <HI>Tenants in capite</HI> as the Greatest Lords? But if you say, they did it by their order and consent, pray why might not these Great Lords or Barons as well do the like for the Knights of Shires and Burgesses, by their ap∣pointment? Since I have already proved, that the Lords did act thus in the Let∣ters which were sent to the Pope concerning the Business of <HI>Scotland.</HI> And be∣sides I must here observe, that the Dr. and you do not deal fairly with your Ad∣versaries, in citing this Authority of the <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Barons</HI> signing these Letters to the Pope, <HI>Vice t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tius Communitat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Angliae</HI>; since I acknowledge in this place the Word <HI>Communitas</HI> being put alone, doth mean no more than the Community of the whole Kingdom. But in the Authority I have quoted, it is put after the <HI>Earls</HI> and <HI>Barons,</HI> and so then must mean the whole <HI>Commonalty</HI> or Body of the <HI>Com∣mons,</HI> in the Sense they are now taken, and as it hath been always used in <HI>French</HI> as well as in <HI>Latin,</HI> when it comes after the Earls and Barons (as I have already noted); And for this pray see the <HI>Stat.</HI> of <HI>Westm.</HI> I. made 3<HI>d Edw.</HI> I. but eleven years after the 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. <HI>Per l'ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntments des Aechievesques, Evesques, Abbes, Priors, Counts, Barons &amp; tout le Comminalty de la terre illonques summones</HI>; Which Phrase I can shew you to have continued the same in most of our <HI>French</HI> Statutes, during the Reign of this King, and all his Successors in many Records and Acts of Parliament, whilst they were writ in <HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>French</HI>; which I shall omit reci∣ting, because I suppose you your self will allow it.</P>
<P>I have a great deal more to say concerning the true sense of the Words <HI>Com∣munitas, le Commune, &amp; le Communalty,</HI> which because it is long, and it now grows late, I shall defer till another time. But I think I shall be able to shew you from undoubted Records, and Acts of Parliament from the Reign of <HI>Hen. III.</HI> as low as <HI>Richard</HI> II. that these Words when used as I have now said, after the <HI>Earls</HI> and <HI>Barons,</HI> cannot refer to them, but to another distinct Estate or Order of Men, then called <HI>les Communer</HI> or <HI>les Communes</HI> in <HI>English</HI> the Commons of the King∣dom, distinct from the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Lords.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall nor now dispute with you concerning the Sense you have put upon the words, you mention but I grant they often signifie the Commons, after the 18<HI>th Edw.</HI> I. in some Acts of <HI>Parliament</HI> and <HI>Parliamentary Records</HI>; but I must beg your pardon, if I cannot allow Communitas to signifie▪ the Commons at this time in your Sense; and
<PB N="424" REF="231"/>
therefore am not yet convinced that the words <HI>la Communalty de la terre,</HI> mentio∣ned in the Statute of <HI>Westm.</HI> I. ought to be understood or englished by the word Commons; who I do not suppose were then above once called to <HI>Parliament,</HI> till the 18<HI>th</HI> of this King.</P>
<P>But as for what you argue from the Knights of Shires being often called <HI>Mag∣nates,</HI> and <HI>Grantz des Countees,</HI> I allow they are often so stiled in our Statutes and Rolls of <HI>Parliament</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.A.I.P.</HI> 219.</NOTE> but if you consider the reason of it, this will do you little Service, since they were so called from their being most commonly at the beginning of their Election, chosen out of the Greatest and most considerable <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI> under the Degree of Barons in each Coun∣ty, and no other, who were chosen to represent the <HI>Omnes alios qui de Rege Tenent in capite</HI> mentioned in King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter; or them and all the other Military Tenants by mean Tenure; For 'tis scarce to be believed that those Tenants <HI>in ca∣pite,</HI> who made such a noise for their Liberties, would part with this main point of being personally present; or else the Body of them represented by some of their own number in every County. And it may be upon this account they had the Title of <HI>Notable Knights,</HI> &amp;c. in the ancient Writs of Summons, directed to the Sheriffs; So that only the Tenants by Knights Service, as sui∣tors to the County Courts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. Pag.</HI> 19.</NOTE> were the Electors. And this was very likely the reason of the <HI>Statute</HI> of the 7<HI>th Hen.</HI> IV. that the Ele∣ction should be made in the County Court by all the <HI>Suitors</HI>; and also why the <HI>Statute</HI> 18<HI>th Hen.</HI> VI.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cha.</HI> 15.</NOTE> by which any man that had 40 <HI>s. per Ann.</HI> of any Tenure, who was before permitted to be an Elector, was altered by 10<HI>th Hen.</HI> VI. and so explained, that none but Freehold∣ers of 40 <HI>s. per Ann.</HI> should afterwards be Electors with respect to the least part of a Knights Fee,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>cha.</HI> 2.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> 40 <HI>s. per Annum,</HI> which were now come into the hands of very ordinary Men. For anciently, soon after, or near the Conquest, there were very few, or no great <HI>Soc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that is, such as held great Estates in <HI>Soccage,</HI> and neither the small ones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">LL: <HI>Hen.</HI> I. <HI>chap.</HI> 29.</NOTE> nor the <HI>Nativi,</HI> or Copyholders, were reputed <HI>Liberi,</HI> ot <HI>Lega∣les Homines</HI> (as before mentioned) or performed the service proper to such Military Tenants, or those to whom they had alienated part of their Fees. But since I have tired you as well as my self, in wrangling about the sense and meaning of the words in dispute between us, I shall for the future take a shorter cut, and give you two or three Authorities from our Anci∣ent Laws of <HI>VVilliam</HI> the Conqueror, and <HI>Hen.</HI> II. and <HI>Rich.</HI> I. which together with King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> will I think, make it plain enough in conscience, that the Commons, as now represented, were not summoned to Parliament during the Reign of King <HI>Iohn</HI>; and whether they were so summoned before 49<HI>th H.</HI> III. (when they were called but once, till above twenty years after) will be the other part of my Task.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I approve of your Method very well, and I assure you I love pedantick Disputes about the Grammatical signification of words as little as your self, un∣less where it is absolutely necessary, as indeed you have rendred it so, by raising the greatest part of your Arguments from the equivocal use of those general words whereby our Ancient Laws and Historians have stiled the Constituent Members of our Great Councils, which if they are well cleared, I think it is high time to fall upon some more solid Arguments. But before you come to that, I cannot
<PB N="425" REF="231"/>
forbear observing that your self do allow, that in all Acts of <HI>Parliament</HI> and <HI>Re∣cords</HI> after the 18<HI>th Edw.</HI> I. the words <HI>Communitas</HI> and <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Commune,</HI> when put after the Earls and Barons, do signifie the Commons in the same sense in which they are now taken; but I must confess it seems incredible (nay almost impossible to me) that these words should signifie the Community of the Tenants <HI>in capite.</HI> In the 48<HI>th Hen</HI> III or 18<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. (begin where you please) and yet that the next <HI>Parliament</HI> after those the same words should be taken in quite another sense for the <HI>Knights</HI> of <HI>Shires, Citizens</HI> and <HI>Burgesses,</HI> and that no <HI>Statute, Record</HI> or <HI>Historian</HI> of that or succeeding Ages should take the least notice of it is understood.</P>
<P>But before I conclude this part of the Question, I cannot but rectifie a great mistake you have fallen into by adhering to the Dr. with too implicite a Faith; For whereas you suppose, that the reason why our Knights of <HI>Shires</HI> were called anciently <HI>Grantz des Countees,</HI> was because they were at first elected out of the Tenants <HI>in capite</HI> only, and who with the other Tenants by <HI>Military Service</HI> were also the only Electors of them at first, till the Statute of 7<HI>th Hen.</HI> IV. <HI>ordained the Election should be made in the County Court by all the Suitors,</HI> as if it had not been many Ages so before; Whereas if you please to peruse that Statute a little better, you will find it was not made to enlarge the number of the Electors of Parlia∣ment men, for long before that time all sorts or degrees of Freeholders, as well <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI> as their Tenants by any kind of Tenure, or whether holding of such <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI> or else of others, as Abbots and Priors, and o∣ther Mesne Tenants, did alike owe Suit and Service to the County Court, and consequently were all alike capable of giving their Voices there, at the Election of Knights of Shires, however small their Estates were; Nor was that Statute of <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. now cited (which requires the Election of Knights of Shires to be made by those that were summoned, and all other that were there present) made to confer any new Right upon such Feeeholders but only to prevent the Abuses of Sheriff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who were wont before that Statute, to procure Knights of Shires to be chosen clandestinely, without any due Summons, or notice given to the Free∣holders of the Election; much less doth the Statute of 8<HI>th Hen.</HI> VI. confer any new Right or Priviledge upon Freeholders of 40 <HI>s. per Annum,</HI> to give their Voi∣ces at such Election (as you suppose) but only takes away the Right which the smaller Freeholders of under 40 <HI>s per Annum</HI> (whether <HI>Tenants in capite</HI> or not) had before, and restrains it only to such as <HI>shall have Lands or Tenements to the va∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of</HI> 40 <HI>s. by year above all charges.</HI> And it is yet a much greater mistake to sup∣pose, as your Dr. doth, that this Statute of 8<HI>th Hen.</HI> VI. was at all altered by that of the 10<HI>th</HI> of this King, which is no more than an Explanation of it, <HI>viz.</HI> that by 40 <HI>s. per Annum, was meant</HI> 40 s. <HI>Freehold, and that of Lands lying within the County, where the Election should be made.</HI> So that nothing can prove more expres∣ly, that all Freeholders, as well <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI> as by any other <HI>Tenure,</HI> were all alike capable of Elections; and being elected by the Ancient Law and Custom of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> long before those Statutes, and consequently were all alike Freeholders in the Eye of the Law.</P>
<P>But if you have nothing at present to object against what I have now said, pray pursue the Method you have undertaken, and let me see those convincing Proofs you so much rely upon, and which you hope may also serve to convert me.</P>

<P>Before I undertake this Task, pray permit me to give you my Opinion, in answer to the Difficulty you have now proposed, which I confess seems to carry some weight with it; but those Prejudices will soon vanish, when we con∣sider that the first time this Alteration was practised, it was done in the King's Name, tho by the absolute power of <HI>Simon Mountfort,</HI> in the 49th <HI>Hen</HI> III. and after a discontinuance of above twenty years was again renewed by <HI>Edw.</HI> I. at the desire of the Earls and Barons. as I hope I shall shew you before we have finished our Conversation. And therefore it being first done by the King's absolute Pow∣er, and after with the general consent of the Lords, there needed no <HI>Statute</HI> to introduce it any more, than there was in the Reign of <HI>VVilliam</HI> the Conqueror, to give the Bishops and Abbots that held by Knight's <HI>Service</HI> places in <HI>Parliament</HI> among the <HI>Temporal Lords,</HI> and to bring their Lands which were held before in <HI>Franc Almoigne,</HI> under the Yoak of <HI>Military Service.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed in the Design I have undertaken; it is necessary that I shew you first of all who were those <HI>Freemen</HI> or <HI>Freeholders</HI> properly so called, upon whom the whole burden of the subordinate Government of the Kingdom chiefly relied, and who then constituted the Legal University or Community thereof, immediately after the <HI>Norman</HI> Conquest, and during many King's Reigns after that time.</P>
<P>I suppose you are not ignorant that King <HI>VVilliam</HI> the Conqueror having outed all the <HI>English</HI> Nobility and Gentry of their Estates, gave them away to his <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Norman</HI> Followers to be held of him and his <HI>Successors in capite,</HI> either by Knights <HI>Service,</HI> or <HI>Petit Serjeanty,</HI> reserving to himself the Ancient Demesnes of the Crown, and adding more thereunto for the maintenance of the Royal Dig∣nity; and for this I need refer you to no better Author than <HI>Doomsday</HI>'s Book it self; And then after he had thus distributed the Lands of <HI>England</HI> as aforesaid, he composed a Body of Laws still extant, and which are in great part Addition to the Ancient Laws of King <HI>Edward,</HI> and his Predecessors. I shall give you three or four of these new Laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A.A.

Exaction and Taillage, were only such who were to perform Free Service, (i. e.
<PB N="427" REF="232"/>
Knight's Service) which was before appointed and granted them in Hereditary Right by the King in the Common Council of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>So that none were properly Freemen, or exempt from Tax or Talliage,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.A.P. p.</HI> 17.</NOTE> but such as held by Military Tenure, tho not Knighted.</P>
<P>And pray also by the way take notice, that by this <HI>Commune Consilium Regni,</HI> you are not to understand a Council of <HI>English</HI> men, or of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> to∣gether, but one wholly made up of <HI>Frenchmen</HI> or <HI>Normans,</HI> who as well Bishops and Abbots, as Temporal Earls and Barons, held almost all the Lands in the Kingdom by Knights <HI>Service.</HI></P>
<P>Which is also farther made out by the 58<HI>th</HI> Law; <HI>Tit. De Clientum seu Vassallo∣rem prastationibus. Statuimus etiam &amp; firmiter praecipimus, ut omnes Comites, &amp; Bermes, &amp; Milites, &amp; Servientes, &amp; Universi Liberi Homines totius Regni nostri pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tihabeant &amp; teneant se semper benè in Armis, &amp; in equis ut decet, &amp; oportet &amp; qud sint semper prompti, &amp; benè parati ad servitium suum integrum, nobis explendum &amp; p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gendum cum semper opus adfuerit secundum quod Nobis debent, de Feodis &amp; Tene∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tis suis de Iure facere; &amp; sicut illis statuimus, per Commune Consilium totius Regni nostri praedicti &amp; illis dedimus, &amp; Concessimus in Feodo, Iure Haereditario, hoc praecep∣tum non sit violatum ullo modo super foris facturam nostram plenam</HI>; So that here all the Freemen of his Kingdom were to perform their Military Services,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> with Horse and Arms according to their Fees and Tenures. Therefore they were Tenants in Military Service onely (which in those times were the only great Freemen, and that Service the only Free Service) which were meant in this Law; And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow different they were from our ordinary Freeholders at this day (for whom neither of these Laws were made) I dare leave it to the Judgment of every in∣different person.</P>
<P>These then were the men, the only Legal men that named and chose Juries, and served on Juries themselves, both in the Countrey and Hundred Courts, and dispatched all Countrey Business under the Great Officers, as will appear by the next Law with a little Explication: <HI>Ut Iura Regia illaesa, servare pro viribus c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entur subditi, Statuimus etiam &amp; firmiter praecipimus ut omnes Liberi Homines totius Regni praedicti sint Fratres conjurati, ad Monarchiam nostram &amp; ad Regnum nostrum, pro viribus suis &amp; facultatibus contra inimicos pro posse suo defendendum, &amp; viriliter ser∣va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um, Pacem, &amp; Dignitatem Coronae nostrae, integram observandam, &amp; ad Iudicium Rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um, &amp; Iustitiam constanter omnibus modis pro posse suo sine dolo, &amp; sine dilatione fa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endam.</HI> Now the Judgment they were to give, and the Justice they were to do by this Law (besides that in their own Courts and Jurisdictions) was principal∣ly as they were Jurors or Recognitors upon Assizes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (tho some of the grea∣test of their <HI>Milites</HI> were often <HI>Sheriffs, Hundredaries,</HI> and other Under-<HI>Iudges</HI> and Ministerial Officers of Justice in their several Counties) as may be seen in <HI>Glan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ille</HI> every where, but especially <HI>Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 10, 11. <HI>lib.</HI> 9. <HI>c.</HI> 7. <HI>c.</HI> 17. <HI>&amp; lib.</HI> 13. throughout.

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I answer your Conclusion from King <HI>VVilliam</HI>'s Laws, I must tell you, I am not at all satisfied neither with the Account you give, how the Com∣mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>England</HI> could come in to be a part of the Parliament, without any noise or notice taken of it, either by our Acts of Parliament, or Historians; since it is not only improbable, but also quite contrary to Matter of Fact, and History it self; as I shall, I hope, make good, when we come to treat of that Subject. Nor is your Argument of any weight, since it doth not follow, that because <HI>VVilliam</HI> the Conqueror so subjected the Lands of Bishops and Abbots to Tenure by Knights Service; that therefore this was done by his sole Power, without any Law for it, made by the Common Council of the whole Kingdom. Since I observe in the first Law of King <HI>VVilliam,</HI> which you have now cited, that the very Services which (you say) were reserved upon the Lands he had bestowed, are said to be so appointed or setled, by the Common Council of the whole Kingdom; and therefore certainly the Services of the Bishops and Abbots must be so likewise; And therefore I must confess my self to be of Mr. <HI>Selden</HI>'s Opini∣on in this Matter, who presumes there was a Law for it, tho now lost; and cannot believe that this King (how powerful soever) should attempt to introduce so great a yoak upon all the Bishops, and so many of the Abbots and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ors of <HI>England,</HI> without their consents expresly given to a Law, and made in the Great Council concerning it, tho that Law (as many others of this King) is not now to be found.</P>
<P>But to come to the main Design of your present Discourse, which is to shew that none but Tenants by Military Service <HI>in capite</HI> were in the first times after the Conquest properly the only true <HI>Freemen</HI> or <HI>Freeholders</HI> of the whole Kingdom. I shall shew you that first the Notion is quite new, and never heard of, till the Dr. (from whom you have borrowed it) first broach'd it; neither Mr. <HI>Lambard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Somne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> nor Sir <HI>Henry Spelman,</HI> nor any of our <HI>English</HI> Antiquaries or Lawyers ever discovered any such thing, before your Dr. arose to disperse these Clouds; every man of the Kingdom, who was no Villain, being look'd upon as a Freeman, and every Owner of Lands of Inheritance, though of never so small a propor∣tion reckoned a Freeholder, and his Estate called his <HI>Franc Tenement,</HI> or Freehold, as well in our Ancient, as Modern Laws; and that Freehold was not restrained only to Military Service, within a hundred years after the Conquest, appears by King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s <HI>Magna Charta</HI>; In which it is expresly recited, that <HI>Nullus distri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tur ad faciendum majus servitium de Feodo Militis, nec de alio Libero Tenemento qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> inde debetur</HI>; and that Socage Tenants, tho by Villain Services, were as much Freemen as your Tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> see <HI>Spelman</HI>'s <HI>Glossary, Tit. Socman,</HI> where he says thus, <HI>Socmannus in natura brevinan (brevi de Recto) propriè talis est, qui Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e est, &amp; tenet de Rege, seu de alio Domino in antiquo dominico terras suas seu Tenement<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Villenagio. Libro Sancti Albani Tit. Honcton,</HI> Chap <HI>I. Rege Angliae manerium de H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣cton tenuerunt in dominico; omnes Tenentes Liberi, scil. &amp; custumarii per sokam defendebant tenementa. sua,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>ex quo patet sokmans liberos <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> significare.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="429" REF="233"/>But since you seem to make a distinction between Freemen and Freeholders, properly, or improperly so called; since King <HI>VVilliam</HI>'s Laws you have now cited, do not warrant any such Distinction; I must beg your excuse if I am not of your Opinion; for the First Law you have quoted warrants no such thing; it only says, <HI>That all Freemen in general, shall take an Oath of Fealty to the King, to maintain him, his Lands and Honours, against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Enemies and Strangers.</HI></P>
<P>Now it is apparent that this Law extended to all Freemen, (who were by the Ancient <HI>Saxon</HI> Laws recited in the Addition to the Laws of King <HI>Edward</HI>) to take the very same Oath in the <HI>Folkmote,</HI> as they were after your Conquest to do according to this Law, either in the County Courts, or Sheriffs Tourne. Nor will the next Law do the business any more than this; for the Words are, That all <HI>Freemen of our said Kingdom may have and hold their Lands and Possessions free from all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>njust Taillage Exactions, &amp;c.</HI> Which Word <HI>Possessions</HI> extends not only, to Lands of Inheritance, (much less to Lands held by Knights Service) but also to Estates for Life, and all other Chattels or Possessions, as well real, as personal: Nor doth the Words <HI>Servitium Liberum,</HI> extend only to those Services which were reserved upon Lands held by Knights Service <HI>in capite,</HI> but also to those Common Services (called <HI>Trinoda necessitas</HI>) which I have formerly mentioned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iz. The building and repairing of Castles and Bridges, and Expedition against Foreign Enemies, which all the Lands in <HI>England</HI> were liable to, as well after, as before your Conquest: Nor will the 58<HI>th</HI> Law make more for you; for tho it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly says that all Earls, Barons, Knights, and their Servitors or Esquires, and all Freemen of the Kingdom shall always be fitted with Horses and Arms as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ought to be, and which they ought to do according to, and by reason of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees and Tenures. Now it is plain that this Law cannot extend to the Less <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Capite</HI> only, since they, according to your own sense, are comprehended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eder the Word <HI>Milites,</HI> and their <HI>Servientes,</HI> which seems to mean their Feudata∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Tenants, are as much tyed by this Law to find Horses and Arms, as the <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ants in capite</HI> themselves. So that whereas the Law says expresly, <HI>Uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rsi Liberi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mines totius Regni,</HI> it should have been, to make good your sense, <HI>Univers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Libe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Homines qui de Rege Tenant in capite</HI>; And as for the other Freemen who were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f lesser Estates than to find Horses, they were to be ready with such Arms as be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed their Condition, as we see it explained by the Assize of Arms of <HI>Henry</HI> II. which I have now cited; so that this Law of King <HI>VVilliam</HI> is not to be taken in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sense you put upon it, That all the true Freemen of the Kingdom were obliged to be ready with Horses and Arms, as if none were Freemen that did not; but referring the Words <HI>Horses</HI> and <HI>Arms</HI> to those who were to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind both; and the Word <HI>Arms</HI> to those Freemen who were only obliged to keep Arms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it for Foot∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, which sense the words will very well bear, tho expressed generally and concisely according to the Mode of those times, which abhor'd more Words than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeds: And if these Laws will not prove what you bring them for, much less till the last you have cited; For if the Words <HI>Omne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Liber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Homines totius Monar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> in the First Law, who were to take an Oath of Fidelity to the King must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tend to all the Freemen of <HI>England,</HI> (as certainly it did) all Freemen being a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e obliged to be sworn in the Court Leer, and County Court; so must this too, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Title being, that <HI>Omnes subditi,</HI> all the Subjects should endeavour to main∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in the King's Rights with all their Power; And tho I grant that <HI>Subditi</HI> here
<PB N="430" REF="234"/>
are the same with <HI>Liberi Homines</HI> in the first Law; yet since by that Law all Freemen were to take the Oath of Fidelity to the King, these must be also the very same Freemen, who were to be sworn Brothers to defend the Kingdom, according to their Power and Estates. So that all that you have said to prove your Tenants by Knights Service <HI>in capite,</HI> to be the only Freemen that served o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Juries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being built upon a false Interpretation of these Laws of King <HI>VVilli∣am,</HI> are but the meer Fancies and Imaginations of the Author from whom you borrowed them.</P>
<P>But taking the Words <HI>Liberi Homines</HI> in the strictest sense, and as they are is the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> and <HI>H.</HI> III. <HI>Chap.</HI> 14. where it is ordained, that <HI>Liber Homo non amercietur pro parvo delicto, nisi secundum modum illius delicti, salv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h contenemento suo, &amp; mercatar eodem modo, salva marchandiza, &amp; villanus salv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> VV<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nagio</HI>; Upon which Words Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> in his 2<HI>d.</HI> Inst. observes, that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Homo</HI> is here meant such a one as enjoys a <HI>Franc Tenement,</HI> that is, any sort of Free<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> hold.</P>
<P>But pray go on to prove by some plainer Authorities, that the <HI>Arch-Bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bishops</HI> and <HI>Abbots,</HI> &amp;c. together with the Earls, Barons, and other <HI>Tenents in capi∣ta,</HI> were the only Council of the Kingdom, for the assessing of Taxes, and mak∣ing Laws in the Times immediately succeeding the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> the First.</P>

<P>To return an Answer to all your Authorities together, I must now repeat what I often said, that there are no firm Arguments to be drawn from the doubt∣ful Words, and general Expressions of our Ancient Historians; and I doubt not but to shew you, that all the whole strength of your Reasons consists in this alone.</P>
<P>But since I have already spoken so much of the various signification of the Word <HI>Barones Regis &amp; Regni,</HI> I shall omit that, and now proceed to the rest of the Words, which you think make so plain for you, and shall only observe at present, that these Words <HI>Barones</HI> and <HI>Milites,</HI> are always stretch'd or con∣tracted,
<PB N="432" REF="235"/>
according as the Gentlemen of your Opinion find it best to suit with their Hypothesis.</P>
<P>As for Example. If the Word <HI>Barones</HI> is put alone, then it must signifie none but Great Barons, and Tenants <HI>in capite</HI>; if it be joined with <HI>Milites,</HI> then by <HI>Barones</HI> must be only meant the Great <HI>Barons</HI> or <HI>Peers</HI>; and by <HI>Milites,</HI> those <HI>Te∣nants in capite</HI> who were not Lords. If any other words follow <HI>Milites,</HI> then this Word must signifie only such Tenants <HI>in capite</HI> as were Knighted. So likewise you deal with all other Words, tho of never so comprehensive a Significa∣tion.</P>
<P>But why may not I with as much Reason affirm, That by <HI>Barones</HI> mentioned in these Authorities, is to be understood the <HI>Barones</HI> properly so called; and by the <HI>Mi∣lites,</HI> the Knights of Shires, whether they were Tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> or Feudatories to others; For <HI>Radulphus de Diceto in Anno</HI> 1040. in the Laws of <HI>Malcolm</HI> the Second, King of <HI>Scots,</HI> mentions <HI>Milites Vavasores, qui tenent de Baronibus tetras suas</HI>; and that not only Tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> but all others of whomsoever they held, who were able to maintain themselves like Knights, might be then forced to re∣ceive Knighthood, appears by two Writs of 24<HI>th</HI> and 26<HI>th H.</HI> III. as they are found in the Close Rolls,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot Claus.</HI> 24th <HI>H.</HI> III. <HI>m.</HI> 8. <HI>dorso Rot. Claus.</HI> 26<HI>th H.</HI> III. <HI>ps.</HI> 1. <HI>m.</HI> 6. <HI>dorso.</HI></NOTE> under this Title, <HI>Forma de Mo∣litibus faciendis</HI>; and I desire you would read the Writ it self.</P>
<P><HI>Rex Vicecomiti Northampton, Salutem Praecipimus tibi quod per totam Ballivam tuam in Singulis bonis Villis, &amp; similiter in pleno Comita∣tu tuo clamari facias, quod omnes illi de Comitatu tuo qui tenent Feodum Militis integrum, vel etiam minus quam Feodum inte∣grum, dum tamen de Tenemento Suo tam Militari quam Socagio p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssint sustentari, &amp; Milites non sunt, Sicut Tenementa sua deligunt, citra festum omnium Sanctorum Anno Regni Nostri</HI> 25. <HI>Arma capiant &amp; se Milites fieri faciant. Et si qui fuerint tales qui citra Terminum illum se Milites fieri non fecerint, Omnia Nomina eorum Statim à Termino illo, &amp; quantitatem, &amp; Valorem tenementorum suorum nobit scire facias Teste Rege, apud Lewes</HI> 25 <HI>die Iulii.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Similiter Scribitur omnibus Vicecomitibus.</HI></P>
<P>And as for the Words <HI>Homines Sui,</HI> which you will have only to mean the King's Tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> those Words have so equivocal a Signification, that there is no Argument to be drawn from them; for they may as well signifie all the King's Subjects sworn to him by Fealty and Allegiance, as Tenants by Ho∣mage, or Knights Service only, as Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI> in his Glossary observes upon the Word <HI>Homo, dicitur de quovis Praediorum Tenente, sive Socmanno, sive Militari</HI>; And for this he cites the Book of <HI>Ramsey,</HI> and if <HI>Suus</HI> be added to <HI>Homo,</HI> it doth much alter the Case, as appears by the words following, in the same place, <HI>Dici∣tur Praeterca de Quovis Ministro, &amp; Subdito, &amp; saepe occurrit hoc modo in Antiquis Pri∣vilegiis, non Solum Vassalos, &amp; Tenentes, sed Famulos, &amp; Subditos quoslibet Signifi∣cans</HI>; and for this he gives us several Authorities.</P>
<P>So that you see these Words do not only signifie Tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> but also any other Subjects, and so might take in the Knights of Shires▪ with the Citizens and Burgesses likewise, at least the Representatives of such Cities and Burroughs as held of the King <HI>in capite,</HI> by your own Sense of these Words.</P>
<P>But I shall however say something of the rest of the Words you insist upon, out of Abbot <HI>Benedict. viz. Barones terrae suae,</HI> which means no more than <HI>Regni sui</HI> before mentioned, and then it will signifie no more, than that all the Ba∣rons
<PB N="433" REF="235"/>
of his Kingdom were summon'd to this Assembly; which Word, Tenents <HI>in capite,</HI> I can give Mr. <HI>Selden</HI>'s Authority for, who in his First E∣dition,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 276, 277.</NOTE> 2<HI>d</HI> Part, hath his remarkable Passage, speaking of the seve∣ral kinds of Barons, he says,
<Q>That besides the <HI>Barones Regis,</HI> there were Barons of Subjects holding, not of the King, but by Mesnalty, who made a third Rank of such as were Lords of Mannors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Out of this may be understood why, and in what sense <HI>Baronagium Angliae, Rex &amp; Baronagium su∣um, &amp; sine Assensu Baronagii sui,</HI> so often occur in our old Stories, taken as well for the King, and the whole State sometimes, as for the Greater Nobility.</Q>
But if your Dr. had been pleased to have compared the Authors he quotes with others, nay with the Title to the very Constitutions of <HI>Claren∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 41.</NOTE> as he hath given them, as in his Appendix to his History out of <HI>Quadrilogus,</HI> this Objection would have been need∣less;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 1395.</NOTE> for if you consult <HI>Gervase</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> he stiles the Parties to this Council <HI>Praesules,</HI> and <HI>Proceres Anglicani Regni.</HI> And as for <HI>Matt. Paris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 100.</NOTE> pray observe that after the word <HI>Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rus</HI> (which there) coming immediately after the Bishops, Abbots, and Priors must needs signifie the Inferior Clergy), he expresses the Lay Orders thus; <HI>Cum Comitibus Baronibus ac Proceribus cunctis,</HI> where we may observe the word <HI>Proceres</HI> here put distinct from <HI>Barones,</HI> which may very well signifie not the Less Tenants <HI>in capi∣te,</HI> but the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, as I have already proved the word <HI>Proceres</HI> does often signifie, both in our Historians and Records; but <HI>Quadrilogus</HI> gives us the Title of these Constitutions more exactly in these words, <HI>Facta est ista Recognitio, coram Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, &amp; Clero, &amp; Comitibus, &amp; Proceribus Regni</HI>; and in the next Line he says, That those Customs were thus recognized, <HI>per Archiepiscopos, Episcopos, Comites, Barones &amp; per Nobiliores, &amp; Antiquiores Regni</HI>; where he likewise distinguishes between the Bishops and Inferior Clergy; and those who in the first place he calls <HI>Proceres Regni,</HI> In the next he calls <HI>Nibilores &amp; Antiquiores Regni,</HI> by which he might mean the Knights of Shires, Citizens and Burgesses, who were called in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Times <HI>Seniores &amp; Sapientes,</HI> as I have already proved; now if the Inferior Clergy appeared by their Represen∣tatives at this Council (since they could not then all come thither in person any more than now); to imagine that the Commons of <HI>England</HI> should not be like∣wise there by their Representatives of their own order, is to deprive the Commons of that Right, which you cannot but allow to the Inferior Clergy.</P>
<P>To conclude; You your self confess, that your Less <HI>Tenants in capite,</HI> some∣times called <HI>Barones minores</HI> were only nominally, and nor properly <HI>Barons</HI> of the Kingdom, in the sense that word is now taken; and if so, pray give me any satisfactory Reason, why other Commoners as well as they, <HI>viz.</HI> the Knights of Shires, Citizens and Burgesses, might not then likewise have had Places in our Great Councils or Parliaments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you use your utmost endeavour from the various and equivocal sense of the words in question between us, to prove that the Commons in the sense they are now taken might be comprehended under the words <HI>Barones, Mi∣i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, &amp; Homines sai,</HI> which it is very certain could not be, according to the Constitution of the Government at that time. And therefore I shall give you a very plain Answer to your Question, why other Commonrss as well as the lesser Tenents <HI>in Capite</HI> could not be present, or have places in those Great Councils,
<PB N="434" REF="236"/>
because it was contrary to the received Custom and Law of the Kingdom at that time, appears by those Clauses of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter, which Dr. <HI>B.</HI> hath made use of with so good success against Mr. <HI>P.</HI> and the Author of <HI>Ianus An∣glorum,</HI> &amp;c. And therefore I desire you would read them along with me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they stand here in the Appendix to the Dr's Compleat History of <HI>England</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 131.</NOTE> and as he hath transcribed them from an Ancient Manuscript in <HI>Bennet</HI> Colledge, and divided them into so many distinct Articles or Chapters; but those we chiefly insist upon are these.</P>

<P>From which Ancient Monument we may draw these Conclusions.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the King exercised a Royal Prerogative before this Charter, of Assessing Aids, and Scutages upon all sorts and degrees of Men, without the Assent o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Great or Common Council, (since called the Parliament) from doing which for the Future, the King by this Charter tyed up his own I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>and, unless i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Three Cases here particularly reserved.</P>
<P N="2">2. That there is no mention of any other Members to be summoned to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Council, but the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Earls, and Greater Barons b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> particular Writs, and all the other Lesser Tenents <HI>in Capite</HI> by one general Sum∣mons by the Sheriff. So that it is apparent that the Grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Councils before this time only consisted of such Earls Grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Barons and Tenents <HI>in Capite,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I. E. M. G. P.</HI> 211.</NOTE> as the King by special Writ wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pleased to summon; and this new way brought in a greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> number of the Tenents <HI>in Capite</HI> than ever had appeared before; so that if i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be true, which you assert, that this Charter was no new Grant to the Peo∣ple of <HI>England,</HI> but a Confirmation of their Ancient Rights and Liberties, it mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> then necessarily follow, that <HI>Great Lords</HI> and <HI>Tenents in Capite,</HI> called sometim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Barones Minores,</HI> were then the only Representatives of the Commons.</P>
<P>And that the Inferior Tenents consent was included in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Assent of his immediate Superior Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.</HI></NOTE> whose presence was r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quired in those Great Councils or Parliaments, need not,
<PB N="435" REF="236"/>
think, be doubted, and I can give you, if need be, several Authorities to prove it. But pray observe further, that here is no mention at all in this Charter of any Citizens or Burgesses to be summoned to the Great Council, unless you will have them included under the general Title <HI>of all others who hold in Capite,</HI> and then none but such Cities and Towns who held <HI>in Capite</HI> could pretend to send any Members; much less is there any mention of any Knights to be chosen for Counties, which certainly would have been particularly provided for by this Charter, had they then had any place in this Assembly. So that, I think, it is very plain, that the Commons were not otherwise represented than by these Tenents <HI>in Capite</HI> for the rest of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s, and most part of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. Reign, for ought I can yet discern: For though this Charter was Confirmed in the second and ninth year of that King last mentioned, <HI>per Commune Consilium <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Regni;</HI> yet there is likewise no mention made of any Knights and Citizens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Burgesses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I answer this main Argument of yours, (which I freely grant carrieth the greatest shew of probability of any you have yet brought) give me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ve to take notice, that I think you are very much out in your first Conclu∣sion; that before this Charter, the King exercised a Royal Prerogative of Impo∣sing Taxes without the Assent of Parliament; for if you mean that this Exacti∣on was exercised <HI>de facto,</HI> and from thence you would make it a Prerogative of the Crown, I grant this was true, not only before, but after this Charter, <HI>before the Statute de Tallagio non concedendo</HI> was made; but if you mean <HI>de Iure,</HI> I affirm that our Kings were as much tyed up by the 55th Law of <HI>William</HI> the First, (which you have already Cited) from Levying any <HI>unjust Taxes,</HI> or <HI>Exactions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Communi Consilio totius Regni,</HI> as they could be afterwards by any other sub∣sequent Law that could be made.</P>
<P>But I shall proceed to answer the Authority you have now brought from this Clause in King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter to prove, That none but <HI>Tenants in ca∣pite</HI> had any place in our Great Councils, or Parliaments. But though I confess the Charters of <HI>Henry</HI> III. and Confirmation of <HI>Edward</HI> I. are the same with this in the most material parts, yet there are several Clauses (of which this Clause in question is one) which are in King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter, and yet are totally omit∣ted out of both those of <HI>Henry</HI> III. as I shall shew you hereafter. So that let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e sense of this place be what it will, I defie you to shew me any Great Coun∣cil of the Kingdom, that was ever summoned according to this Imaginary Mo∣del of yours; and that I do not speak without Book, that Parliament or Coun∣cil of 9. <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, when but 11 years after King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter was Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>med; <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. Paris</HI> (as I have already observed) tells us, it consisted of <HI>Cle∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, &amp; Populus cum Magnatibus Regionis.</HI></P>
<P>But give me leave to read this Clause, according as your Dr. himself hath Printed, and Transcribed it, and as your self have now read it; and I doubt not, but it will appear plain enough, that the Clause you insist on in this Char∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, doth not at all concern the <HI>Great Council</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom</HI>; and for the proof of this, I desire you only to observe, that by the 15th and 16th Clauses of this Charter you have now read, both the <HI>City of London,</HI> and all other <HI>Cities. Bar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ghs</HI> and <HI>Towns,</HI> had a Right to have a Great Council of the Kingdom for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>essment of Aids, (otherwise than in the Three Cases there expected.) And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay take the Dr's Paraphrase to this Clause along with you in his Appendix to
<PB N="436" REF="237"/>
his compleat History of <HI>England,</HI> viz. That they, <HI>viz.</HI> the Citizens, Burgesses,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 131. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and Cinque Ports <HI>shall send their Representatives or Com∣missioners to the Common Council of the Kingdom, for the Assessment of Aids</HI>; So that according to his Concession, there must have been Citizens and Burgesses in the Great Council, in the Reign of King <HI>Iohn</HI>; and if so, I desire you to tell me whether those Gentlemen were Commoners or not?</P>
<P>But I will not insist too much upon his Concessions, for I think it is very plain from the Words themselves, which point out a distinction between the Common Council of the Kingdom, mentioned in the first Clause which was to meet, to grant, or assess Aids or Subsidies; and that other (tho not Common) Council or Assembly, consisting of all the Tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> which by the 17<HI>th.</HI> and 18<HI>th.</HI> Clauses of that Charter, are to meet to assess <HI>Escuage,</HI> and to do such other Business as was express'd in their Summons. So that nothing seems plainer to me, than that this Assembly mentioned in this Charter, for assessing Escuage, was a distinct Council from the Great Council of the Kingdom, which was ap∣pointed for the granting of other Taxes, called <HI>Auxilia,</HI> and for the making of Laws.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess this Gloss of yours seems at first sight very plausible, and agree∣able enough to the way of Reading and Pointing, with which the Dr. himself published this Charter; but for all that, I much doubt whether you are in the right, or not, therefore pray give me leave to put off this Debate till our n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t Meeting, since it now grows late; and in the mean while I will take time to consider the Arguments and Authorities you have now made use of.</P>

<P>But to come to the matter that we now meet about, I must now tell you again, that tho' this your gloss upon King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter, seems plausible at first sight, nay, is agreeable to the Dr's own way of dividing and reading the several Articles of this Charter; yet upon better consideration, I can see no good reason for making a full, or at least, a half stop in the 16<HI>th</HI> Article, after these words, <HI>omnes liberas consuetudines suas</HI>; adding the rest that follows, <HI>&amp; ad habendum Commune Concilium, &amp;c.</HI> to the following Clause, <HI>&amp; de seutagiis assidendis, &amp;c.</HI> much lest for supposing as you do, without any ground, that there were two sorts of Common Councils, one for Asses∣sing Escuage, and the other for Granting all other Aids and Taxes; and then, if read otherwise, it will plainly appear that it was one and the same Council of the Kingdom that did then both grant Aids to the Crown, and Assess Escuage <HI>ratione tenurae,</HI> which I am the more inclined to believe
<PB N="438" REF="239"/>
from the fourteenth Clause here cited, which says. That no Scutage, or Aids shall be imposed, unless by the common Council of the Kingdom. Now to what purpose is this so-express'd, if there was to be one Council for the granting of Aids, and another for the Assessing of Escuage: So that if this Common Council of the Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> might grant Aids, and Assess Escuage upon the Subjects (unless in the case before excepted) I see no rea∣son why they should not be the only Council, for the giving their Assent to Laws also; and consequently of concluding not only their own Tenants, but the King's Tenants in <HI>Petty Sergeanty</HI> and Socage, nay, the Tenants of any other Persons whatsoever.</P>
<P>And though I have seriously considered Mr. <HI>P</HI>'s Append<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x to the Rights of the Commons asserted, and Dr. <HI>b</HI>'s Answer to it, as also his Animadversions upon <HI>Iani Anglorum. &amp;c.</HI> Yet can I not see any colour of an Argument for making any distinction between the King's <HI>Curia</HI> of his Great Lords, and Te∣nants in <HI>Capite</HI>; and the Great or Common Council of the Kingdom, but that they were then all one and the same. It would be tedious to me, as well as you, to run over all the particular Authorities and Examples which have been urged <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> in this Question. But I desire you, or your Friend Mr. <HI>P.</HI> to shew me that there was any <HI>Bishops, Earls, Barons,</HI> or other Mem∣bers of Parliament in the times we now treat of, that had any place, or Vote therein, but according to their Tenure, and the ancient Custom of all Feu∣dal Tenants, who by the <HI>German▪ Gothic</HI> and <HI>Lombard</HI> Feudal Laws (which in substance were the same with ours) were always summoned to the Court of the King their Supreme Lord.</P>
<P>But farther to prove that this Council for Assessing Escuage, was no other then the great Council or Parliament of those Tenents in <HI>Capite,</HI> appears from <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tleton</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enures, where in his second Book, Sect. 97. he tells us, <HI>That after an Expedition Royal into</HI> Scotland, <HI>Escuage shall be Assessed in Parliament upon all those who failed to do their Service in that Expedition</HI>: so that if the Parlia∣ment did then Assess Escuage, I desire to know why they might not do it in the Reign of King <HI>Iohn</HI>? i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this great Council of the Arch bishops, Bishops, great Lords and Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> were not the Common Council of the whole Kingdom in those Times? yet that Escuage was not always Assessed in Parliament after this Charter of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> but that the King by his own Prero∣gative did often grant his Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> a Power to take Scu∣tage of their Tenants without any Assent in Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. p.</HI> 117.</NOTE> the Dr. hath given you above a dozen Examples in the Reigns of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. and King <HI>Iohn.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it was for Aids and Scutage Service, but if it was for Scutage imposed in Parliament as a Tax upon Land by the Common Council of the Nation, then the Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> were not only the sole Grantors, but the Collectors of that Scutage too, from their Mesne Tenants: And the Writs to the Sheriff was different from these in Scutage Service,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. p.</HI> 121.</NOTE> though the same in Substance; as likewise appears by those Records the Dr. hath there given us.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not but I shall make good my Assertion, and shall be able to de∣fend what Mr. <HI>P.</HI> hath in his Learned Treatise asserted concerning this mat∣ter. In the first place, I must stick to that way of reading and pointing of this Clause in dispute, since it is not only agreeable to the Dr's Manuscript Copy, but also to the old French Copy, published by Father <HI>D'achery</HI> in his <HI>Spicilegium, vol.</HI> 13. which is written in the French of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time: but to an∣swer your Objection against this Interpretation, you your self have in great part helped me to do it, by that true distinction you have now made be∣tween a Scutage as an Aid, or Tax, and as a Service, the latter of which you assert might be granted to the King, to be raised by his Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> upon their under-Tenants, whereas the former was only grantable in Parliament by the Common Council of the whole Nation. Which Tax, I Affirm, was always granted to the King, and imposed by the Com∣mon Council of the Kingdom only, and not by the Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> alone, before the Expedition was undertaken. Whereas <HI>Scutage Service</HI> (consider∣ed as a payment of so much Money) was never due or payable, till the Ex∣pedition was ended; and then only upon such as had failed to serve in Per∣son, or by sufficient Deputies; and was then to be Assessed by the Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> alone.</P>
<P>And though I grant it may seem to have been a Prerogative as you call it, exercised by some of our Kings, sometimes to grant his Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> a License to take Scutage of their Tenants, without the Assent of the Great Council of the Kingdom; yet such Payments or Assessments were either according to Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. p.</HI> 117.</NOTE> and the express Grant of this Charter it self; as is that Writ of King <HI>Iohn</HI> to the Sheriff of <HI>Glocester∣shire</HI> for the Assessing of an Aid or Scutage Service of three Marks on each Scute upon the Tenants of <HI>Saber,</HI> Earl of <HI>Winchester,</HI> for making his Eldest Son a Knight, and which the said Earl, might have claimed of his Te∣nants by the Common Law, as also by the 20<HI>th</HI> Article of that Charter; but for Scutage Tax <HI>Littleton</HI> tells us, Lib. 2. Sect. 101. <HI>That because such Tene∣ments came at first from the Lords, it is Reason they should have Escuage of their Tenants, and the Lords in such case might destrain for the Escuage so Assessed by Parliament; or in some Cases they may have the King's Writ directed to the Sheriffs of the same County,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vy such Escuages for them, as appears by the Register.</HI></P>
<P>But if either King <HI>Iohn,</HI> or King <HI>Hen.</HI> III. granted Writs to levy Escuage upon the under-Tenants of the great Lords, and Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> without their own Consent in Parliament this ought to be no more cited as a Precedent, than any other illegal Acts committed by those Kings; since, as our Records and Histories tell us, it was such illegal Proceedings which were the cause of the Barons Wars. And it is expresly against the words of this Charter of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> which you have now quoted, <HI>viz. nullum Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>agium vel Auxilium p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nam in Regno nostro, nisi per Commune Consilium Regni nostri.</HI></P>
<P>So that notwithstanding all you have yet said, it doth not appear to me, how Scutage, when given as a Tax upon Knights <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees alone, and to be levy∣ed not only from the Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> themselves, but their under-Tenants
<PB N="440" REF="240"/>
as also from the Tenants of them, who though they held in <HI>Capite</HI>; yet held not by Knights Service; such as were the Tenants in <HI>Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y Serjeanty,</HI> and those who held of the King in Chief, as of several Honors, and not of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Crown, as in <HI>Capite,</HI> could ever charge such Tenants without their Consent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> given either by themselves, or their lawful Representatives; much less could your Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> Tax or Charge such as did not hold <HI>in Capite</HI> themselves, <HI>viz.</HI> Those Abbots and Priors who held Lands in Right of their Monasteries in <HI>Franc Alm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igne,</HI> and who together with their Tenants made at least two third parts of all the Abby-Lands in <HI>England</HI>; as also Tax'd those, who not holding by Knights Service at all, but by Tenure in Socage, or Fee Farm, did not hold their Lands, as Knights Fees, and therefore could never be Tax∣ed by your Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> for so many Knights Fees, or parts thereof. And <HI>Braecton</HI> (who lived at this very time) has distinguish'd to no purpose between those Common Services which all Tenants owe their Lords, and the general Taxes, or Charges imposed by the Common Consent of the whole Kingdom.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bract. lib.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 16. <HI>p.</HI> 37.</NOTE> The words are very remarkable, pray read them. <HI>Sunt quaedam Commun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s praestationes quae ser∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cis non di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, nec de consu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tudine ven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um nisi cum necessita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> intervenerit, vel cum</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>i. e.</HI> When the King comes to Parliament.</NOTE> <HI>Rex venorit, sicut sunt Hidagia.

So that nothing seems plainer to me, than that there was (us our ancient Historians tell us) a distinct Court, which was held anciently three times every year, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Easter, Whitsuntide</HI> and <HI>Christ∣mas</HI>; and then the King was attended by all the Bishops, great Lords,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. R. C. p.</HI> 131.</NOTE> and other Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and this was called <HI>Curis,</HI> or <HI>Concilium Regis</HI>; and if any difference of Right did arise between the King and his Tenants, or between Tenant and Tenant; here it was to be heard and determined; and many other things were there u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted and done, in relation to the King's Barons, or Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only.</P>
<P>But under Favour, this was not the <HI>Commune Consillum Regni,</HI> or Parlia∣ment (as we now call it) for the King held this Court <HI>ex More</HI>; or by Cu∣stom, without any Summons, as <HI>Simon</HI> of <HI>Durham,</HI> and <HI>Florence</HI> of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and divers other Writers of the Lives of our first <HI>Norman</HI> Kings do shew us. But when they take notice of the meeting of the <HI>Commune Con∣silium totius Regni,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 680.</NOTE> their Expressions after, and then they say, that, <HI>Rex ascivi,</HI> as it is in <HI>Ordericus Vitalis.

Magno Parliamento,</HI> &amp;c.) So that it seems plain to me, that this uniting of the great or whole Parliament, must be understood the Conjunction of both Councils together; and therefore, when this Council of Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> that thus met <HI>ex more</HI> took upon them assess Escuage, and transact other matters of consequence, without the consent of the major part of the Te∣nants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who often failed to appear at these Courts, or Assembl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es held <HI>ex more,</HI> it was then and not before expresly provided by this Charter of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> that Escuage should not be assessed for the future, without Summons, or Notice given of it to all the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who had right to be there.</P>

<P>I see you would fain prove that there was a Council or Assembly of great Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> distinct from the Parliament, and which met <HI>ex more,</HI> and that these were the Persons who were by this Charter to Assemble for the Assessing of Escuage, which is a meer precarious Hypothesis, nor can you, or those, from whom you borrow this Notion, make it out from any good Authority; for I have already proved, that the <HI>Barones Regis &amp; Regni,</HI> were the same Persons, and that usually the Barons or Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> of what Quality soever, did repair to the King's Court, at <HI>Christ∣mas, Easter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<P>But pray give me leave to ask you this question, might not our first <HI>Norman</HI> Kings often Summon the Common Council of the Kingdom at one of the said usual Feasts, since it was so much for the conveniency of the Bi∣shops, great Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> (who I grant, were then all Mem∣bers of the Great Council,) to meet all the rest of the Kingdom, or Repre∣sentatives of the Commons at the same time: Though the Writers you have quoted may not mention their being Summoned at all. And as for the Writs of Summons, those of much later Parliaments being lost, how can it be ex∣pected we should now prove their being Summoned so many Year before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess it might be so, that upon extraordinary business,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.A.P. pag.</HI> 115.</NOTE> and when the occasion was great, and the King desired a great and full appearance, they might also receive an express Summons at those times. But then I must desire you to shew us any mention of a Summons to any of these Common Councils, which when called at other times, are most constantly mentioned in this Author. And I desire to know of you what you will say to those words <HI>pro more convenit,</HI> which is spoken of the most general Councils, when the Community of the Kingdom met at the King's Court? You cannot deny, but that the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> were the Kings <HI>Barones, Milites, Magnates,</HI> &amp;c. Upon this we will joyn issue; And I affirm (without bringing Proofs which are infinite in this Case) that all the Bishops, Earls and Barons of <HI>England,</HI> did hold their Lands, Earldoms, and Baronies of the Crown, or (which is all one,) of the King, as of his Person, and that was <HI>in Capite.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, as I said before, divided most of the Lands in <HI>England</HI> amongst his great followers, to hold of him; he made Earls and Barons, such as he pleased: They and their Descendants held upon the same Terms with the first grantors, which was, to find so many Horse and Arms, and do such and such Services; both Titles and Lands were Forfeitable, for Treason or Felony to the King, did Homage for them, and every Bishop, Earl and Baron of <HI>England</HI> was in those circumstances, and held of the King after this manner.</P>
<P>Other Lands were given to other Persons for meaner Services; as to his <HI>Woodwards, Foresters, Hunts-men, Faulconers, Cooks, Chamberlains, Gould∣sinlibs, Bayliffs of Mannours,</HI> in his own hands, and many other Officers, which in <HI>Doomsday-Book,</HI> are called, <HI>Terrae Thanorum Regis,</HI> and sometimes <HI>servientium Regis</HI>; And I doubt not, whatever the Notion of <HI>Petyt Sergeanty</HI> now is, but that originally, this holding of Lands was the true Tenure; not
<PB N="443" REF="241"/>
but presenting the Lord with a Bow, an Arrow, a pair of Spurs every Year, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> might also be called <HI>Petyt Serjeanty,</HI> though not so properly as the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not to multiply words to no purpose, I think your Reply is far from be∣ing Satisfactory; for in the first place, it is very unreasonable to demand, that we should now shew the express Summons to these common Councils which were not held <HI>de more</HI>; since you know that all antient Records of that kind are destroyed and lost; for if we could produce them at this day, the difference between us, and those of your Opinion, would quickly be at an end, as ap∣pears by those great Councils, which are said expresly, by the Historians I have cited, to have been summoned, and yet no such Writs of Summons are to be found; nor is it any good Argument, that because our ancient Historians mention no distinct Summons to the great Councils, when met at the usual times of the meeting of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> that there∣fore there were none such, since we find they often pass by much more mate∣rial Matters than this.</P>
<P>And though I grant that the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were then part of the great Council of the <HI>Barones, Milites &amp; Magnates Regni</HI>; yet does it not follow for all this, that none but the Kings Barons, and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were Members of this great Council, since there might be in those times other Barons, or great Freeholders, who (though they held their Lands of the Tenants <HI>in Ca∣pite,</HI> yet) might be there as Knights of Shires, or else appear in Person at those Assemblies as well as the other; and besides, there were others, who, though they did not hold of the King <HI>in Capite,</HI> but of some great Honor or Castle, or else of some Abbot or Prior; yet were Men of very great Estates, and very numerous, all which must otherwise have had their Estates tax'd, and Laws made for them, without, nay, against, the consent of themselves, or any to represent them: Nor is your Assertion at all true, That <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror divided most of the Lands in <HI>England</HI> to be held of him <HI>in Capite.</HI> For besides those Servants and Officers you last mentioned, above two third parts of the Lands of the Abbies and Priories in <HI>England</HI> were not held, as al∣so much other Lands in <HI>Kent,</HI> and other Countries, <HI>per Baroniam,</HI> or Knights Service, but in <HI>libera Elecmosina</HI> only, or Socage, as I have already prov'd; and consequently neither they nor their Tenants could, according to your Hypothesis, have any Representatives in Parliament.</P>
<P>And farther, you your self grant, that those Lands you mention which were given out by your Conqueror, to his <HI>Woodwards, Foresters, &amp;c.</HI> did not capacitate them to appear in Parliament, since their Tenure was only by <HI>Petyt Serjeanty,</HI> and not by Knights Service: Nor could they become the King's Tenants in ancient Demesne, because such Tenants held wholly by Socage Tenure; whereas it appears plainly by <HI>Littleton,</HI> that Tenants in <HI>Petyt Serjeanty</HI> were subject to Wardship, Marriage and Relief: So that whoever will but con∣sider, that near half the Lands in <HI>England</HI> were held by Bishops, Abbots, Priors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and of whom not a third part held by Knights Service of the Crown; and will then likewise consider what a vast number of Tenants those Abbots, Priors, Deans and Chapters (who were not Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> at
<PB N="444" REF="242"/>
all) must have had; and who either held Estates in Fee, or else for Life, un∣der them in Socage, as well as by Knights Service; as also all the other sorts of Tenures I have already mentioned, which either held of the King as of some Honor or Castle, or else of other Mesne Lords by other Tenures than Knights Service, must certainly conclude, that not above one half of the Lands of the whole Kingdom was held either immediately of the King, or else of other Mesne Lords by that Tenure: So that if all these Persons which were far the greater Number of the Free-holders in <HI>England,</HI> should have been thus excluded from having any thing to do in our Great Councils, I doubt not but we should have found sufficient Clamour in our Histories against so unjust a Constitution; and when the whole Body of the Kingdom was in Arms against King <HI>Iohn</HI> at <HI>Running-Mead,</HI> they would likewise have inserted a Clause for themselves, if they had not had their Suffrages there before, either by them∣selves in their own Persons, or by their lawful Representatives. And there∣fore upon the whole matter, I durst leave it to the Consideration of any un∣prejudiced Man, whether it is not much more probable, that the Constituti∣on of Knights of Shires, Citizens and Burgesses appearing in Parliament, should be much more antient then the time you assign, than that so small a Body of Men as the Bishops, Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> should represent all the Freeholders and People of <HI>England,</HI> who never held of them by Knights Service at all. Nor have you yet answered the Quotation I have brought out of <HI>Bracton</HI> in my last Discourse to the contrary. And whoever will but consult that Author in his Chapter of Tenures, will find, that the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were so far from having a Power of charging all the Mesne Tenants at their Pleasure, that in his Chapter <HI>de Tenuris,</HI> it appears, that a Mesne Tenant <HI>in Capite</HI> having purchased an Estate for a valuable Consideration, was lyable to no other Services and Conditions, than what his Tenure express'd; which once performed, the Lord had no more to say to him: and if so be he laid any further Burthens upon him, he might have had a Writ of acquital out of the King's Court against him directed to the Sheriffs; several Forms of which you may see in <HI>Glanville,</HI> and in the old Register.</P>

<P>We are not to rest upon meer Probabilities, for some things that now appear to us unreasonable at this instant of time, might then be very just; for if the Feudatary Tenants of the Bishops, Barons and other Te∣nants <HI>in Capite</HI> were well enough contented with the Constitution of the Kingdom, as it then was; and that it plainly appears by matter of fact, that there was but one Common Council for the whole Kingdom; and that of the Bishops, Abbots, Great Lords and less Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only, it is in vain to argue of any unreasonableness in, or Inconveniencies that might arise from, such a Constitution, though perhaps a great part of the Kingdom did not hold <HI>in Capite,</HI> nor yet by Knights Service; and therefore though the Feu∣datary Tenants of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> were upon the performance of their Services acquitted of all other Charges; yet this was still to be understood only of such ordinary Services as those Tenants were to perform by virtue of their Tenures, such as was Scutage Service, or the attending upon their Lords when they went out to War along with the King; but did not extend
<PB N="445" REF="242"/>
to such Scutages as were granted in Parliament, or as a Tax upon Land by the common consent of the Nation; for then the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were not only the Grantors, but the Collectors too, of such Scutage Tax, from their Military Tenants; and the Writs to the Sheriffs were different from those for Scutage Service; and for proof of this, I desire you would peru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that Writ which the Dr. Quotes of the 19th of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. which is still to be seen in the close Roll of that Year.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cl. 19. <HI>H.</HI> 3. m. 8. <HI>dorso.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Rex Vice Comiti Sussex salutem.

<P>Now I desire you to tell me whether any thing can be more plain, than that this Tax was granted by a Common Council of the Kingdom, ac∣cording to that Clause of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter, I have now cited: Where∣in it is first especially provided, that no Aid, or Scutage shall be imposed up∣on the Kingdom, unless by the Common Council thereof; and yet you see by this Writ, that the Archbishops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the Barons there mentioned, to∣gether with the other Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> alone, granted an Aid or Scutage Tax of two Marks for every Knights Fee which they held of the King; and that by virtue thereof not only those Knights Fees they held in their hands, but also all those Subseudatary Tenants called here Freeholders, who held of them by Knights Service, were likewise charged for every Knights Fee, so held, the like Summ of two Marks. Now I think nothing can be more plain from this Record, than that this was a Common Council of the whole King∣dom, and yet consisted of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only; and therefore I desire you to shew me some better Proofs than you yet have done, that these Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> ever made a distinct Council different, from the Common Council of the whole Kingdom.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant this seems at first sight to be a good Authority for you; but I doubt not for all that, to prove, that it makes wholly against you; and will, together with those Proofs I shall urge, make out this difference be∣tween the two sorts of Councils, I have already asserted; and therefore I must tell you, that there is no necessity of understanding the words <HI>de Consilio illorum</HI> (mentioned in this Record) to refer to the Common Council of the whole Kingdom, It not being here said to be
<PB N="446" REF="243"/>
granted <HI>per Commune Concilium Regni,</HI> and then there can no more be proved from this Record, than that a Common Council of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> took upon themselves an unusual Power, <HI>sine consuetudine</HI> as the Writ here mentions in those times, to charge not only themselves, but their Under-tenants also, and that even this was an encroachment appears by the Statute, <HI>De <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣lagio non con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edendo,</HI> made 25th. of <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. whereby it is expresly forbid that any Talliage or subsidy should be laid upon the Kingdom <HI>sine volun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Archiepiscorum, Episcoporum, Comitum, Baronum, Militum, Burgensium &amp; aliorum liberorum hominum de Regno nostro.</HI> Now pray read my Lord <HI>Cooks</HI> Reason in his 2d.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 532.</NOTE> Inst. why this Statute was made,
<Q>The 2d. Cause (says he) was that the King the Year before, had taken a Talliage of all Cities and Burroughs, without assent of Par∣liament, whereupon arose a great Murmuring and discontent among the Com∣mons, for pacifying which discord between the King and his Nobles, and for the quieting of the Commons, and for a perpetual and constant Law for ever after, both in this and other-like Cases, this Act was made, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being no other (then as the same Author tells us in the Conclusion of this comment on this Statute;) then a restitution general to the Subjects of all their Laws, Liberties, and free Customs as freely and wholly as at any time before, in bet∣ter and fuller manner than they used to have the same.</Q>
But yet, that this was no general Scutage or Tax upon the whole Kingdom, but only upon the Te∣nants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and their Tenants by Knights service, appears by the Writ it self. So that not only all the Persons I have already mentioned, who being Tenants to Monasteries and Priories, did not hold by Knights service, and all Tenants in <HI>Petys Sergeanty,</HI> and all Cities and Burroughs, who did not hold <HI>in Capite</HI> (who if they had not then Representatives in the great Council, were wholly Free from this Tax) and not only these, but all Tenants in Fee Socage, whether holding of the King, or of other Mesne Lords were wholly exempt from this Scutage▪ So that nothing seems plain∣er to me, than that this Assembly that gave the King this Tax for them∣selves and their Tenants, was a Common Council only of Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> charging themselves and their Tenants only, and not the whole Kingdom; and that done in a Case of great necessity, <HI>sine consuetudine</HI>: For if it had in∣cluded all the rest of the Kingdom, there would certainly have been some mention made, how all the rest of the Kingdom (which did not hold by Knights service) should be Taxed.</P>
<P>And that this was a Council consisting of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only may appear by a Record of the 42d. of this King, which I pray read. <HI>Rex Bar.</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Quia per Commune Concilium Com. Baronum &amp; aliorum Magnatum nobiscum in Walliâ nuper existentium provisum est;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Inter Commu∣nia de Term. Sancti. Mich.</HI> Anno. 42. H. 3. Rot. 4. <HI>de Scut.

Scutag. nostrum.</HI>
<PB N="447" REF="243"/>
From which Record, it appears, that this was only a Common Council of Te∣nants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who had attended on the King, and done their Service in this <HI>Welsh</HI> Expedition, and concerned none else but such Tenants by Knights Service and their Tenants who had fail'd to do their Service; and is just such a Tax as is expresly reserved by the last Clause of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter, which you have before cited: whereby Scutage is to be assessed by all the Tenants <HI>in Capite.</HI></P>
<P>And that not only the Spiritual and Temporal Barons, and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> did thus meet, and hold distinct Councils, or Assemblies for the granting of Scutage, but also that the Spiritual Barons and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> did also sometimes hold separate Assemblies, appears by the Patent Roll of the 15. of this King, thus. <HI>Cum peteremus à Praelatis Angliae quod nobis Auxilium facerent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Pat. 15. H. 3. N. 3.</NOTE> <HI>pro Magnâ necessitate nostrâ de quâ cis con∣flabat,</HI> viz. <HI>Epis.

<P>But when a general Tax or Subsidy was granted by the whole Kingdom, the Stile of these Councils runs much otherwise, as appears by the Close Roll, of the 4th. of this King, where it is recited in the Record; that, <HI>Omnes Mag∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates, &amp; Fideles totius Regni nostri,</HI> granted <HI>de qualibet caru∣catâ duos solidas.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Claus.</HI> 4. H. 3. M. 5.</NOTE> Now it hence appears that this was a grant of Caruage, which not being a Scutage service, nor yet a Tax by way of Scutage: and was therefore to be granted by the Common Council of the whole Kingdom, assessed, not only upon Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> and their Feudatory Tenants, but upon each Plough-Land of the whole Kingdom, must have bin granted (as I have already pro∣ved out of <HI>Bracton,</HI> speaking of this Caruage,) <HI>de consensu &amp; Communi consilio toti∣ut Regni</HI>; for otherwise these Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> could never have charged all the Lands of <HI>England</HI>; of which, not half was held by Knights service. And to make it yet plainer by other Records, pray see another of the 16th. of this King, in these words. <HI>Rex Vice-comiti Devon. salutem sciatis quod Archiepiscopi Episc.

<P>I think you and I may so far agree, that this Council I instanced in, consisted of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only, and likewise that they imposed Scutage upon no others than their Tenants, by Knight-service, yet doth it not there∣fore follow, that they were not the Common Council of the Kingdom, or might not have Tax'd all others, though they were not their immediate Tenants as well as they did those that were: And therefore I am not con∣vinc'd, but that these Persons mentioned in the Records you have cited (which you grant constituted a Common Council of the Kingdom) were no other, than the same Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> already mentioned, for as for the <HI>Fideles</HI> mentioned in the Record of 4<HI>th.

<PB N="449" REF="244"/>
our Histories and Records.

<P>The King had writ to them all particularly, but that the business required greater haste. It seems before the granting of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> this King sent special Summons, and particular Letters to his Barons, and other Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> to meet upon any occasion. So likewise in these Writs there mentioned to the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> of several Counties,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. G. p.</HI> 45. Cl. 42. <HI>H.</HI> 3. <HI>m.</HI> 10. <HI>dorso.</HI></NOTE> as they are found in the close Roll there cited. <HI>Rex omnibus Co∣mitibus, Baronibus, Militibus &amp; aliis fidelibus sui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de Com.

<P>But to speak somewhat of the <HI>Clerici Terras habentes, &amp;c.</HI> as also of the <HI>Liberi Homines &amp; Villani,</HI> mentioned in the Record of 16 <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. you have now cited. 1.

P. p.</HI> 220, 221.</NOTE> <HI>qua ad Ecclesias suas non pertinent,</HI> by Inferior Landed Clergy-men, since 'tis more than you can make out; for I take them to be such Clerks, as had Mannors and Free, or Military Fees belonging to their Benefices, and that held of the King <HI>in Ca∣pite,</HI> the Fee whereof was in the Crown, and not in the church, and therefore did not belong to it.</P>
<P>But <HI>Mat. Paris, fol.</HI> 377. informs us better who they were that gave this Tax, when he speaks concerning this very Council—<HI>ad Coloquium coram Rege convenerunt Episcopi, &amp; aliarum Ecclesiarum Praelati, cum Proceribus Reg∣ni concessa est Regi quadragesima pars honorum.</HI></P>
<P>Now what the <HI>Liberi Homines</HI> were in this Record, you have cited, we may easily guess from the other Records I have made use of in 19 <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. <HI>viz.</HI> such of those, <HI>Omnes alii qui de nobis Tenent in Capite,</HI> which were not <HI>Milites</HI> in a strict sense, or had not received the Order of Knighthood. And
<PB N="450" REF="245"/>
I shall make out this sense of the words, as also of the true meaning of these <HI>Villani</HI> by another Record,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot.

<P>From this Record we may observe, 1. That the King's Writ was only issued to the Arch-bishops,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. I.</HI> 221.</NOTE> Bishops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Earls, Barons of the whole Kingdom. 2. That in the recital of this Tax, the Sheriff is told, first, that the Arch-bishops, Bishops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Clergy which had Land not belonging to their Churches (a certain sign that they granted by themselves, and out of nothing else, but that) and then that the Earls, Barons, Knights and Free men for themselves, and their Villains granted a thirtieth part of their moveables.</P>
<P>And from this Record it is also manifest, these <HI>Liberi Homines</HI> had <HI>Villa∣nos</HI> (if not Bondmen) Villagars or Rusticks, <HI>Colonos,</HI> or Husbandmen at least; of whose Estates by publick Assent, and for the publick benefit, they might in part dispose of; which <HI>Liberi Homines</HI> according to the Tenor of all our Records and Histories were Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>; and that the <HI>Villani</HI> mentioned in the other Record of 16. <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. to have given a fortieth part of their Moveables, did grant by their Lords; that is, their Lords Paramount, that were Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> did grant for them, though they held it not immediately of them, but of other Tenants in Military Service, which im∣mediately held of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who did charge them by publick Taxes, hath been shewn from divers Records: So that it was frequent in those times to say, such, and such, <HI>concesserunt,</HI> granted such a Taxe, that is, by those who had Power and Authority to do it for them; and without their consent too, when those for whom they granted were not capable of being Members of Parliament themselves. I could give you more Examples of the like Nature, but I will not tire you.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray Sir give me leave to answer this long speech, and to begin with your Interpretation of this word <HI>Fideles,</HI> First then, we are so far agreed, that the word <HI>Fideles</HI> had two, or three, different Significations. First, it signified all the Subjects in general; in the next place, all Vassals, or Feuda∣tary Tenants whatever, whether of the King, or any other Lord, as appears by the Passage you have cited out of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury,</HI> as also divers antient Charters, particularly those of King <HI>William</HI> I. and <HI>Maud</HI> the Empe∣ress, and King <HI>Stephen,</HI> which are divers of them directed, <HI>Fidelibus suis, Fran∣cis &amp; Angl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which cannot mean Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>; since the Doctor and your self will scarce allow any English Men to have then held Lands <HI>in Capite</HI> of the Crown. Lastly, I grant this word <HI>Fideles</HI> may sometimes signifie the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> of the King; all which being so, I think you cannot deny, that it
<PB N="451" REF="245"/>
is not the bare word, but the sense it bears in the Places where it is used, that must direct us to its true Signification, and that the <HI>fideles</HI> there mention∣ed to have granted Caruage in the 4<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. could not be the King's Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only, I have given you a sufficient reason which you do not think fit to answer, <HI>viz.</HI> That Caruage was a general Tax imposed upon all the Lands of the Kingdom, as well what was held by Knights Service, as what was not; and how your Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> could Tax those Lands which were never held by Knights Service, I desire you would resolve me. And therefore by the <HI>Fideles</HI> here mentioned in this, and many other Records, are not to be understood the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only, but all other Subjects who did Fealty; who, though they could not all appear in Person in our great Councils or Parliaments, yet were there by their Representatives the great Freeholders, Lords of Mannors, or else by the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses.</P>
<P>But I must now make some Remarks, upon your Interpretation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Writs of the 16<HI>th</HI> and 21<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. wherein you have certainly very much mistaken the sense of all the main Words. For in the first place, as for the <HI>Clerici terras habentes non ad Ecclesias pertinentes,</HI> which you interpret to have been <HI>Clerks having Mannors, and Military Fees not belonging to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enefices, but held of the King in Capite, seems to be altogether forced.</HI> For whoever heard of Clerks (that is inferior Clergy Men) Parsons, or Vi∣cars of Churches, who held Benefices of the King <HI>in Capite,</HI> and not in <HI>Franc Almoigne</HI>? or if they had any such, that therefore those Lands so held should be called, Lands not belonging to their Churches; for at this rate the Lands of Bishops, all Abbots, Priors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which held of the King <HI>in Capi∣te,</HI> would have been in your sense, Lands not belonging to the Church; but who but you and your Doctor ever gave such an unreasonable Comment on those words?</P>
<P>Nor will that Passage you cite out of <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> at all favour your Inter∣pretation; for either these Bishops and Prelates there mentioned, gave this sortieth part of their Moveables in Parliament, with the rest of the King∣dom, or else as Clergy men in Convocation: If the former, then these <HI>Cle∣rici</HI> could have no Votes there in Person; for I believe it would puzzle you to prove, that at this time any Ecclesiastical Person below the degree of an Abbot or Prior, had any place in Parliament, by reason of his Tenure by Knights Service <HI>in Capite,</HI> for those Lands he held in Right of his Church; but if you'll have this Tax to be granted by the whole Clergy in Convocati∣on, then such Clerks as you mention could not be there in Person: First, be∣cause they are said to be such as had Lands, <HI>qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ad Ecclesias suas non pertinent,</HI> and so could not have any place there as Clergy-men; nor could they be in∣cluded under the <HI>Praelati,</HI> since that word takes in none beneath the degree of a Dean. And therefore if these Clerks gave any thing in Parliament, they must do it by their lawful Representatives, the Knights of Shires; or if in Convocation, by their Clerks of the lower House, then called <HI>Procuratores Cleri</HI>: So that take it which way you will, those Clerks could not be present themselves at these Parliaments, when those Taxes of the 30th and 40th
<PB N="452" REF="246"/>
part of their Moveables were given to the King; and therefore either as Lay-men or Clergy-men, must be Taxed by their Representatives; but in deed the words <HI>Proceree Regni,</HI> which immediately come after <HI>Episcopi &amp; Pralati</HI> in <HI>Matth. Paris,</HI> sufficiently shews this grant was made in Parliament, that the word <HI>Proceres</HI> often includes, not only the Knights of Shires, but Citizens and Burgesses too, I have already proved, when I spoke of the various significations of that word. Nor is your Interpretation of <HI>Liberi homines,</HI> for Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who Taxed their <HI>Villani,</HI> any other than a meer wresting of these words; for, if they were only those who gave for themselves and their <HI>Villaines,</HI> whom you suppose were either their Bondmen, or else their Rusticks or Husbandmen, it is absolutely contrary both to Law and Reason; for whoever heard that Villains or Bondmen, who had no property either in Lands or Goods, ever payed Taxes? And if you suppose that these <HI>Villani</HI> were only the Rustick Tenants in Socage by Villain Service of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> then it is plain, that all the Military or Feudatory Tenants of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and all Tenants in Free Socage by certain Rent, were exempt from both these Taxes, since they are not so much as once mentioned in these Writs, nei∣ther can be comprehended under these <HI>Villani,</HI> as your self must acknowledge: For if these <HI>Villani</HI> were meer Rusticks, pray tell me what reason there was to put them check by Jole with their Lords, as they are in the Record of the 16th of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. as if they had given by themselves as well as the rest of the Freemen of the Kingdom: Or what reason is there why the Lords (as the words are in your Record) gave <HI>pro se &amp; suis Villanis,</HI> if the <HI>Liberi homines</HI> there men∣tioned, had not represented them; which could never have been said with any sense, had they been only so many Freemen, or Masters over their Slaves: where, as it here appeares, every one of these orders or degrees of Men here mentioned, had an equal independent Power to give for them∣selves, and not one for another: or else this word may be meant in a larger sense, as in the Record of the 16th of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. where they are put in the No∣minative Case (as equal to the rest of the Orders of men there recited) and so could not be Husbandmen, or meer Villagers, but the Inhabitants pof Ci∣ties and Burroughs, and which sense Sir <HI>Henry Spellman</HI> allows in his glossary; <HI>Villanus est qui i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Villa habitas ut Vrbanus ab Vrbe, &amp;c. Villa autem propria <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at Viculum Rusticanum▪ sed a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e more Gallici idiomatis eraducitur ad insignia oppi∣du, &amp; ad ipsas vrbes</HI>: but take it in what sense you please, it is plain, it could never here mean meer Villagers; nor could all your <HI>Liberi homines</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e only Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>; for then the Record would have concluded thus; <HI>&amp; Libe∣ri homines, qui de nobis tenent in Capite</HI>; as it is in the Record you have cited of the 10th of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. to the Sheriff of <HI>suffex,</HI> and may be found in many other Records, which respect only Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>: And for further proof of this sense of the word <HI>Villanus,</HI> we need go no farther than these very Re∣cords themselves, of the 16th and 21th of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. which you and I have now made use of; in both which Writs there are certain Persons appointed to Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss and Collect the Aids in every County, and who, by Vertue of these Writs, did cause to be Elected four of the best and most lawful Men, <HI>de singu∣lis Villis</HI> of each hundred in the Counties there mentioned; and then the <HI>Vil∣lani</HI>
<PB N="453" REF="246"/>
will signifie in these Writs, not Villaines or meer Rusticks who were not then reckoned <HI>inter L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>galea homines.</HI> And though 'tis true you have brought some Presidents to prove, that the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> gave Taxes for their Feudatary Tenants; yet that was only where the Tax was raised upon Knights Fees alone, and not upon all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands of the Kingdom in general, much less upon Goods and Chattels; so that either the <HI>Liberi Homi-nes</HI> mentioned in these Records, must mean all the Freemen of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> who by their Representatives gave these Taxes of a 40th or 30th pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t for themselves, and all such of their Tenants, who held Estates of Copy-hold Leases, for Years, or at Will, or had Estates in Stock, Money, or other Chattels; nor otherwise could these Taxes ever have been general, not charged upon moveable goods of the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>I have but one thing more to remark upon your Observations of this Writ, which is, that whereas you take notice that the King's Summons was directed to none of the Laity but the Earls and Barons of the Kingdom; and if so I desire you to prove to me, that your less Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were at all present at those Parliaments; for you have already granted that they were no Barons, and consequently could not be included under that Title; so that if these <HI>Liberi Homines</HI> who granted this Tax for themselves, and their Tenants, were not only Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> but their under Tenants also by Military Service; (as the Doctor himself grants in his Answer to <HI>Argumentum Antinormannicum.</HI>) <HI>p.</HI> 25. as also in his Glossary, <HI>p.</HI> 51. therefore unless you can prove that your <HI>Liberi homines</HI> were all Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> you will never make out that none but they, and the less Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> had a right under that Title, to appear at our great Councils or Parliaments; and to grant Aids, and joyn in the making of Laws for themselves, and the rest of he Nation, before the times you allow. To conclude, unless you can also prove that there was a Tenure <HI>in Capite</HI> of Goods and Chattels, as well as of Lands, it will appear by these Aids granted in Parliament of Personal Estates, that all Freemen or Free∣holders were alike Free, and consequently had the same right to appear in Parliament, either by themselves, or their Representatives.</P>

<P>But pray make out if you can, by some more evident Proofs, that any others besides Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> were admitted into our great Councils; and that these <HI>Liberi Homines</HI> were not Tenants <HI>in Capite.</HI></P>

<P>I think I need go no further than the first words of the Agreement between King <HI>Iohn</HI> and the Barons which is still extant on the close Rolls of the 17th of this King, (<HI>m.</HI> 2. <HI>dorso.</HI>) beginning thus, <HI>Has est conven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>io inter Dominum Iohannem Regem Angliae ex una parte, &amp; Robertum Filii Walteri, Ma∣rescalli exerci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Dei, &amp; sanctae Ecclesia Angliae, &amp; Ric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<PB N="454" REF="247"/>
the King and his Barons, and the Freemen of the Kingdom; which Assem∣bly <HI>Matt. Paris</HI> expresses more succinctly by these words, <HI>tota Nobilitus An∣gliae in unum collecta, quasi sub numero non cadebit</HI>; so that nothing can be plainer than that many other, besides your Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> appeared at this great Council.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, before I answer the main of your Argument, give me leave to tell you, That I cannot allow this Assembly at <HI>Runne Mead</HI> to have been truly a great Council of the Nation, but rather a Rebellious Armed Rout met together without the King's Writs of Summons, and indeed, whe∣ther he would or not; and I suppose you will not assert that any Representa∣tives had Votes therein; nor can you shew me that any Knights, Citizens or Burgesses were summoned to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant indeed that that Assembly was not properly a Parliament, I mean such as we have at this day, as not being called by the King's Writs; yet since almost all the Bishops, Earls, Barons, Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and all the rest of the Kingdom, were then in Arms, it may very well be reckon'd a Common Council or Solemn Convention of all the Freemen of the whole Nation, and that after the most antient manner; since all, or the greatest part of the Free∣holders of the Kingdom were there present in Parliament; and that this Council is look'd upon as a Parliament in the Eye of the Law, appears by a Writ to the Sheriff of <HI>Northampton-shire,</HI> which is found in the close Rolls in the 28th of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cl.</HI> 28. <HI>H.</HI> 3. <HI>M.</HI> 12. <HI>dorso.</HI></NOTE> to this Effect, <HI>That he should not permit any one in his Bailiwick to use any Liberties belonging to the Crown, unless they had formerly been used</HI> ad Tem∣pus Parliamenti de <HI>Runne Mead</HI>; quod fuit inter Dominum Johannem Regem Patrem nostrum▪ &amp; Barones suos Angliae.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see that you are forced to confess, that this Assembly was no Parlia∣ment in the sense we now take that word, nor indeed could be any more than a Rebellious Rout there met, whether the King would or no; and therefore the word Parliament is not to be understood in this Record, in the sense we now take it, since that word came not in use here (instead of <HI>Magnum Concilium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. p.</HI> 71.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; Commune Concilium &amp; Colloquium</HI> a Conferrence) until about the middle of <HI>Henry</HI> III. Reige, and doth no more point out the constituent Members of it, than that word did at that time: And so the meaning of the word <HI>Parliamentum</HI> is to be taken in this Record.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have very good reason, notwithstanding what you have now said to affirm, that this was a great Council or Parliament accoding to the Mode of those times; And tho I grant it was not called by the King's Writs, since it is certain he avoided calling any, because he utterly refused to grant this Charter at all, yet that is not material, since they, being a general and full Assembly, or Convention of all the Estates of the whole Nation, had a just right to meet and vindicate their Liberties then out-ragiously opprest, and trodden under foot by the King; and the King himself owned them as a lawful Assembly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.</HI> Matt. Pa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is</NOTE> by sending to them, and appointing them to meet in <HI>Runne Mead</HI> between

<HI>Staines,</HI> and <HI>Windsor</HI> on the 15<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Iune,</HI> which our Historians tell us, they joyfully obeyed, so that he himself admitted them to be a lawful Assem∣bly of Estates, and consequently for his Parliament as appears by the agree∣ment now cited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not much trouble my self,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.A.G. p.</HI> 159.</NOTE> whither this was pro∣perly the great Council or not: But however, I cannot see how Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> could make out, that this Charter was made by, or to all the Freemen of <HI>England</HI>; for it seems to me that there was not the least ground for it. For if under the words <HI>Liberi Homines,</HI> all the Freemen, or Free-Tenants of what condition soever, were comprehended; yet her is nothing in this Record that any way proves that they had any hand in mak∣ing this Charter, but the <HI>Liberi Homines,</HI> here were only those whom the King calls <HI>Liberi Homines Nostri</HI> in his Charter, and immediately grants them several Relaxations of their rigid Feudal Tenures, by which 'tis apparent, these <HI>Liberi Homines</HI> were the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and yet nei∣ther was the Charter made by them, as is before intimated; Tho I confess these were the Freemen which made such a Cry for their Liberties (most of which were but an Abatement of the Rigour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.</HI> G. <HI>pag.</HI> 51.</NOTE> and a Relaxation of the Feudal Tenures, as appears by the Charter it self) the rest were only Followers, and helped to augment the Noise, they were no Law-makers as you imagine; for 'tis not probable, that those Men that had the force of the Nation in their hands, would per∣mit Men of so small Reputation to share with them in Law-making: Those that had the Power of this, and other Nations <HI>de Facto,</HI> always did give Laws and Tax the People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Supposing this, (as I have already proved it,) to be a Lawful Common Council, or Parliament of the whole Kingdom, I think I may still affirm that this Charter was made, not only by the King, but by the Bishops, Earls, Barons, and all the Freemen of the Kingdom, who certainly gave their Assent to it by drawing it up into Form, and by accepting it from the King, when past under his Seal, as truely as the <HI>Magna Charta</HI>'s of King <HI>Hen.</HI> III. and <HI>Edw.</HI> I. are called Statutes for the same reason, as I have already proved to you, or as much as the Petition of Right granted by King <HI>Charles</HI> I. was a Statute, tho past under no other Form.</P>
<P>Nor were the <HI>Liberi Homines totius Regni</HI> to whom King <HI>Iohn</HI> granted this Charter, no other than the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> as you suppose since in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> II. this Kings Father, the word <HI>Liberi Homo</HI> was taken in a much larger sense, as appears by the Assize of Arms, ordained by this King (as it is recited in <HI>Hoveden</HI>'s History) where after it is appointed, what Corcelets, Helmets and other Arms, every Tenant <HI>in Capite</HI> should find, it immedi∣ately follows thus; <HI>Quicuncque liber Laicus habuerit in Catallo vel in redditu ad Valentiam</HI> 16. <HI>Marcarum habeat Loricam, &amp; Cassidem &amp; Clypeum &amp; Lanceam; Quicunque Liber Laicus habuerit in Catello ad Valentiam</HI> 10. <HI>Marcarum habeas Habergellum, &amp; Capelet Ferri, &amp; Lanceam: &amp; omnes Burgenses, &amp; tota Communia liberorum hominum habeant Wambais, &amp; Capelet fervi &amp; Lanceam▪</HI> Where you may observe, that every Freeman who was worth in Rent or Goods to the value of 16 Marks, was to find as much Arms for the Defence of the King∣dom
<PB N="456" REF="248"/>
as he that possessed a whole Knights Fee; and the meanest Townsman, and the whole Commonalty of Freemen (for so I translate the Words, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Libe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orum hominum</HI>) were to find a Caplet or Head piece of Iron, be∣sides other Weapons. And the 2d. Article of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter says ex∣presly, <HI>Concessimus etiam &amp; omnibut Liberis Hominibus Nostris Regui Anglia, pro Nobis &amp; Hae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elibus Nostris in perpetuum omnes Liberates subscriptas, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣das &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enandas eis, &amp; haeredibus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uit de Nobia &amp; H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rodibus nostris</HI>: Which the Dr. himself renders thus. We have also granted <HI>to all our Freemen of the Kingdom of</HI> England, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And sure then this Charter could not be made to none but Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> unless you will suppose that none but they were Freemen, and all the rest Slaves.</P>
<P>Nor was this Charter only made to relax the severity of the Feudal Te∣nures as you suppose, since there are divers other Clauses in it which con∣cern all the rest of the Freemen, and Free holders in <HI>England</HI> as well as they, for besides the first and second Chapters of this Charter, which grants and confirms to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and to all the Freemen of the Na∣tion their Rights, and Liberties; If you please better to consider it, you will find, that there are several other Chapters in this Charter, which all other Freemen, as well as the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> have thereby an Inte∣rest in, as you may see by the 10, 11, 12 13. 15, 16. 22, 23, 24, 25. and above 30 other Chapters, or Clauses therein exprest which are granted, not to Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> alone, but either to Ecclesiasticks, or other Lay Free∣men of the whole Kingdom. But to prove this a little further, I shall give you but one or two instances out of this <HI>Magna Charta</HI>; and that too in the Drs. own Translation, Article 48.
<Q>No Freman shall be taken or imprisoned or disseised of his Free Tenement, or Liberties, or Free Customs, or Out-Lawed, or Banished, or any ways d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stroyed, nor will we pass upon him, or commit him to Prison, unless by the Legal Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land (<HI>i. e.</HI> by Legal Process.) The other is the 49. Article of this Charter, that we will not sell to any Man, we will not deny any ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or delay Right or Justice:</Q>
Now Judge your self, whether these two Articles were made to the Tenents <HI>in Capite</HI> alone, or to all the Freemen of the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>And hence it also plainly appears that the same Body of Freemen to whom this Charter was made, were likewise present and gave their Assents to the making of it: Nor were Vavasors, or Fendatary Ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts of the Bishops, Abbots, great Lords and other Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> Persons so inconsiderable as you would make them, that they only should come hither, but as followers, to augment the Noise, since I have already proved from <HI>Bracton,</HI> that there were divers of them, Men of great Estates, and Power in their Countries, besides the Tenants of those Abbots and Priors who (as I have already mentioned) did not hold <HI>in Capite</HI> of the King at all, and yet made a great Part of the King∣dom, besides Tenants in <HI>Pety<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Serjeanty,</HI> and those that held of great Ho∣nours, who could never be represented by the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> at all. And therefore I must (notwithstanding what you affirm to the contrary) look up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on all these Persons, for as good Law-makers as the greatest Lords or T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nants
<PB N="457" REF="248"/>
<HI>in Capite</HI> of them all; since the main force of the Nation did not lye in them, but in their Feudatary Tenants, who would never have followed their Lords in this Assembly, if they had not look'd upon themselve as having as good an interest in the Rights and Liberties they demanded (as appears by this <HI>Silvo</HI> of all their Liberties) as their Lords themselves; and also as good a Right as they in giving their Assent to them, when they were to be pass'd into a Law, as they were by this Charter; since these Feudatary Tenants were not at all obliged by their Tenure to obey their Lords Summons at any other Warlike expeditions, but where the King, or his Lieutenants went out in Person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very well satisfied, that this could be no Parliament for the reasons already given, and tho I grant that these Charters were made to, and in the Presence of the greatest part of the Clergy, Earls, Barons, and Freemen of the Kingdom; yet this proves not that they had any Vote, or Suffrage in making of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. l. p.</HI> 167.</NOTE> nor indeed could they, for the great Charters were only the Petitions of the People drawn into the Form of a Charter, and passed under the King's Seal, as his meer voluntary Free Grants and Concessions, without any Votes or Authority from the People: And therefore the great Charters of <HI>Henry</HI> III. recites them to have bin made of his meer <HI>Grace and Free Will,</HI> as it is in the Pre∣face to it. But pray answer me a few plain Questions concerning King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter; which if you can resolve, I may be inclined to believe there might be some other great Council besides that of Tenants <HI>in Capite.</HI> The first is, if this Common Council of Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> were for As∣sessing of Aids and Escuage only (as you suppose it is pro∣vided by the last Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use of this Charter) why was the Cause of the Meeting to be declared in every Writ of Summons to the great Barons and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will give you an answer to this Question immediatly, but before I do it, let me tell you that you are much mistaken, in saying, that the great Charters (because they were the Kings Free Concessions) were therefore pas∣sed without any Votes, Suffrages, or Authority of the People of <HI>England</HI>: Since I have already proved in our discourse concerning the <HI>legis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tive</HI> Power, that the matter of those Charters was no more then an affirmative of the Common Law of <HI>England</HI> long before your Conquest; and that the Peoples consent, and Suffrage was sufficiently given in their drawing them up; and offering them to the King to be Sealed, and accepting them from him when he had done it: And therefore that the great Charters are always called Sta∣tutes in our Ancient Records and A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of Parliament. But to answer your Question, I suppose that the King, besides the ordinary business of their As∣sessing Escuage had often other affairs of great moment to be transacted with, and Communicated to his Bishops, great Lords, and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> in which the rest of the Kingdom were not at all concern'd, such as giving the King their Advice, as a great Council, concerning divers weighty Affairs (as
<PB N="458" REF="249"/>
in the business of <HI>Sicily,</HI> mentioned in the first Record I have cited)as also about undertaking Forraign Wars against <HI>France, Scotland, Wales,</HI> &amp;c. in which they were bound to follow, and assist him together with their under-Tenants according to their respective Tenures, and therefore it was but rea∣son that they should have timely notice that they might give their advice in it, as also that they might either come, or stay away, according to the greatness or urgency of the occasion, and might also give their Under-Tenants notice to provide themselves with Horses and Arms, and all things necessary in case a War should be agreed on, which I think are sufficient reasons for thus expressing the Causes of their Meeting in the Writs of Summons.</P>

<P>Admit this were so, (which I shall yet take further time to consider of) pray tell me in the next place, if all your inferiour Barons, Vavasors, or Lords of Manours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> supposing them either to have appeared in Person, or else as chosen for Knights of Shires, or else as Citizens and Burgesses, who were the Members of the great Council of the Nation; I pray tell me why there should not have been the same care taken, that they might be also Sum∣moned as well as the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>; certainly they came not to them by instinct, nor is it scarce probable that they would leave their Country busine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to Travel from one remote part of <HI>England</HI> to another, to these great Coun∣cils, which seldom continued above three or four days, if they had had a Right so to do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall answer you in few words, because it was not at all necessary to express that Clause you mention for them all: Since it was sufficient therein to follow the old Course of Summoning the Common Council of the King∣dom; for doing which it had always been the Custom to give sufficient No∣tice by Writs of Summons of their Meetings, whereas in this Council of Te∣nants <HI>in Capite,</HI> Since there was by this Charter some al∣teration in the manner of their Summoning,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. p.</HI> 68.</NOTE> so there was al∣so for expressing the cause of their Meeting: For whereas be∣fore that (as the Dr. himself allows) all the Lesser Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> had par∣ticular Letters or Writs of Summons expressing the Cause of their Meeting, they were for the future to be Summoned by general Writs directed to the Sheriffs, and therefore it was but reason, that there should be a particular Clause reserved for their general Summoning, which there was no need of in those Writs that were Issued for the summoning therest of the People, or Com∣mons to the great Council or Parliament, as I doubt not but it would appear, in case we had those Writs to produce, in which likewise there was anciently often exprest the particular cause of their Meeting, as there was, for instance, in those famous Writs to the Lords and Commons of the 49. <HI>Hen.</HI> III.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.</HI> 137.</NOTE> which the Dr. hath given us in his answer to Mr. <HI>P.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have still a greater objection behind than either of the former. You cannot deny, but that by the first clause of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter (which I have made use of) all Aids, and Escuages, were to be im∣posed by the Common Council of the Kingdom; and <HI>Littleton</HI> himself tells us, in the second Book of his Tenures, <HI>That Escuage is always to be Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed by Par∣liament upon those that failed to do their Services after the Expedition was ended.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="459" REF="249"/>Now if this had not been a Right Inherent to the Great, or Common Council of the Kingdom, but that the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> alone assessed it in King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s time; how came they to lose that Priviledge, and the great Council of the Kingdom, or Parliament to get it, if the former had not been the only great Council at the first?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope to give you as satisfactory an answer to this, as I have to the rest of your Demands. This alteration might have fallen out two ways, either according to <HI>Camdens</HI> old Manuscript Author, cited in his Intro∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction to his <HI>Britania</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 122.</NOTE> the Summ of which is, that when King <HI>Henry</HI> III. after his great Wars with <HI>Sim. Momford,</HI> and the Barons had Ruined many of them, he out of so great a Multitude which was before Seditious and Turbulent, called the best and chiefest of them, only by Writ to Parliament, who after that time became Barons by Writ, and not by Tenure as they were before. And as for the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sser sort of them, called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ones Minores,</HI> they might be wholly resolv'd into the Body of the Commons, or ordinary sort of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree-holders, and the King being fearful of any farther encrease of Power in these Barons and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> might no more desire their Company at the usual Feasts of the Year, whither before they used to come <HI>ex more,</HI> and so their Power fell of course to the Council or Parliament, of which, before, they only made a part.</P>
<P>Or else it might happen from the negligence of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> them∣selves, who growing weary of their Attendance might neglect to come to those Councils, because of the great trouble and charge of those Journeys; and the King being as willing to dispense with their Presence, this Court was lost by Non-usage; and so the judicial part of it remained in the House of Peers, and that of Assessing Escuage, and advising and giving Aids in matters of War, fell wholly to the great Council of the Kingdom, of which these Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> by their being capable of being Elected Knights of Shires, soon became the Principal Members.</P>
<P>But, admit I should take this Council for Assessing Escuages for the Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on Council of the Kingdom; pray give me leave to ask you one or two Questions likewise in my turn. Pray tell me therefore, if this Council had been such as you would have it, to what purpose is there a full Stop in all the old Coppies, at the end of this Clause, <HI>&amp; ad babendum Commune Concilium leg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l de Scutagiis assidendis ali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er quam in tribus Casibus praelictis,</HI> and why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould the next Clause begin with, <HI>&amp; de Scutagiis assidendis submoneri faci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if they had been both one and the same Councils. Since it had been easier to put it all under one Clause, If the matters ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Treated of had been the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>?</P>
<P>In the next place, pray tell me if this were the great Council of the King∣dom or Parliament as it is now called; why are there no other Rights or Pri∣viledges reserved to this Council, but this of Assesing Escuage? Were not the Powers of granting other Taxes (which could not be included under the word Escuages▪) and also of giving their Assent to Laws, things of as great (say greater) moment than this of Assessing Escuage?</P>
</SP>

<PB N="460" REF="250"/>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall give you as short and satisfactory an answer as I can to those Queries. In the first place, I will not deny, but that both the Clauses you mention might have been contracted into one, supposing them to be read without any full stop between them, as Sir <HI>H. Spellman</HI> in his Glossary sup∣poses them to be. But what is this to the purpose? Must these therefore be two distinct Councils, because the Charter it self words them a little more loosely than it needed to have done? And as for your next Query, there was no need of inserting any Clause to this Charter of reserving or conferring any Power to this Common Council, of granting Taxes and giving their Assent to Laws, because they were things which at that time they had no reason to com∣plain of, since we do not read that King <HI>Iohn</HI> (as Arbitrary as he was) ever took upon him to make any new Laws without their consents; and besides, it was implicitly reserved to them by the last Clause of this Charter, <HI>viz. Saving to the Arch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bishops, Bishops,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Earls, Barons, Knights, and all others,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>the Liberties and Free Customs which they had before.</HI> So that there was no need of any other Clause than this, because it had been, not only the Custom, but the Law of the Kingdom, for the King to lay Taxes, and Assess Escuage up∣on the Nation without the Consent, or Assistance of this great Council, which grew now so great a grievance, that they would not be contented, untill the King by this Charter had renounced it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not now trouble my self or you, to confute this mistake of yours; That the Kings of <HI>England</HI> could legally raise Taxes upon all their Sub∣jects without consent of their great Council, or that they ever exercised such a Prerogative, unless it were in the violent Reigns of the Two <HI>Williams,</HI> and then if it was ever done, it was only upon their <HI>English,</HI> and not their <HI>Nor∣man</HI> Subjects; the latter being exempt from it by the very <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of King <HI>William</HI> I. by your own confession: Nor would they, I believe, have born it at his hands; but I shall speak more particularly of this another time. Only pray give me leave to ask you this one Question? If this Charter of King <HI>Iohn</HI> had been intended as a constant standing Rule or Form, not only for this, but all succeeding Common Councils or Parliaments, what could be the reason that this Clause you so much insist upon, of Summoning all the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> should be omitted in the great Charter of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. granted In the 2d. Year of his Reign, and but Three Years after the 17. of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> (when these Charters were first granted) as also when it was again confirmed in the 9th. of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. For can any one of sense imagine, that so material a Clause as this, and so express for the Rights and Priviledges of the whole Body of Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> as the sole Representatives of the whole Nation could have been omitted, had they alone in those times constituted the com∣mon great Council of the whole Kingdom? How comes it to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that in all the Records of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. Reign, wherein this Charter is mentioned; It is always recited <HI>Magna Charta Nostra,</HI> viz. his own Charter, without taking notice of his Fathers? I should be glad to receive a satisfactory answer to this Question from your self or any other intelligent Person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I may give you a satisfactory answer to this Scruple, which I think may be thus satisfied; I conceive that the first great Charter we have,
<PB N="461" REF="250"/>
which is commoly attributed to <HI>Henry</HI> III. and stiled his Charter in our Sta∣tute-Books was properly the Charters of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. or perhaps, rather his Ex∣plication or Enlargement of those Charters of King <HI>Iohn</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> III. For we find not the great Charter, either of that or King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s, in any of the Rolls, until the 25th. of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. and he had a greater Summ of Money for confirming this Charter than <HI>Henry</HI> III. had. Now in this Charter then confirmed, there is no Provision made for any Summons to great Councils or Parliaments, and the reason may well be, because the constitution of great Councils or Parliaments was lately changed, from what it was in the beginning of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s time, and till the 49. of <HI>Henry</HI> III. nor perhaps was it so fixed and peremptorily resolved on at this time, what it should exactly be for the future, as to have it made an Article of the Charter, and to this conjecture the frequent variations of Summons to Parliaments in those times do give a probable confirmation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not at all satisfied with this supposition of yours. For I doubt not but to prove that it is altogether vain, and grounded upon no good Authori∣ties, either from History or Records, but I shall shew you before I have done, that the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> which we have still upon Record, by <HI>Inspeximus</HI> of <HI>Edw.</HI> I is the very same, word for word, in all the material parts of it, with that of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. both of the 2d. and 9th. Year of his Reign, and that there was no alteration at all made as to the manner of it, a Summoning or chusing Members of Parliaments from the beginning of this Kings Reign to the very end of it: Nor yet in the time of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. as you suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should not be displeased to see that proved, though I think I am able to shew you the contrary. But before we proceed to that, I must needs tell you, I am not yet satisfied, that there ever were anciently two Councils, one of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and the other, of the whole Kingdom; for methinks not only your self, but Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI> and Mr. <HI>Atwood</HI> his second have fallen very short of their proofs they have brought in this point; and there is nothing in the Drs. whole answer to them, in which (in my opinion) he hath obtained a clearer Victory, therefore pray give me some better proofs of this distincti∣on, if you have any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not imagin I should have needed to have spoken any further up∣on that head; yet since you now require it, I shall obey your commands: Since therefore you tell me that the times before your Conquest are obscure, and the Authorities uncertain; I will give you a short History of these Councils, beginning with King <HI>William</HI> I and so going down as low as <HI>Henry</HI> III. So f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r then we are agreed; that the Council of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> met <HI>ex more</HI> at the great Feasts of the Year; and that they also granted the King Aids, or Subsidies to be Levyed upon themselves alone; as I grant, appears by the Writ of 19th. of <HI>Henry</HI> III. which you have but now cited, directed to the Sheriff of <HI>Sussex.</HI></P>
<P>But that this Council which was thus held <HI>ex more,</HI> was also often Summon∣ed to meet at other times when the Kings occasions required it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Claus. M.</HI> 7. <HI>dorso.</HI></NOTE> it also as certain as appears by this Writ of the 26. of the same King, which I shall read to you, <HI>Rex Vice-comiti</HI> Nor∣thampton,
<PB N="462" REF="251"/>
<HI>&amp;c. Praecipimus tibi sicut alias praecipimus, quod Summoniri facier Archiepiscopos, Episcopos, Comites, Barones, Abbates, Priores, Milites, &amp; libe∣ros homines qui de nobis Tenent</HI> in Capite <HI>eodem modo scribitur omnibus Vice-comi∣tibus Angliae</HI>: Which Writ extending only to those who held <HI>in Capite</HI> could never be a Summons to the Common Council of the whole Kingdom; for then this restriction had bin needless, <HI>qui de nobis Tenent</HI> in Capite, and it would have been known who had a right to come to this Council, if these words had not bin inserted, so that this seems to me to make a plain distinction be∣tween these <HI>Liberos homines qui de nobis Tenent</HI> in Capite, and the rest of the Freemen of the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>But when <HI>Eadmerus</HI> and other ancient Historians mention the great or Com∣mon Council of the whole Kingdom (afterwards called the Parliament,) then their expressions are more general and comprehensive; for proof of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lately Publish∣ed at</HI> Oxford, 1692. <HI>in Sax∣on and Latin.</HI> p. 186. <HI>in the Printed Copy.</HI></NOTE> pray consult the Old <HI>English</HI> Saxon Annals, continued down to the time of <HI>Henry</HI> I. wherein <HI>Anno. Dom.</HI> 1085. (being the last Year of <HI>William</HI> I.) there is a remak∣able passage which I shall here give you in <HI>English</HI>;,
<Q>At <HI>Chri∣stmas,</HI> the King (<HI>viz. William</HI> I.) was at <HI>Gloucester</HI> with his Nobles, and there held his <HI>Curia</HI> or Court (in <HI>Saxon</HI> (his <HI>Hired</HI>) Five days; and immediately after it follows thus:) After this he held a great Council [in <HI>Saxon, Mycel Getheat</HI>] where he had many great Discourses with the Nobles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
Now it seems plain to me, that this Court (here called his <HI>Hired</HI>) could not be the great Council of the King∣dom; for to what purpose should it meet again so quickly, if it had the great Council of the whole Kingdom? or, why are they here called by different Ti∣tles, the one his <HI>Hired</HI> or Court, and the other the <HI>Mycel Gathea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Vol. f.</HI> 451.</NOTE> the great Council; which is also called <HI>commune Con∣cilium totius Regni,</HI> in Sir <HI>Henry Spellmans</HI> Councils in this ve∣ry Year.</P>
<P>And to shew you more plainly the difference between this great Council of the whole Kingdom, and the lesser Council of the Kings Barons and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>: Pray see <HI>Eadmerus,</HI> who relating what was done in a great Council held at <HI>Easter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>f.</HI> 58.</NOTE> immediately before the Invasion of <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> in the 2d. Year of <HI>Henry</HI> I. says, there met <HI>tota Angliae Nobilitas, cum Populi numerositate,</HI> and then Arch-bishop <HI>Anselm</HI> engaged for the King that he should Govern the Kingdom according to the just Laws thereof, where you see, that besides the Noble men and Gentlemen here called, <HI>Regni Nobilitas</HI>; there was also a great number of the Commons here termed in the Barbarous <HI>Latin</HI> of that Age, <HI>Populi numerositas.</HI></P>
<P>But when the King held his <HI>Curia</HI> of the great Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> alone, the expressions are more particular, as may appear by many Charters of our first <HI>Norman</HI> Kings to several Abbeys of their own Foundation, which are said to be made <HI>Consilio, &amp; Assensu Baronum nostrorum tam presulum quam Laicorum,</HI> as you will (for example) find it in the Charter of <HI>Hen.</HI> I. to the Ab∣by of <HI>Abington</HI>; as it is exemplifyed in the ancient Manuscript Register of
<PB N="463" REF="251"/>
that Abbey now in the <HI>Cottonian</HI> Library, in which Book you will find more of the like Nature, which plainly make out this difference between this less Council of the Kings Barons and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and the great Council of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>And for further proof of this, pay see the Instrument of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s re∣signation of his Crown to the Pope, as you will find it at the end of Dr. <HI>B's.</HI> compleat History: which is recited to have been done <HI>Communi Concilio Baronum
No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um,</HI> that is, by the Common Council of the Kings Barons and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who were all there present in Arms against the Landing of the <HI>French</HI> King then expected. And yet this was never looked upon to have been done <HI>per Commune Concilium Ragni,</HI> since this Resignation was declared void by the Bishops, Lords and Commons in full Parliament in the 40th. of <HI>Edward</HI> III. because done <HI>sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z lour Assent</HI> as it is in the Parliament Roll of that Year.</P>
<P>But when ever the whole great Council, or Parliament was summoned to assemble, then this lesser Council of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> must needs meet also, as being a principal part of it. And then the expressions were more comprehensive, as I have already noted; and our ancient Historians do in my Opinion, by their Expressions, plainly signifie an Union of both these Councils, to make up the Common-Council of the Kingdom; as appears by the Letters which the Priory of <HI>Canterbury</HI> wrote to the Pope upon the Election of <HI>Ralph,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> in the 14th of <HI>Hen.</HI> 1. to the See of <HI>Cantebury,</HI> as you will find them in <HI>Eadmerus,</HI> (<HI>Lib.</HI> 5. <HI>fol.</HI> 111.) and which is there said to have been made <HI>adunato conventu totius Angliae</HI>; that is, in the united Assembly of all <HI>England, viz.</HI> the <HI>Episcopi, Abbates &amp; Principes Regni, &amp; itgens Populi Multitudo.</HI> So likewise <HI>Hovelen</HI> in his History. (<HI>fol.</HI> 273.) <HI>An∣u</HI> 1121 (being the 18th of <HI>Hen.</HI> 1.) relates the Kings Marriage with the Lady <HI>Adeliza,</HI> Daughter to the Duke of <HI>Lovain,</HI> to have been celebrated at <HI>Windsor, adunato Concilio totius Regni, i. e.</HI> in the united Council of the whole Kingdom.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not yet satisfied with your proofs; and I doubt not but to shew you that this distinction of your Friends, Mr. <HI>P.</HI> and Mr. <HI>A.</HI> his second, be∣tween the Common Council of the Kingdom, and the Council of the great Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> will prove but a meer <HI>Chymra</HI> of those Gentle∣men, from whom you have borrowed it; for there was indeed but one Com∣mon Council of the Kingdom in those times, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Bishops, Earls, Barons, and other Tenants <HI>in Capite.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore in answer to your first Authority from the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle, I shall shew you another of the same King's Reign, which will shew the diffe∣rent expressions of this great Council by <HI>Hired,</HI> and <HI>Mycel Getheat,</HI> to have been the particular Fancy of that Monkish Writer, and it is from <HI>Gervas Do∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bornensis, de Actis Pontisicum Cantuarens.

Mariae,</HI> where you may see that this confirmation of the Arch-bishop was made in the great Council of the Kingdom which is here called collectively or altogether (and not one part of it only <HI>Curia Regis.</HI>) As for the words which make up the constituent parts of this Council, we have sufficiently de∣bated them; and therefore I need say nothing more concerning them.</P>
<P>But tho the Dr. has given us more Authorities to prove this,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 125.</NOTE> yet I shall make use of but one more from <HI>Badmerus</HI> it is in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> I. thus, in <HI>subsequenti Nativitate Dom.

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already answered that Objection; and granting it might be so, it does not prove it was so: But I desire you to tell me what you can say to this expression in the Authority I have now made use of from <HI>Eadmerus.

So that your small Criticism upon the Words <HI>adunato Conventu</HI> or <HI>Concilio,</HI> as if they signified this Uni∣on or Conjunction of two Councils into one, is but a meer Pancy of your Authors, those words signifying no more than a gathering or meeting toge∣ther of all the Persons that constituted that Assembly, as appears by these words in <HI>Eadmerus, Adlinatis</HI> (without either <HI>Praecepto</HI> or <HI>Sancti∣one Regis</HI>) <HI>ad Curiam e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us in pascha Terrae Principibus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 90.</NOTE> i. e. the chief Men of the Nation being at his Court at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aster.</HI></P>
<P>But as for your main instance of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Resigning his Crown to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope in a Common Council of the great Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> but not of the Common Council of the Kingdom, I confess it were very considerable if it were true, for tho I grant that in all the Charters of this Kings resig∣nation, the words you mention, <HI>viz.

First it appears by all our Historians, that King <HI>Iohn</HI> had just before Summoned all the Earls, Barons, Knights and Free∣men of the Kingdom, whoever they were, and of whomsoever they held, to appear in Arms, which made so vast an Army, that after all the ordinary Rabble were sent home; <HI>Matt. Parls</HI> tells us, that the Knights, Esquires and Freemen that stayed behind, made an Army of 60 Thousand Men, who were Encamped at <HI>Barham Down,</HI> not far from <HI>Dover,</HI> where this resignation was Executed: So that this being almost as great a Meeting as that at <HI>Runne Mead,</HI> not long after, the King might very well have Summoned at least a great Council of all his Tenants, <HI>in Capite,</HI> to countenance this resignation, and that he did do so, the Charter it self says expresly; which had it been other∣wise, would have appeared a notorious Lye to the whole World. Nor do your Objections to the contrary prove considerable. First, you say this was only a Military Summons, and not to a Common Council, yet such a one as was constituted by this Kings Charter, which sure could not be at this time, when that Charter was not yet made till the Year after, before which, you grant, that the great Councils might have met without the 40 days Summons, expres∣sing the cause of their Meeting; and if they could meet <HI>ex more,</HI> as you grant this Council did at the great Feasts of the Year, without any Summons at all, sure they might as well meet now on such an exigency: The King had, 'tis true, Summoned them at first upon another occasion; but say you, there was so small a number of Barons at this Meeting, that it could not be a Common Council of the Kingdom, neither do I say it was, but the contrary; but how does it appear it was not? Why say you, Five of the Bishops were then fled into <HI>France,</HI> and a great many of the Barons of their Party. The latter is not true in Fact: few or none of the Barons siding with these Bishops but as for the Bishops, what if Five were absent? Were there not enough left to have made a Common Council of the rest of the Tenants <HI>in Capite?</HI> Well, but there were but Two Bishops present, and Seven Earls, and Three Barons, as ap∣Pears
<PB REF="253"/>
by their Names at the end of this Charter, without any mention of more, or of the whole Communities being there; a special reason, as if no more could be present at this Assembly than whose Names are to it; by this Rule the great Charters of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> and 9<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. were not made in a great Council of the whole Kingdom; for there are no Witnesses Names expressed at the end of them; it is true at the beginning of these Charters it is said they were done by the Council of certain Bishops, Earls and Barons, which yet were but a very few more of all sorts then there are mentioned at the end of this Charter of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Resignation: So that this appearance of the Bishops, Earls, Barons and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> is meerly precarious; for if more might very well have been there, it is most certain they were, notwith∣standing the paucity of the Witnesses to this Charter, since those were added only for form sake, and were commonly those who were nearest the Throne when the Seal was put to it.</P>
<P>I confess your first Objection is more material from <HI>Eadmerus,</HI> of the whole Kingdoms meeting the King at <HI>Christmass ex more,</HI> without any Summons mentioned▪ to which it may be reply'd, that there might be a Summons to the whole Kingdom to meet, as well as to the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>; and this happening at <HI>Christmass,</HI> one of the usual times of their meeting, this Author might apply the Title of this Court to the Council of the whole Kingdom: And that this was so, will appear from an <HI>Anonymous</HI> Author, who wrote in <HI>H.</HI> 1. his time, published by Mr. <HI>Sylas Taylor,</HI> in his History of <HI>Gravel-kind,</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 194,) who relates this Election of Arch-bishop <HI>Lanfranc</HI> to have been made <HI>Communi Consensu &amp; Consilio omnium Baronum suorum, omniumque Episcoporum, &amp; Abbetum tostusque Populi,</HI> which certainly must mean somewhat more than your Council of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> alone.</P>
<P>And this also is confirmed by <HI>Matt. Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> who has been so careful, as to mention a Summons to a great Council immediately after the holding of the <HI>Curie</HI> of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> at <HI>Christmass</HI>; the words are thus: <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1237, i. e. the 21th of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. <HI>senuts Rex curiam suam ad natale apud Win<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, autem continuo per omnes fines Angliae Scripta Regalia praecipiens omnibus ad Regnum spectantibus, Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, Abbatibus, Prioribus, Comiti∣bus &amp; Baronibus, ut omnes in octabis Epiphaniae Londentis convenirent.</HI> Now pray tell me if this <HI>Curia</HI> held <HI>ex more</HI> at <HI>Christmass,</HI> had been the great Council of the whole Kingdom, consisting of the Arch-bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Earle and Barons, and other Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> to what purpose should the King <HI>coptinus</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> immediately) issue out his Writs for summoning the very same Persons to meet him at <HI>London</HI> on the <HI>octave</HI> of St. <HI>Hillary,</HI> when they were then all with the King at <HI>Winchester,</HI> and that he might have communi∣cated what he had pleased to them.</P>
<P>Or what have you to say to the <HI>Curia,</HI> or Common Council held before, in the Ninth of this King, but Eleven years after King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> when the great Charters were confirmed, and an Aid granted by the whole Kingdom, which <HI>Matt.

Populo cum Magnatibus Regionis,</HI> which words (as I have already urged) must comprehend some other Persons then your Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> alone; other∣wise the word <HI>Populus</HI> had been altogether in vain: so that you see the Com∣mon Council of the whole Kingdom was often held at the same time with the ordinary <HI>Curia,</HI> and is by way of Excellency, called by the same name as we at this day call the great Council of the Kingdom, the High Court of Parlia∣ment; and <HI>Curia</HI> and Court differ no more then a Latin Name from an English, which is likewise very well confirmed and explained in the Chroni∣cle of <HI>Walter</HI> of <HI>Civentry</HI> (to be found indivers private hands) who lived in the Reigns of King <HI>Iohn</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> 3. and speaking of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Council or Parliament (which though it might begin at <HI>Christmas</HI> with the <HI>Curia,</HI> yet it seems held on till <HI>Candlemass</HI>) when the Commons were joyned to it.

<P>I confess these Authorities you have now brought carry some colour of in Argument, but if they are lookt into, will signifie little: to begin with your first quotation from <HI>Matt. Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> suppose I grant that there was a <HI>Curia <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more</HI> held at <HI>Westminster,</HI> at which there then appear'd at Court only a small number of the Bishops, Lords, and great Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>; but the King not finding them enough for the great Affairs he had then to communi∣cate to them, immediately issued out his Royal Writs to all the Orders of men there mentioned to appear at <HI>London</HI> on the <HI>octave</HI> of St. <HI>Hillary</HI>; but how can you affirm there were any Commons then summoned in the sense in which they are now taken, the Barons being the lowest Order here expresly menti∣oned: but if you would but have read the words that immediately follow in its place you have now cited, you would easily see that your Knights of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and Burgesses could not then be there; the words are these, <HI>venti i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Sancti Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arii Londoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s insini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bilium multitulo</HI>; how could these representatives of the Commons have been elected and returned in so short a time as between <HI>Christmass,</HI> and eight days after <HI>Twelfth-ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>; so that there
<PB N="468" REF="254"/>
could have been scarce three Weeks time from the date of the Writs present∣ly after <HI>Chistmass-day</HI>▪ to the meeting of the Parliament; but the truth is, by this <HI>infinita Nobilium multitudo,</HI> who are here said to have come to <HI>London,</HI> is to be understood the great number of the smaller Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who all appeared at this Council according to King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter: Whereas your Knights of Shires, Citizens and Burgesses, if they had all come at that time, could not be called <HI>infinita Nobilium multitudo,</HI> as not consisting at this day of 600 Persons; and sure would have been fewer then. But as for your other Authorities, if this be true I have now laid down, they will be as easily an∣swered, since by the word <HI>Populus</HI> put before, and distinct from the <HI>Magnates</HI> in the passage you have now quoted from <HI>Mat. Paria</HI>; these smaller Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> are to be understood; and by <HI>Magnates</HI> the Bishops and great Lords; and this also explains the like Phrase you now cite from <HI>Walter</HI> of <HI>Coventry</HI>; where by <HI>Proceres &amp; Populus</HI> are to be understood the same orders of Men as by <HI>Magnates &amp; Populus</HI> in <HI>Mat.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have now put a very fair gloss upon these Places I have now made use of; but 'tis an hundred pitties that such a fine Hypothesis should have no better proofs than your bare Surmises to support it; for that is all the Authority that I can see you bring for your sense of this word <HI>Populus</HI> for the smaller Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and not for the rest of the People; but I see no good Authority as yet brought by you to prove it, except that clause in King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter, which if as I have lately shewed you, it will beat a quite different Interpretation, all that you have said upon that head will sig∣nifie nothing; therefore as for the main Argument you raise from the words <HI>infinita multitudo nobi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ium</HI> in <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> that they could not be the Knights of Shires, together with the Citizens and Burgesses, because they could not be such an infinite Multitude as this Author here mentions to have me; at <HI>London</HI>; as also because of the shortness of the time of the Summons: If these are material Objections against our Opinion, so it will be likewise against yours; for how could this be a great Council according to King <HI>John</HI>'s Char∣ter, which expresly provides for Forty days Summons for the Tenants <HI>in Ca∣pite</HI> to come to this Assembly; and if so be, this usage was broken at this time upon some urgent occasion in respect of them, it might be so also as to all the rest of the Kingdom, for the <HI>Knights</HI> of Shires might be chosen at the next Country-court, and their Names returned immediately before, or together with their meeting at <HI>London</HI>; and as to the Citizens and Burgesses, it was yet more easie for them to be chosen and returned in three Weeks time, since every body knows the Cities might have called Common Councils; and the Towns and Burroughs by the notice of their proper Officers to whom the Writs were delivered, might have assembled at their common Halls or Town-hou∣ses, immediately upon the receipt of the Writs; and these, together with the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses joyn with the great Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> made up the <HI>infinita Nobilium multitudo,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Mat. Paria.</HI></P>
<P>But your main Objection I confess is behind, how these Representatives of the Commons here called <HI>infinita Nobilium multitudo,</HI> could be the Knights,
<PB N="469" REF="254"/>
Citizens and Burgesses, whose number could not be at that time above 500 Persons: As for this, pray consider if the difficulty will not bear as hard up∣on you; for if your Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> made such a vaft multitude, all those difficulties will arise that you press me with upon my Hypothesis of the meet∣ing of all the chief Free-holders or Lords of Manors in <HI>England</HI> in Parlia∣ment, before Knights of Shires were introduced in the room of them, <HI>viz.</HI> How it was possible for so great a multitude to debate, vote, or do any bu∣siness; and what Room or Church was able to hold so many, and the like; so that granting all your smaller Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> (who had but one Knights Fee apiece) to have met there, these might have made a body of 5 or 5000 Men; which how they could have been managed any better then 20000 or 30000, which would have more then taken in all their Feudata∣ry Tenants too, I desire you would resolve me if you can; so that at last upon your own Hypothesis, this <HI>Populus</HI> consisting of the Tenants <HI>in Capi∣te</HI> were as much Commoners as the Knights o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shires at this day; for, as for the word <HI>Nobilium,</HI> I have already proved (and you must needs here grant it) that it takes in the inferior Nobility or Gentry, under the degree of Lords, as well as the Superior; and if so, why not all the considerable measu Tenants of those Tenants; so that you have hitherto brought no proof but your bare Assertion, that under this <HI>infinita multitudo Nobilium &amp; Populus,</HI> must be understood only the great Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> since either this Author speaks Hyperbolically, or else all the chief Gentry of <HI>England,</HI> of whatsoever Tenure; might have appear'd at this great and extraordinary Assembly.</P>
<P>So that you are under this <HI>Dilemma</HI>; either this <HI>Curia</HI> (which you confess met <HI>ex more</HI>) was the great Council of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> or it was not; if it was not, then there was some other greater Council besides that; but if it was, then it will plainly follow (though you do all you can to mince the matter) that this great Council of the Kingdom or Parliament met of course by an∣cient custom three times in the year without any Summons at all from the King; which if I should have affirmed, you would have called it a Common∣wealth Notion, since nothing can be a greater proof, that this Assembly of the whole Nation in Parliament did not upon your Hypothesis immediately depend on the Kings Writs of Summons for their Assembling and Acting when met.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, since you can bring no direct proof that these were any other be∣sides the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who met at this great Council, I have still more reason to suppose them to have been so, then you can do for the conorary Opinion; therefore pray give me if you can, some clearer and later proofs for this difference between the two Councils.</P>

<P>Now I think here is as manifest a distinction as need to be between the Lords and Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I. A. A. p.</HI> 207, 208.</NOTE> as Members of the great Council and the common University of the whole Kingdom; for it is obvious that when all the Lay Lords, Earls and Barons (to whom you may also add your Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> if you please) being met together, were asked by the Bishops, Abbots and Priors then present, whe∣ther they would agree with them or not? the Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls and Barons answered for themselves, that they would do nothing without the <HI>Common Vniversity,</HI> which could not possibly be only the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> since it is plain they were now all here, and referred themselves to another distinct order of Men, different from themselves (who were not there present.) as also from the Bishops, Abbots and Priors, who demand∣ed there. Consents to what they had agreed upon. Now if the Temporal Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> had concurred, here had been the consent of the <HI>Common Vniversity</HI> of Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>; but besides the con∣sent of all these, there was, notwistanding, it seems, required the Consent of another body of Men, called here the <HI>Communis Vniversitas,</HI> by which must be meant the Commons, or no body, since otherwise they might have all agreed together without any more ado.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess this Story out of <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> looks somewhat plausible at the first on your side, but I doubt not if it be better considered, it will do you lit∣tle Service; for what if by this <HI>Common Vniversity</HI> is to be understood the whole body of lesser Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itting with the Lords at that time, they would do nothing without their Consents, till it was proposes to them; but that they did afterwards all agree, pray read the rest of this Narration, and it will make it clear enough, that this <HI>Common Vniversity</HI> of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> did also agree with the Lords, Bishops and Abbots, the words immediately following in <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> are these; <HI>Tunc de communi assen∣su electi fuerunt ex parte cleri Blectus Cantuariensis, Wintoniensis, Lincolniensis, &amp; Wigoriensis Episcopi ex parte Laicorum, Richardus Comes Frater Domini Reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Comes Bigod, Comes Legr.

<PB N="471" REF="255"/>
comprehensive then University simply taken; now if the Commons, as at this day represented, had been there, we must have had some mention of them one way or other, as well as of the Committees of the other Orders which made up the general Committee of Twelve; so that it is plain beyond doubt, that the Commons were not part of the <HI>Common Vniversity.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then pray tell me who they were, for the Historian tells that when all these Bishops, Abbots, Priors, had now met together with the Earls and Barons, yet these last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell them that without the Common University they could do nothing; which had been nonsense, if, as your Doctor supposes, the whole University, or Community of the Kingdom had been all present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, this is a material Objection, but what if to help him out, I should tell you that by the Common University here mentioned, is to be understood the body of the inferior Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> under the degree of Barons; and this Common University of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> might not have been present and sat with the Earls and Barons at that time when the Bishops and Abbots made this Proposal; therefore the Lords might very well answer, that till they had consulted the Common Universty, or Body of Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> they could do noth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng; and though this Body of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> did not then actually sit with the Earls and Barons, yet doth it not follow, that they made a distinct Estate by themselves, different from that of the Lords or greater Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>; for then the Arch-bishops, Bishops, Ab∣bots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (who are here expresly said to have consulted by themselves,) must have done so likewise; therefore though our Author is not so particu∣lar as he might have been, yet certainly this Common University were there∣upon consulted, and gave their Assents to the choice of this Committee of Twelve, who were to draw up their answer to the King, for the words are, <HI>tunc ex communi assensu electi fuerunt</HI>; which seem to refer to the Common University or Body of Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> or else the Lords Excuse, as well as the Election of these Persons by the Bishops, Earls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had been very insignificant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>This seems to me to be a precarious assertion, and without any due proof, for tho the words are <HI>Tunc ex Communi Assensu,</HI> yet I very much doubt, whether these words do refer to the <HI>Common Vniversity of the whole Kingdom,</HI> or not; for your self confess, <HI>that</HI> Mat. Paris <HI>is short in this point</HI>; and that it was not so, seems most likely to me by this material circumstance, that not one Person of the Twelve, but was either a Bishop, Earl, or great Baron. (For that <HI>Richard de Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sichet,</HI> and <HI>Iohn de Baliot</HI> were so; Sir <HI>William Dugdale</HI> hath proved in his Baronage of <HI>England</HI>▪<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tom. 1.</NOTE>) Whereas, if the University or Body of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> had joyned in this Election, it is not likely, but they would have chosen some of their own Body to represent them in this Committee, who were not Earls or Barons: Since your self must confess that they then were a great Body of Men, who were not Lords, nor did at this time Sit, or Act Joyntly with the Lords, or greater Barons in this Assembly; and likewise it farther seems highly probable, that this <HI>Common Vniversity</HI> of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> (take it in your sense) did not give any Resolution in this matter, since we do not find
<PB N="472" REF="256"/>
any Mony given in answer to the King's Request, but only Complaints of, and orders about, Redressing of Grievances which was in those days often done in a great Council of the Bishops, Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite.</HI></P>
<P>But I shall shew you now by some other Records which the Dr. himself hath made use of,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A.

The rest I shall not trouble you with, because it is not to our present purpose.</P>
<P>But you may here see, that taking the Words <HI>Proceres</HI> and <HI>Fideles</HI> in your own sense, the former for the Bishops and Lords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the latter for the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who were called to consult about the business of <HI>Sicily</HI> (which Kingdom the King had before too rashly accepted of from the Pope.) Yet tho they were all met, they could do nothing but give him advice, and could give him no <HI>Commune Auxilium, i. e.</HI> common Aids, or Subsidies, without the consent of the Commonalty of the Kingdom. Now what can this <HI>Community</HI> signifie but the <HI>Commons,</HI> for your Lords and Tenants <HI>in Ca∣pite</HI> were all met already, and if they alone made up the <HI>Common Vniversity</HI> or Body of the Kingdom (as you suppose,) why could they not have immediate∣ly granted the King the Assistance he desired (if they had a sufficient Pow∣er so to do) without putting him off with a Promise, that they would use their endeavour with the Community of the Kingdom, as a distinct order or <HI>Body of Men</HI>: That this Aid or Subsidy should be given him; and upon this con∣dition it is, that at the end of this Record, the King Promises them, that be∣fore <HI>Christmas,</HI> He would mend the State of the Kingdom, <HI>per Consilium Pro∣borum &amp; Fidelium Hominum nostrorum,</HI> which can mean nothing less than a Parliament; which the next Record in the same Roll recites, was to meet at <HI>Oxford</HI> after the Feast of <HI>Pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icost,</HI> which Record since it not only recites the King's Oath, whereby he had bound himself to observe the Direction of a Committee of 24<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Fideles.</HI> i. e. <HI>Faithful</HI> or <HI>Loyal Man,</HI> 12 of which were to be chosen out of the Kings Council, and the other 12. by the <HI>Procore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> or <HI>Magnates Regni</HI> which as I have already proved may take in the Commons as well as the Lords; but whether by these word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were meant the Lords or Commons: The conclusion of this Record sufficiently confirms my Argument from the precedent Record, that the Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> could not then Tax the whole Kingdom at their Pleasure, without the

consent of the Commons; or else to what purpose are these words in the con∣clusion of this last Record: <HI>Promiserun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> etiam nobis Comites, &amp; Barones Me∣mora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i, quod expleris Negotiis superius tacti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fide labora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unt ad hoc quod Auxilium nobis Commun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> praest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ur à Communitate Regni nostri in cujus rei,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Dat</HI> 2. <HI>die Maeii</HI>: And it appears by the Date, as also by the entry on the Roll, that both these Records were perfected at once, and concerning the same busi∣ness, and further to prove that the Parties appointed in the Record to be chosen <HI>ex part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Procerum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M.</HI> 6.</NOTE> were not chosen by the great Lords or Peers only, may be seen from a Patent Roll of the same 42. <HI>Hen.</HI> III. whereby <HI>Henry de Wengham</HI> Dean of St. <HI>Martin le Grand,</HI> and then Keeper of the Great Seal, and <HI>Iohn Manse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Provost of <HI>Beverlay,</HI> were two of the said Commissioners, tho they were neither Barons nor Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> (as I know of) hue only Eminent Lawyers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 391.</NOTE> and Men of great Abilities (and so meer Commoners.)

<P>I confess what you have now said, would carry some, weight with it, were I not very well satisfied, that you impose upon your self, by taking (as I told you at our last Meeting) these words <HI>Communitas, le Commune, &amp; Communalti</HI> in a wrong sense; for the Commons as they are now, when in∣deed these words before the 49th. of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. nay the 18th. of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. (as the Learned Dr. shews us in his 2d. Edition against Mr. <HI>P.</HI>) are always to be understood, either of the whole Representative Body of the Kingdom in gene∣ral consisting of the Bishops, Abbots, Earls and Barons, together with all the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> called by <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> and other Historians <HI>Communitas Baronagii,</HI> or else for the Community of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> alone, Stiled <HI>Communitas Regni</HI> in our ancient Records. And this I think I can prove to you, by undoubted Testimonies; but since you are now upon the proving part, pray shew me that these words I now mentioned, did ever signifie the Commons of <HI>England</HI> in the sense they are now taken before the times we in∣sist on, and I have the more reason to desire this from you; because it is chiefly from the mistaken Application of these Words, that the Gentlemen of your opinion have imposed their false notions upon the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall undertake what you desire; and I hope if I cannot satisfie you, the fault will not lie in my Authorities, but you prejudices against them. In the first place therefore let me mind you, how far you and I agreed at our last Meeting, when I granted you that these words now in dispute were very equivocal, and were often taken in different senses, as sometimes you say true, for the whole Representative Body of the Kingdom, sometimes for the Community of the Barons, and sometimes for the Community of the Bishops and Clergy; but never as I know of for the Community of the Bi∣shops, Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> much less for the Body of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> alone, nor were you then able to prove to me, that these words must necessarily be understood in your sense for the Community of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>: And tho you should prove them sometime to be taken in that sense, yet would it rather make against, then for your Opinion, since they must then signifie a different Body of Men from your great Lords, and consequent∣ly as meer Commoners as your Knights of Shires at this day, which is against your first general assertion, that by these words are always understood the Community of the Baronage only.</P>
<P>But to come to my proofs (which I shall divide in two parts;) first I will prove that these words <HI>Communitas, le Commune,</HI> and <HI>Communalty,</HI> when coming im∣mediately after <HI>Comites &amp; Barones,</HI> or Counts and Barons or <HI>Proceres</HI> in our old Statutes and Records, do always signifie the Commons in the same sense in which they are now taken: And for proof of this, I will begin with the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> III▪ when these words came first to be generally in use, and so de∣scend to his Successors as low as <HI>Rich.</HI> II. and if I can shew you, that these words (so put) always signifie the Commons, as well before, as after that time: I think you have reason to be satisfied, that these was never once upon a time such a strange alteration in the constituent parts of our great Councils as you supposed, yet none of our ancient Historians or Statutes should ever take any notice of it, till these modern Antiquaries took upon them to disperse these Clouds.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you give me leave to answer this Question presently, because I confess it is very material, before you proceed farther? There may (in my opinion) very good reasons be given. 1. Why the words <HI>Communitas &amp; la Commune,</HI> may signifie the Community of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> in the Form of the peace, and Acts of Pardon; and yet signifie the Commons of the County in general, in the Writ for Expences you have now mentioned: As first, because the subject matter is different in the Form of the Peace, and Acts of Pardon, from that in the Writs of Expences; the one being the <HI>Communitas Regni,</HI> and the other <HI>Communitas Comitatus</HI> only, called also in the Plural Number, <HI>Communitates Comitatuum,</HI> and then I grant when thus used, it always signifies the Commons in general; and there may be likewise a sufficient reason given, why this great change might have been made in the constituent parts of our great Councils, and yet no change of Phrases or Ex∣pressions might be made in our Records and Statutes, nor any notice taken of it by our Historians; which is, because the first Knights of Shires, being chosen out of, and by, the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only; the change was im∣perceivable at first, there being still Men of the same order, appearing in Parliament, for the whole Body of those Tenants, the difference being only in the Number, <HI>viz.</HI> Two, for a whole County; whereas before all the chief Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> came in Person, and I am the more inclined to be of this opinion, because in this Writ of Expences of the 49th. of <HI>Henry</HI> III. (which you have now cited) there is no such Clause as is in the following Writs of like Nature, <HI>prout in casu consimili fieri con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uevit,</HI> which shews it to have been a new thing for the Knights of Shires to have their Expences allowed them, that being the first time of their Meeting in Parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess what you say is very plausible, were there any Colour of a proof brought by you for it, but I shall shew you further, that your distincti∣on between the <HI>Communitas Regni,</HI> and the <HI>Communitas Comitatus</HI> signifies no∣thing, unless you can prove that this <HI>Communitas Regni</HI> was not the Represen∣tative of the <HI>Communitates Comitatuum</HI> mentioned in this Writ, and did not consist of Persons of the same degree or order; for the Writ of Summons of 49th. <HI>Hen.</HI> III. says no more then that these Knights should be <HI>de legalioribus &amp; peritioribus militibus comitatus,</HI> without limiting them to Tenants <HI>in Capite.</HI> But as for your Reason, why these great alterations might be made in our great Councils or Parliaments, without any notice taken of it, it is altogether false and precarious, for you have not yet, nor can, I believe, give me any sufficient Authority (beside the Drs. bare assertion) that ever none, but Te∣nants <HI>in Capite,</HI> were capable of being Elected Knights of Shires, or that none but such Tenants by Military Service were the Electors.</P>
<P>And I think I have sufficiently confuted the Vanity of that Assertion at our last Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Dict.</HI> 6th. <HI>Pag.</HI> 425.</NOTE> when I shewed you the false in∣terpretations you gave of those Statutes of 7th. of <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. and 10th. of <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. whereby you would have proved, that there was some alteration thereby made, as to the Electors of the Knights of Shires at the County Court: Whereas, indeed before those Statutes, all Persons of whatsoever Tenure, and of howsoever small an Estate of Free-hold,
<PB N="477" REF="258"/>
who owed Suit and Service to the County Court, were capable of being Ele∣ctors; and consequently of chusing whom they pleased as well Tenants <HI>in Ca∣pite</HI> as others, to be Knights of the Shire; and that those who were not such Tenants were frequently chosen; in the Reigns of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, and <HI>Richard</HI> the Second; I could bring sufficient proofs, were it worth while to insist upon a thing so certain.</P>
<P>But I shall go on to prove that the same words, <HI>viz. Communitas le Com∣mune,</HI> or <HI>la Communalie,</HI> were used in many of our Statutes and Records, to signifie the Commons. I come therefore to the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, and I pray, in the first place, remember, what I took notice of at our last meet∣ing concerning the Statute of <HI>Westminster</HI> the first, made in the third year of this King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See the Old</HI> Fr. <HI>Statutes in</HI> Tottle.</NOTE> beginning thus in <HI>French, per L'assentement des Archesques, Evesques, Abbes, Priors, Counts, Barons &amp; tout la Communalty de la Terre, Illonques Sum∣mones.</HI></P>
<P>Now every one knows that <HI>Communalty</HI> is but <HI>French,</HI> for the Latin <HI>Com∣munitas,</HI> as appears by the first Writs we have left us (except that of the 49<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, now mentioned) <HI>de expensis Militum,</HI> being of the 28<HI>th.</HI> of this King directed to the Sheriff of <HI>Somerset∣shire</HI> to levy the expences of the Knights for that County (who had served in the last Parliament) <HI>le Communitate Comi∣tatus praedicti;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot.

Re∣gister, p.</HI> 9.</NOTE> which sure must mean the Commonalty, or Commons of all those Cities and Bur∣roughs there mentioned, for the Record is, <HI>Eodem modo scribitur Majoribus, &amp; Ballivis pro Burgensibus Subscriptis</HI>: And which is also more remarkable, these Writs contain this Clause, that the said Knights and Burgesses should have their expences allowed, <HI>pro veniendo, manendo, &amp; redeundo a Parliamento praedicto prout alias in casu consimili sieri consuevit</HI>; which words relating to a former Custom, not then newly began (as this word <HI>consuevit</HI> in a legal sense still imports) must needs relate to some time much more ancient than the 49<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third; or the 18<HI>th.</HI> of this King, the former of which was but 26 years, and the latter but 10 years before this 28<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Edw.</HI> the First, in which time there were not above thirty Parliaments called, if so many.</P>
<P>And further, that the Word <HI>Commonalty</HI> signified the Body of the Com∣mons, and not Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> in the Reign of this King, appears by the Statute or Ordinance (the year is uncertain) intituled, <HI>Con∣suetudines Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iae,</HI> which you may see in <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Tottles</HI> Collection; the Ti∣tle of them is thus, <HI>Ceux son<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> les usages les queax la Communalty de Kent Clayment avoir en Tenements de Gavel-Kind.</HI> Now every body who knows any thing of <HI>Geval-Kind,</HI> know also it was generally a Socage Tenure, there being but little of it held by Knights Service, and consequently the owners

<P>I pray Sir give me leave to answer your Arguments from these Re∣cords as you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut them, least I forget what you have said, in the first place
<PB N="480" REF="260"/>
as to this Record of the 30th. of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. which relates to a Tax given in the 18th. Year of his Reign, and recites an Aid of 40 s. upon every Knights Fee through the whole Kingdom to have been given by the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shops, Earls, Barons and other <HI>Magnates,</HI> or great Men of the Kingdom in full Parliament, for themselves and the whole Community thereof to Marry the King's Daughter; and which Subsidy he had deferred to Levy till now, and therefore because this was a Tax granted only upon Knights Fees, that those only who payed this Scutage, were then the <HI>Communitas</HI> or whole Body of the Kingdom, which is no Argument at all, since from this we may plainly collect the clean contrary; for if none had been to pay to this Tax but those that held by Knights Service <HI>in Capite,</HI> then the King would have had no need to have had it granted in Parliament; since by the 14th. Article of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Char∣ter, he might have Taxed his Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> for the Knighting of his Eldest Son, and the Marriage of his Eldest Daughter without the Assent of the Common Council of the Kingdom, and according to your Hypothesis, and the Authorities you have brought to prove it, these Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> might also, by the like reason have made their Tenants by Knights Service, have Con∣tributed to this Tax, which yet you see they could not do without the consent of Parliament, and therefore this Aid or Subsidy being granted in Parliament, must needs extend to all the Lands in the whole Kingdom, as well those that held by Knights Service, as well as those that did not, for it is not here said as in the Writ to the Sheriff of <HI>Sussex, qui de nobis Tenent in Capite,</HI> and then the words <HI>pro se, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ota Communitate Regni</HI> cannot mean (as you would have them,) <HI>viz.</HI> That the Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> had granted it for themselves and the Community of their Tenants by Military Service only, who (say you) repre∣sented the whole Community of the Kingdom, for then (as I have already observed) this needed not to have been granted in Parliament at all; but at this rate no Tenants of those Abbeys and Monasteries (which were a great many) who did not hold <HI>in Capite,</HI> would have payed any thing to this Tax, nor yet the Kings Tenants, who did not hold <HI>in Capite,</HI> but of some Castle or Honour: Nor lastly, any Tenants in Socage, who were very numerous in <HI>Kent,</HI> as well as in other Counties (as Mr. <HI>Taylour</HI> proves in his History of <HI>Gav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l-K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd,</HI>) so that if your Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> and other under Tenants by Military Service had been then the Community of the whole Kingdom. This Com∣munity had not consisted of above one half, or at most a third part of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>But in my sense of this word <HI>Communitas,</HI> here will be no difficulty at all, for these <HI>Magnates</HI> mentioned in this Record, being taken as (I have prove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) they often are, for Knights of Shires, then these words are thus to be under∣stood▪ <HI>viz.</HI> that all the Parties mentioned in this Record, gave for themselves and the whole Community of the Kingdom, consisting of all the Free holders of <HI>England,</HI> who all contributed to the Marriage of the Kings Daughter ac∣cording to their respective Estates; and tho the sense of this word had been o∣therwise in this place, yet it would not have contradicted my sense of the word <HI>Communitas,</HI> which I do not aver always to signifie the Commons, but when it

comes immediately after the words <HI>Comites &amp; Barones,</HI> as it does not in this Record you have now cited.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray tell me how this could be, since the Record says expresly, that this Aid was to be Raised by 40 s. upon every Knights Fee, which could only extend to Tenants by Knights Service, nor could this word <HI>Communi∣tas</HI> here signifie the Commons as now understood; since the Citizens and Burgesses are not at all mentioned, who you know do at this day make up the greatest part of the Representatives of the Commons of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>Where you may Note, that all Men who held the value of a Knights Fee, either by Military or Socage Tenure were liable to be made Knights, provi∣ded they could maintain themselves of their Estates; which could never have been, had not the Custom of Reckoning and Taxing Estates of all sorts, as well by Knights Service as otherwise, according to the value of so many Knights Fees (that is, at 20<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>per An.</HI>) been then commonly used: But as for your next Objection, that the Citizens and Burgesses are not mentioned in this Record, and so could not be comprehended under the words <HI>Communitas Regni,</HI> this proves no more then that which will easily be granted you, that this word <HI>Communitas</HI> used in your Record, is there to be understood restrictively, and according to the subject matter, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Community</HI> of Free-holders, or Land-holders of the whose Kingdom only; since this Tax being wholly upon Lands, the Com∣mons of Cities and Burroughs then called <HI>Communitates Civitatum, &amp; Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>go∣rum,</HI> whose Estates lay in Money or Goods, could not be Taxed by Knights Fees; nor do I doubt but that if we had the Records of that Parliament of the 18th. of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. now left us (which are lost) it would appear, that they also contributed to this Tax according to their Estates as they did in the 34th Year of this King to make the King's Eldest Son a Knight: As for your Re∣cord of the 20th. of <HI>Edw.</HI> III. it is but the same in effect with this of the 30th. of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. and the same answer will serve for both, only I cannot but observe, that whereas you have often asserted that this word <HI>Communitas,</HI> did only sig∣nifie the Community of Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> now you fall a Peg lower, and it must at last take in the whole Community of Tenants by Knights Service, whether <HI>in Capite</HI> or not.</P>

And least we should happen to mistake the meaning of these words, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Do∣ctor himself has furnish'd us with this Learned Comment upon them as follows in the same place.
<Q>It is said in this Record that the Archbishops,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. G. p.</HI> 34.</NOTE> Bishops, Earls, Barons, Abbots, Priors, Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghts and Freemen, and Communities of Counties, gave a Thirtieth part of their Goods, as if they had been all Members, and sat in this Parliament: And so it is said of the Cities and Burghs, that the Citizens, Burgesses and the Communities of the Cities and Burghs gave a Twentieth part of their Moveables, as if they had been all there. But these words signifie no more, than that the Knights and Freemen gave by their Representatives, and that the Communities of Counties, and the Citizens and Burgesses▪ and Communities of Cities and Burghs gave by their Representatives,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Claus.</HI> 34. <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 1.</NOTE> as is most clear from the Writ of Expences for the Knights of <HI>Lincoln</HI>-shire, and so consequently for the rest.</Q>
Now I desire you would tell me whether there can be a plainer Record against the Doctors opinion than this; for in the first place who were these Knights, Freemen and Com∣mons who granted this 26<HI>th.</HI> and 30<HI>th.</HI> part of their Moveables in the 34<HI>th.</HI> year of this King; but the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, the Lawful Re∣presentatives of the whole Kingdom in General, as well those who held <HI>in Capite,</HI> or else by inferior Military Service, as those that held by any other Tenure; or who were these Representatives, but men chosen out of all so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well those that held by Knights Service, as those that did not; unless you can prove (as you have not done hitherto) that all the Cities and Buroughs in <HI>England</HI> held of the King <HI>in Capite</HI>; and that none but Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> or Military Service at least, were chosen either for Counties or Cities, and though I find your Doctor has an utter aversion to the word Commons, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore will needs translate the word <HI>Communitates,</HI> by Communities, and not Commons, yet if you were to render those words, <HI>the Commons of the Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, Cities and Buroughs,</HI> into our Law-Latin: I desire to know what other words you could make use of but these in this Record, viz. <HI>Commu∣nita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Civi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atum &amp; Burg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rum?</HI> So that to conclude, if in the 28▪ 34 and 35<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the First▪ a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l the Commons gave by the same Repres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves as they do now, I can see no reason why they might not do so too, thirty or forty years before that time; and pray take notice also that here the Tenants in Ancient Deme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n gave likewise by themselves; and could not be charged by the Knights of Shires. And therefore as Mr. <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣bard</HI> in his <HI>Arche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI> very well observes, this Prescription of not being chargeable with the rest of the County must be very ancient, si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was no Land at that time reckon'd as Ancient Demesne, which had not be∣longed to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rown before the making of Dooms-day Book.</P>

<P>I must confess what you have now said concerning the constant use of the words <HI>Communit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmune</HI> (coming after <HI>Comi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> and <HI>Barones</HI>) to express the Commons in Parliament in our Statutes and Records, would we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh much with me had I not good reason to believe there were no such thing as Commons in Parliament in the sense now taken before the 49<HI>th.</HI> of

<HI>Henry</HI> the Third; and from which time I suppose it was discontinued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till the 18<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the First; for which, I can give you very good proofs, when it comes to my turn; but in the mean time pray shew me by any Re∣cord, or Statute, that there were any Knights, Citizens and Burgesses Summoned to Parliament till the times I allow; for in the first place, you cannot shew me any mention of Commons in the Plural Number; in any old Statute before <HI>Edward</HI> the First's time, and as for the words <HI>Communitas</HI> and <HI>le Commune,</HI> which I grant were of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en used to express the Com∣mons after that time, your self own they are equivocal; and therefore when put after the Earls and Barons in the Instances you have given, may signifie the Community of the smaller Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> which were the only Representatives of the Commons that appeared in Parliament in those days; and I am the more incline<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be of this opinion, because I have searched the old Statutes very exactly; and cannot find any mention of the word Commons in the Plural▪ much less of Knights, Citizens, or Bur∣gesses, till the Statute of 34<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tallagio n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n conced<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣do</HI> (made in the 34<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the First) wherein I grant they are express∣ly mentioned; and as for Writs of Summons you can produce none till the 23<HI>d.</HI> of this King, to Summon them to Parliament; though I shall shew one by and by that the Doctor has found out of the 18<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, whereby he proves they were then Summoned after about twenty-six years discontinuance; therefore pray shew me if you can by any suffici∣ent proof that they were there in <HI>Henry</HI> the Third's Reign except once, or in <HI>Edward</HI> the 1<HI>st</HI>'s till the 18<HI>th.</HI></P>

<P>I confess your Doctor has not only ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeded all other men but himself too in this rare discovery, for whereas in his first Edition of his Answer to Mr. <HI>Pety<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s Book, he was content to follow Sir <HI>William Dugdale,</HI> and make the Commons to have been first Summoned to Parliament in the 49<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, and to have commenced by <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ford</HI>'s Rebellion, and so to have still continued on; now the Doctor upon second thoughts, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Edition in Folio, will have them never to be Summoned any more than that once, because forsooth he cannot find them mentioned in such express words as that he cannot evade them, by saying the sense is equivocal; and if the Commons not being expressly mentioned in our Statutes were a sufficient reason to prove them not to have been there; were the Writs of Summons lost as well after as they are before the 23<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, you might as well have faced us down, that there were none in all that time till the Sta∣tute <HI>de Tallagio non concedendo,</HI> you now mentioned. And for proof of this pray see the Statute called <HI>Articuli super Char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,</HI> made in the 28<HI>th.</HI> of this King, which is said to be made and granted by the King at the Request of the Prelates, Earls and Barons, who are only mentioned in this Statute, and yet certainly the Commons were then at this Parliament, as appears by the Writs of Summons and Expences I but now mentioned, and sure their assents were given to it, as well as the Bishops and Lords, I could shew you the like in many other Statutes of this King, nor are the words <HI>Communit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> or Commonalty, ever mentioned above twice in all the Statutes of this King's
<PB N="485" REF="262"/>
Reign, <HI>viz.</HI> in that of <HI>Westminster</HI> the first, and that against Bearing of Arms; neither is the word <HI>Commons</HI> to be found above once or twice in all the Statutes of <HI>Edward</HI> the Second; in the Statutes made at <HI>Lincoln,</HI> in the 9<HI>th.</HI> of this King, 'tis said to be done by the King, the Counts, Barons and other <HI>Grands</HI> of the Kingdom; now if these general words did compre∣hend the Commons in those times, you grant they were constantly Sum∣moned to Parliament, I desire you would give me any good reason why the same words may not as well comprehend them long before? and if the bare omission of the distinct Orders or States of Men that gave their assents to the making of any Statute, and the different penning of Acts of Parlia∣ment were a sufficient reason to prove they had no hand in it; I doubt two parts in three of the old Statutes of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the First, would have been made without the Consents either of the Bishops or Lords; since in most of them there is no mention made of either; and that what I say is true, pray at your leisure peruse these Statutes following, <HI>viz. de Distriction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Scacarti</HI> of the 51 of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, with other Sta∣tutes made in the latter end of that King's Reign, as also that of <HI>Acto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Burnel</HI> made in the 11<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> I. that of <HI>Winchester</HI> made in the 13<HI>th.</HI> of this King; that of <HI>Merchants</HI> in the same year; as also those of <HI>Circum∣specte agatis,</HI> and <HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> and see if you can find any mention either of the Lords or Commons in them.</P>
<P>But to come to direct proofs, tho I grant the words Knights, Citizens and Burgesses was not expressly mentioned in our old Statutes; yet I shall prove to you by other words of a much more comprehensive signification, that they appeared in Parliament in the very beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third's Reign▪ for this we need go no farther than the old Manuscripts, as well as Printed Copies of <HI>Magna Charta</HI>; which was first Granted in the second year, and a∣gain confirmed in the 9<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, both which conclude thus, <HI>Pro hac autem Donatione &amp; Concessione, Archiepiscopi, Episcopi, Abbates, Priores, Comites, Barones, Milites, libere Tenentes &amp; omnes de Regno nostro ded<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣iun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> quint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m decimam pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tem omnium mobilium suorum.</HI> Now can any thing be more express than this Clause, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, for themselves and the inferior Orders, <HI>viz.</HI> the Knights and Freeholders, and all others of the Kingdom by their Lawful Representatives, gave this 15<HI>th.</HI> of their Moveables, at both those Parlia∣ments, in which this Charter was first made, and afterwards con∣firmed.</P>

<P>I confess this Authority looks very plausible at first, but if it be strictly looked into; I believe it will prove nothing at all: for as to your interpretati∣on of these words, I do not allow it for reasons I shall shew you by and by; but in the first place give me leave to dispute the Antiquity of this Charter, which I do not take to be so ancient as you make it, for tho I grant there was such a Charter made in the 2d. and again confirmed in the 9th. of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. yet you have already had my thoughts of this Charter which you suppose to be <HI>Henry</HI> the Thirds, <HI>viz.</HI> that this which we now have is not properly his, but his Son <HI>Edw.</HI> I. since it concludes this: <HI>His testibus Bonifacio-Cantuari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is

<P>I am very glad you have made these Objections against the Validity of this Charter; for if I can prove to you, that what you have now urged from your friend the Dr. is a meer Evasion against the Charter it self, I think you have reason to be my Convert. In the first place, pray give me leave to con∣firm the Vali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity of the Charter it self; I therefore freely grant that the Original of this Charter is not to be found among the Statute Rolls in the <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner,</HI> where there is nothing left of it on Record, except this confirma∣tion of it by a Charter of <HI>Impeximus</HI> of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. (the Conclusion of which is as you have now given) and I think there cannot be a greater P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oof of the careless keeping or voluntary im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ezlement of the ancient Statutes and Records of the Kingdom, than the loss of this great Charter, which certainly must have been inrolled at the time when it was made, as well as every common Grant made by the King to ordinary Per∣sons of Markets and Pairs, since we find Copies of it still Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant in the ancient Annals of divers Monasteries, where they were formerly kept▪<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Annals Burt. pag.</HI> 271. <HI>&amp; dein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> as in particular in the Annals of the Abby of <HI>Barton,</HI> Published in the first Volum of ancient <HI>English</HI> Writers, lately Printed at <HI>Oxford,</HI> which fully an∣swers your Objection, for instead of <HI>Boniface</HI> it is there Wit∣nessed by <HI>S.

<P>But to put this out of all doubt, there is still Extant a fair Original of this Charter of confirmation of the 9th. of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. (when he was of full Age) under the great Seal of this King (which is supposed to have belonged to <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ail</HI> Abby) and is now to be seen in the hands of Sir <HI>Nathaniel Powel</HI> Benches of the <HI>Inner-Temple,</HI> who is so civil as to Communicate it to all, who have the Curiosity to see so great a Rarity, so that tho it is not to be denyed, but that the Charter Published by Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> in his 2d. Institutes, is properly the Charter of confirmation of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. since <HI>Boniface</HI> was at that time Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulk</HI> Bishop of <HI>London</HI> (<HI>E.</HI> being by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stake put for <HI>F.</HI> yet I think no man has any cause to doubt whether that

<P>Well, admitting this Charter to be as ancient as you please, yet let me tell you▪ if your sense be, that the words at the end of this Charter, <HI>viz. omnes. de R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gon,</HI> those who gave, or granted this Subsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, were Members of that Parliament; if you wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> understand it so, and according to the literal meaning of the words then <HI>om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es de R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

And so then I would willingly understand where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll these People should meet, how their Council shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be managed, and how it is possible in such Meetings (i any such there can be) to prevent the greatest confusion imaginable. The meaning then of the words, must be, that the Arch-bishops, Bishops, Abbot, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Barons, Knights, Free-Tenants, and all of the Kingdom, or all the King's Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jects <HI>Dederunt,</HI> that is paid a Fifteenth part of their Moveables to the King, for his grant∣ing these Charters, not that they themselve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gave, or granted this Subsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y; and 'tis reasonable to conclude, that all the King's Subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts paid the Fifteenth part▪ because one way or other, little or much they enjoyed the benefit of them. I take this to be the Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uine sense of the words, but <HI>Mat.

<P>I think I can as easily answer this small Objection against on meaning of these words at the end of this Charter. Pray do, I affirm that these words are to be taken literally or the contrary? Therefore you do ill to put a sense upon me which I do not allow of, but pray tell who ever was so mad as to believe that these words are to be understood litterally; or that all those Persons who you here give us a Bed-Roll of, could all appear in Parliament, in Person, or had all Votes at the Elections of Parliament Men; and yet for all that, this Clause is true in a legal, tho not in a litteral sense, that all the Freemen of the Kingdom granted this 15th. <HI>viz.</HI> that the Prelates and Temporal Lords in their proper Persons, and all the rest of the Kingdom by their respective Representatives granted this Fifteenth; I hope it is a good Rule in your Civil, as well as our Common Law, that he who gives, or grants any thing by his sufficient <HI>Proxy</HI> or <HI>Representative</HI> is said to perform it by himself; and in this sense, all the Men in the Kingdom gave, or granted, a Fifteenth for
<PB N="488" REF="264"/>
the confirmation of this Charter; and so at this day, it may be said in a legal sense, that all the Men of the Kingdom do joyn in granting the King a Tax by themselves, or their Representatives in Parliament, tho none but such as are Free-holders of 40 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. a Year, can have Votes at the Election of Knights of the Shire, nor any but the Aldermen of divers Cities and Towns, and the Freemen of Corporations, and the Scot and Lot-men of Buroughs, who have any Votes at the Election of Citizens, or Burgesses.</P>
<P>And that your Dr. himself, tho he hath misled you in the sense of this word <HI>Dederunt,</HI> yet can grant this to be a reasonable Interpretation of this Clause, when he is in a good humour:
<Q>Pray remember his Comment upon the Re∣cord of the 34th. of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. which I gave you but now; wherein, after the <HI>Barones</HI> it follows, that <HI>milites Liberi homines &amp; Communitates Comitatuum</HI> grant∣ed a 30th. part of their Moveables, and the <HI>Communitates Civitatum &amp; Bur∣gorum</HI> a 20th. whereupon he tells you these words are so expressed as if they had been all there in Person; but these words signifie no more, then that the Knights and Freemen gave by their Representatives and that the Communities of Counties, and these Citizens and Burroughs gave by their Representatives. and why these <HI>Milites Liberi homines &amp; Omnes de Regno</HI> might not do it as well in the same sense?</Q>
When this Charter was granted and confirmed, I should be glad if you could give me a sufficient reason, so that I shall refer it to your own Ingenuity, to consider when the Charter says expresly, that all the Persons therein mentioned, gave a Fifteenth, whether it be not a manifest wresting of the <HI>Grammatical</HI> signification of this word, <HI>Dederunt</HI> to render it they pay'd; for at this rate a Man may make words signifie just what he pleases. But our ancient <HI>English</HI> Historians are the best Judges in this case, for the ancient Annals of <HI>Waverly-Abby</HI> Published in the same Volume I last mention∣ed, under the Year 1225. having given us a short account of the granting th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Charters, 9 <HI>Hen.</HI> III. recite the conclusion of the great Charter in the same words as they are in the Charter it self, only before <HI>Dederunt</HI> there is also added the word <HI>Concesserunt,</HI> which shews that the Author of this part of those Annals, who might very well write at the same time, or presently after the Charter was granted, by his Paraphrase of <HI>Concesserunt,</HI> seemed to intend to prevent any such mistake in the the signification of the word <HI>Dederunt.</HI> And that this was the constant opinion of all Historians and Antiquaries to this day; I will shew you from <HI>Henry de Knighton,</HI> who lived within 100 Years after this Charter was granted,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Christi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crip ores</HI> Cot. 24.29.</NOTE> in his History hath this passage in this Yera, <HI>viz.</HI> 9. of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. <HI>Post haec Rex Henricus concessit Magnatibus terrae duas Chartos unam de Foresta, &amp; aliam de Libertatibus ob quam causam Com∣munes Regni concesserunt</HI> 15. <HI>partem mobilium, &amp; in mobilium</HI>: From whence it appears plainly that at the time when this Author writ, it was generally be∣lieved that the Commons (called <HI>Milites &amp; Libri Tenentes</HI> in this Charter granted this 15th. of all their Goods.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with a modern Authority of a Person, who you will own to be a Man of great Judgment and Learning, <HI>viz.</HI> Sir <HI>Henry Spelman,</HI> who in his Discourse of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> inserted in his Glossary, hath this remark∣able

As for what you say further, whereby you would set up the Authority of <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> against the express <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ords of the Charter it self: I suppose you or the Dr. from whom you borrowed this N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, are the first who interpret anci∣ent Statutes and Records, according to the general Words of Historians: Whereas I always thought till now, that the sense of Historians ought to have been understood by Records, and not <HI>vice versa,</HI> since the former differ one from another in their manner of expression of the constituent parts of our great Councils or Parliaments, and for brevity sake, express themselves in as few words as they can.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding the Conciseness of those expressions which we find in <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> and other ancient Authors; yet I think even in this place now cited, there are words enough to prove there were other Lay Persons at this Coun∣cil, besides Earls and Barons there mentioned, or else, what is the meaning of these words <HI>Aliis U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iversis</HI> immediately after <HI>Baronibus,</HI> to whom <HI>Hubert de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urgh</HI> proposed the Kings Demands, and who also gave their answer to them? And if these Gentlemen were not Barons, as certainly they were not (or else to what purpose was this distinction made) then they were meet Commoners, and so we find that there were Commons in Parliament from the Authority of <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> before the 49. <HI>Hen.</HI> III. which is likewise proved by the Statute of <HI>Merto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (which I have lately cited) in the conclusion of its Preface runs thus, <HI>Ita provijum fui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, &amp; conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssum t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m à predictis Archi-piscopis, Episcopis Comi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣bus, Baronibus, quam ab ipso Rege, &amp; Aliis.</HI> Now pray tell me who these <HI>&amp; Alii</HI> were if not the Commons, for you did not answer this Question when I last mentioned this Statute.</P>

<P>I think your Interpretation of the word <HI>Milites</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forced, and quite con∣trary to the true meaning of this Charter; now pray shew me the consequence,
<PB N="490" REF="265"/>
that because the Barons were anciently stiled <HI>Milites</HI>; that therefore your Tenants <HI>in Capi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> were then stiled <HI>Barones</HI> too; which is not true, and quite contrary to this Charter it self, where these <HI>Milites</HI> (whoever they were) are put after the <HI>Barones,</HI> as a distinct Order of Men from them, whereas if the terms had been then reciprocal the words <HI>Baron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> or <HI>Milites</HI> (chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e which you please) would have comprehended both; but indeed this Title of <HI>Miles</HI> was then of a much larger signification, and took in all Knights of whatsoever Tenancy, whether by Military Service or Socage, as appears by those Writs of the 25<HI>th.</HI> and 26<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, which I have alrea∣dy cited, whereby those that held Estates sufficient to maintain themselves <HI>de Tenemento, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o tam militari, quam Soc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gi,</HI> were a like Summoned in to take the Order of Knighthood, and when Knighted were certainly as good <HI>Milites</HI> as the best of your Tenants <HI>in Capit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and so might very well be reckon'd a∣mongst the <HI>Milites</HI> in this Charter: But pray tell me what say you to these following words, <HI>Liberi Tenent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s &amp; omn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s de Regno?</HI></P>

<P>Pray give me leave to answer this Interpretation of the word <HI>liberi Tenentes,</HI> before we proceed farther.

<P>If you do not like our sense of these words, <HI>Milites</HI> and <HI>Libere Terentes</HI>: I cannot help it, nor shall I dispute them longer with you; but as for this last Clause in the Charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. pag.</HI> 65.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; omnes de Regno,</HI> it only means, all these who were Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> in gene∣ral in the same sense, as when our ancient Historians mention <HI>Regnum, &amp; S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cerdotium</HI>; by <HI>Regnum</HI> is to be understood both the Temporal and Spiritual Barons, great and small; the Kings Justices, or any other that exercited any share or Ministerial part of the Government; as perhaps all those di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one way or other by coming to our great Councils or Parliaments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which is evident from the words of the <HI>Quadri parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> History, concerning <HI>Thom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Becket,</HI> thus, <HI>Rex apud Clarendun.

I pray also remember that passage you your self made use of but now, out of <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> whereby you would prove that the Common Council of the whole Kingdom was distinct from that of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>; because that after the <HI>Curia</HI> held at <HI>Christmass,</HI> the King immediately issued out his Writs, commanding <HI>omnibus ad Regnum spe∣ctantibus,</HI> to appear at <HI>London</HI>; and yet you see there are no more mentioned to be Summoned than the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls and Barons.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. G. p.</HI> 65.</NOTE> So that we may hence learn the true meaning of these words, <HI>omnes de Regno,</HI> at the end of this Charter; for these <HI>omnes de Regno,</HI> were the same with the <HI>omnes ad Reg∣num spectantes,</HI> in <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> the <HI>Regnum,</HI> or Government, the <HI>Communi∣tas Regni,</HI> the <HI>totalis Regni universitas,</HI> the <HI>insluita nobilium multitudo</HI>; and also gives us the meaning of those words <HI>omnes alii de Regno,</HI> in the close Roll of the 19<HI>th.

Now this Writ could not be directed to all the Men in <HI>Kent,</HI> but to all such as paid Scutage, for not a fortieth part of them were Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> or Military Service: So that these <HI>omnes alii de Regno,</HI> and <HI>Omnes alii Comitatus,</HI> were the same one with the other, and otherwise it could not be: for by <HI>Omnes de Regno,</HI> or <HI>Omnes alii de Regno,</HI> the Inhabi∣tants in general could not be understood, for they never were Summoned, no not the Hundredth part of them to meet in Great Councils; for 'twas impossible they should, and perhaps not above a fourth part of the King∣dom paid to this Fifteenth, if we consider how many Servants, Villain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Bondmen, and many such People there were than in the Nation that paid nothing.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have taken a great deal of pains to perplex and darken words in themselves very clear and perspicuous; for methinks it is a strange piece of confidence in your Doctor, when the Charter says expresily, That <HI>Omnes d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="492" REF="266"/>
Regno</HI>; all the Freemen of the Kingdom gave this 15th, to restrain this Act only to the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who were but a few in comparison to the whole Kingdom; this is indeed to make words signifie any thing he fancies.</P>
<P>But to answer your Authorities, which are founded all upon false suppo∣sitions, without any proof. As to your Authority from the Quadrilogus Hi∣story of <HI>Thomas B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecket</HI>; it is true, that the <HI>Praesules</HI> and <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceres</HI> are there called <HI>Regnum,</HI> the Kingdom; but I have already proved at our last Meeting; that this word <HI>Proceres</HI> was of so comprehensive signification, that it took in all the Principal Men of the Kingdom, as well those that were Lords, as those that were not; so that the chief Citizens and Magistrates of our Cities and great Towns, are often stiled <HI>Proceres &amp; Magnates Civitatum,</HI> in our ancient Historians and Records, and certainly the great Free-holders, or Knights of Shires did much more justly deserve that Title.</P>
<P>As for the other passage out of <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> where the Bishops, Ab∣bots, Earls and Barons, are called <HI>omnes ad Regnum spectantes</HI>; this is but a general way of expression in this Author, and proves nothing: For either the word <HI>Barones,</HI> takes in all the smaller Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> or it does not, if the latter, then this Author does not exactly recite all the Orders of Men, whom your self must acknowledge to have appeared there; since the great Barons alone could never make this <HI>infinita Nobilium multitudo</HI> mentioned in this Author; if the former, then it is plain, that he thereby comprehended more then those who were really Barons. Since it is certain that the smaller Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were not so, nor are so much as called so in King <HI>Iohn's</HI> Charter; and then make the most of this word <HI>Barones,</HI> it may in a large and common acceptation, take in all the chief Free-holders, or Lords of Man∣nors, which (as I have already proved) were often called Barons in our ancient Historians, and Laws of the first <HI>Norman</HI> Kings; and Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> tells us that under the word <HI>Baronagium, omnes Regni ordines continarentur</HI>: This I say, supposing that by this <HI>infinita Nobilium multitudo,</HI> is to be understood, all the cheif Gentry, or Free-holders of <HI>England,</HI> called often <HI>Nobilitas Angliae,</HI> as I have already made out, and which may also take in the Representatives of Cities and Towns; but if we should suppose, that by the <HI>Barones</HI> here mentioned, are to be understood only the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>; yet, since they, together with the great Lords, made the chiefest Figure in the Government; it was easie for him to over-flip the particular mention of others, it being enough to comprehend them with the Representatives of the rest of the King∣dom, under the general Phrase of <HI>Infinita Nobilium multitudo,</HI> as I have al∣ready said, but I always thought that the Conciseness of Historians, was to be explained by our Statutes and Records, and not that their express words should be interpreted by the concise Phrases and Expressions of Histo∣rians; and if by <HI>omnes de Regno</HI> are to be understood all the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> in general; how could this be without a notorious Tautology, since if it be as you say, that the Bishops, Abbots, Earls and Barons comprehended all the greater Nobility, and the <HI>Milites &amp; libere Tenentes,</HI> all the lesser, or Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> (who made then the whole Kingdom) if so, what can these words <HI>omnes de Regno</HI> here signifie, but so many idle words without any sense or meaning?</P>
<P><PB N="493" REF="266"/>But it will be now more easie to answer your false Interpretation of these words, <HI>omnes alii de Regno,</HI> which you will needs have to signifie only the Te∣nants <HI>in Capite</HI>; and it will be no hard matter to shew you the Drs. Prevari∣cations on these words; for as to the first Writ directed to the Sheriff of <HI>Somerset-shire,</HI> tho I confess these words at the beginning of the Writ, are <HI>omnes alii de toto Regno nostro</HI>; yet the Dr. has in his Glossary concealed the words that follow, which plainly restrain them, to Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and their under Tenants by Military Service; but if you please but to turn to the Writ which he has given us at large in his Appendix, Numb. 14. you will find first, that this Writ recites, that the Earls, Barons and <HI>omnes alii de Regno,</HI> had granted the King an Aid to two Marks on every Knights-Fee, <HI>quae de nobis Tenent in Capite</HI>: Secondly, that at the Command of the Earls, Barons and all others that held <HI>in Capite,</HI> the Sheriff should distrain <HI>omnes milites &amp; libere tenentes qui de eis tenent per s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvitium militare,</HI> who were likewise to pay the King the like Summ of two Marks for every Knights Fee, so that you may here plain∣ly see that this could be no general Tax granted by the whole Kingdom, since none but Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> and their under Tenants by Knights Service were chargeable with it, which, if given with their consents, must have been done in full parliament, and in which they had Representatives of their own choo∣sing, and if without their consents, was directly contrary to Law.</P>
<P>But you need go no farther then this Writ you have now cited, to prove that the <HI>Milites &amp; libere tenentes,</HI> were not at this time only Tenants <HI>in Ca∣pite,</HI> as you suppose but their Feudatory Tenants also, as appears by the ex∣press words of this Writ, which orders the Sheriff to distrain <HI>omnes Milites. &amp; libere tenetes qui de ci tenent p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rservitium Militare</HI>; but as for the other Writ to the Sheriff of <HI>Suss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x,</HI> which (as you say truly) relates to the former, to the Sheriff of <HI>Somerset-shire</HI>; it sufficiently interprets those general words, <HI>omnes alii de R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gno,</HI> and expresly restrains them to <HI>omnes alii qui de nobis tenent in Capite,</HI> who in a Council of themselves alone, granted this Tax for themselves only, as I have already proved, which, whether it was according to Law or not, we shall inquire by and by.</P>
<P>But in the mean time, give me leave to answer to your next Record of the 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th. of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. which recites an extraordinary Service and Aid done by the <HI>Prelati, Magnates, lib re Tenentes, &amp; omnes alii de Regno</HI>: Now that this was not a Service performed, or an Aid given by the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only for the whole Kingdom; the word <HI>Subsidium</HI> may teach you, which was never granted otherwise, then by the whole Kingdom in Parliament. But let us first consider the substance of this Record, which is indeed but the Kings De∣claration or a right to all his Subjects in general, or the Freemen of the whole Kingdom, that what they had lately performed in <HI>Articulo nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssitatis praedictae non sibi cedat in prajulicium, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c ad posterum tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atur in consuerudimen, vel conse∣quentiam nec ad bujus modi servi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ium compellentur</HI>; which being the effect of this Record, now see the cause why it was granted, which you may find in another Record of the same Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M.</HI> 9. dorso.</NOTE> and on the Roll, and to which this Rcord you cited relates, which is a general

Summons directed, <HI>Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, Abbatibus, Comitibus, Baronibus, Vice-comitibus, Militibus, liberis Hominibus, &amp; Vniversae Communitati Comi∣tatus Lincolniae,</HI> commanding them all, even the Citizens and Townsmen im∣mediately to appear with such Arms as are there expressed (and were proper for each Mans Estate and Condition) for the common Defence of the King∣dom, against strangers then ready to invade it, and this Record also says, <HI>eodem modo scribitur caeteris Vice-comitibus Angliae.</HI> Now since it appears by this Writ of Summons by which this Service and Aid was performed, that not only the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> but all the Subjects of the whole Kingdom were engaged in the performance of it; can any body, but one who will take things by halves, suppose that by these <HI>omnes alii de Regno</HI> there mentioned (and who must certainly be the same Parties intended in the Drs. own Record, <HI>viz.</HI> all the Freemen of the Kingdom) could be meant no more then the Lesser Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> taken altogether, when they had been (according to our sense) all particularly named before?</P>
<P>But that by these <HI>omnes de Regno</HI> cannot be here meant only the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Cl.</HI> 2. <HI>Mem.</HI> dorso.</NOTE> but all the Freemen of the whole King∣dom, I shall prove by another Record of the 16th. of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. and is the very Writ I gave you before, wherein it is recited, that the <HI>Villani</HI> together with the rest of the <HI>Liberi Homines</HI> had given a 30th. of their Moveables, in consideration of which, this Writ con∣cludes thus, <HI>Concessimus etiam Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, Abbatibus, Prioribus, Co∣mitibus, Baronibus, &amp; vobis omnibus aliis de Regno nostro, quod tam Charta no∣stra, de Foresla, quam alia Charta nostra de Libertatibus, quas eis, &amp; vobis fieri fecimus de caetero in omnibus teneantur</HI>; so that it plainly appears, that by these words in this Record <HI>omnibus Aliis de Regno,</HI> must be understood all the Free∣men of the Kingdom in general, unless you will allow none to have had any share in these Charters, or to have received any benefit by them, but the Drs. Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> alone, which sure you will not affirm.</P>
<P>But least I tire you as well as my self, in dwelling so long upon things so plain and obvious, were not they by too much industry, rendred obscure, I come at last to the conclusion of your discourse, which is no more then a repeti∣tion of what you had said at first; that because all the Kingdom could not be Summoned to appear in Parliament, and that <HI>Villains</HI> and Servants <HI>&amp;c.</HI> never paid to this Tax; that therefore the words <HI>omnes de Regno</HI> are not to be understood literally; (a doughty discovery) and therefore you have found an expedient to help this contradiction by your Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and Thy Knights, Citizens and Burgesses for the Laity, and by the <HI>Procuratores Cleri</HI> for the Inferiour Clergy; whose Interpretation is most agreeable to truth, I durst leave to any indifferent Judge; for I must needs tell you once again, I cannot see any manner of reason, either from Authorities, or from the Na∣ture of the thing, that your Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> could be the <HI>omnes de Regno</HI> in a legal sense, and as such did represent all the Freemen of Estates in the whole Kingdom; therefore if you can prove this, it may go far to convince me, otherwise not.</P>

<P>I grant indeed, the matter of fact to have been sometimes as you say, since there is no averring against express Records; but I say likewise, that as for those Writs the Dr. has given us concerning the Kings Ordering the Sheriffs to distrain the Mesne Tenants of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> for Scutage Service, as to Marry their Daughters, or for the finding of Men in any Warlike Ex∣pedition, it was no more then those Mesne Tenants were bound to do by the <HI>Tenures</HI> of their Estates; if they had failed to serve their Lords in Per∣son, or by sufficient Deputies; and therefore the King might legally grant them Scutage upon such Tenants, and perhaps might also change their Service in Person into a pecuniary Aid, as appears by some of those Writs the Dr. has given us; and this not by his Prerogative, but by Law; so likewise, tho your Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> could Tax themselves in their distinct Council, or else in the Common Council of the whole Kingdom at what rate they pleased, for the Knights Fees they held of the King; and tho the King might some∣times undertake by this pretence, to I evy a Scutage of two Marks on their Under-Tenants also; yet does it not appear by either of those Records you have now cited, that they gave for more then themselves alone, the words in the Writs being only, that they had given the King <HI>Esse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ax Auxilium</HI> of two Marks upon every Knights Fee (as well Wards as others) who held of him <HI>in Capite,</HI> without any mention of their Mesne Tenants; so that if the Sheriff was afterwards ordered to distrain these Mesne Tenants also, for two Marks for each Knights Fee they held of their Lords; this was straining a point of Prerogative, and was expresly against Law; for at this rate the King might by the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke Prerogative have Taxed all the Bishops, Abbots, great Lords and all other Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> without their consents, as well as their Mesne Tenants, tho it was contrary to the express words of the Charters of King <HI>William</HI> I. and King <HI>Iohn,</HI> which you your self cited at our former Meeting, so that granting the matter of fact to have been pra∣ctised sometimes as your Records make out, this is no proof that this was a constant Law, or settled Custom, much less that the King had a right so to do.</P>

<P>From all which you may plain see that the Kings of <HI>England</HI> had ancient∣ly a Prerogative of laying Taxes not only upon their own Tenants and their Mesne Tenants who held under them, but upon the whole Kingdom too; and it their Successors have acted otherwise it has proceeded from their meet grace and favour who have tyed up their owne hands from exercising this Prerogative.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have muster'd up a great many Authorities; but for what end I know not unless it be to prove that some former Kings stretcht their Prerogative to act directly against Law, and their own Charters to the contrary; and to justifie them in it when they have do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, as if all things were done according to their Lawful Prerogative, because they did it; if this be Law or Reason either much good may do you with it; for at this rate the King notwithstanding all Laws made and sworn by him to the contrary may take what he pleases out of our Estates without our consents, because his Pre∣decessors broke the Laws and their Coronation Oath into the Bargain; but you might have remembred that a <HI>de f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cto ad jus non datur consequentia</HI>; but I doubt the Precedents you have now brought, will not come up to the proof of the assertion you have laid down; for it is plain as well from King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Char∣ter, as by that passage in <HI>Bracton,</HI> I but now cited, whereby it appears that extraordinary Taxes such as Hidage, Corage, and Carvage, <HI>&amp; alia</HI> (under which I suppose was included your Scutage-Tax also) could not be imposed without the consent of the Common Council of the whole Kingdom; when the King met his People in Parliament; if then this were Law whatever K. <HI>Iohn</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, or any other King acted contrary to this Rule, was illegal, and produced among other mischiefs the general revolt of all the Baronage, <HI>i. e.</HI> as well the Inferior as Superior Nobility of the whole Kingdom, till such time as our Kings, finding they could do no good by force, were fain at last to content themselves with the Legal Prerogatives of the Crown, and by new Laws and fresh Declarations of the ancient Law to de∣clare it unlawful for them to impose any Taxes upon their Subjects without their consents in Parliament.</P>
<P>But let me tell you that by thus setting up the Kings Illegal Prerogative of taxing the Mesne Tenants of their Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> you quit the que∣stion; for I asked you by what right the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> (whom you suppose) could grant by this great Charter a Fifteenth of the Moveables of the whole Kingdom as well of those who did not hold of them by Military Service, as of those that did, nay of those who never held of them at all; and you then fly presently to I know not what unknown Royal Prerogative of Taxing the Mesne Tenants of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> at pleasure; which was either according to Law, or it was not, if the former, I have already proved he could not do it by Law at all; but if a∣gainst Law, there was the like reason why he should have had the like Pre∣rogative over his Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> too; even over the very Bishops, Ab∣bots and Temporal Lords; and then I desire to know whether the great Council of the Kingdom had not been long since destroyed and given up.</P>
<P>But to examine your Authorities, it is true, <HI>Hoveden</HI> says of <HI>Richard</HI> the First, that <HI>accepit de unaqua{que} Hida Terrae V. solidos,</HI> yet does it not therefore follow, that he took this Tax without consent of his great Council, it was the ordinary Phrase of Writers in those times to say, <HI>Rex accepit,</HI> i. e. received such a Tax, when indeed he took nothing but what was given him by his Parliament. And therefore tho we find this Tax not mentioned in
<PB N="498" REF="269"/>
any other Writer, but only <HI>Hoveden,</HI> and so cannot give you an express proof that this Tax was granted in a great Council, yet it is most likely (nay certain it was) for the word <HI>accepit</HI> does not in its own nature import any violent or illegal exaction▪ and therefore considering the nature of the thing, it is greater reason to suppose that this aid was granted by consent; since this same Author tells us in the relation of this affair, that this Money was received by the hands of two lawful Knights of each Hun∣dred, and that they did answer this Money to the <HI>Exchequer, Coram Episco∣pis, Abbatibus &amp; Baronibus ad hoc assignatis,</HI> who would never have undertaken it, had not this Tax been granted by the Common Council of the Kingdom; but that this King could not tax the whole Kingdom at his pleasure may appear by a relation out of this very Author: in the very same year,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 441. <HI>b.</HI></NOTE> but a little before, <HI>viz.</HI> that when the King demanded by <HI>Hubert</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> that <HI>Homi∣nes Angliae</HI> the men of <HI>England</HI> should find him 300 <HI>Milites, i. e.</HI> Knights to stay one whole year in his Service, or else would give him so much money as that he might therewith maintain those 300 Knights in constant pay,
<Q><HI>viz.</HI> to every Knight three Shillings of <HI>English</HI> Money wages a day, and that to grant this, all the rest were willing, as not daring to resist the King's will, only <HI>Hugh</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI> as a true servant of God abstaining from all evil answered, That he would by no means agree to the Kings desire, be∣cause it would redound to the detriment of his Church, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so it seems the business fell and came to nothing.</Q>
Now it is plain that this Request must have been made in the great Council of the Kingdom; or at least in that of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and if he could not charge his Subjects with the keeping but of 300 Horsemen for one year without their assents can any body believe that he should presently after extort a much greater Sum, <HI>viz.</HI> five Shillings out of every Plow-land in <HI>England.</HI> But as for all your Precedants for <HI>King Iohn</HI>'s reign, he was such a Notorious Tyrant and breaker of his Coronaci∣on Oath, and common Faith both to God and man, that I hoped that neither your self nor any good <HI>English</HI> man would have fetcht Precedents for Pre∣rogative, from so pros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igate a Reign as his, and in which I grant there were more than once illegal Exactions of this nature, which yet are branded by those very Historians that relate them for great oppressions and unjust exactions;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Chron. Thom. Wikes. &amp; Annales de Waverly in Anno</HI> 1207. <HI>Published at</HI> Oxford.</NOTE> as particularly in this first instance of out of <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> of <HI>K. Iohn</HI>'s taking away by force the Seventh of the Moveable Goods of the whole Kingdom; which is by this Author called by no bet∣ter than <HI>Rapinam,</HI> Rapine or Robbery.</P>

<PB N="499" REF="269"/>
very perjuries for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lowers of the Crown, and Royal Prerogatives.</P>
<P>But as for the Authorities you urge for this Kings Talliating his De∣mesnes without consent of Parliament, you your self grant that this Talli∣age was not general upon the whole Kingdom; and if so, could only con∣cern his own Tenants in ancient Demesn, and none else; who were always exempted from being taxed with the rest of the Nation▪ because they were lyable to yield the King a reasonable Talliage <HI>ratione Tenurae</HI> whensoever he needed it; yet this was counted rather a priviledge than otherwise, since they were not only free from all other burthens and Parliamentary at∣tendance, but were also Taxed much less than the rest of the Nation in re∣gard of their Tilling the Kings Lands; but when this reasonable Pre∣rogative grew to be abused, and the Exactions levyed upon them became intollerable, then they would no longer suffer it; but got it taken away by the Statute <HI>de Tallagio non concedendo</HI>; after which we find the Tenants in ancient Demesne frequently giving their shares of Aides and Subsidies in Parliament by Delegates of their own, as in the Record of the 35<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the First, which you have now cited; till at last they came to be resol∣ved into the common body of the Kingdom, but a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the City of <HI>London</HI>▪ it was never taken for part of the Kings Demeans, and so is not to be found in Dooms day Book, but as appears by Record held of the King <HI>in Capite,</HI> and therefore could be no otherwise Taxed then as the rest of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> that is, by the Common Council of the Kingdom. And this made the <HI>Londoners</HI> deny to be otherwise Talliated, as appears by this Record of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, which you have now cited. But the truth is they had this Exaction first laid upon them in the exorbitant Reign of King <HI>Iohn</HI>; and this was afterwards trumped again upon them in all the ill part of his Sons Government, because his Father had done it before; and I doubt not but if Ship-mony had passed unquestioned, and been as often paid in the Reign of <HI>K. Charles</HI> the First, but that it would have been urged as a Precedent in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>But as for your last Authority of the 33<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, pray take notice, that it is before the Statute <HI>de Tallagio non concedendo,</HI> and extends only to such Estates in ancient Demesn as were held of the King by Noble∣men or Gentlemen, either by Gift, or Purchase; and which, for all that still kept the ancient custom of being Talliated by the King, as their under Tenants were by them, to enable the Lords to pay the Kings Talliage; and in this sense I understand these words in this Record, <HI>unde sunt in Tenantia; i. e.</HI> of which they are in Tenancy to the King. Nor does the Record call them <HI>Dominica sua,</HI> as it does the Kings Demesns that follow; so that this could not be a Tax upon all under Tenants by Knights Service as you sup∣pose: sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e their Estates were never called <HI>Antiqua Dominica,</HI> and therefore I think after all, you cannot shew me any legal Precedent that our Kings claimed a Right under colour of their Prerogative of Taxing the whole Nation <HI>de Alto &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sso,</HI> at their pleasure.</P>

Nor was this at all unreasonable, that those who thus held Estates by Mesne Tenure under the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> should be bound by the Acts of those of whom they held them;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. I. A. pag.</HI> 171.</NOTE> since we see in <HI>Scotland</HI> that at this day none sit there, either as Commissioners of Shires, or Burgesses for the Royal Buroughs, but such as hold <HI>in Ca∣pite</HI> of the King; for anciently before the Law for excusing the smaller Ba∣rons and free Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and sending Commissioners of Shires in their stead, was introduced by a Statu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e made in the Seventh Parliament of <HI>K.

<P>I will answer your Argument from <HI>Scotland</HI> by and by; but in the mean time give me leave to tell you why I think it could never have been the custom in <HI>England</HI>; and that for two Reasons, first because it was against Reason; and 2<HI>ly,</HI> because it was against the known Law of the Kingdom▪ that it was against Reason, is apparent; since what reason was there that if a Man in those times purchased an Estate for a valuable consideration of a Lord, or any other Tenant <HI>in Capite</HI> (as certainly thousands did) to be held either by Knights Service, or in Socage that such a Tenant should lye at the Mercy of his Lord, to dispose of his Estate in Taxes, and make Laws for him at his pleasure; however exorbitant those Taxes were, or inconvenient those Laws might prove, the Lord being no Representative of his own choice▪ or appointment.</P>
<P>In the next place, that this was contrary to the received Law and Custom of the Kingdom in those times, I can prove by two very sufficient Authori∣ties, the one of the Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> the other of the Bishop of <HI>Durham.</HI> Now it is certain that both this Earl and Bishop hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their County Palatines <HI>in Ca∣pite</HI> immediately of the King, nor had those Counties any Representatives in Parliament, till long after that they had Knights of Shires and Burgesses, granted them by particular Statutes made for that purpose; now according to your Hypothesis, all the Freeholders and Inhabitants of those County-Palatines should have been bound by all Acts of Parliament, and Taxed with the rest of the Kingdom as often as there were Laws made, and Taxes given when their Bishop or Earl was present, which was not so; for in the first place as for the County of <HI>Chester</HI> if the Earl had been the Representative in Parliament of his Tenants by Knights Service, or otherwise, as also of all the
<PB N="501" REF="270"/>
Abbeys, and the City of <HI>Chester</HI> it self, and all other great Towns in that County, his Vote in Parliament would have obliged all of them; and there would have been no need of a Common Council or Parliament of the States of the whole County in which they then made Laws, and Taxed themselves as a Separate Body from the rest of the Kingdom, as may appear from these following Records which Mr. <HI>A.</HI> hath given us; the first of which is a Writ of <HI>K. Edw.</HI> I.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I. A. p.</HI> 22. <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Pat.</HI> 3. <HI>E.</HI> 1.

He desires that they also would of their Benevolence and Courtesie (in Latin <HI>Curialitate</HI>) grant him the like Subsidy, which Note could not be done out of a Common Council.</P>
<P>So likewise in another Writ of the 20<HI>th.</HI> of this King, reciting that whereas the <HI>Probi Homines,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Bat.</HI> 20▪ <HI>E.</HI> 1. <HI>m. b.</HI></NOTE> <HI>&amp; Communitas Ce∣striae sicut caeteri de Regno nostro</HI> 15 <HI>mam partem omnium mobi∣lium suorum nobis concesserunt gratiose</HI>: Now supposing (as the Doctor always does) that these <HI>Probi Homines</HI> were the Earls Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> what can this word <HI>Communitas</HI> here signifie but another sort of men distinct from them, <HI>viz.</HI> the Communalty or Commons of that County: And which is also remarkable, this County was now fallen to the Crown for want of Heirs male of the last Earl; and so according to the Doctors notion, the King being their sole Representative needed not to have been beholding to them for these Subsidies; since, tho not as King, yet as Earl of <HI>Chester,</HI> he might have Taxed them himself, which yet he thought not fit to do, because he knew it was contrary to the Rights and Priviledges of that County, which had ever since the grant of it to <HI>Hugh Lupus</HI> by <HI>Will.</HI> I. always been Taxed by themselves.</P>
<P>Which Priviledges are also expressly set forth in a Supplication of all the Estates of this County Palatine to <HI>K. Henry</HI> the Sixth, which Mr. <HI>P.</HI> has given us from an Ancient Copy of it then in the hands of Sir <HI>Thomas Manwaring</HI> of that County,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> R. <HI>C. p.</HI> 45, 46.</NOTE> Baronet:
<Q>Wherein the Abbots, Priors, and Clergy, Barons, Knights,
Esquires, and Commonalty set forth, that they with the consent of the Earl did make, and admit Laws within the same, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that no Inheritors, or Possessors within the said County were chargeable or lyable, or were bounden, charged or hurt of their Bodies, Liberties, Franchises, Lands, Goods, or Possessions, unless the said County had agreed unto it.</Q>
Now what can here be meant by County but the Common Council, or Parliament thereof, since otherwise they could make no Laws, nor do any other publick Act?</P>
<P><Q>The like I may say for the County Palatine of <HI>Durham,</HI> which from the Grant thereof by <HI>William Rufus</HI> to the then Bishop, had always been Taxed by themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Aleman.</HI> 14 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. <HI>m.</HI> 9.</NOTE> and not by the Bishop in Parliament, and that as low as the Reign of <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. as appears by this Record of the 14<HI>th.</HI> of that King; con∣taining
<PB N="502" REF="271"/>
a Letter or Commission to <HI>R.</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham</HI>; reciting, that whereas the Prelates, Earls, Barons and the Commons of Counties, had given him a 9th. of their Goods there mentioned, that therefore the Bishops should convene, the <HI>Magnates &amp; Communitatem Libertatis vestrae</HI> (to wit, of his County <HI>Palatine</HI>) <HI>ad certum diem, &amp; locum,</HI> with all conveni∣ent speed, and that done to perswade and excite the said <HI>Magnates &amp; Com∣munitas</HI> to grant the King the like, or a larger Subsidy, or Aid towards the maintainance of his Wars, which had been altogether in vain, if the Bishop, or the King could in those days have Taxed this County at their Pleasure.</Q></P>
<P>Now if these great Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> could not Tax their Mesne Tenants without their consents, much less could the rest of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> in <HI>England</HI> impose Taxes on their Tenants in Military Service, or in Socage without their consents, which last had a much less dependance upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess I never considered these Precedents of the County <HI>Pala∣tine</HI> of <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Durham</HI>; and therefore can say nothing to them at present, since it is matter of fact, but as to Reason and Law; I think it is consonant to both,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. pag.</HI> 171.</NOTE> that not only Tenants in Military Service but Socage Tenure should be found by the Acts of their Superior Lords, of whom all the Lands of <HI>England</HI> were formerly held by Knights Service: And tho in Process of time many of these Estates and Lands became free Tenements, or were holden in Socage, that is, were Free holders; yet the Lords retained Homage (which in the times we now write of, was no idle insignificant word) and by that a Domi∣nion over the Estate▪ whereby upon Disobedience, Treachery, or Injury done to the Lords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Lands were Forfeited to them, and although the Lands, nor the Tenants of them (which were termed Free-holders) were sub∣ject to any base Services, or Servile works, yet the Lords had a great Power over these Tenants, by reason of their doing Homage to them (which tho now antiquated) yet <HI>eo nomine</HI> their Lands were many ways liable to Forfei∣ture, and Taxes too.</P>
<P>So that upon all thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> accounts, it was then as reasonable that the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> should in those days make Laws, and grant Taxes for all the rest of the Kingdom; as the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> should do so to this very day, for all the Inhabitants of that Kingdom of never so great Estates, and to this Argument which is certain in matter of fact, you have yet an∣swered nothing, nor do I believe can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot see notwithstanding what you have now said, that the Su∣perior Lords, by reason of Homage should have an absolute Power over their Tenants Estates: For tho in the Profession of Homage to the Lords, I grant the Tenant thereby promised to become the Lords Man; yet he never thereby meant to become his slave, and there were mutual Duties on both sides; so that if the Lord failed to protect his Tenant in his Estate, or un∣justly oppressed him, he might have refused (nay renounced) his Ho∣mage, till the Lord had done him right; nor can I see how a bare right of ha∣ving
<PB N="503" REF="271"/>
the Forfeiture of the Estate in the Cases you have put which yet let me tell you, were never so strict in respect of Socage as Military Tenure as I could shew you, were it worth while; for if this right of Forfeiture alone▪ could give the Superiour Lord a Power over his Tenants Estate, to make Laws for him, and Tax him as he pleased, then by the same Rule, the King as Supream Lord over all his Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> should have had the like Power over them, of making what Laws for them, and imposing what Taxes he pleased upon them without their consents: and so there would have been no need of Common Councils or Parliaments at all, since upon your Hypo∣thesis, the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were the only Persons that had any right to ap∣pear there. But if neither the Wardship, Marriage nor Relief of the Heir▪ could give the King such a Power over his Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> much less could they attain the like right over all their Mesne Tenants by Knights Service, for that would have given them a greater Power over their Tenants then the King himself had over them; therefore if those great Tyes of Wardship, Marriage and Relief of the Heir, could neither give the King, nor yet any Tenant <HI>in Capite</HI> power over the Estate, or Liberty of his Tenants by Knights Service, much less over their Tenants by Socage Tenure, who were not under this subjection; and farther, if a right of Forfeiture alone, in some Cases, could have given the Lords a Power of making Laws; and granting Taxes for his Tenants in Socage, then they should have kept that right by this Rule, since all Lords had a right of Forfeiture even upon their Tenants in Socage in some Cases, before the Statute of taking away Knights Service; and the Court of Wards, and Liveries in the second year of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, as I could prove, were it worth while.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Scotland,</HI> I shall not deny the matter of fact to be as you say, that it hath at this day no other Representatives in their Parliament, but the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> yet whether it was so or not anciently. I very much doubt, since I find the very same words and Phrases made use of in the Titles of their old Statutes, as also in their Records to express the Constituent parts of the great Council of that Kingdom as were used in <HI>England,</HI> to express those of <HI>England</HI> at the same time: For proof of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.

<P>I desire no better proofs then what your self have now brought to make out, that the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> are not only at this day, but have been from the very beginning of Parliaments in that Nation.</P>
<P>For I shall appeal to those very Statutes and Records you have now cited, which compared with divers subsequent Statutes of that Kingdom, will make the matter plain enough; that the <HI>Communitas</HI> and these <HI>probi homines</HI> mentioned in these Laws you have cited, were the Community of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only.</P>
<P>In the first place, therefore let me observe from that very Law of King <HI>Alexanders,</HI> the Title of which you have but now quoted, that these words <HI>per essenssum Communitatis</HI> cannot here signifie the Commons, since they alone could neither advise, nor give their consent to make Laws, and there∣fore they must needs refer to the whole Community or Assembly of Estates, consisting of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<P><PB N="506" REF="273"/>Having thus shewn the ancient Costitution of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Parliaments for your satisfaction, I shall farther shew when, and how it was altered.</P>
<P>In the Seventh Parliament of King <HI>Iames</HI> the First, held at <HI>Perth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Statut. Iacob.</HI> 1. <HI>ibid.</HI></NOTE> <HI>A. Dom.</HI> 1420, there was a Law made (which I shall contract)
<Q>That the small Barons and Freeholders need not to come to Parliaments, and that for the future out of each Schirefdome there should be sent two or more wise men after the large∣ness of the Schirefdome the which shall be called Commissaries of the Shire, and that these should have full power finally to hear and determine all cau∣ses to be proposed in the Great Council or Parliament, and that the said Commissaries should have Costage of them of each Shire that ought to ap∣pear in Parliament or Council.</Q>
I have only given you an Abstract of this Statute because it is pretty long, and pen'd in old <HI>Scotish English,</HI> but you may consult it at your leisure.</P>
<P>And this is farther confirm'd by a subsequent Act of Par∣liament of King <HI>Iames</HI> the Sixth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. f.</HI> 99.</NOTE> holden at <HI>Edinburgh, Iuly</HI> the 29<HI>th.</HI> 1587, wherein after a repetition of the former Act of King <HI>Iames</HI> the First, and a Confirmation of the same, it follows thus:</P>
<P><Q>And that all Freeholders of the King, under the degree of Prelates and Lords of Parliament be warned by Proclamation to be present at the choo∣sing of the said Commissioners; and none to have voit in their Election but sik as hes Fourtie Shillings Land in free tenandrie halden of the King, and hes their actual dwelling and residence within the same Schire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
I need give you no more of this Act, but I think it is most clear from this as well as the former Act of Parliament, that the Commons in <HI>Scotland</HI> were only the Kings Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and are so at this day, since none but they can either choose or be chosen Commissioners for the Shires,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Present Stat. of</HI> Scot∣land, <HI>p.</HI> 17.</NOTE> but as to the Buroughs who do each of them send but one Commissioner or Burgess (except the Ci∣ty of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> which sends two) all which are chosen by the Common Council of the Towns. Now there are in <HI>Scotland</HI> three sorts of these Burghs, that is to say, Royal Burghs, Burghs of Rega∣lity, and Burghs of Barony;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 100.</NOTE> but only the Royal Bur∣roughs, the <HI>Burgi Dominici Regis,</HI> or <HI>qui de Rege Tenent in Capite,</HI> send Commissioners to Parliament, and are in number Sixty.</P>
<P>To conclude, that I may apply what hath been said concerning the Consti∣tuent parts of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Parliament to ours anciently, it seems to me that from the great affinity there was between ours and theirs, 'tis certain, that our and their <HI>Communitas Regni,</HI> was the same, that is, they were the small Barons and Tenants <HI>in Capite.</HI></P>

to their places in Parliament by a Statute made in the latter end of King <HI>Iames</HI> the First; yet I cannot allow that from the beginning of that Government, the <HI>Scotch</HI> Parliaments have consisted of no other Members than those, since the word <HI>Communitas</HI> coming as it does in these old Statutes and Records (I have now cited) immediately after the <HI>Praelati, Comites, Barones, &amp; Milites,</HI> &amp;c. must signifie a distinct order of men from the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> called in the Statute of King <HI>Iames</HI> the First the small Barons, and since the Citizens and Burgesses though none of those Barons, were also comprehended under this <HI>Communitas</HI> (and whom you grant to make the third Estate,) why this word might not com∣prehend all the other great Freeholders, I can see no reason to the con∣trary.</P>
<P>And therefore I suppose that in the Reigns of <HI>K. David</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> or <HI>Robert</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> or else the beginning of <HI>Robert</HI> the 3<HI>d.</HI> there was a great alteration in the constituent parts or Members of the <HI>Scottish</HI> Parliament; and about that time the chief Freeholders or Lords of Mannors who held of Bishops, Ab∣bots, and other Temporal Lords, as well as of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> or else of the King by petty Serjeantry, or Socage Tenure, as also many of the small Towns, or Baronies might either forbear coming at all, or else desire to be excused because of the great trouble and charge of attendance; (as you see the smaller Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> afterwards did when Commissioners for Shires were appointed in their steads) and so might by degrees leave off coming or be excluded by some Law not now extant; and thus the Tenants <HI>in Capi∣te,</HI> might become the sole Representatives of the whole Nation in Parlia∣ment; and I am of this opinion because in many of the old Statutes before the time of <HI>Robert</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> we find the <HI>Communitas totius Regni</HI> coming immedi∣ately after the Earls and Barons (as in our own ancient Statutes and Records) but after those Reigns we find no more mention of this <HI>Communitas,</HI> but on∣ly of the Dukes, Earls, Barons, <HI>Liberi Tenentibus, &amp; Burgensibus qui de Rege tenent in Capite,</HI> as in the Titles to those Statutes of <HI>K. Robert</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> and <HI>Iames</HI> the 5<HI>th.</HI> you have now cited.</P>
<P>And yet that <HI>Liber Tenens</HI> was not anciently taken for a Tenant <HI>in Capite</HI> only; pray see the 14<HI>th. Chap.</HI> of the Laws of <HI>K. Alexander</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> made <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1214. with your Doctors comment upon them; <HI>Statutum est quod nec Episcopi, nec Abbates, nec Comites, nec aliqui liberi Tenentes, tenebunt curias suas nisi Vicecomes Regis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.A.P. p.</HI> 98.</NOTE> <HI>vel servientes Vice∣comitis ibidem fuerant,</HI> upon which words the Doctor in his answer to Mr. <HI>P.</HI> hath this remark, <HI>viz.</HI> this again shews us, that the Free∣holders were Lords of Mannors at least. So that unless you will suppose that none but Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were Lords of Mannors, or held Courts, (as cer∣tainly very many of the Mesne Tenants did) this word <HI>Liber Tenens</HI> must ex∣tend to any other great Freeholder or Lord of a Mannor, of whatsoever Lord he held it; and as such might anciently have had a Vote in that Parliament, so that if I have (as I think sufficiently) proved that the word <HI>Communitas</HI> coming after the Earls and Barons in our ancient Statutes and Records did certainly signifie another order of men distinct from the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> I
<PB N="508" REF="274"/>
I have the same reason to believe it was so in <HI>Scotland</HI> too; not only because these general words <HI>Communitas totius Regni,</HI> must needs be more comprehen∣sive than to express the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only (who could never Represent all the great Freeholders in <HI>Scotland</HI> any more than they did in <HI>England</HI>) but also because it is acknowledged by the <HI>Scotch</HI> Lawyers that the Fundamental Laws and Constitutions are the same in both Kingdom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for Sir <HI>Iohn Skene</HI> in his Epistle to <HI>K. Iames</HI> before his <HI>Scottish</HI> Laws▪ says thus, <HI>Intelligo tuas tuorum∣que Majorum leges, cum legibus Regni tui Angliae magna ex parte consentiunt,</HI> which is also acknowledged by the King himself in the Speech he made in Parlia∣ment concerning the Union of both Kingdoms.</P>
<P><Q>To conclude, I cannot but admire your Doctors strange partiality who does allow the Commons of <HI>Scotland</HI> to have even been a third Estate, when he expressly grants that <HI>the Commons of</HI> Scotland <HI>were, and are at this day the Kings Tenents</HI> in Capite, <HI>and that the Kings Royal Burroughs were such as ever did, and do at this day in</HI> Scotland <HI>only send Burgesses to Parliament</HI>: Now why the Cities and Burroughs in <HI>England</HI> should not have always had the like Pri∣viledge as well as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I wish you could give me any sufficient reason.</Q></P>

<P>Since you own that the Tenants <HI>Capite,</HI> or else Commissioners in their stead have been the sole Representatives for the whole Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> for above 200 years, I doubt not but they were so long before that time; since you confess you cannot shew any Law by which this ancient Custom came to be changed; though I grant that the Statutes before <HI>K. David</HI> and <HI>Robert</HI> the 2<HI>d,</HI> are said to be made by the <HI>Communitas totius Regni,</HI> yet you must not suppose that Constitution of the Kingdom altered, when the Clerks altered their phrases in penning their Statutes and Records, so that this <HI>Communitas</HI> was the Community of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only, and not of the Freeholders, or of the Citizens and Burgesses of the whole Kingdom; since as for the former you cannot say that all the People in <HI>Scotland</HI> had ever a right to chuse the Commissioners for the Shires; for then 'tis most likely they would have kept to this day, whereas we see that none but Tenants <HI>in Coplie</HI> have Votes at such Elections.</P>
<P>And as for Cities and Burroughs, I cannot find (nor do I believe you can shew me) any instance of a City or Burrough-Town in <HI>Scotland</HI> that ever sent Deputies to Parliament, but what held <HI>in Capite</HI> of the King. For though there are, at I said already, besides the Royal Burghs, two other sorts, <HI>viz.</HI> Burroughs of Regality, and Burroughs of Barony, who hold of the King, but not <HI>in Capite</HI>; or else of some Bishop or Temporal Lord; and though divers of these are considerable for Trade and Riches, yet none of them send any Burgesses to Parliament; so that though I confess there are three Estates in the <HI>Scotch</HI> Parliament, called in the Statutes of <HI>K. David</HI> and <HI>Robert</HI> the 2<HI>d,</HI> the <HI>Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Communitates Regni,</HI> yet did these always consist of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only, who therefore sit together, and make but one Assembly.</P>
<P>Now that we may apply what hath been said to <HI>England,</HI> I desire you to take notice that the Doctor and we that are of his opinion, do not positively affirm that that the Commons of <HI>England</HI> were not at all represented before
<PB N="509" REF="274"/>
49 <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. but that they were not represented in Parliament by Knights, Ci∣tizens and Burgesses of their own choice, but by the greater and lesser Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> the greatest part of which I grant were not Lords; and admit that I should grant you that some Cities and Burroughs sent Members to Parliament, before the 49<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third; yet were they only such as held <HI>in Capite,</HI> and no other, as the Doctor has very well observ'd in his Answer to Mr. <HI>P</HI>'s argument from the Petition of the Town of St. <HI>Albans</HI>; so that upon the whole matter there will be no more gain'd by you in this Controversie than that perhaps some Citizens and Burgesses appear'd in Parliament, and constituted a third sort of men, which you may call the Commons, if you please, though I cannot find they were so called, till after the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the First; but supposing this to be so, it is very far from your Republican, levelling opinion, who do suppose that all the Freeholders of <HI>England,</HI> had an ancient indisputable right of appearing in Parliament by reason of their propriety in Lands, or other Estates, whereas by our Hypo∣thesis we suppose the great Council or Parliament to have anciently been the Kings Court-Baron consisting of his immediate Tenants call'd thither by him their Supreme Lord to advertise him of the Grievances of the Nation, and to propose what new Laws were necessary for the publick good of the Commonweal, and together with him to raise such publick Taxes both upon themselves and their Tenants as the necessities of the State requir'd; yet not∣withstanding there is a vast difference between your notion and mine con∣cerning the Rights which such Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> might claim of coming to Parliament, since before King <HI>Iohn's</HI> Charter, (whereby I grant all the lesser Barons or Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were to be Summonld by the Sheriff to come to the Common Council of the Kingdom) the King might have only call'd some of the greatest and wisest of them, and such as he thought most fit to advise him in making Laws, and imposing Taxes upon the Nation. And the like Prerogative his Son <HI>Henry</HI> the Third resumed during the greater part of his Reign, as I shall shew you from divers old Statutes by and by:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.</HI></NOTE> And that our Kings did often take up∣on them to call whom they pleased, and omit whom they pleased of these Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> may appear by those who were called <HI>Pares Baronum,</HI> or <HI>alios Magnates,</HI> who are put after the Barons; and of these there are many instances of their being called to Parliament, and again omitted in several Kings Reigns after the Commons were a third Estate, as represented as at this day.</P>

<P>I must beg your pardon, if I cannot come over to your opinion, notwith∣standing what you now have said; since I do not find your reason to come up to what you intend therein, for you only suppose, (but without any proof) that the words <HI>Populus</HI> and <HI>Communitas</HI> must signifie only Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> in the ancient <HI>Scotish</HI> Charters and Statutes. All the Argument you bring to the contrary is that I cannot shew you any Law by which it was altered to what it is now, and therefore that the Constitution has been always the same as at this day. Now pray consider whether this will not press altogether as hard upon you in relation to <HI>England</HI>; for you cannot shew me any Law whereby the
<PB N="510" REF="275"/>
Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were excluded here, and Knights of Shires introduced in their fleads; and therefore by the same Rule let the <HI>Scottish</HI> Parliaments have been of what they will, yet ours have been still the same they are now. But if you say that this contrary usage hath been introduced either by the Kings Prerogative, or by the silent consent of the People, or by some Law that is now lost are not all the same Arguments to be made use of in the case of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Parliaments; which I may upon as good Grounds suppose to have deviated from their original Constitution as you do that our <HI>English</HI> Parliaments have done it.</P>
<P>So that if those Arguments are of any weight they will serve for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> as well as <HI>Scotland</HI>; but if they are not, it is in vain to make use of them at all. The like I may say as to Burroughs in <HI>Scotland,</HI> since it is as easie to suppose that divers Burroughs in <HI>Scotland</HI> might voluntarily desist from sending their Deputies to Parliament, that did not hold of the King <HI>in Capite</HI>; as it is that divers Burroughs in <HI>England</HI> did Petition to be ex∣empted from sending Burgesses to Parliament, by reason of their inability to pay the Expences of their Burgesses; as I could shew you by divers Prece∣dents, (some of which are in Print) had I now time.</P>
<P>As for the rest of your Discourse I cannot imagin to what it tends; for if the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> had any place in, or right to come to Parliament, how came they to have it, but by reason of the great Freehold Estates they held of the King? and if so, I can see no reason why those that had as good or better Freehold Estates than they should be all excluded; Or why a small Tenant <HI>in Capite</HI> of but one Knights Fee held of the King <HI>in Capite,</HI> should give him a right to a place in Parliament, and get that a Mesne Tenant, or <HI>Vavasour</HI> (as he was then called) who held ten Knights Fees of some Bishop or Abbot, who perhaps did not hold <HI>in Capite</HI> at all, should have no right of appearing there, nor of choosing any Representative for him; since not∣withstanding all you have now said the Doctor either con∣tradicts himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. p.</HI> 68.</NOTE> or you, when he tells us expressly in his An∣swer to Mr. <HI>P.</HI>
<Q>That the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who were no Barons represented only themselves, and not the Commons; but how this will agree with what he says in his Introduction, that the Body of the Commons had no share in making Laws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before 49<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, unless they were represented by thd Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>: and if so must then cer∣tainly represent those that he here calls the Body of the Commons of <HI>England</HI> Collectively taken.</Q></P>
<P>But as for your notion of the Parliament's being the King's Court Baron; tho you have borrowed it of a Learned <HI>Scotch</HI> Lawyer Sir <HI>George Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ensy,</HI> yet let me tell you it was never true, for it is well known that the Great or Common Councils both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> are much more ancient than the Tennres of Lands by Knights Service; or then the very Institution of Mannors in this Kingdom▪ which the Doctor tells us are of no higher an original than the <HI>Norman</HI> Conquest.</P>
<P><PB N="511" REF="275"/>But admit I should allow your notion of the Parliaments being anciently the Kings Court Baron, then certainly all the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> had a right to appear there, and to be not only Suito<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, but Judges of all differences arising among the Tenants in the Lords Court, where neither the Lord him∣self nor his Steward were Judges, and that of right and not by savour; whereas you suppose such a Court-Baron as was never heard of, where the Lord could admit or exclude whom of his Tenants he pleased, to which if they had a right <HI>ratione Tenurae,</HI> certainly he could never do. So that instead of a Court-Baron and a Common Council according to King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter, whereby all the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were to be Summoned to this Council, or pretended Court Baron; you suppose the King still retained a Prerogative of calling or omitting whom he pleased, which instead of confirming the validity of the Charter, and that it was to be a Rule how such Councils should be called for the future; you make to signifie just nothing, and that no Com∣mon Council was ever called according to that Model. But pray shew me a Court-Baron, wherein the Tenants ever took upon themselves a Power of giving Taxes out of their Estates, that did not hold of the mannour, though they were resident within it:
<Q>But indeed you are out in the whole matter, for the Doctor himself grants in his answer to Mr. <HI>P.</HI> when he gives us King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Letters of Summons to a Council directed to the Barons and Knights (and as he translates <HI>Eidelibus</HI>) Feudatories, or Vassals of all <HI>England</HI> wherein he lets them know,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. pag.</HI> 40.</NOTE> that he had sent his Letters to every one of them, if it might have been done:</Q>
Now what reason had he to write thus, if these Gentlemen had no right to be consulted, or that the King might have called or left out whom of them he pleased.
<Q>But the Barons and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> were in another mind, when in the 37th. of King <HI>Hen.</HI> III. as <HI>Mar. Paris</HI> tells us, they refused to Act or Proceed upon any thing, without all the rest of their Peers, divers of whom, it seems the King had for some reasons then omitted to Summon.</Q></P>
<P>But as for your instance of the Barons Peers, or <HI>alios Magnates,</HI> which were somtimes Summoned, and sametimes omitted in the Reigns of our three <HI>Edwards</HI>: You do well to put in, that it was after the times that the Commons were a third Estate; for indeed, it was only after that the Te∣nants <HI>in Capite</HI> had left off making a distinct Council by themselve; which I suppose was about the end of <HI>Henry</HI> III. Reign, and then it is true, the King called several of these Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> (as also others that were not so) by Writ, to the House of Lords, as <HI>Pares Baronum, i. e.</HI> not as real Barons, but Barons-Peers, since a ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Summons by Writ did not as yet, (nor long after) vest a Peerage in their Heirs, so that upon the whole matter, I see no reason from any thing you have urged from the example of <HI>Scotland</HI> to make me change my opinion, that the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were anciently the sole Representatives, either of this or that whole Nation in Parliament; for pray take Notice that I do not find the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> so much as mentioned in the ancient Statutes of that Kingdom, or Charters of their Kings, as the Common Council or Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> before the Reign
<PB N="512" REF="276"/>
of King <HI>Robert</HI> III. which was but late in Comparison of the antiquity of those Councils in that Kingdom.</P>

<P>I could say more as to the Antiquity of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> their coming to Parliament as the sole Reprensentatives of the Nation before the time you mention; but it grows late, and therefore I shall wave it at present, and so shall only proceed to remark that great part of the Errour of the Gentlemen of your Opinion, proceeds from this false ground, that you suppose that the Parliaments, both of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> were a perfect Representative Body of all the Free-houlders and Freemen of those Kingdoms, which is a meer Chymera; for in the first place, if we will consider, it never was, nor indeed is so at this day; since you your self must acknowledge, that all Copy-holders and Lease-holders under Forty Shilling a Year, all Freemen in Towns Corporate▪ where the Elections lies wholly in the Major, and Aldermen, or Common Council; and lastly all that will not pay Scot and Lot in divers Burrough Towns, are utterly excluded from giving their Votes in the choice of Parliament Men; and consequently from having any Representatives in Parliament, though sure as much Freemen as the rest of the Kingdom; and this either by general Statutes, or else by the particular Charters and Customs of those Cities, Towns and Burroughs; all which are lookt upon as good and lawful Representatives of those Cities and Burroughs; so that I am clearly of the Doctor's Opini∣on,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. pag.</HI> 68.</NOTE> that the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> as well those who were Barons as those that were not, only represented themselves, and not the Commons, as being (as you truly observe) never chosen by the People; and as no Man can believe that a great Lord or Bishop could Represent his Mesne Tenants, so neither could the smaller Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> who were no Barons, be properly said to represent theirs; and yet, these might according to the Custom of Feudal Tenures, and the Power they then had over their Tenants Estates, very well make Laws for them, and Tax them at their pleasures, because the main interest and strength of the Kingdom, lay almost wholly in them; and these (as the Doctor very well observes) having the Power of this, or any other Nation <HI>de facto,</HI> always did make Laws for, and Tax the rest of the People.</P>
<P>But to say somewhat to the Authorities you have brought from the County <HI>Palatines</HI> of <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Durham</HI>; I know not what old Priviledges they might pretend to, of not being forced to give Voluntary Aids or Subsidies of their Moveable Goods without their consents; yet this much I think may be made out, that as for all Land Taxes, and the general Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom; they were as much bound by the one, and as much liable to pay to the other, as the rest of the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> or else how came they afterwards to be bound by our general Statutes at all, as certainly they were from all times since the Conquest; though <HI>Chester</HI> had no Representa∣tives in Parliament, till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and <HI>Durham</HI> had none till our times.</P>

<P>You Gentlemen who hold this general notion of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> are so intoxicated with it, that you do not care what absurdities or contra∣dictions
<PB N="513" REF="276"/>
you fall into, provided you may maintain your dear opinion, as I shall shew you by and by: But first let me tell you your Reply to what I have now said, is very fallacious, and in some points mistaken as to the matter of Fact: For in the first place, I doubt not but our Common Councils or Parlia∣ment were in their first institution, the main Body or Representative of all the Freemen of the Nation; and though it may by long continuance of time to deviate from that Institution; yet, that it is to be attributed either to some prevailing Custom, or else positive Law to the contr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry; for it is certain that in the <HI>Saxon</HI> times, all the Free holders of <HI>England</HI> had a right of coming to Parliament in Person; and hence it is, that <HI>Liber Tenens, Li∣ber Homo &amp; Ingenuus</HI> were Synonimous, and of the same signification, as I have proved from Sir <HI>Henry Spelman</HI>'s Comment, in his Glossary upon those words; and hence it is, that the Members of those Councils were so nume∣rous as they were in those times, and long after, till they became so vast and unmanageable, that they were fain by degrees to pitch upon this method, of sending Knights of Shires to represent them, which is certainly a very an∣cient Institution, since the Tenants in Ancient Demean, claimed to be ex∣empted from the Expences of Knights of the Shires by P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iption, as I shall shew you more particularly by and by; and likewise since all Riches consisted in those days in Land, or else in Stock, or Trade, therefore the Cities and Burroughs, and Towns, by reason of their Riches, had always a share in the Legislative Power, as well as in giving of Taxes; and since all such Citizens and Burgesses, not being able to come in Person, as the Free-holders could, were represented either by their chief Magistrates, called their Aldermen, or else by Burgesses of their own chusing as at this day; so that all Freedom, or Ingenuity being in this, as in all other Common∣wealths, reckon <HI>per censum,</HI> by the Estates of the owners; our Common Councils were, and that truly, the Representatives, not only of the Estates, but Persons of all the Freemen of the Nation, for I am so far of the Doctor's Opinion, that the Cheorl Folk (as they were then termed) were little bet∣ter than the <HI>Scotch</HI> Vassals or <HI>French</HI> Peasants at this day▪ and so were not Reckoned among the Freemen; all Freedom consisting then in so much Free∣hold Lands, held in a Mans own right, or being Freemen of some City or Burrough Town; and this gives us a reason why Copy-holders and Te∣nants for years, have no Vote in Parliament at this day; since it is certain, (and all our Law Books allow it), that at the first all Copy-hold Estates were held by Villenage, and the owners of them at first the <HI>Villani,</HI> or Tillers of the Demefnes of the Lord of that Town, there being at first no Free-hold less then that of a whole Township, since a Mannour; and therefore all Copy-holders and Tenants for years, or at Will, though Freemen are not admitted to have Votes at this day, because (as I said before) Freedom anci∣ently consisted in the Inheritance or Free-hold Estate of Land, or in Riches, in Trade or Traffick; Leases for Life and Years, being not known, or at least not commonly in Use in those days; and hence it is, that when Estates of Free-hold came to be divided into small Parcels, all Free-holders till the Statutes of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and VI. (which we have before cited) were as much
<PB N="514" REF="277"/>
capable of giving their Votes at the Election of Knights of Shires, as the best and greatest Tenant <HI>in Capite</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> till it was reduced by those Statutes to 40 <HI>s.</HI> Freehold <HI>per Annum</HI>; these Freeholders and Burgesses of Towns being anciently looked upon in the Eye of the Law as the only Free∣men; and it was these Freeholders alone who owed Suit and Service to the County, Court, and were amerced if they did not appear.</P>
<P>This being premised, and sufficiently understood, will give us a very good account, why Copy-holder and Lease-holders for years do not give any Votes at Elections of Knights of Shires; and yet the Parliament may still continue the Representative of all the Freemen of the Nation, as the People of <HI>Rome</HI> and the Territories about it were of all the <HI>Romans,</HI> though there were a great many <HI>Liberti,</HI> and in <HI>Inqui lini,</HI> who sure were Freemen, and not Slaves, and yet had no Votes in theirs <HI>Comitiis Centuriatis,</HI> or general Assemblies of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Citizens.</P>
<P>But that the <HI>Liberi homines, &amp; Libere Tenentes de Regno,</HI> must take in more than your Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> the Doctor himself is at last for∣ced to confess in his Glossary (notwithstanding his maintain∣ing the contrary in the body of his Book) <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Liberi Homines,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tit. Liberi Homines &amp; Libere Ten.</HI> p.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; Libere Tenentes</HI> mentioned in <HI>Iohn</HI>'s <HI>Magna Char∣ta,</HI> were not only the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> but their Retinue and Tenants in Military Service also, and whom he there supposes to have been then the only men of Honour, Faith and Reputation in the Kingdom, and if so might certainly have been chosen Knights of Shires as well as any of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>; though this is but <HI>Argumentum ad Hominem</HI>; for the truth is that the Mesne Tenants by Military Service were not the only men of Faith, and Honour in those times, since it is certain the Kings Tenants in <HI>Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yt Serjeantry,</HI> and of some Honour or Castle, or else his Tenants in Socage, besides those who held of other Mesne Lords; and the Tenants of those Abbots and Priors, who did not hold <HI>in Capite,</HI> and yet were very numerous, were men of as much Faith and Honour as those that did; since many of them possest as good if not better Estates than the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> themselves▪ so that you are certainly mistaken in matter of Fact when you say the whole force and strength of the Nation lay in their hands; for if you mean Legal force, I have already proved, that the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> had no Legal right to give away the Estates of their Mesne Tenants, or to make Laws for them without their consents, who were altogether as free as themselves, <HI>Servitiis suis debitis solum-modo exceptis,</HI> as <HI>Bracton</HI> tells us, much less for so great a Body of Men as I now mentioned, who never held of them at all, and consequent∣ly could not upon your own Hypothesis, be ever represented by them; but if you mean a Physical strength, or force, though this can give no Natural, much less Legal right for one Man to Lord it over another: yet even this was much farther from truth, since the Mesne Tenants of all sorts, as well by Military Service as in Socage, together with those above mentioned: who never held of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> at all, made six times a greater Body of Men, both for numbers as well as Estates, then all the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> taken together.</P>
<P><PB N="515" REF="277"/>But to conclude, neither is your remark upon my Authorities from <HI>Gheller</HI> and <HI>Durham</HI> at all to the purpose; for I have sufficiently proved, that those County <HI>Palatines,</HI> were not at first concluded within the general Laws and Taxes of the Kingdom; since they had their particular Councils for both within themselves, as the Supplication of the Estates of the County <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Chester,</HI> sufficiently declares; and certainly <HI>Durham</HI> had the like Privi∣ledges, since I never heard that the Men in that County were more Slaves to their Bishop, then the <HI>Cheshire</HI> Men to their Earl; and tho I grant that about the confused Times of King <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. there was a great breach made on the an∣cient Liberties of these two Counties <HI>Palatines,</HI> and if the King and Parlia∣ment made Laws for, and Levyed Taxes upon them, though they had no Representatives therein, this proceeded partly from their being over-pow∣ered by the rest of the Nation, and partly by the ease they found in be∣ing excused from the Expences of Knights of Shires, and Burgesses, which all the rest of the Kingdom, was at that time liable to, and which came to a great deal of Money (Four shillings <HI>per diem,</HI> being in those days, more then Forty Shillings now,) and yet you see at last they were aware of their Errour, and at their request, got the Priviledge of having Representatives in Parliament of their own choosing, as well as the rest of the Kingdom; and if this had not been a certain right of <HI>English</HI> Subjects, how came the <HI>Welsh</HI> Counties, which were anciently no part of the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> to have been admitted to choose one Knight for each County, and Burgesses for each Burrough Town, as well in <HI>North Wales,</HI> as <HI>South Wales,</HI> though both these were Conquered Countries at the first, and incorporated to <HI>England</HI> by particular Statutes; and therefore we have no reason to deny the Truth of <HI>Bracton</HI>'s and <HI>Fortescue</HI>'s assertion, that no Laws are made nor Taxes imposed in <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.

<P>I will proceed to do it, and for this end shall reduce my Arguments to these three Heads, the first is, some Writs found out and produced by the Doctor, whereby he proves that the Commons were not Summoned during the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. till the 49th. secondly the general silence of all Sta∣tutes in <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</HI> III. Reign; wherein is not one word mentioned of the Com∣mons, but rather to the contrary, thirdly the critical Time (<HI>viz.</HI> in the 49th. of <HI>Hen.</HI> III.) when the Commons were first called, during <HI>Monsfords</HI> Rebel∣lion, fourthly, their discontinuance from that time, till the 18th, of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. there being no mention made of them in all the rest of the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. nor yet of <HI>Ed.</HI> I. till the 18th. in which the Doctor shews you a Writ (not taken notice of before) by which the Commons were Summoned, a new to Parlia∣ment:
<PB N="516" REF="278"/>
Lastly, from the uncertainty of the manner of the Writs of Summons, whether for one Knight or two Knights, and sometimes no Citizens and Bur∣gesses at all, which sufficiently prove the Novelty of the Institution, as al∣so of some Parliamentary Forms relating to the Commons, which shew that neither their number nor manner of Election was settled long after the Reign of <HI>Edw.</HI> I.</P>
<P>To begin therefore with the first Head. I know the Gentlemen of your opinion make a great Noise about the loss, or rather defect of the Writs of Summons, and Parliament Rolls of all the Kings, till the 23d. or 25th. of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. So that we cannot be so well assured what was done in Parliaments of those times, as we may be afterwards: Yet there are still some Writs of Summons Extant upon the Close Rolls before and in those times,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. p.</HI> 87. <HI>&amp; dein.</HI></NOTE> by which the Bishops, Earls and Barons, were Sum∣moned to Parliaments or great Councils. And we have all the Close Rolls of King <HI>Iohn</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> III. on the <HI>Dorse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> of which anciently, most of the Writs of Summons to the Commons in other King's Reigns, are entred (few on the Patent Rolls which we have likewise.) 'Tis therefore very strange, if the Commons were then repre∣sented by Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, and Summoned to Parliament as at this day, that there cannot be found any Summons to them upon these Rolls, as well as to the Lords.</P>
<P>But the Learned Doctor hath for our Satisfaction, found out three Writs of Summons to the Lords, one in King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Reign, and two other of <HI>Hen</HI> III. The first is in the Close Roll▪ 6th. of King <HI>Iohn</HI> directed to the Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M.</HI> 3. <HI>dors.</HI></NOTE> which is needless here to be repeated <HI>Verbatim,</HI> only pray take notice of the materi∣al words of this Writ, where after the Cause of the Summons particularly expres'd, it concludes thus, <HI>expedit habere vestrum Consilium &amp; aliorum Mag∣natum Terrae nostrae quos ad diem ilium &amp; Locum fecimus convo∣cari.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M.</HI> 13. <HI>dors.</HI></NOTE> The second is in the Close Roll of the 26th. <HI>Hen.</HI> III directed to <HI>W.</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>York,</HI> wherein he is likewise Summoned <HI>ad tractandum, Nobiscum una cum caeteris Magnatibus nostris quos similiter fecimus convoca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i de arduis Negotiis nostris statum nostrum &amp; totius Regni nostri specialiter tangentibus</HI>; with this note underneath <HI>eodem modo Scri∣bitur omnibus Episcopis, Abbatibus, Comitibus &amp; Baronibus.</HI></P>
<P>The third is of the 38th. of the same King directed to <HI>Boniface</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Cl.</HI> 38. Hen. 3. <HI>M.</HI> 14. <HI>dors. de Magnatibus vocatis al Con∣cilium.</HI></P>

<PB N="517" REF="278"/>
who were the Constituent parts of this Parliament may be be farther made out by a Letter of the Queen, and Earl <HI>Richard</HI> to the King then in <HI>Gascony,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Additament.</HI> fol. 189. <HI>N.</HI> 50.</NOTE> which is recited by <HI>Mat.

Whereby it appears who were then the Constituent parts of Members of our <HI>English</HI> Parliaments, <HI>viz.</HI> the Arch∣bishops, Bishops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Earls and Barons of the Kingdom. So that there is no such Universal silence concerning the Constituent Parts of our Parliaments, as you and those of your Party, suppose from the loss of the Parliament Rolls of those times, most of which, though I confess are lost, yet there are enough left to satisfie any reasonable Person, that there were then no Commons in Parliament in the sense they are now taken.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot give me a better demonstration of the loss of the Parlia∣ment Rolls and Writs of Summons than what you now offer, for if we have all the Close Rolls of King <HI>Iohn</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> III. on the <HI>Dorses.</HI> of which you tell me, the Writs of Summons use to be entered, then certainly those to the Lords were there entered also, and if so; how comes it to pass that in above Eighty Years time, in which there must be above Eighty Parliaments, you can shew me but three Writs of Summons, and those only to as many Bishops, and to no Temporal Lords at all: If so be these were Parliaments and not great Councils of the Bishops, Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only, as I rather believe they were, for you rely too much upon you Doctors credit, when you alledge that we have all the Close Rolls of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> III, which is a great mistake, for I have had a Friend who has given me a note of what Close Rolls are still Extant in those Reigns, and what are lost which you may here see.</P>
<P>To begin with King <HI>Iohn,</HI> pray observe that all the Close Rolls of the first Five years of his Reigns are gone, and so they are in the 9th. 10th. 11th. 12th. and 13th. for certainly, there were some in those, as well as in the succeeding years: In the next place till the 18th. there is but one Roll left of each year, but then there are three; and after that but one or two in a year to the very end; now pray tell me, how we can be assured that there was not more then one Roll in every precedent year, as well as in the 15th. the like I may say for the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. which though I grant are more entire then those of King <HI>Iohn</HI>; there being some left us of every year but the 23d. yet they are but a few; and for the greatest part but one in each year, never but two in any year in all this long Reign, unless it be the 39th. in which there are four, which is very strange, that in so busie a time, as most of this Kings Reign was; there should be no more Rolls left, and therefore it seems very probable, that at least half are lost, and in which might be many Summons, as well to the Commons, as to the Lords, and if they are not lost, pray tell me what is become of all the Writs of Summons to your lesser Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who certainly often met
<PB N="518" REF="279"/>
in this long Reign according to King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter, but if you will tell me they are lost, or omitted to be entred upon the Close Rolls, I may with like reason and certainty affirm the same of the Writs of Sum∣mons to the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, for if the one may be lost, sure the other may be so too.</P>
<P>But what if after all, these Writs you have produced were not any Sum∣mons to a Common Council or Parliament at all, but only to a great Coun∣cil of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> which I have great reason to believe, not only because the Title to the last Writ is only <HI>Summonitio ad Concilium,</HI> and not <HI>Commune Concilium Regni,</HI> but also because Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pryn,</HI> who certainly must have seen all these Writs as well as the Doctor, and were as able to Judge of them, never cite them for Summons to Parliament, and Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> observes of several Writs, in which the like words of Summoning the Lords to give their advice, are likewise found, that they were only to such Councils, or Treatises which were frequently used as Low as the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> II. but if these Writs had been Summons to Parliament, sure Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> had no reason to bewail (as they so often do) the loss, of not only of Parliament Rolls, but of all Writs of Summons, both to Lords and Commons (except those of 49th. <HI>Hen.</HI> III.) till the 23d. of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. But pray go on if you please to make good the rest of the positions you have now laid down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not but in the next place to shew you (though 'tis true, most of our Parliament Rolls are lost) both from our ancient Historians and Statutes, that there were no Commons in any Parliament, during all the long Reign of King <HI>Hen.</HI> III. except in the 49th. of that King.</P>
<P>I shall begin with the first Act of Parliament we have of the time of <HI>Henry</HI> III. which was made in the 20th. of this King at <HI>Merton,</HI> where though it is said, <HI>to be provided and granted, as well by the Arch-bishops, Bishops, Earls, Ba∣rons, as others,</HI> yet the words <HI>&amp; Aliis</HI> and others are to be understood of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> distinct from the Earls and Barons, as I have already proved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall answer your Authorities as you go, you may say you have proved it, but I know not when; and why may not I with as good a Face maintain, that these words <HI>&amp; Aliis</HI> do here signifie the Commons, if the word Ba∣rons must take in all the great Lords and lesser Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> as sometimes you suppose it doth, when no other Lay-Members are mentioned; but I have already observed, that this <HI>Barones</HI> is a Cheveral word, and to be stretch'd, or contracted as best suits with your Hypothesis. So I think I may with greater reason, suppose the Earls and Barons to be all comprehended under the word <HI>Barones,</HI> and the Commons under <HI>Aliis,</HI> as I have already proved; and which is also most suitable to the last Clause of <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. But you forget that I have I think sufficiently made out, that the Com∣mons had their Representatives, both at the making and confirming of <HI>Mag∣na Charta</HI> in 2d. and 9th. of <HI>Henry</HI> III. and therefore whatever proofs you bring to the contrary, will come to late; though I shall patiently hear what you have to say, but if you have no more Authorities to produce from
<PB N="519" REF="279"/>
Statutes and Records, which have not been already considered: Pray proceede to the 49th. of this Kings Reign, and give me some reasons why the Commons were called in that year, and never before nor after, till the 18th. of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. for they both seem to me very improbable suppositions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall observe your Commands, and shall give you as short an ac∣count as I can of this transaction: First, therefore I desire you to take no∣tice, that after <HI>Simon Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fort</HI> and the rest of the Barons of his Faction had taken King <HI>Hen.</HI> III.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. p.</HI> 134. <HI>&amp; dein.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwall</HI> the King's Brother, with many other of the Nobi∣lity Prisoners at the Battle of <HI>Lewes.</HI> He carried them about with Him, till they had taken in all the strong Forts and Castles of the Land, and when this was done, <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> tells us, that calling together at <HI>London,</HI> the Bishops, Earls and Barons of that Faction, which so seditiously held their King Prisoner, they began to set up a Committee for the Government of the Kingdom consisting of Twelve Lords, who were chosen out of the whole Community or Body of the Baronage, without whose advice and con∣sent, or at least of Three of them no affairs in the King's Houshould, or in the Kingdom should be transacted; and to these Ordinances, the King and his Son were forced to agree; and though the Record of this Agreement recites that this Ordinance▪<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Pat.</HI> 48. Hen. III. <HI>M.</HI> 6. <HI>Dorso.</HI></NOTE> was made at <HI>London,</HI> by the consent, good<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liking and Command of the King, and also of the <HI>Prelates,</HI> Barons, and of the Commu∣nity there present, yet I am not yet convinc'd, that by the word <HI>Communitas</HI> in the <HI>Latin</HI> Record, is to be understood the Commons, but the Community of the whole Kingdom, since this Agreement is Signed only by some great Earls and Barons, and no Commoner witness to it, but the Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> whom your self will grant, was no Parliament Man.</P>
<P>After which, <HI>Simon Montfort,</HI> the better to settle himself in his Usurpt Power, and in those Lands and Castles which himself, and those of his Faction, had unjustly wrested from Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> who was now also a Pri∣soner, having delivered himself as a Hostage for the Performance of this forc'd Peace; they in the first place sent out Writs in the King's Name, unto di∣vers Bishops, Abbots and Priors, and to such of the Noblemen as were of their own Party▪ to appear at <HI>Westminster</HI> on the Octaves of St. <HI>Hillary</HI> next ensuing and the Doctor hath given us a Copy of the Writ of Summons to the Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

then of the Faction, and made by them, for 'tis there said only <HI>quod venire faciar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> There are also other Writs recited to have been directed to all the great Cities and Towns of <HI>England,</HI> as also to the Cinque Ports, to send two of the most Legal and Discreet of each of the said Cities, Burroughs, Towns and Cinque Ports to the said Parliament at <HI>Westminster,</HI> at the time aforesaid. So that without the History of this Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of time, these Writs (which are said to be for the Delivery of the Prince out of Prison, and for the settling of tranquility and Peace in the Nation,) cannot be understood.</P>
<P>But Prince <HI>Edward</HI>'s Release could not be agreed upon in this Parliament, whatever other Business might be dispatched: So that things still remained in this uncertain condition (the King being all this time a meer Shadow) until such time as <HI>Simon Montfort,</HI> and <HI>Gilbert de Clare</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester</HI> falling out, the latter, at last took up Arms, and joyning with the Earles of <HI>Surry</HI> and <HI>Pembroke,</HI> to whom also came Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> after he had made his Escape from <HI>Hereford,</HI> they altogether raised considerable Forces against <HI>Monfort,</HI> who meeting them, and joyning Battle near <HI>Evesham, Monfort</HI> with one of his Sons, and many other Lords and Knights were Slain, and all his Party routed.</P>
<P>Now pray tell me if this is not a very clear account from the History of the matter of Fact, why the Commons were first called to Parliament by <HI>Monfort</HI> during his Rebellion; and I think I can also give you very good reasons (and Authorities to back them) why they were again discontinued all the rest of this Kings Reign, untill the 18th. of <HI>Edward.</HI> I.</P>

<P>I shall tell you my opinion of your Narrative by and by, but in the mean time pray satisfie me in one or two Questions, pray Sir, what may be the reason, that we can find but twenty three Earls and Barons Summoned, of that great number there was then, and only to thirteen Bishops in this Parlia∣ment, and yet at the same time there should be summoned above an hun∣dred Abbots and Priors, and but five Deans of Cathedral Churches; pray why might not these numerous Barons be trusted as well as all the Abbots and Priors?</P>

<P>As for his not Summoning all the the Earls, Barons and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> but putting Knights of Shires and Burgesses in their rooms,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. p.</HI> 143.</NOTE> there may be a very good reason given for it, <HI>viz.</HI> the danger that <HI>Simon Monford</HI> and his Privado's appre∣hended from the too great Concourse of the Nobility, and their great Reti∣nue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ and the Example of his own and the Barons Practices at <HI>Oxford</HI> in the Parliament of 42<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third might be the cause why they al∣tered the ancient Usage; and of their sending Writs out, commanding the Sheriffs of each County as also the Cities and Burghs to send two Knights. Citizens and Burgesses respectively. But the Reason why there was so many Abbots and Priors Summoned was,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> 139.</NOTE> be∣cause <HI>Simon Monfort</HI> thought himself sure of them; He was a great Zealot, and a Godly Man in those times, and a great Minion of these Religious men (as then called) as also of the Bishops and Clergy, and they were at least seemingly Great Favourites of his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="521" REF="280"/>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess there is some colour of Reason, why <HI>Simon Monfort</HI> should Summon so many Abbots and Priors to this Parliament if he were sure of all their Votes before hand, but there is no certainty of this, for if he had been so sure of them, there was as much reason why he should have called them all likewise to the Parliament at <HI>London,</HI> which you say he Sum∣moned the year before, when with the Consents of the Bishops, Barons and others, he made the new Ordinances you mention; but you cannot find in any Historian, or Record, that he then Summoned so many of them, and it seems pretty strange, that all these Abbots and Priors. and Deans, not a fourth part of which were Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> should all take the trouble to come to this Parliament without any scruple, if neither they nor their Predecessors had ever been Summoned before.</P>
<P>But the other reason you give why so many Earls and Barons should be omitted, is much more unlikely, for if the numerous Barons Factious Pra∣ctices at <HI>Oxford</HI> had before frustrated, <HI>Monfort</HI>'s designs, there had been in∣deed some reason why he should have done, all he could to have hindered their coming again; whereas on the contrary the Earls and Barons at the Parliament at <HI>Oxford,</HI> though they came thither with Arms and great Re∣tinues, yet it was only to joyn with him, and to force the King to agree to the <HI>Oxford</HI> Provisions. But if the Commons were now Summon'd (as you suppose) to curb the extravagant Power of the Lords, yet it could not be his Interest, or indeed in his Power so to do, not the latter, because the Earls, Barons and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> were too powerful and numerous a body to have suffered such an affront and breach on their Right, as this was. Nor could he and his two and twenty Companions have ever dared, to have displeased so great and powerful a body of men, as you must allow your great Barons and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>▪ both great and small then were, and who made such a powerful opposition for their Liberties in King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s time, or that they would have thus tamely permitted men wholly of the Sheriffs choice to have thus taken away their places in Parliament, and made Laws for them, much less the Citizens and Burgesses, most of whom were certainly not Noble by Birth, nor yet held Lands <HI>in Capite</HI>; nor could it be for <HI>Mon∣fort</HI>'s Interest so to do; for the greatest part of the Earls, and Barons were of his side already, and thus to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>clude them, had been the only way to disoblige them, and make them leave him, and go over to the King's side: So that I must needs tell you upon the whole matter, granting <HI>Monfort</HI> to have been such a Knave and Hypocrite as you make him, yet certainly he was no Fool, but a great Politician and I leave it to your self, or any indif∣ferent person to judge whether it was possible for him to do so silly and un∣politick a thing as this. For granting all the Abbots and Priors to have been of his side (as you suppose) they could no way counterballance the great Power of those Earls and Barons, and numerous Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> that were all hereby excluded. So that let the Commons have been Summoned when you will, it was certainly before this 49<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, or not at all.</P>
<P><PB N="522" REF="281"/>But to give you my opinion why so few Earls and Barons are mentioned in this Record of the 49 of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3<HI>d</HI> to have been Summon'd to this Parlia∣ment; I conceive it was not out of any jealousie or suspition in <HI>Simon Mon∣fort</HI> of those who were then his fast Friends but out of pure carelesness, or omission of the Clerks; who I suppose through hast, inadvertency, or multiplicity of business omitted to enter the names of all the rest of the Earls, Bishops and Barons, to whom Writs of Summons were likewise sent, and that I do not speak without Book, I appeal to the Record it self; where there is a blank space left unfill'd of about four Inches breadth which could be left for no other end than to add the names of all the rest of the Earls and Barons who were certainly Summoned to that Parliament as well as those whose names are there expressed.</P>

<P>I shall not longer dispute this point, but I think you must grant that the Commons are never mentioned in any Record or Statute of this King; for after his Victory at <HI>Evesham</HI> he called a Parliament at <HI>Winchester,</HI> whereto we do not find any Commons Summoned, as before, but the King by the advice of his <HI>Magnates</HI> alone, Seised the Liberties of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and also they gave Him all the Lands of the late Rebels.</P>
<P>And then there was after this a Parliament Summoned at <HI>Kenelworth,</HI> in the 50<HI>th.</HI> of this King, where it was agreed by the common assent of the Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, and <HI>all others,</HI> that six Persons who were all (except one) either Bishops or Barons, should chuse six others and the whole twelve were to judge concerning those who were disinherited for their late Rebellion, and their Determination or Award, is call'd <HI>Dictum de Ke∣nelworth,</HI> and was made to better the condition of the disinherited, and to turn the Forfeitures and Loss of their Estates into a Composition for them after the value of five years Purchase, to be paid at two or three short pay∣ments, yet we do not find that to this Parliament the Commons were at all Summoned, but to the contrary; for though it is true that the Statute gives us all their Names. Yet the Doctor further proves to you from Sir <HI>William Dugdale</HI>'s Baronage, that there was not one of them, but what was either a Bishop or a great Baron of the Kingdom; whereas had there been any Commons in this Parliament, they would certainly have had Commissi∣oners of their own order as well as the Bishops and Lords.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall give you a short answer to your Authorities from the Parlia∣ments of <HI>Winchester</HI> and <HI>Kenelworth</HI>; as for the former you must own that all the Rolls of it are lost;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.A.P. p.</HI> 144.</NOTE> and that there is no more left of it on Record than that Writ or Commis∣sion which the Doctor has given us, which recites that by the unanimous con∣sent of all the <HI>Magnatum,</HI> or great Men (as the Doctor renders it) the King had the seisin and possession of all the Rebels Estates given to him; which is no argument to prove that no Commons were there; since I have so often made out that under this word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Magnatum</HI> not only the Knights of Shires, but Citizens and Burgesses were often comprehended: 'Tis true there are no Writs extant to prove the Commons were now Summoned; neither is there any reason to believe the contrary; since if it were a cunning inventi∣on
<PB N="523" REF="281"/>
of <HI>Montfort</HI> to Summon the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses to abate the power of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> it was sure as good policy for this King to continue so politick an Institution, which would for the future serve for so good a ballance; not only against his Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> but his great Lords. also, as for the Parliament at <HI>Kenelworth,</HI> I shall admit all the matter of Fact to be true as you have related it from <HI>Mat. Westminster,</HI> who says, that the Twelve Commissioners appointed to draw up the Statute of <HI>Kenelworth,</HI> were chosen <HI>de Potentioribus Procerum, &amp; Prudentioribus Praelatorum,</HI> and also that the <HI>French</HI> Record (cited by the Doctor) together with Sir <HI>William Dugdale</HI>'s Comment upon it make it out plain enough that the Lay▪Com∣missioners who were chosen by all the parties there named, to make this Statute, were all great Earls and Barons, though in the Record it self only stil'd Knights.</P>
<P>Well, what follows from all this? that the Commons could have no hand in this choice, because the <HI>tous Autres,</HI> or <HI>omnes Alii</HI> mentioned in this, and other Records must needs always signifie the smaller sort of Tenants <HI>in Ca∣pite</HI>; and I say it signifies the Commons as now taken; whether you have made good your Interpretation by any cogent proofs I must leave to your own ingenuity; for to tell you the truth, I think your Doctor has led you astray in this point; and till you can make it out better than you have done, I must beg your pardon if I keep my old opinion; and if your Ar∣gument be good, that no Commoners were there, because none of them were chosen Commissioners, then by the same Argument none of the small Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were there neither; because none under the degree of an Earl or Baron were Elected. As for the want of Writs of Summons to these Parliaments if that were to be the rule, that makes as much against the rest of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who were no Barons, nay the ve∣ry Bishops and Abbots, and Lords, since there is no Writs of Summons found for their appearance at either of these Parliaments; and so the King might call whom he pleased.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place it does not follow that because <HI>Montfort</HI> had Summon∣ed some of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> to appear for all the rest; and that he also called some Citizens and Burgesses to this Parliament of the 49<HI>th.</HI> yet the King might have very good reasons (though we cannot now positively tell what they were,) nor to follow this new Invention of <HI>Monforts,</HI> however it might then serve the turn; for perhaps the King did not like it because introduced by a Rebel. And he had also by his Victory at <HI>Evesham</HI> so quell∣ed the power of the great Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> that I believe he was afterwards able to call or omit whom of them he pleased, according to the Testimony of Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI>'s Nameless Manuscript Author, cited in his <HI>Brittania</HI>; that after the horrid troubles and confusions of the Barons Wars, only those Earls and Barons, <HI>Quibus Rex dignatus est brevia Summonitionis di∣rigere venirent ad Parliamentum suum, &amp; non Alii.</HI></P>
<P>And that this was true in matter of Fact, I shall prove from the next Statute of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. which is extant, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bridge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

more Summoned than some of the more <HI>Discr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t</HI> of the <HI>Greater</HI> and <HI>Less<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Barons,</HI> as appears by these words in the Preface to that Statute, <HI>Convocatis Discretioribus ejusdem Regni tam Majoribus quam Minoribus, Brovisum est; &amp; Statutum ac concordatum, &amp;c.</HI> which seems to have been done by the King's particular direction since by the general Writ of Summons provided by King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter, the Sheriff of each County was to Summon all the Minor Barons, and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> which could not be, if only the more Dis∣creet were then Summoned, nor is there in this Preamble, the least Hint or Intimation of any Writs directed to Counties, Cities or Burghs for the Choice of Members.</P>
<P>I desire you in the next place to take notice that <HI>Britton</HI> (who lived about that time) supposes this Statute to have been made,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.A.P. Pag.</HI> 95.</NOTE> <HI>Per la Purveance de Robert Walerand &amp; per Com∣mune Assent des Graunts Seigneurs du Realme.</HI> By the Procurement or Forecast of <HI>Robert Walerand,</HI> and by common assent of the Great Lords of the Realm, without any mention of the Commons. I have a great many more such Sta∣tutes to instance in which are said by <HI>M. Paris</HI> to have been made in several Parliaments of this King, by the <HI>Community,</HI> or <HI>Common Vniversity</HI> or <HI>Baro∣nage</HI> of the whole Kingdom, but I pass them by because we have sufficiently debated most of them already.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If only some of your Great Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> could thus meet, and make Laws to bind all the rest, and they so tamely put up this strange Infringement of their Priviledges as you suppose, it seems their Power was much abated since the 37<HI>th.</HI> year of this King, when (as I said) <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> tells us, that the Barons would do <HI>nothing without</HI> the rest of their Peers, whom it seems the King had then omitted to Summon; and there∣fore I must needs tell you, that I am not of your Doctors opinion, nor yet of <HI>Cambden</HI>'s nameless Author, that this King after his victory over <HI>Montfort</HI> and his Adherents could by his Prerogative call, or omit what Peers he pleased, since it is contrary to the Declaration of all the Bishops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. <HI>Sir</HI> R. Cotton<HI>'s Col∣lection of Re∣cords in this Year.</HI></NOTE> Abbots, and Priors in Full Parliament, 2 <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. wherein they claimed,
<Q>That holding <HI>per Baronium</HI>▪ it did belong to them, <HI>de Iure &amp; consuetudine R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gni Angliae</HI> (that is, by Rights of Prescription) to be present in all Parlia∣ments as Peers of the Realm, and to treat, consult and or∣dain concerning the Affairs of the Kingdom;</Q>
and if the Spiritual Lords claimed this Priviledge, sure the Temporal Barons might with the like right have made the like claim, and I am sure it is highly derogato∣ry to the Rights of the Peerage of <HI>England</HI> to maintain that the King ei∣ther hath, or ever had the power of calling and leaving out what Lords he plea∣sed, and so to make pack'd Parliaments to serve a turn when ever he pleases.</P>
<P>But to come to the main strength of your Argument, that because the more <HI>Discreet men</HI> of the Kingdom <HI>of the Greater</HI> as well <HI>of the less<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> are only mentioned in this Statute; that therefore there were only called to it such Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> as the King pleased to Summon, and that all the rest were left out; which is a very idle Supposition; for at this rate,
<PB N="525" REF="282"/>
may as well say, that there were no Temporal Barons there at all, and that by the <HI>Greater discreet m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> are to be understood some of the Bishops and Judges; who tho no Peers▪ yet were then the most Learned in the Laws and Customs of the Kingdom of any persons at that time, and consequently the <HI>most wise and discreet</HI> to draw up Laws, and by the lesser sort of discreet men, shall be understood such <HI>Great Clerks</HI> and <HI>Lawyers,</HI> tho not <HI>Tenants in Capite;</HI> as the King pleased to chuse, as being likewise most able to advise him. But if you tell me that this Interpretation is forced; I may as well say the same of yours, and that with greater reason. Yet I shall prove that this Parliament was Summoned in no other manner, and consisted of no other persons than those that used to appear in all other preceding Great Councils or Parliaments. In the first place therefore I must put you in mind of what I have already said, that there is no conclusion to be drawn from the bare penning of the different Forms of ancient Statutes, who were Summoned to the making of them, nor by what power they were Enacted; some of them it is true, being drawn in the form of the Kings Charters, or Writs; without any mention of the Assent either of the Lords or Commons, and others are said to be Enacted by the whole Realm without any mention of the King at all; and I have given you a List of divers old Statutes from the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. to the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. in which there is no men∣tion at all made, either of the King, or any other of the three Estates; and yet no Man I think but will grant that these Statutes were all made, and agreed to by them according to the usual Forms, tho it be not particulaly ex∣pressed, and therefore to give a better account of this Law, it is fit we con∣sider, that these words <HI>convocatis Discretioribus Regni,</HI> are no more restri∣ctive to some particular Persons, then if it had been in the Superlative De∣gree, and instead of <HI>Discretioribus,</HI> it had bin <HI>Discretissimis,</HI> or <HI>Sapientissimis Regni,</HI> which no Man would interpret to mean only a few of those whom the King should judge the wisest and most discret Men of the whole Kingdom; and therefore we must not mind the Grammatical, but Legal sence of these words, and then it amounts to no more than this, that by the <HI>Greater discreet Men,</HI> were meant the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, as under the lesser <HI>Discreet Men</HI> were included the Commons.</P>
<P>But that these <HI>Minores Descreti</HI> cannot be understood of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only, appears by the conclusion of the Preface to this Statute of <HI>Marle-bridge</HI> in these words: <HI>Provisiones, Ordinationes, &amp; Statuta subscripta <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b omnibus Regni ipsius incalis, tam majoribus, quam Minoribus, firmiter &amp; in∣violabiliter temporibus perpetuis Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> observari;</HI> so that if by the <HI>Majores I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>colae,</HI> who were to observe these Statutes, the Lords Spiritual and Tempo∣ral are meant, then by the <HI>Minores Incolae Regni</HI> must be understood by the same reason the whole Commons of <HI>England</HI>; and so likewise for Parity of reason by the <HI>Minores Discreti,</HI> mentioned before in the Preface, must be also meant the Representatives of the Commons in Parliament.</P>
<P>And that this alone can be the genuine sense of these Words, may appear by comparing this Statute with another made at <HI>Gloucester</HI> the 6th. of <HI>Edward</HI> I. where in the Preface it is recited in these words, <HI>purvenant
<PB N="526" REF="283"/>
m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sm le Roy, pur Amendement de son Royalme, &amp; pur pluis plenier exhibicion de droit sicome le profit d'office demande, appelles les pluis Discretes de son Royalme auxibien des Greindres, come des meindres, establie est, &amp; acordan'ment ordeine.</HI> So that if the Commons were there called to this Parliament, and if by the <HI>Greindres Discretes</HI> were understood the Lords, then by the like rea∣son under <HI>Meindres Discretes</HI> must be meant the Commons as at this day.</P>
<P>But that this Statute was made by the Common Council of the Kingdom, and not by a Conventicle of a few of the Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> Sum∣moned <HI>ad Libitum Regis,</HI> appears by all the original Writs, founded upon seve∣ral branches of this Statute, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch are to be seen in the Re∣gister; reciting that this Statute was made <HI>de Communi Con∣cilio Regni.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 171, 174, 175.</NOTE> Now the word <HI>Commune</HI> signifies no more than General; and how could this be call'd a General Council, which only consisted of a few of the wiser sort of Bishops, Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>?</P>
<P>As for what you and the Doctor cite out of <HI>Cambden</HI>'s Nameless Author of King <HI>Henry</HI>'s, sending Writs of Summons, and culling out a few of the Earls and Barons out of a great multitude that were Seditious after the War with the Barons was ended; if you will have it extend to those who never forfeited by reason of <HI>Montfort</HI>'s Rebellion. I need not say much to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 590.</NOTE> since Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his Titles of Honour hath suf∣ficiently baffled that Authors authority, for if it was never true as to Earls, it was not like to be truer in respect of the greater Barons. But as for your lesser Barons or Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>; I know not but he might be much more in the right in respect of them.</P>
<P>What you say as to <HI>Robert Walrand</HI> is not much material, for tho he was never so great a Baron or Lawyer, yet he could draw up this Law, but as be∣ing one of the Kings Council, who in those days drew up, and prepared all Bills that were offered in Parliament. And thus <HI>Britton</HI> might well say, that this was made by the <HI>Common Assent</HI> of the Grand <HI>Seigneurs</HI> (this Act being so highly for their advantage) and yet the Commons might be also there as well as the Great Lords; for otherwise if <HI>Britton</HI> must be literally under∣stood, what becomes of your <HI>Minores Discreti</HI> mentioned in this Statute to have given their consents as well as the <HI>Majores,</HI> whereas this Author men∣tions none at whose request it was made, but the Great Lords only: But that by these <HI>Minores Incolae Regni,</HI> mentioned at the end of this Statute, were meant the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses; Pray see a Writ of Summons the 24th. of <HI>Edward</HI> I. with the Doctors note upon it in his answer to Mr. <HI>P.</HI> the Writ is directed to the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Cl. M.</HI> 4. <HI>Dorso.</HI></NOTE> and concludes thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. pag.</HI> 155.</NOTE> that he should warn the <HI>Procuratores Cleri</HI> there menti∣oned to appear with him, <HI>ad tractandum, ordinandum &amp; faci∣endum no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscum, &amp; cum ceteris Praelatis, &amp; Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eribus, &amp; aliit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lis Regni nostri</HI> in the Margin over-against these last words, the Doctor gives us this Note, the <HI>Incolae Regni</HI> were the Knights, Citizens and Bur∣gesses mentioned in the former Writ, but not here particularly enumerated.
<PB N="527" REF="283"/>
Now, though it is true, that this Writ is after the time that the Doctor will acknowledge the Commons to have been constantly Summoned to Parliament, yet if these words could mean the Commons in this Writ. why they should not signifie the same in this Statute, I can see no reason, but the Doctors strong prejudices to the contrary. But if you have no more Autho∣rities to alledg from the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, pray go on, and shew me the rest of your Arguments; why you suppose the Commons were never called in above half the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, till the 18<HI>th.</HI> And I de∣sire this the more, because as I have already proved from the Statute of <HI>West.</HI> 1. 3 <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. the words <HI>&amp; tout le Communalty de la Terre,</HI> coming immediately after the Counts, Barons; and those other words foregoing, must needs signifie the whole Commonalty of the Land;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.A.P. p.</HI> 146.</NOTE> and so the Doctor himself has rendered it in his Answer to Mr. <HI>P.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But first pray observe what the Doctor there tells you, that by the word Commonalty he means not the Commons in the sense they are now taken, but the Community of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only; and for this,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Claus.</HI> 3. <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. <HI>in</HI> 1. <HI>die veni∣endo ad Par∣liamentum.</HI></NOTE> pray consult the Writ of Summons to the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> to come to this Parliament, (which I confess is the only Writ of this kind that is left upon the Rolls from the 49<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third to the 23<HI>d.</HI> of this King) in which you will find the Archbishop Summoned <HI>ad tractandum, ordinandum una cum Prelatis, &amp; magnatibus Regni</HI>; that is, as the Doctor ex∣plains it, with the Prelates and Great Men of the Kingdom, which Great Men very frequently comprehended as well the Barons <HI>Majores</HI> as <HI>Minores,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 147.</NOTE> the Earls, Barons, and greater Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and the less which then were the Community of the King∣dom; so that your Interpretation of the words <HI>des Greindres, &amp; des Mendres</HI> in the Statute of <HI>Gloucester</HI> (by which you would interpret the like words in the Statute of <HI>Marlbridge</HI>) for the Commons, as now understood, will sig∣nifie nothing, as being before the time we allow the Commons to have been Summoned to Parliament in this Kings Reign.</P>

<P>It were a very easie thing for any man of a confident undertaking tem∣per to frame what Interpretations he pleases from the general or equivocal of Histories or Records, if he could as easily find Authorities to support it; but I see nothing like a proof for it, but the Doctors bare Assertion: Since I have already sufficiently proved, that the words <HI>Communalty</HI> and <HI>Communitas</HI> coming in our Statutes and Records immediately the Counts and Barons after do always signifie the Commons as now understood, and why they should not signifie so here, I can see no reason; for as to the words in the Writ to the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> they prove nothing at all, who were the Consti∣tuent parts of that Parliament; for if the word <HI>Magnates</HI> must need signifie the greater and lesser Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> only, pray why do they not signifie so in the Writ of Summons to Parliament, of the 49th. of <HI>Henry</HI> III.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cl.</HI> 49.

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, you cannot shew us any mention of the words Com∣munalty, or <HI>Communitas</HI> in any of the Parliaments of this Kings Reign; not in the Statute <HI>de Bigamis</HI> made in the 4th. of this King; the Preamble thereof runs to this effect:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. pag.</HI> 147, 148.</NOTE> That these under∣written Constitutions were recited before some of the Bi∣shops and others of the Kings Council, and afterwards heard and published before the King and his Council, here is no express mention, who were the Constituent Members of Parliament at this time, or of this Par∣liament in particular, more then that it is said in the Close of this Statute, that the aforesaid Constitutions were Published at <HI>Westminster</HI> in the Parliament after the Feast of St. <HI>Michael.</HI></P>
<P>So likewise by the Statute of <HI>Westminster</HI> the 2d. made in the 13th. of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. it appears that the Prelates, Earls, Barons and the Kings Council, were the Constituent parts of the Parliament at <HI>Gloucester</HI> you but now mention∣ed; for it recites that the King in the 6th. year of his Reign, <HI>Convecatis Pre∣latis, Comitibus, Baronibus, &amp; Concilio suo apud Glocestre,</HI> &amp;c. and thus; the Statute of <HI>Mortmain</HI> made by this King in the 7th. of his Reign, is recited to have been made <HI>de Consilio Pralatorum, Comitum, Baronum &amp; aliorum fidelium Regni nostri de Concilio nost<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o existentium,</HI> &amp;c. the Statute of <HI>Acton Burnel,</HI> was made in the 11th. of this King, by himself and his whole Council, <HI>Le Roy per Luy, &amp; per tout son Council ad ordein &amp; establie</HI>; though this was done in Parliament, as appears by the Statute of Merchants of the 13th. of the same King, which recites, that the King had made by himself and his Council at his Parliament at <HI>Acton Burnel</HI> these Establishments. I have been the more particular in the recital of these Statutes, not only because here is no mention made of any Commons in these Parliaments, but also be∣cause it farther confutes your position in your 5th. Dialogue, that the King had not then the sole Legislative Power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have said almost nothing now (I except that of the Kings being the sole Legislative Power,) which I have not already freely acknowledged, <HI>viz.</HI> that the words <HI>Communitas,</HI> and Communalty are not above twice men∣tioned in the enacting part of any Statute in this Kings Reign; and the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses not once mentioned, till the 34th. of this King, nor any mention again of the Commonalty till the Statute of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> made in the 12th. of <HI>Edward</HI> II. and yet it appears by the Writs of Sum∣mons and Expences, beginning at the 28th. of <HI>Edward</HI> I. that the Commons had been Summoned to Parliaments, ever since that time; and that they were so, also before that time; I have already proved both by Acts of Par∣liament
<PB N="529" REF="284"/>
and Records, but by yours, and your Doctors method of arguing; if the Writs of Summons to the Commons of the 49th. of <HI>Henry</HI> III. had happened to have been torn off, and lost, as they easily might have been, since it is only affixt to the Roll by a loose Schedule, and also that all the Writs of Summons to the Commons had been lost, from the 23d. of <HI>Edward</HI> I. to the 34th. then there is no denying the Commons to have been there, because par∣ticularly named; and if these Writs had also happened afterwards to have been lost till the 12th. of <HI>Edward.</HI> II. when they are expresly named in the Sta∣tute of <HI>Lincoln</HI> which I now mentioned; then the Commons should have been again excluded by the same Argument, as they are after the 49th. of <HI>Henry</HI> III. because no Writs of Summons are found for them, nor any men∣tion made of them in any Statute, first for above 30 Years, and after that for above 13 Years together, since you will not allow the words <HI>Communitas</HI> and <HI>Communalty</HI> to signifie the Commons, till you please to allow them in that sense.</P>
<P>This may serve as a general answer to all you have said▪ concerning the omission of the Commons in all Statutes till the 18th. of this King, and may serve not only for them, but against the Bishops and Tenants <HI>in Capite.</HI> being all present at divers Parliaments, where the Acts are recited to have been made by the common Assent or Accord, without at all specifying whose Assent, and sometimes without naming the King at all.</P>
<P>This being premised, it will be easie to return you a short and particular answer to the Statutes you have cited. As for that <HI>de Bigamis,</HI> you confess that the Statute only mentions its being recited before the Kings Council, and Publish'd in Parliament without relating what were the constituent parts of it; <HI>Ergo,</HI> no Commons were there, and I may with as good a Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e say, no Bishops, Abbots, nor your smaller Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were there, because not particularly named: As for the rest of the Statutes you have cited of <HI>Gloucester, Mortmain</HI> and <HI>Act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Burnel</HI>; 'tis true, the Prelates, Earls and Barons are the only particularly mentioned, because they then bore the grea∣test figure in the Government, your lesser Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> being quite lest out; for that they could not then be comprehended under <HI>Baronum,</HI> I have sufficiently made out. But to conclude, give me any sufficient reason, why the Commons might not be at these Parliaments as well as they were af∣ter the 18th. tho most commonly no otherwise mentioned then they were be∣fore that time, if you say the Writs of Summons make it out they were there: You confess l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke your prejudice, since the two Writs of Summons before that time would, if they had not been lost have made out the same thing.</P>
<P>As for what you say for the Kings being the sole Legislative Power in those times. I have long since proved, that no King could ever legally make laws without the consent of the Common Council or Parliament, and after that, all that you can say for the Kings making Laws alone with the advice of his Council signifies nothing; For if the words are litterally to be under∣stood, then this Council of the King, whether you will have it to consist of the whole Parliament, as the Statute of <HI>Mortmain</HI> seems to intimate, or else of his particular Council in Parliament, as in the Statute of <HI>Acton Burnel,</HI>
<PB N="530" REF="285"/>
where those constitutions are said to be ordained by the King and his Council, if by ordain'd, you mean only drawn up, and prepared for the Parliaments Assent; it is no more then what I shall easily grant to have been often used in those times, but if you will have ordained to signifie enacted, then pray tell me how you will avoid the Kings Council, having a Joynt Hand with the King in his Legislative Power, since the words are the King <HI>by himself and his Council had Ordered and Established</HI>: But you have carried both your self as well as me, too far from the main Question; therefore pray give me some better reasons why you are of this Opinion, that the Commons were not Summoned again to Parliament till the 18th. of <HI>Edward</HI> I.</P>

<P>I am now coming to it: But first remember that about an hour or two ago, I cited a Record of the 30th. of <HI>Edward</HI> I. which related to an Act of the 18th. of this King;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. pag.</HI> 149.</NOTE> by which Record it appears, that the Prelates, Earls, Barons and other great Men of the Kingdom had then in full Parliament on the first of <HI>Iune,</HI> granted him 40 s. on every Knights Fee to Marry his Daughter; and it thence also appears, that tho this Tax is said to be given for themselves and the whole Community of the Kingdom, yet it was by the Community of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> alone, because it was to be raised whol∣ly upon Knights Fees; so that hitherto in this Kings Reign, there appears nothing that can plainly evince, either the Summoning, or being of any Commons in Parliament, as now understood; we are at least left at great uncertainties, nay in my Opinion, the proof is more strong on the Negative, that there were none.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder you should mention this Writ any more, since I have already confuted the Doctors notion about it, and proved that it was a general Tax granted by the Parliament upon the whole Kingdom, and not laid either by, or upon, the Community of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> alone, nor does the way of Taxing by 40s. upon every Knights Fee at all prove it; for if it is to be under∣stood of Lands only held by Knights Service; then this Tax could not have extended to any other Estates, as certainly it did, since the King could by King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter, have forced his Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> to grant him an Aid towards this Marriage of his Daughter, and (if what you say be true) could also have made all the Mesne Tenants of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> to have con∣tributed to it according to the Knights Fees they held, and this without cal∣ling a Parliament at a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; therefore pray give some better Authority then this, for I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e assure you I am not at all satisfied with it.</P>

<P>I will now give you the Writ the Doctor has discovered, and by which, it will plainly appear, that this Tax granted in the 18th of this Kings Reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. p.</HI> 149. <HI>&amp; dein.</HI></NOTE> was given before ever the Com∣mons were Summoned to it; and for this, the Learned Do∣ctor has found out a loose bundle of Writs of this year, di∣rected to the Sheriffs of most Counties of <HI>England,</HI> and they are the ancientest Extant, or perhaps that ever were (for in probability, the calling of Knights, Citizens and Burgesses according to that Example was discontinued from the 49th. of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. unto this time) by which two or three Knights were di∣rected
<PB N="531" REF="285"/>
to be chosen for each County; pray read the Writ it self, since I look upon it as the first Pattern of this kind, that of the 49th. of <HI>Henry</HI> III. seem∣ing to have been Written in haste without those Forms, that were afterwards required in Writs of this kind, and particularly in this: <HI>Edwardus Dei Gratiâ Rex Angliae, Dominus Hiberniae▪ &amp; Dux Aqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aniae Vice-comisi West∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rlandiae Salutem.

Teste meipso apud Westmonast.</HI> 14 <HI>die</HI> Jun. <HI>Anno. Regni Nostri</HI> 18.</P>
<P>Whereby you may see in the first place, that there was yet no certain number of Knights of Shires settled, who were to be Summoned to appear at this Parli∣ament: And you may in the next place remember from a before mentioned Re∣cord of the 30th. <HI>Ed.</HI> I. that on the first of this Month, the King had Scutage then given him in full Parliament; and now Fourteen days after, at the In∣stance of the Earls, Barons and other great Men of the Kingdom, upon cer∣tain matters by them moved and propounded to him; He Issued His Writs of Summons to the Sheriff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the several Counties, to cause to be chosen two or three Knights of each Counties, to come to him at <HI>Westminster,</HI> three Weeks after St. <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> at farthest. We may also further observe from this Writ, that it is most probable (though it is not here absolutely said so) that the King was moved by the Earls, Barons and great Men of the King∣dom, to call these Knights to this Parliament, and that as this Writ is the first to be found after that of the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> III. so it really was the first Writ of Summons after that time, for the Election of Knights to represent the several Counties.</P>
<P>In the next place, that there could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e no Citizens nor Burgesses chosen, or sent to this Parliament by Vertue of this Writ, as they were afterwards by directions contained in the Writs sent to the Sheriffs for Electing Knights of the Shires.</P>
<P>Lastly, that by this Writ, the Knights were to come to the King at <HI>West∣minster,</HI> three Weeks after St. <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> at furthest. which was the 15th. of <HI>Iuly</HI>; also, that in the same year, between the time of the date of the Writ, and the time appointed for Meeting of the Knights, The Statute of <HI>Westminster</HI> the third was made as may appear by this Clause at the beginning, <HI>Dominus Rex in Parliamento suo apud West monasterium post Pascha-A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Regni sui Decimo octavo, videlicet in Quindena Sancti Iohannis Baptist.</HI> (that is the 8th. of <HI>Iuly</HI>) <HI>ad Instantiam Magnatum Regni sui Concessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Providit. &amp; Statuit, Quod de caetero liceat unicuique libero homini,</HI> &amp;c. So that this was the same full Parliament, which gave the King Scutage on the first of <HI>Iune,</HI>
<PB N="532" REF="286"/>
and then the King and Barons, without the Commons, made this Statute, or the Knights had another Summons after the Date of this Writ (for before that they were not in Parliament) or the Knights came a Week before they had need to have done, but neither of the latter are probable, seeing the Knights then were great Husbands of their time and Expences, and were not very forward to undertake this Service, as being constantly bound with, or engaged by Sureties, or Manucaptors for the performance of it, and their appearance in Parliament, and therefore it seems reasonable to con∣clude, that this Law was made without them, and before their coming to Parliament.</P>
<P>So much of this Writ, from which, as well as divers following Writs and other Records; it is evident that it was from this Kings Authority, and at this very time that the House of Commons came to be fixed and establish'd in the present constant Form, it is now, and hath been in, for many Kings Reigns, and than the King in this Age was not altogether confin'd to any Number of Knights, Citizens or Burgesses, nor were several strict Forms and Usages now Practiced ever then thought of, nor some Legal niceties and Punctilio's now in use, then judged absolutely necessary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray give me leave to answer what you have now said from this Writ, before you proceed to any other Record. First as to your Argument from the variety or uncertainty of the number of Knights of Shires, which you at first suppose to have been Summoned to Parliament, that I doubt will prove a gross mistake, for if we closlely consider the Writ it self, it will prove no more then a Summons of these Knights to a great Council, Colloquy or Treatise (as the Writ here cal'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it) and not to a Parliament, the words <HI>Col∣loquium &amp; Tractatum</HI> mentioned in the Writ, not then signifying a Parlia∣ment; but such a Collequy Treatise, or great Council as is mentioned i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Statute of the 7th. of this King, forbiding all Men coming with Arms to such Assemblies wherein there is also a plain difference made between Parliaments and such Treatises as I have already proved from the Statute of the Staple of the 27th. of <HI>Edward</HI> III. which was first made in such a Trea∣tise or Council as appears by the Title to the said Statutes, and was after∣wards confirmed by the next Parliament, in the 28th. year of the same King, Cap. 1. whereby <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and all other Statutes before made are al∣so confirmed; for had this Summons been to a Parliament, sure there would have bin also Writs of Summons found for the Electing▪ and returning of Citi∣zens and Burgesses, as well as Knights of Shires to this Assembly, and these Writs of Summons would have been entered on the Dorse of the Close Rolls according to the Rules, your self have laid down; whereas this Writ is only found, in a loose Bundle of Writs of divers other Matters; neither is there any title in the Margin of the Record (as is usual in Writs of Summons) to Parliament, whereby it may appear, what kind of Assembly this was, to which these Knights were Summoned, nor is your Argument from the date of the Writs of Summons any convincing proof, that the Commons were not in this Parliament at the time of the Writ Issued; since during the Session of this Parliament, the Earls and Barons might make this Request, for calling
<PB N="533" REF="286"/>
of those Knights out of the Counties, to give their Opinions and Advice in the matters to be proposed to them by the King, and that thereupon, the King at their Request, thought fit to Summon two or three more of the Knights of Shires to have their advice also.</P>
<P>And as for your last Argument, that the same Parliament which gave the Tax above mentioned on the first of <HI>Iune,</HI> must be sitting, even to the very time of the return of the Writ, because the Statute of <HI>Westminster,</HI> the third was mane on the <HI>Quindene</HI> of St. <HI>Iohn</HI> Baptist: (<HI>viz.</HI> the 8th. of <HI>Iuly</HI>) So that the King and the Barons, without the Commons, made this Statute, and that these Knights were Summoned after the act was passed. There is no necessity of making these Consequences, for this Parliament might very well be dis∣solved that very day this Act passed, and this Council or Colloquy might be Summoned to Meet within three Weeks after <HI>Mid-Summer</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> about the 16th. of <HI>Iuly</HI>) according to the Writ you have cited. And so I believe it would appear were the Rolls of that Parliament now Extant, as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y are lost, as well as those of divers succeeding Parliaments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then you are forced to confess, that this Writ was Issued whilst the Parliament was still sitting; and if so, I cannot see any need there was of another less Council or Colloquy to meet, after the Parliament was ended, since as long as it was sitting, that could have much better dispatch'd all such business as the King had to do, and how the King could foresee that he should have need of another Council before he had any business for it, seems very improbable; and therefore I think I may very well suppose with the Doctor, that this Writ was a Summons to Parliament, though it does not (I grant) expresly call it so; but your Argument is of no weight, that because this Writ was not entred upon the Close Roll, that therefore, it is not to be look'd upon as a Summons to Parliament, as also because the Title to it is only <HI>Summonitio ad Consilium</HI>; since the Doctor in his answer to Mr. <HI>P.</HI> gives us several Parliament Writs upon the Close Rolls with this Title <HI>ad Consilium,</HI> which proves that the King had in those days a larger Power of calling what number of Knights of Shires he pleased to Parliaments, as appears by two other Writs he there gives us of the 22d. of <HI>Edward</HI> I. which are entred in the Close Rolls to the Sheriff of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> to cause two Knights to be Elected for that County, bearing Date the 8th. of <HI>October,</HI> and the next day after the King, as appears by another Writ to the same Sheriff, ordered him to cause to be chosen two other Knights besides the former, and to cause them to appear at <HI>Westminster</HI> the morrow after St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s Day, to hear and do such things as the King should more fully enjoyn: The like Writs (with bot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the former) were sent to all the Sheriffs in <HI>England.</HI> Now though it is true▪ that the Title to the first of these Writs, is only <HI>de Melitibus Eligendis &amp; Mittendis ad Concilium</HI>; yet these words well considered must certainly here mean a Parliament, both these Writs being entred upon the Close Rolls where all Writs of this kind are wont to be found, as I have already observed; and besides the words in the first Writ are the same with those which are found in several other Writs of Summons to Parliament, <HI>viz. ad Consule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dum, &amp; Consentiend. pro se &amp; Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nitate illà biis qua Comites, Barones &amp; Proceres pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: concorditer ordinaverint in praemissis.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess we are at a loss in this affair, for want of the Records of this Parliament, which if we had I doubt not but there would appear very good reasons why the Lords did then desire the King should consult more of the Knights of the Shires then what had appeared at this Parliament, as that Lords might refuse to give their Advice in the matters proposed by the King, without he would also consult more of the best and ablest Knights of Coun∣ties, who were to come up with fresh Power, and further Instructions, what answer to give the King in the matters he should propose, which, that it was neither to give Money, nor make Laws, is plain; since (you say) the Tax of 40s. on even Knights Fee was given, and the Statute of <HI>Westminster</HI> 3d. made before they came up to Parliament; but indeed the words in the Writ plainly prove that this was no Parliamentary Meeting, since they are here only Summoned, <HI>ad Con ulendum, &amp; Cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iendum</HI>; whereas in all Writs of Summons to future Parliaments, the words are <HI>ad faci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndum quod <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unc de Com∣muni Consilio ordinabitur</HI>; or the like, as appears by the Writ of Summons of the 23d. of this King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

And if this had been done at the request of all the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> (as you suppose,) how come the Bishops, Abbots and Priors, who held also <HI>in Capite</HI> to be omitted, and not mentioned in this Writ, to have joyned in this request, as well as the Earls, Barons and great Men?</P>
<P>But as for the Doctors next precedent, <HI>viz.</HI> a Writ to the Sheriff of <HI>Nor∣thumberland,</HI> to return two Knights of the Shire, and then the next day after, other two for the same County, I am not at all satisfied, that those Writs were a Summons to a Parliament and not to a great Council, for besides the Title of the Writ is <HI>de Militibus Eligendis &amp; Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tendis ad Consilium,</HI> and the words in the Writ are not the same with those which were commonly used in Writs of Summons to Parliament, as I have already shewn' you in this Writ of Summons we are now upon: Whereas in the Summons to Parliaments of the 23d. of this King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Claus.</HI> 23. E. 1. <HI>M.</HI> 4. <HI>Dorso.</HI></NOTE> the ordaining part doth as much refer to the Commons, as to the Lords, the <HI>Commune Consilium</HI> consisting of both; whereas in these Writs you have cited, they were to consent to such things which the Earls, Barons and great Men, should think fit to agree to; but that I may shew you a little more plainly, the absurdity of this fancy of your Doctors, that these Knights of Shires were now Summoned, the Parliament sitting; pray let me ask you one or two Questions concerning this business, pray who were these Gentlemen that the King you say thus Summoned to Parliament?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>According to the Doctors account, they must have been all Tenants <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Capite,</HI> since he often tells us, that out of these alone, the Knights of Shires were chosen at the first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but then who were these <HI>Magnates</HI> and <HI>Alii Proceres</HI> men∣tioned in the Statute of <HI>Westminster,</HI> and in this Writ of the 18th. of <HI>Edward</HI> I.?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="535" REF="287"/>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must own my self at a loss, certainly to define who they were; for if I say they were the smaller Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who are here put as a distinct order from the <HI>Comites &amp; Barones</HI> immediately foregoing; I foresee you will ask me how these Gentlemen could be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ummoned, since all the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were at this Parliament already; therefore I must tell you, I think there were only some of the greatest and wisest of the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> who were no Barons now Summoned, and whom the Doctor tells us, were often called to great Councils, as Barons, Peers, and who, though sometimes cal∣led to sit among the Lords, were often again omitted in several Kings Reigns, so that this Parliament was composed (as those of <HI>Marlbridg</HI> and <HI>Glouces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI>) not of all, but only of the more discreet of these lesser Barons or Tenants <HI>in Capite.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this be all you have to say to extricate your self out of this difficulty, I think it will not amount to much, for in the first place, all you have here said is meer conjecture without any proof; since this Statute of <HI>Westminster</HI> 3d. says only in general, that it was made at the Instance of the <HI>Magnates</HI> under which Title your Doctor,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. pag.</HI> 147.</NOTE> when he ex∣plains the Writ of Summons to the Arch. bishops of <HI>Canter∣bury</HI> tells us, were frequently comprehended the <HI>Barones Majores,</HI> the Earls and Barons, as under <HI>Minores,</HI> the lesser Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> which when the Statute of <HI>Westmister</HI> the first was made he will have to be the whole Commonalty of the Land therein mentioned; and why this Parlia∣ment of <HI>Westminster</HI> the 3<HI>d.</HI> should not consist of the same Members now, needs some better reasons than your bare affirmation to the contrary. Be∣sides this Prerogative of calling these Barons Peers to Parliament, did not only extend to Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> but to other Mesn Tenants also; if the King thought them considerable enough for Estates, or wisdom to do them that Honour, and so was not confined to Summon none but Tenants <HI>in Ca∣pite,</HI> who according to your Interpretation of <HI>K. Iohn</HI>'s Charter had all a right to appear by General Wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, at the Common Council of the King∣dom: but you may put what sense you please on these words <HI>Magnates &amp; Proceres,</HI> yet I am sure your <HI>Doctor</HI> can take them in no other sense than for the Community of all the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> both great and small;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tir. Communi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as Regni.</HI></NOTE> and so he tells us in his <HI>Glossary</HI> when he Comments upon the Writ of the 30 <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. which you now menti∣oned, and which refers to this very Parliament of the 18<HI>th.</HI> when Forty Shillings was granted on every Knights Fee to Marry the Kings Daughter;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess I do not see how the <HI>Doctor</HI> can solve this difficulty; but by denying what he has already said; and affirming, as I do now, that all the lesser Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> were not Summoned to this Parliament, but on∣ly
<PB N="536" REF="288"/>
some of them at last ordered by this Writ to be chosen and returned by the Counties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he might do it, if bare affirming were to pass for proof; but I shall not give up my reason upon no better Grounds either to him, or you; not to mention the improbability of the thing, that the King should be now over∣perswaded by the Earls, Barons, and other Great Men to call these Knights of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ires which had been now omitted ever since the 49 <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. for above twenty year<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when he had no need at all of them▪ but rather the contrary advantage of Governing without them, since it is the Policy of Princes ra∣ther to diminish than increase the number of the Members of their great at well as private Councils, who certainly are most easily managed when they are a few than a great many.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if we should go from the Doctors Position, and say, that perhaps these Knights were chosen out of the Mesn Tenants of the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> many of whom I grant might be considerable for Interest as well as prudence; and with whom the King at their request might desire to treat of certain matters which had been before moved and propounded by him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>This is all that can be said, and yet is much more unlikely then the other; since to believe that the Earls, Barons and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> should be now grown so weary of their Power of imposing Taxes▪ and making Law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the whole Nation as to, intreat the King to admit their under-Tenants to partake of so large a share in both, is so extravagant a Fancy, that if it had not suited with the Doctor's present Hy∣pothesis, he would never have asserted it in cold blood; since himself affirm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that upon the making of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter, that the Earls, Barons and Tenants <HI>in Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e,</HI> were the only Parties to it, <HI>and that all the rest of their Tenants who were there present were only their Retinue and Tenants in Military Service which were with them at</HI> Runnemede, <HI>and were hardly to be reckoned among the Freemen of the Kingdom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.G. Glo.</HI> p. 51.</NOTE> <HI>all the rest being only Followers who helped to augment the noise; and were not Law-makers, for 'tis not probable</HI> (says the Doctor very well) <HI>that those men that had the force of the Nation would permit men of small Reputation to share with them in Law-making, those that had the power of this or any other Nation de Fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, always did give Laws, and Tax the People.</HI> But it seems these Great Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> are either very stiff to maintain; or else easie to give up their priviledges just as it best suits with the Doctors present oc∣casion; but the Doctor may contradict himself as much as he pleases; since it is not his fault, but his Hypothesis that hath lead him into it.</P>

<P>I confess it does seem somewhat hard at present to conceive it, but we know not what reasons the Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> might have had to desire the Concurrence of these Knights of Shires at this Juncture of time; but that their coming to Parliament looks like a new Institution, may far∣ther appear from hence, that the King for a good while after the introducing Knights of Shires to serve in Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P. p.</HI> 152.</NOTE> was wont to use the liberty of Nominating the same Mem∣bers
<PB N="537" REF="288"/>
of Parliament who were formerly chosen, appears by a very remarkable Writ the Doctor there likewise gives us of the 28<HI>th.</HI> of the same King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> 28. <HI>Ed.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>M.</HI> 3. <HI>Dors.</HI></NOTE> directed to the Sheriff of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> whereby he is commanded to cause to appear at the Parliament at <HI>Lincoln</HI> on the <HI>Octive</HI> of St. <HI>Hilary</HI> the ve∣ry same Knights, Citizens and Burgesses who had before appeared at the last Parliament, unless any of them were sick or dead. From which we may collect, that our Kings in those days often made use of their Prerogative of Summoning such Members to Parliament, as were not then actually chosen to serve in that Parliament; and for a farther confirmation of this, there is still extant upon Record in the same Roll the Returns of several of the Sheriffs upon the same Writs. Whereby it appears that the same Members were returned to appear in this Parliament who had before served at the precedent, unless in the Case of some that were sick or dead.</P>
<P>And that our Kings had not yet a long time after lost their Prerogative of Nominating how many Knights, Citizens and Burgesses they would have chosen and returned to appear in Parliament, may appear by a Writ of the 45. <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. whereby one Knight for a County,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Claus.</HI> 45. <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. <HI>M.</HI> 2. <HI>Dors.</HI></NOTE> and one Citizen and Burgess, and those too, na∣med by the King to the Sheriff were to be Summoned to ap∣pear at <HI>Winchester</HI> to do those things that are appointed in the same Writ, which were likewise directed to all the Sheriffs in <HI>England</HI>; and that this was a Parliament appears from hence, that the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses had Writs for their Expences at this Meeting at <HI>Winchester.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cl.</HI> 45. <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. <HI>M.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ <HI>Dors.

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se be all the Arguments you have to produce a∣gainst the Ancient Right of the Commons being part of the Parlia∣ment before the 18 <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. I doubt they will not be sufficient to do the bu∣siness. For as to this Record of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8 of <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. whereby the King is sup∣posed to have had a power to cause those Knights of Shires to be returned who were Elected to serve in the Parliament before going without any new Ele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, this is altogether Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for if you will but read the Writ it self, and the reason of the King's thus acting, it will plainly prove the con∣trary. For the King re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in that Writ,
<Q>That having resolved that the Charter of Forests should be observed and that his Subjects had made a per∣ambulation thereupon; yet that he would conclude nothing in that matter, without the Counsel of the Prelates, Earls▪ Barons, and other Great Men; and therefore desiring to hasten that business, as far as he could without any delay. He thereby orders him to cause to come before him to the Parliament at <HI>Lin∣coln</HI> the same Knights, Citize<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and Burgesses as were before Elected.</Q>
Now the King might have very good reason for it, why he would rather treat with them than with any other, because they had been privy to all the pre∣cedent transactions concerning this business of Forests, and therfore were most
<PB N="538" REF="289"/>
likely to come to the speediest conclusion with the King in that affair, as being better instructed in it, than it was possible for any new Members to be, who had not before been privy to the whole Affair.</P>
<P>Yet that the King never intended hereby to impose Representatives upon his People without their free Consent, appears by this Clause at the end of the said Writ. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Milites, C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves &amp; Burgenses praedicti dictis die, &amp; loco n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dis omnibus inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut eum plena potestate aud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endi, &amp; faciendi ea quae ibidem in praemiss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ordinaeri con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingent pro cummuni commodo dicti Regni.</HI> Now how these Knights, Citizens and Burgesses could appear in Parliament with full power of acting therein, without the new Election or Confirmation at least of those whom they represented, I should be very glad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Doctor or your self could inform me▪ But to come to your next Record of the 45 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. whereby you would prove that the King in those days had a Power of ap∣pointing not only how many Citizens and Burgesses should appear in Parlia∣ment for each County, but also could name the Persons that should appear therein. I wonder how the Doctor could so impose upon your, or his own, understanding since nothing is more apparent than that this Council at <HI>Win∣chester</HI> to which they were Summoned, was no Parliament at all but a Great Council, as appears by the very words of the Writ it self, which recites,
<Q>That whereas a Parliament lately at <HI>Westminster</HI> had given the King a Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sidy of 24 <HI>sh.</HI> and 3 <HI>d.</HI> upon every Parish in <HI>England,</HI> that the King being willing to be better inform'd after what manner the Levy of this Tax might be soonest performed, and because it would be burthensom for all the Great Men, Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, who came to the said Parliament to meet together again for this matter, therefore he Ordained for the sparing their Pains and Expences, to have a Colloquy and Trea∣tise with some of the same Members, and therefore names the very Persons whom he commands should appear before him at <HI>Winchester</HI> to in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm him and his Council of the best manner and form whereby the said Tax might be soonest and most conveniently levyed, according to the in∣tent of the said Grant.</Q>
So that nothing is more plain from the Writ it self, than that this Assembly was no Parliament; the proper Business of which is always to make Laws, give Money, or re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ress Grievances, none of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut it is apparent were the cause of this meeting. To which these that were Summoned did not appear as Knights of the Shires (their power being expired at the Dissolution of the Parliament) but only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so many particular private men, who by reason of their Interest in the Country the King supposed could best inform him in the business above mentioned. But that in the Reign of this King there were several Councils of this kind, which tho no Parliaments as having but one Knight, one Citizen, and one Burgess, and only making Temporary Constitutions concerning Trade, and other things of less moment, which were to be put in practice for a time till they could be confirmed by the next Parl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ament, appears by the Ordi∣nance or Statute of the Staple above mentioned. And of these Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> in the first part of his Parliamentary Regi∣ster of Writs gives us divers Precedents;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g.</HI> 215.</NOTE> which he rightly

<PB N="540" REF="290"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="541" REF="290"/>So that I hope I have now fairly run through, and examined all the Pre∣cedents which you or your Doctor have been able to urge in this great Question▪ and I think, if you are a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> candid and ingenuous as I take you to be, you will not assert, that any of them do amount to a proof▪ either that the Commons were never Summoned from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9th. of <HI>Henry</HI> III. to the 18th. of <HI>Edward</HI> I. or that the Writs of Summons he there produces, was to a Parliament and not to a great Council, or that the King ever took up∣on him to appoint what number of Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, should come to Parliament, or could nominate who they should be, or could dis∣charge whom he pleased from serving as Members therein. All which your Doctor, I think with greater confidence, than right understanding of the true meaning of the ancient Writs and Records of Parliament, hath under∣taken to assert▪ I beg your pardon for troubling you so long on these Heads. since the length as well as diversity of Records you have now cited, could not be answered in less compass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, you have given pretty plausible answers to most of the Authorities and Records I have now cited, yet I cannot assent so far as to come over to your Opinion, without a longer consideration of the strength of the answers you have now given me to the Doctors Authorities. But in the mean time you would oblige me, if you could give me the rest of your Ar∣guments, whereby you would undertake to prove that the Commons have been always an essential part of the Parliament ever since the Conquest, for it seems to me, by what I have read out of our ancient Historians, that there is no express mention made of them by Name. in any Historian or Re∣cord, till the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I. and as for those Arguments Mr. <HI>P.</HI> hath given us to the contrary, methinks the Doctor hath given satisfactory an∣swers to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have made it clear enough, that the Commons of <HI>England</HI> were a constituent part of the <HI>Wittena G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ote,</HI> or Common Council of the Nation before your pretended Conquest; and if it doth not appear that they were deprived of that right by the <HI>Normans</HI> entrance (which you have not yet proved) I think we may very well conclude, that things continued in the same State as to the Fundamental Constitution of the Government▪ as well after your Conquest as they did before. Nor have you as I see proved any thing to the contrary. since you confess that as much a Conquerour as King <HI>William</HI> was, yet he altered nothing in those Fundamental Constitutions, the most that you pretend he did, being only in an alteration of the Persons, who were the Legislators from <HI>English</HI> to <HI>French</HI> Men or <HI>Normans</HI>; so that upon the whole matter, I think there is no need of any new Arguments to confirm this truth, since the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> claiming a right by Pre∣scription, of having their Representatives in Parliament; if you nor your Doctor, nor none of those whom he follows, can prove by sufficient Autho∣rities when this began, then I am sure you ought if you were of the Jury in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s matter, to find for the Tenants in Possession; since that, to∣gether with a constant usage, time out of mind is as well by your Civil as our Common Law a sufficient Title to any Estate; yet I doubt not but to
<PB N="542" REF="291"/>
shew you the next time we meet, that the Doctor has no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> given such satis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ory answers as you imagine to most of Mr. <HI>P</HI>'s best Arguments, proving this right of Prescription to have been the constant Opinion of an succeeding Ages; to which I shall also add divers new Authorities, as well from ancient Historians, as Parliamentary Records and Statutes, but since it is grown now very late, I beg your pardon till another opportunity.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Must beg your Pardon, if I have made my Publisher tell you an Untruth before I was aware, in the Advertisement at the end of the last Dialogue; when he told you there were, but two or three Sheets behind upon this Subject; whereas indeed this Dialogue is almost wholy taken up in discussing these Rea∣sons, and Authorities, that have been formerly brought by Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI> or are now newly added by me; to prove that the Com∣mons had Representatives in Parliament long before the <HI>49</HI>th of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the <HI>3</HI>d, in doing which, if I have been too long, I hope you will pardon it, since so weighty a Question could not be dismist without say∣ing the most, I could find had been alledged; as well for as against it. And since I was to explain the meaning of those Words <HI>Clerus &amp; Po∣pulus,</HI> in the times immediately after the Conquest, it was fit to let you know that anciently the Inferiour Clergy, (who did not hold <HI>in Capite</HI>) had Places and made a part of the <HI>3</HI>d Estate, as well the Bishops and Abbots, in our general Councils or Parliaments.</P>
<P>There was likewise a necessity of shewing, that the Commons of <HI>England</HI> claim to appear in Parliament by Prescription, Time beyond Memory, and consequently of shewing how that time is to be under∣stood in all our Law Books; which are the onely proper Interpreters of
<PB REF="293"/>
that Law Term of Time, <HI>of which there is no Memory to the contra∣ry.</HI> And since there is no Writer that I know of, who hath opposed this Notion of the Right of Prescription in the Commons, but Mr. <HI>Prin.</HI> I have Impartially consider'd, what he has writ against it, in his <HI>2</HI>d and <HI>3</HI>d. part of his Parliamentary Register, and put down the Substance of it in this Discourse, with what may be reasonably replyed thereunto; so that considering the many fresh Authorities from Histori∣ans and Records that are here inserted, and that have never been Pub∣lisht altogether before. I think I may safely affirm, that there hath never been so much hitherto put together of this kind; nor perhaps will be till Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI> shall please to publish at large his Learned and Ela∣berate Collections from Ancient Monuments of Antiquity, Histories; (both Manuscript and Print) as also from Parliamentary and other Records on this important Subject, many of which you will here find Abbreviated; and to whose Learning and Knowledg in matters of this kind, I must own my self beholding for the Arguments from the Inferior Clergy's (who were not Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>) being anciently part of the great Council of the whole Kingdom, as also that of apply∣ing the Right of Prescription to the House of Commons.</P>
<P>But if Dr, <HI>Brady</HI> or any Friend of his shall think fit to animadvert upon any thing that hath been here laid down, I shall be so far from being concerned at it, that I shall rather be very well satisfied; s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce as a fair Representer of other mens Opinions, who write not for Vi∣ctory, but the Discovery of Truth, I shall be glad if the Dr. or any other Learned Person shall think fit to give the World greater Light on this Subject, by publishing somewhat that is now, and more con∣vincing; then what hath been heretofore done. For had it appeared so to me, I declare I should not have taken so much Pains to set down the Arguments on both sides; which I shall still continue to do, if any thing shall be performed material in this kind. I have to make up this Dis∣course just entred upon the Question of Non-Resistance, but cannot go far in it now; but shall leave what is to be f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rther said upon that impor∣tant Subject to the next Dialogue, which will be speedily Published.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Am glad to see you again so soon; for indeed I am very impatient to make an end of this great Question concerning the Antiquity of the Commons appearing in Parliament; and therefore pray go on where you left off, and give me those plain proofs you promised me, whereby you would make out that both the Knights of Shires, as well as the Citizens and Burgesses had a right to be there ever since the Conquest; for I desire to go no higher.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought I had said enough on that Subject at our last Meeting to satis∣fie any reasonable person: I am sure more than you were able fairly to answer, especially as to my Replies to the best Authorities you brought from the Doctor; and therefore pray before we proceed farther, tell me your Opinion upon se∣cond thoughts of those Authorities and Arguments I then gave you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess they do somewhat shock me; but I hope you will pardon me if I cannot come over to you, without first hearing what may be said by the other side, and to this end I have writ to the Learned Dr. for his Solu∣tion to several difficulties, that I confes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon his Hypothesis I know not how to solve; but doubt not but to receive farther satisfaction from him as to those Points in a short time; but in the mean while, let us proceed in our intended design, and examine the rest of the Arguments you have to produce on your side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall obey your Commands; and therefore in the first place you cannot
<PB N="544" REF="294"/>
expect more than is in our power to give you: For since all the Parliament-Rolls and Writs of Summons, (except those of the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third) are lost till after the times in question between us, you must be contented with what other proofs we can produce, provided they are sufficient to satisfie any unbyast, indifferent Person: And to this end I shall sort the Authorities I intend to make use of into these three Heads. First, I shall give you divers Quotations out of the most Ancient Writers, who lived in, or nearest the time you prefix; <HI>viz.</HI> the coming in of the <HI>Norman William</HI>; and shall descend down in order of time as low as your Drs. 18th of <HI>Edward I.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I shall shew you from the Authorities and Testimonies of the Judges of almost all our Courts; of the House of Commons; nay of several whole Parlia∣ments, and the King himself, that the Commons had an undoubted Right of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting there by Prescription.</P>
<P N="3">3. From the Consent of all our Neighbouring Kingdoms who being governed by a King, and a great Council or Assembly of the Estates according to the <HI>Gothick</HI> Model, the Commons had always from the Institution of the Government their Representatives in those Assemblies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I much doubt that; but pray begin with your Ancient Historians; for as for my own part▪ I must freely tell you, though I have looked them over very warily, yet I can find nothing in them concerning the particular constituent parts, or Members, of our great, or Common Councils, but the <HI>Magnates, Optimates,</HI> or <HI>Principes, Comites</HI> and <HI>Barones</HI>; all which tho' you have at our last meeting shewed me from some Authorities, that they may take in others, tho' not Nob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by Birth; yet since these words have been most commonly taken in another sense; it needs some better proof than to say in general, that meer Commoners were there, because those general words may sometimes be taken in that sense▪ and as for the words <HI>Clerus</HI> and <HI>Populus,</HI> which I confess are often mentioned to be present at those Assemblies; the Learned Dr. in several places of his Answer to Mr. <HI>P.</HI> as also in his <HI>Glossary</HI> hath plainly proved,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.</HI> p. 26, 27 <HI>Tit. Clerus &amp; Populus.</HI></NOTE> that as the word <HI>Clerus</HI> sometimes signifies the Bishops, and sometimes the Inferiour Clergy; so <HI>Populus</HI> does also neither great nor little People, but only the Layety; and therefore as it is used, and restrained signifies the Lay <HI>Plebs</HI>; or the Lay <HI>Magnates.</HI> What I mean by <HI>Plebs,</HI> I shall shew you by and by; but that the word <HI>Populus</HI> does not signifie the Inferiour sort of people, or such as were inferiour to Barons, Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> or Noble-men, the Dr. has very well proved from that passage made use of by Mr. <HI>P.</HI> to prove the Commons to have been in that great Council which made <HI>Henry</HI> the first King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.

must be the People or Lay-men here mentioned, and this same <HI>Clerus</HI> and <HI>Po∣pulus</HI> is by <HI>Eadmerus,</HI> speaking of a great Council held at <HI>Westminster</HI> in the second Year of this King called <HI>Primates Regni u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riusque Ordinis</HI>; or as <HI>Florence</HI> of <HI>Worcester</HI> words it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anno D.</HI> 1102</NOTE> the Orders of Men assembled in this very Council, <HI>Omnes Principes Regni sui Ecclesiastici, &amp; Secularis Ordinis</HI>; the which the Dr. also proves from several like passages in <HI>Eadmerus</HI>; in all which, as also in all other Authors the Dr. hath there cited: This <HI>Populus</HI> is explained to be the Earls, Barons, and great Men of the Kingdom only,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 31, 32.</NOTE> that is, all the greater, as well as smaller Tenants <HI>in Capite.</HI> And tho' I confess at our last Meeting you brought very good proof, that the word <HI>Populus</HI> was more comprehensive among the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>; yet tho' the <HI>Roman Populus</HI> comprehended all the People, as well Nobility as Plebeians; and that in <HI>Scotland</HI> it took in the Burgesses of the Royal Burroughs, which hold immediately of the King; yet does it not follow that this word must needs signifie so in this Kingdom too, since in all Countreys not all the People, but only the Governing part of it is used for the <HI>Populus</HI> in all Histories, Publick Acts, and Laws of those Kingdoms; thus in <HI>Denmark</HI> formerly, and still in <HI>Po∣land,</HI> the <HI>Populus</HI> consisted solely of the great Councils, of the Nobility and Se∣nate, in which there were no Plebeians at all.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hoped we had done wrangling about this word <HI>Populus</HI>; but since I see you are not yet satisfied, I shall shew you more plainly that by this word used in our Ancient English Historians, is not only meant the great Lords and Te∣nants <HI>in Capite,</HI> but another larger, and more comprehensive Body; and where∣as you say that the word <HI>Populus</HI> is still restrained by our Ancient Historians to the <HI>Magnates, Primates, &amp; Principes Regni</HI>; all which words do in their genuine signification signifie Great or Noble-men; and that tho' they are sometimes taken in a different acceptation, yet that it lies upon me to prove that they are to be taken in my sense, to this I must tell you, that the proving part ought to lie wholly of your side; for since the Commons of <HI>England</HI> have been for above these Four hundred years constituent Members of our Parliament, (as is agreed on all hands) and that they also claim to be so by right of Prescription, it lies still upon your door to prove the contrary, and to shew at what time, and upon what occasion they were first introduced, which if you have not been able hi∣therto to perform, so as to give me any tolerable satisfaction; you cannot blame me if I still keep my own Opinion, and believe them as Ancient as Kingly Go∣vernment it self in this our Island.</P>
<P>But since I grant these words <HI>Clerus</HI> and <HI>Populus</HI> are of a general, and equi∣vocal signification, their true sense and meaning is best to be understood from the subject matter that is treated of, as I shall shew you first from the nature and signification of the words <HI>Clerus,</HI> and <HI>Populus,</HI> according to the Ancient Con∣stitution of our Government, that they must signifie many more than your Te∣nants <HI>in Capite</HI> alone; and then I shall confirm my Interpretation by the Autho∣rity of such Ancient Historians as lived either in, or very near the Times I men∣tion: And therefore I shall first prove it from the great Analogy there was be∣tween the <HI>Clerus,</HI> and the <HI>Populus,</HI> so that if the <HI>Clerus</HI> took in more than your Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> in our Common Councils, by the same reason the <HI>Populus</HI> must do so too.</P>
<P><PB N="546" REF="295"/>Now that this word <HI>Clerus,</HI> when used by it self, does not originally signifie either the Bishops and Abbots alone, or the Inferiour Clergy alone, (as your Dr. asserts) is evident, because <HI>Clerus</HI> is a general word, and comprehends all the Clergy of whatsoever sort or degree: Now that all the Clergy as well the Superiour as Inferiour, had either themselves in person, or else by their Representatives a place in the Saxon <HI>Witten Gemots,</HI> or <HI>Mycel</HI> Synods, and made together with the Laity one entire Council, or general Assembly, without the joynt consent of both which no Laws or Constitutions, whether Ecclesiastical or Civil, could be en∣acted; for proof of this, we need go no farther than Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI>'s first Volume of Saxon Councils, and particularly in the Councils or Synods of <HI>Clovesho</HI> first and second,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Spelman's Counc.</HI> 1 <HI>Vol. from p.</HI> 332. <HI>to</HI> 346.</NOTE> that of <HI>Kingston, A.

<P>And that this continued so both in, and after the <HI>Norman</HI> Times, appears by the first great Councils we have left us, that were held under the first Kings of the <HI>Norman</HI> Race.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be very glad to see that proved; for I always hitherto believed that none of the Clergy had then any Votes in the Great, or Common Council of the Kingdom, but those Bishops, Abbots and Priors, who all held <HI>in Capite</HI> of the King alone; and tho' it is true, there was also a Synod, or Convocation of the Clergy often held at the same time when the Common Council of the Kingdom was assembled, yet was it no part of that Council; and as the Clergy had no∣thing to do in the making of Temporal Laws; so had the Laity no hand in the making of Ecclesiastical Canons, or Constitutions for the Popes Legate or Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> often held these Synods at other times when the Common Council of the Kingdom was not assembled at all; and thus it continued till the 25th and 26th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, when the King was first by the Clergy in Convo∣cation, and afterwards by the whole Parliament recognized and declared Supreme Head of the Church of <HI>England</HI> under Christ; and from that time the King reassu∣med the Power which the Pope had before usurped; and his consent alone under the great Seal is the only Ratification of all Canons or Ecclesiastical Constitu∣tions passed in either of the Convocations of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> or <HI>York,</HI> at this day.</P>

<P>I grant that for between three hundred, and four hundred years the mat∣ter of fact hath been as you say; but that it was not so from the beginning, is also as certain; for first in the Saxon times before the Popes Usurpation came in, it is evident from the Councils, or Synods I have now cited that the King had no more power to make or confirm any general Ecclesiastical Laws or Constitu∣tions without the consent of the Wittena Gemot or Mycel Synod consist∣ing of the Clergy, as well as Laity, than he had to make Temporal Laws with∣out it. So far were they in those times from having any notion of any personal Supremacy in the King in Spiritual, more than in Temporal matters; and that this continued so till the Pope did not only usurp upon the King's Right, but
<PB N="547" REF="295"/>
that of the whole Kingdom in general, may appear by those Memorial<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we have left us, of such common Councils or Synods in the Reigns of our first <HI>Norman</HI> Kings.</P>
<P>For the Proof of which, I shall begin with the Reign of <HI>Willi∣am l.</HI> in whose 14<HI>th</HI> Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anno Domini.</HI> 1077.</NOTE> the Priviledges of the Abby of West∣minster were Confirmed by that King in a Common Council, as well of all the Clergy as Laity of the whole Kingdom, as may be proved by a Charter, still to be sound at large in the Old Char∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulary of the Abby of Westminster,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sab Essigie Fausti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ae, A.</HI> 3.</NOTE> now in the Corronian Li∣brary; Collected by <HI>Sulcardus</HI> an ancient Monk of that Abby, the Conclusion of which Charter of Priviledges, makes it very plain of what Members this Council then consisted, and who gave their Consents to the Acts of it; which pray read, <HI>In solemnitate Pentecost<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: haebito consilio in celeberrino loco praescripti Westmonast, &amp; a nostra regia Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate Conven∣tis in unum, cunctis Regni nostri Primatibus, ad audiendes, &amp; confirmandas quosdam Synodalis decreti causas necessarias communi consensu maxime Episcoporum Abbatum, &amp; alio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um insignium Procerum,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Scripta est haec Charta, &amp; sigillata &amp; ab ipso Reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, &amp; supradic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is personis testificata confirmat. &amp; auctorizata in Dei nomine,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This being one of the first, and most remarkable Councils of this Kings Reign. I cannot let it pass without observing, First, That all the chief men of the King∣dom were there, as well of the Clergy as of the Laity; and that the Words <HI>Pri∣mates,</HI> and <HI>Proceres</HI> here mentioned are very Comprehensive; and may take in many others, besides your great Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> I have already proved at our last Meeting but one: Secondly, Pray observe, that this Char∣ter of Priviledges, tho' all of them concern meer Temporal Things, is authori∣sed, Confirmed by the common Consent, and Subscriptions of all the chief men, as well of the Clergy as Laity; from all which nothing can appear more plain to me, than that in the Reign of this King, the Clergy and Laity made one Com∣mon Council, without whose joynt Consents, nothing could be transacted in the Legislative: Whether of Ecclesiastical, or Civil Concernment.</P>
<P>I could give you more Instances of this kind in this King's Reign, but I make haste to that of his Son <HI>William</HI> II. in whose 7th Year <HI>Ead∣me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A.

I have already proved, that divers others besides your Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> might be comprehended, and their great number shews them to have been more than those.</P>
<P>But tho' this Author does not here expresly say it, yet that the Inferiour Clergy were likewise at these Councils, appears from <HI>Sim.</HI> of <HI>Durham,</HI> and the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntinuator of <HI>Florence</HI> of <HI>Worcester, A. D.</HI> 1126. being the 25. of this King, where they both make mention of a Synod or Council held at <HI>London,</HI> at which were Assembled the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, <HI>&amp;c</HI> (the Pope's Legate pre∣siding over the Clergy,) and besides these, <HI>cum innumera Cloi, &amp; Populi Multitu∣dine,</HI> and the Continuator of <HI>Florence</HI> shews us the manner of their giving their Consents to those Constitutions, as well Civil as Ecclesiastical, there made, and Published: they being proposed, with a <HI>Placet vobis,</HI> and the Answer to them is, <HI>Plaecet, Placet, Placet,</HI> thrice repeated; which is very like the Form still ob∣served in the Bishops and Lords giving their Consent to all Matters proposed in their House by saying <HI>Content.</HI></P>
<P>So likewise the Continuator of <HI>Florence,</HI> in <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1127. being the 27th of this King, mentions such another General Council, or great Sy∣nod;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Spel.

<P>In the Reign of K. <HI>Stephen,</HI> there were also several Councils held of the same sort: and particularly that of his Third Year, in which was granted a Charter of Confirmation of this Kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A. D.</HI> 1138, 1139.</NOTE> of the Privi∣ledges of the Abbey of <HI>Westminster,</HI> which is also to be found in <HI>Sulcardus</HI>'s Chartalary above-mentioned, wherein after the ge∣neral words of <HI>habito universali totius Angliae consilio,</HI> and a mention of the Pope's Legate (who Presided over the Clergy): It follows thus, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffuerunt etiam Comites, Regni mei &amp; Barones quamplurimi, &amp; innumera Cleri &amp; Populi multitudo qui his omni∣bus interfuerunt, &amp; Religioso favore voluntatem &amp; Assensum, Authoritati nostrae pagi∣nae, &amp; Privilegio praebu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rent, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>So likewise in an ancient Manuscript Chronicle of the Abby of <HI>Ely,</HI> under <HI>A. D.</HI> 1139. being the 4th Year of K. <HI>Stephen,</HI> there is a remar∣kable Passage,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.

<PB N="549" REF="296"/>
viz <HI>Episcoporum at{que} Abbatum, Monachorum, &amp; Clericorum) Plebis{que} infinitae multitu∣dinis</HI>: Now pray give me leave to make some Observations from these Passages in all these ancient Charters, and Historians: that besides these Bishops, Abbots, Earls and Barons of the Kingdom, there were also an innumerable Multitude of Clergy and People, or (as the <HI>Ely</HI> Chronicle words it) an infinite number of Clerks, and Commons. Now, pray tell me, what can be meant here by all these put distinct from the rest of the higher Orders, but the inferior Clergy, as the Deans▪ Arch-deacons, and Procurators of the Chapters of Cathedral Churches; as also those of the secular Clergy of the whole Diocess? And who can be meant by this infinite Multitude of People, or <HI>Plebis,</HI> (which naturally signifies the com∣mon People distinct from the higher Nobility) but the most considerable Free-holders, or Lords of Manners, whether Tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> or not, under the degree of the higher Nobility, together with the Citizens and Burgesses of Cities and Towns, and who came not only as idle <UNCLEAR>Spectators</UNCLEAR>, since the Charter I last cited, expresly mentions that they were not only present, but also gave their Assents to this Charter of King <HI>Stephens?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>And may I not with as good reason ask you why these words <HI>Populus</HI> and <HI>Plebs</HI> may not in the Historical barbarous Latine of that Age serve only to express (not the Multitude, or Rabble, or meer common People) but the whole Body of lesser Tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> beneath the Dignity of the greater Barons?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will give you two very good Reasons for that; First, from the great Ana∣logy there was then between the Members of the inferior Clergy, and those of the inferior Laiety or Commons; the former of which, even all the Abbots and Priors; (except those few that held <HI>in capite</HI>) with all the rest of the inferior Clergy already mention'd, holding only in Frank Alimoign, and not by any Military Tenure at all. Now pray give me any sufficient Reason why the Layety should not also consist of all other Orders of Men who did not hold <HI>in capite</HI> neither, and by whom I do not mean the meer Vulgar, or Rabble; tho' Freemen, of Free-holders of small Estates, but the most considerable Free-holders or Lords of Mannors in <HI>England</HI>; or else the Knights of Shires, who, I suppose, re∣presented not only themselves, but their inferior Tenants; whether Copy∣holders, or for Term of Years; as also the Representatives of all the Cities, and Borough Towns in <HI>England</HI>: Now these might together with your Te∣nants <HI>in capite,</HI> make so great an Assembly as might very well deserve the Title (with an easie Hyperbole) of <HI>Infinita</HI> or <HI>innumera multitudo</HI> as our Ancient Histo∣rians express it.</P>
<P>Whereas your Drs. Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> could never in these first Times after this Conquest, amount to so great a Multitude, not being by his own Confession,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.I.A. p.</HI> 171.</NOTE> above 700 Persons, besides the Bishops, Abbots and Priors; who did not make above 100 more, which could never deserve the Title of an infinite and innumerable Multitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, that neither your Notion nor your Authorities to prove it do any way satisfie me, for in the first place your Argument from the Ana∣logy between the Clergy and Layety, who, you say, made up this Assembly does not hold; for, tho' I grant there might be in that part of it which we call the Convocation, and was then called the Synod, all the Bishops, Abbots, and great
<PB N="550" REF="297"/>
dignified Clergy-men; (nay, Procurators of the inferior Clergy too if you please▪) yet were not these (who I grant, were not Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>) Members of the great Council of the Kingdom; but a distinct Assembly from it, which treated only of Spiritual Matters, and together with the Bishops and Abbots made Eccle∣siastical Canons, as the two Houses of Convocation do at this day; yet medled not at all in Matters of a meer Civil, or Temporal concern; any more than the Lay Council could meddle with Spirituals: and to let you see that this was true, it is evident beyond dispute that this Ecclesiastical Synod was often assembled by the Authority of the Pope or Archbishops of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> when the Com∣mon Council of all the Layety were not summoned at all: and so <HI>Vice versa</HI> the Common Council of the Kingdom often met, when the Synod of the Clergy was not convened; as appears by the most ancient Writs of Summons to the Bishops we have left us; as particularly, The first Writ of this kind that is upon the Rolls, <HI>viz.</HI> That for the Bishops (which Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> has Printed, in the First Part of his Parliamentary Register) in the 6th of K. <HI>Iohn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 2.</NOTE> and which I have cited from the Drs. Answer against Mr. <HI>P.</HI> at our last Meeting, in which Writ, tho' I grant there is a Clause for Summoning the Abbots, and Con∣ventual Priors, yet there is none for the inferior Clergy.</P>
<P>But in the next Writ, which the same Authors have likewise Published, <HI>viz.</HI> That to the Archbishops of <HI>York</HI> there, there is no Clause at all for Summoning any of the Clergy as such,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 3.</NOTE> tho' it is true, there is under∣neath an <HI>Eodem modo scribitur omnibus Episcopis Abbatibus,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Comiti∣bus &amp; Baronibus</HI>; which shews that this Writ was not to Summon them in their Spiritual but Temporal Capacities. So likewise in the next Writ of Summons to Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 717. P. 5.</NOTE> we have left us on the Roll, which is cited in Mr. <HI>Selden</HI>'s Titles of Honour: as also in the same Parliamentary Regi∣ster, and in Dr. <HI>B.</HI> against Mr. <HI>P. viz.</HI> That of the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, to the Bishop of <HI>Duresme</HI> without any Clause of Summons to the Clergy, whether Abbots or others. So likewise in the next Writ of Summons that is left us, <HI>viz.</HI> That of the 23d of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, (Published also by Mr. <HI>Prin</HI>) to the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 6.</NOTE> in which there is no Clause of Summoning any of the Clergy; and tho' there immediately follows another Writ of the 23d of this King, in which I grant there is this Clause of <HI>Praemunientes Priorem,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>viz.</HI> The Prior, Chapter, and other of the Clergy of his Diocess to appear in Parliament; yet that they were no necessary part of it, but only of the Convocation, appears by the rest of the Writs of Sum∣mons to Bishops, which Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> has also given us in that Chapter; all which if you please to peruse, you will find, that in near 200 Writs to Parliaments or great Councils, the Clause of <HI>Praemunientes Clerum,</HI> is to be found in scarce half of them; which shews that the summoning or omitting them depended wholly up∣on the King's Pleasure, and so were no constituent part of the great Council or Parliament, as you suppose they were under the first Norman Kings; for then sure they would not have been omitted, to have been constantly Summoned in all Parliaments, as well as the Bishops and Abbots.</P>
<P>But to come to your next Argument from the numerousness of these Assem∣blies, which you say could not be properly called <HI>Numerosa,</HI> or <HI>Infinita Multitudo,</HI>
<PB N="551" REF="297"/>
whereas all the Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> as well Ecclesiasticks as Lay-men, did not amount in all to 800, there may be an allowance made for this to the Monkish way of Writing of those times, who might call such a great, or more than ordinary As∣sembly of the Clergy, and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> an innumerable, or infinite Multitude, when indeed they were but few more than our Lords and Commons are at this day.</P>

<P>I pray Sir, give me leave to Answer what you already said, before you pro∣ceed any farther, because what I have to reply to it, will be pretty long; in the first place, you cannot with any reason (if you better consider of it) deny, that the Clergy, as well the Superior as Inferior, did, before your Conquest as well as long after, make but one Assembly or Body of a General Council; tho' sitting in several Places (as the Lords and Commons do at this day) for the words in the Old Book of <HI>Ely,</HI> are <HI>Adunato Concilio Cleri, &amp; Populi,</HI> which is to be rendred, the Council of the Clergy and Layety being united and joyned toge∣ther, as I already shewed this word <HI>Adunato</HI> does always signifie; as also by the Confirmation of that Charter of King <HI>William</HI>'s to the Abby of <HI>Westminster,</HI> and to which, (tho' a Matter of meer Temporal Concernment) all the Clergy, as well as Layety, gave their joynt Consents, as appears by the Conclusion of that Charter, as also to that of K. <HI>Stephen,</HI> but now cited which they could never have done, had they not then made a part of the same General Council, or Assembly.</P>
<P>Having proved to you that the inferior Clergy did anciently make a part of the General or Common Council of the whole Nation, I shall now proceed to answer your Objection: 'Tis true, that for a great part of some Kings Reigns, for want of the Writs of Summons to the Superior, as well as to the Inferior Clergy, we cannot certainly tell, tho' we may presume it from the general words of the Hi∣storians, whether the Inferior Clergy were Summoned or not; yet this, I think, I may boldly aver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that wherever any ancient Author makes mention of the <HI>Clerus,</HI> and <HI>Populus</HI> in general, being present at any such Common Council, it must necessarily mean not the Bishops, and Abbots; or the Superior Clergy alone, or the great Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> onely, but those and the Repre∣sentatives of the whole Nation both Clergy, and Layety taken together; as I think I have sufficiently made out.</P>
<P>Nor is your Objection considerable, from that writ of the 6<HI>th</HI> of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> that no Inferiour Clergy were summoned, because onely the Abbots and Priors are mentioned at the end of it, to this I answer, that (granting it to be a writ of Summons to a Common Council of the Kingdom, which is not yet pro∣ved) the omission of the Inferiour Clergies being summoned, is no cogent Ar∣gument to prove they were not there; since for ought as you and I know there might be other writs issued to the Inferiour Clergy, distinct from those to the Bi∣shops and Abbots: Which last used to have distinct writs to each by themselves, and I may as well suppose these writs to be lost as you do, that all the general writs to the smaller Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who were no Barons and yet were to be all summoned, according to King <HI>Iohns</HI> Charter are all lost; and as for the Ab∣bots and Priors mentioned at the end of this writ of King <HI>Iohns,</HI> they were such as held onely <HI>in Capite,</HI> or else such as did not; if the former, this might be onely a
<PB N="552" REF="298"/>
Council of Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and none other, of which I grant there were many held in those times upon occasion of Wars, Scurages, and other matters; but if by these Conventual Abbots and Prio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> summoned by this writ, you will mean all Abbots, and Priors of whatever Tenure; then it appears plainly that this great Council consisted of many other Ecclesiasticks, than what held <HI>in Capite,</HI> and if so, why might not the Inferiour Clergy as well make a part of it?</P>
<P>But as for your next Authority, the writ of the 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> which is certainly a summons to Parliament, in which is no Clause of summoning the In∣feriour Clergy; this is no more an Argument than the former, since it might not then be the Custom to insert them in the same writ with the Bishop, to be summoned by him; but they might have general writs of their own directed to the Clergy of each Dioces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; but that all the Inferior Clergy as well as the Su∣perior appeared at divers Common Councils or Parliaments during this Kings Reign, (which they could never have done without the Kings Summons, tho the writs are lost) may appear from that great Council or Parliament of the 9<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> 3<HI>d:</HI> Whereto as, <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> tells us (in the place, I have so often mentioned) were summoned <HI>Clerus &amp; Populus cum Magnatibus Regio∣nis,</HI> or <HI>Regni</HI> as <HI>Mat. Westminister</HI> Words it; and in this Council was given by <HI>omnes de Regno</HI> the 15<HI>th</HI> of all the moveables of all the whole Kingdom. So that certainly these <HI>omnes de Regno</HI> must take in all Degrees of men, and conse∣quently the Inferior Clergy too; since it is certain the Bishops, and Abbots did never represent them in the House of Peers, or in Convocation, so as to lay any Taxes upon the Inferior Clergy without their express Consents; and this is the more evident, because this Tax was a 15<HI>th</HI> upon moveables; and not a Tax up∣on Land, and consequently could never be imposed upon those of the Clergy, (who held in <HI>Frank Almoign</HI> as all the Inferior Clergy then did and do at this day) by the Bishops and Abbots that held <HI>in Capite,</HI> and that these Charters were made by the Common Consent of the whole Kingdom; (and then certainly by the In∣ferior, as well as Superior Clergy,) may appear by the Confir∣mation of the great Charters,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Stat.</HI> 25. <HI>E.</HI> 1. <HI>m.</HI> 38.</NOTE> as also in the Preamble to the Statute of <HI>Articuli super Chartas</HI> (made the one in the 25<HI>th,</HI> the other in the 28<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> I.) in both which it is expresly reci∣ted that the great Charters of Liberties, and the Charters of Forrest were made <HI>per Commun Assent de tout le Royalme, en Temps nostre Pere</HI>; and if by the Common Assent of the Realm, then sure by that of the Inferior as well as Superior Cler∣gy, since the Bishops and Abbots, who sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e there only by their Baronies could never represent them.</P>
<P>That the Inferior Clergy were also summoned to Parliament, in the 39<HI>th</HI> of of <HI>Henry</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> appears from the Annals of <HI>Burton,</HI> in <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1253. Where that Author (who lived at that time) relates that the Inferiour Clergy then ap∣pearing in Parliament, sent Messengers to the Pope concerning the intolerable Grievances they then lay under; among which, the first Grievance set forth by the Procurators of the Clergy, for the Diocess of <HI>Lincoln</HI> is this, <HI>Quod decima bi∣neficiorum suoram Domino Regi fuit concessa ipsis non vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atis, maxime cum agitur de ali∣quo obligando necessarius est ejus expressus consensus</HI>: By which it appears, that the In∣ferior Clergy then claimed it as their undoubted Right by the Law of the Land,
<PB N="553" REF="298"/>
not to be Taxed either by the King, or the Pope without their express Consents, and they contended so hard for it, that they have preserved this Right even to this day, when they now give their Votes to the choice of Knights of the Shires; tho till the late King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Reign, they were never taxed without the Consent of their own Procurators in Convocation; and this may serve to enlarge your un∣derstanding, and to shew you in what sense the whole Clergy, as well the Inferi∣or as Superior did anciently make the third Estate in Parliament, which was more Comprehensive than the Bishops and Mitred Abbots alone, who sate in the upper House only <HI>per Baronian,</HI> by Reason of their Baronies; tho in the Synod or Con∣vocation of the Clergy, as Ecclesiastical Persons only; Where they also joined in the making of Ecclesiastical Laws and giving Taxes; which last you cannot de∣ny, but to be a meer Temporal Thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you are so far in the Right; yet tho the Inferior Clergy often joyn∣ed with the Common Council of the Kingdom, in giving the same Taxes, yet this was by, and upon themselves alone, and they had no hand in making of Temporal Laws; and giving Taxes for all the rest of the Kingdom; and I chal∣lenge you to shew me any precedent within these 500 years, that the Inferiour Clergy ever made the third Estate in Parliament, or that their Consents was ever asked to the making of Temporal Laws; since the Bishops have been always lookt upon till of Late, as the onely Representatives of the Inferior Clergy in Parlia∣ment, how else could they be obliged by general Statutes or Acts of Parliament; since according to your own Confession, they gave no Votes at the Election of Knights of Shires, but since the return of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. so that if they had ever joyned in this Legislative Power (as you suppose they anciently did) I cannot see why they should not have kept to this day.</P>

<P>I grant indeed, it has been otherwise between 300, and 400 Years, but for that it was not so from the Original Institution of the Government, is also as cer∣tain; for that the English Common Councils consisted of all sorts and degrees of Ecclesiasticks you must allow; since before the coming in of the <HI>Normans,</HI> the Bi∣shops and Abbots did not sit in the <HI>Mycel</HI> Synods, as Temporal Lords, is generally acknowledged, and yet even after they came to sit among the Lay Peers in the great Council of the Nation by virtue of their Baronies; the Inferior Clergy also gave their Assents to the making of Temporal Laws, and giving Taxes; I have proved by such Authorities, as I do not see you are able to answer; and for fur∣ther Proof of this, to shew you their coming was continued down to the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> third, see Sir <HI>H.

the Year 1185, (being the 31<HI>st</HI> of this Kings Reign) mentions a Common Council of the Kingdom then called at <HI>Clerkenwel,</HI> where <HI>Convocatus est Clerus, &amp; Populus, cum tota nobilitate,</HI> which Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> in his Stumbling Block of Disobedience thus translates;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 193.</NOTE> the Clergy, and Commons together with the Nobility being summoned. And in 1 of <HI>Richard</HI> I. <HI>R.

(says Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> in the same place)
<Q>The Clergy of both Ranks and Orders, with all the Laity (called here <HI>Secta Laicalis</HI>) and the Lords and Commons had then their places in Parliament; and the Dr. proceeds thus, and in possession of this Right the Clergy stood when <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was set forth by King <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d.</HI> Wherein the Freedom, Rights, and Priviledges of the Church of <HI>England</HI> (of which this evidently was one) was Confirmed to them; (<HI>i. e.</HI> the whole Clergy in general).</Q>
I have here shewed you, what Dr. <HI>Heylins</HI> sense was, to let you see that a Person of great Learning, and a high Churchman thought it no Heresie to be of our Opinion, and to maintain as he does all along in that Chapter; that the Inferior Clergy and the Commons were a <HI>Constituent</HI> Part of the Common Council or Parliament long before the 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> 3<HI>d,</HI> and that the Inferior Clergy continued to be so, till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 4<HI>th</HI> at least.</P>
<P>But that their Consents was also anciently asked in the making of Laws, we need go no farther than the Authority I have now given you from the Continuation of <HI>Florence</HI> of <HI>Worcester.</HI> And farther, that they were once a part of this great Council or Parliament, besides the Testimony of the <HI>Modus tenendi Parliamentum,</HI> (who tho he be exploded, as an ancient Author, yet certainly is a good Witness for his own time, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Edward</HI> the third) where the <HI>Procurato∣res Cleri</HI> are reckoned among the <HI>Constituent</HI> Members or States of Parliament, which is also confirmed by the two first Writs of Summons, we have left us on the Rolls, <HI>viz.</HI> the 23<HI>d</HI> of <HI>Edward I.</HI> where in this Clause of <HI>Praemun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entes Clerum</HI> is particularly exprest;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot.

The dangers in the Writ mentioned to be threatned from <HI>France</HI>) and that this was not the first time this Clause of <HI>Prae∣munientes</HI> was inserted in the Writs of Summons to Bishops, might be easily proved,
<PB N="555" REF="299"/>
had we all the Writs of Summons before the 23<HI>d</HI> of <HI>Edward I.</HI> as well as since: But we may hence observe, that the Inferior Clergy are not onely summoned to treat with the Prelates, but are as well as they, here authorised to Treat, Ordain, and Act with them, and the Lords, and Knights, Citizens and Burgesses (for so your Dr. himself here in the Margin translates, <HI>Aliis Incolis Regni</HI>) and how they could thus Consult and Act with them, if they had not bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then, as well as the Pre∣lates, a part of the same Body of the great Council or Parliament of the Kingdom.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already granted, that tho the Inferior Clergy have been, no necessary <HI>Constituent</HI> part of Parliament, for divers Ages last past, yet does it not follow, that therefore they never were so; since they have lost this Right by Degrees; and I shall now shew you by what steps it happen'd: First, there∣fore pray observe, that anciently all Abbots, and Priors whatever, as well those that held <HI>in Capite,</HI> as those that held in <HI>Frank Almoign</HI> were all summoned alike to the general Councils of the Kingdom; as appears by the first Councils after your Conquest, that we have any Monuments of; nay it also appears from that very Writ of the 6<HI>th</HI> of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> (if it were a Writ of Summons to Par∣liament) which as I have already proved at our last Meeting it is most likely it was not whereby the Bishop is to summon all the Abbots and Priors of his Diocess none excepted; and tho I grant that in the next Writ of Summons of the 26<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> to the Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> there is no Clause expres∣sed of summoning the Abbots and Priors, and other Clergy of his Diocess, yet it is much to be doubted, whether this were a Summons to Parliament or not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being without any Title of <HI>ad Parliamentum</HI> or <HI>Concilium.</HI></P>
<P>But that the Abbots and Priors, as well those that held <HI>in Capite,</HI> as those that held in <HI>Frank Almoign</HI> were summoned to the great Parliament of the 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> appears by that List of their Names, which both Mr. <HI>Pryn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parliament Re∣gist.</HI> Part 1. <HI>p.</HI> 106.108, 109, 110.</NOTE> and the Dr. have Printed from the Roll, nor' do I believe that this was the first time that all these Abbots and Priors being 101 in all were summoned to Parliament, notwith∣standing your Drs. fancy, that <HI>Simon Montsert</HI> summoned so ma∣ny of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.</HI> p. 138.139.</NOTE> onely because he was sure of them, since if we had the Rolls of the foregoing years, as well as of this; we should (no doubt) find little or no difference; for by another List of the Abbots and Priors,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> 156.157.</NOTE> which the Dr. himself has given us of the 23<HI>d</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the I. to the same Parliament above mentioned, when the Inferior Clergy were likewise summoned; there appears to have been seventy Abbots and Priors summoned to this Parliament, of which not a third part ever held <HI>in Capite</HI>; and tho divers of them then pleaded exemptions; yet they were many of them such as held <HI>in Capite</HI> as well as those that did not, as the Abbots of St. <HI>Edmunds Bury, Waltham,</HI> St. <HI>Albans, Evesham,</HI> &amp;c. all which, as it is notoriously known, held <HI>in Capite,</HI> and were commonly summoned to all Parliaments afterwards; now pray see how all this numerous Train of Abbots and Priors (which Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> confesses to have sometimes amounted to 122.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parliament Re∣gist.</HI> 141.</NOTE>) who were summoned to some Parliaments and great Councils; came to be omitted is to be ascribed chiefly to their own Petition and Desire, when their constant atten∣dance in Parliament when held every year; and frequently oft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er was counted a burthen rather than an advantage, by Reason of the great charge, and trouble of coming to those Assemblies; and their being bound to contribute to the gene∣ral
<PB N="557" REF="300"/>
Aids that were then given the King▪ and thence it is we find on the Rolls so many discharges upon their Petitions in Parliament, that they did not hold of the King by Barony nor <HI>in Capite</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 142. <HI>Vi.</HI> Seldens <HI>Titles of Ho∣nour,</HI> p. 731. to 735.</NOTE> nay the Abbot of <HI>Leycester</HI> after serving in no less than 50 Parliaments, yet in the 25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3<HI>d</HI> procured a writ of Exemption from the King, <HI>Quod non compellatur venire ad Parliamentum</HI>; the Lords in Parliament easily giving way to it, since they knew that the fewer hands, the Legislative Power was reduced to, the greater still was theirs that remained; to which may be added the Kings Pleasure, who by degrees began to omit summoning of divers of the smaller Abbots, and Priors before summoned; since it has been the policy of our Kings to reduce their great Councils or Parliaments, especially the Peers into as few hands as they could, because they are then most easily managed; and the Abbots and Priors never complained of it, for the Reasons already given; thus most of these came to be struck off by degrees,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> 141.</NOTE> till at last of all this nume∣rous company of Abbots and Priors there were in the Reigns of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3<HI>d. Richard</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th.</HI> and even to the dissolution of Monasteries under <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th,</HI> no more than 25 Abbots and two Priors, <HI>viz.</HI> the Prior of <HI>Coventry,</HI> and of St. <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> summoned to Parliament. I have dwelt the longer on the History of these Abbots and Priors, because it suf∣ficiently confutes your Drs. Notion of none but Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> appearing in Parliament.</P>
<P>But to give you some account of the Inferiour Clergy, how they likewise might come to be often omitted out of the Writs of Summons to great Coun∣cils, and not to make a constant part of the Parliament, but onely of the Convocati∣on; this might happen two or three ways, and that without any positive Law for it: As in the first place, pray consider the vast increase of Power, which fell to the Bishops, after King <HI>Henry</HI> the first, had given up his Right of Investitures to the Pope; by which means they depended not at all on the State, and so took upon themselves a greater Power of imposing upon, and making Temporal Laws for the Inferior Clergy in Parliament, as if they had been their Representatives; yet they could never represent all the Abbots and Priors, who held in <HI>Frank Al∣moign</HI> for the Reasons already given, as also because most of them were exempted from their Jurisdiction; But that the Bishops could never impose Taxes upon the Inferior Clergy at their Pleasure without their express consents in Parliament, or Convocation; appears by this memorable Writ of 9<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> 2<HI>d,</HI> to the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 154.</NOTE> which Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> has likewise given us; by which it appears that divers of the Clergy had consented to grant the King a subsidy in the precedent Parliament, but one∣ly by Reason of the absence of the said Archbishops, and others of the Prelates, and Clergy it could not then be done, and therefore the Archbishop is thereby ordered to call a Convocation for that purpose, which had been needless, if the Bishops alone could have Taxed the Inferior Clergy in Parliament or Convoca∣tion without their express Consents; so that it is plain, that in that Age they still retained a great share of the Supream Power, <HI>viz.</HI> of not being taxed, unless by
<PB N="558" REF="301"/>

<P>But to shew you further, how the Presence of the Inferior Clergy, and conse∣quently their summoning to Parliament became less necessary, we must have re∣course to the Bull of Pop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Boniface</HI> the 8<HI>th</HI> in the 24<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> I. by which he forbad all the Clergy of the Western Church, as well Superior as Inferior to give any more Taxes of Subsidies to Temporal Princes, without his Holinesses Licence; whereupon the King summoned the Bishops and Clergy to Parliament, at St. <HI>Ed∣munds-Bury</HI> in the 24<HI>th</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Reign; where when they then re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>used to grant him any supplies, he then, (as all the Historians tell us,) held his Parliaments at <HI>Westminister, Cum Baronibus suis, excluso Clero,</HI> without either Bishops, Abbots, or Inferior Clergy, which was the first Precedent of this kind, that we ever read of in this Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.

I have given you as good an account as I am able, how the Inferior Clergy, which as well as the Superior did once make a <HI>Constituent</HI> part of our great Councils, before the Conquest, nay for above 200 Years after, did at last cease to be so, partly by the prevailing Pow∣er of the Bishops, partly by the Usurpation of the Pope; tho chiefly by their own silence and consent not complaining of their want of Summons to Parlia∣ment, as long as they could 'scape scot free, and all the rest of the Kingdom pay Taxes, notwithstanding which the clause of their Acting, and Consulting with all the rest of the Estates in Parliament, still remaining in the Writs of Summons is a sufficient Monument to Posterity to prove their ancient Right.</P>
<P>And the Clergy of the lower House of Convocation was so sensible of this,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Dr.</HI> Bur∣nets <HI>History of the Reformation in the Collection of Records,</HI> ex Ms. <HI>Dr.</HI> Stillingfleet, <HI>p.</HI> 117.</NOTE> that among certain Petitions by them made to

<P>From whence you may observe, that as the same stile was observed there in the Titles of their general Councils or Parliaments as with us; and as the Inferi∣or Clergy there put after the Bishops and Abbots did not hold <HI>in Capite,</HI> but <HI>frank Abnoign</HI> in that Kingdom; So likewise by the same Analogy between the lowest Temporal State, with the Spiritual, the Commonalty of <HI>Scotland</HI> here stiled <HI>Com∣munitas Scotiae</HI> could not then consist onely of Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> as your Dr. and those of this Opinion suppose it did.</P>

<P>I must confess you have shewn me more, for the Inferior Clergies being once a <HI>Constituent</HI> part of the Parliament than ever I knew before; I will take time farther to consider them, but that the word <HI>Populus</HI> must needs then take in any more than the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> I much doubt, since the other word <HI>Plebs,</HI> which you so much insist upon from the old Book of <HI>Ely,</HI> signifies no more,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<Q>In it self signifies neither Great nor little People, but only Laity, and therefore as it is used and restrained, signifies either the Lay <HI>Plebs,</HI> or the Lay <HI>Magnates,</HI> as I can shew you by several Examples, as particularly out of <HI>Mat.

Now pray consider, that the Word <HI>Plebs</HI> is of a much more vulgar Signification than <HI>Populus,</HI> so that if the former did not signifie the Commons as now under∣stood, the latter cannot do so. And therefore I see no Reason to suppose that there Words must signifie the Commons.</Q>
The like Error I must tell you by the way, the Gentlemen of your Opinion have fallen into, concerning the Word <HI>Vulgus</HI> in the old Coronation Oath in Latine,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<P>This is but to urge the same thing over and over again, for that under the Word <HI>Populus</HI> were also comprehended the Commons, I have already suf∣ficiently proved, and can yet prove it further, from divers Historians and Re∣cords, both of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI> the 1<HI>st,</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI> the 2<HI>ds</HI> Reign; in the first place, therefore I must still put you in mind of that Passage so often cited,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 323.</NOTE> from <HI>Mat.

Te∣nants <HI>in Capite,</HI> since it did not concern Tenures at all; and was levied on those Knights Service, as well as upon those that did.</P>
<P><PB N="561" REF="302"/>But the Author of the Annals of the Abby of <HI>Burton</HI> is more full in this Point, for in <HI>Ann. Dom.</HI> 1255. being the 39<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> he tells us a Parliament was held at <HI>Westminster, Convocatis ibidem Episcopis Abbatibus Prioribus Comitibus, &amp; Baronibus, &amp; totius Regni Majoribus in quo, petebat</HI> [Rex] <HI>a Clero &amp; Populo, de Laicis feodis suis sibi suffragium exhiberi,</HI> &amp;c. (<HI>viz.</HI> For the Business of <HI>Sicily</HI>) and then goes on thus, <HI>disponens de suo iniquo Consilio Hoc prius a Clero, &amp; postmodum a Pop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lo Majori &amp; Minori extorqueri</HI>; from which passage, I shall observe, first, That all the Clergy in general, as well the Bishops and Abbots, as Inferior Cler∣gy are here stiled <HI>Clerus.</HI> Secondly, That the Nobility and Commons or whole Body of the Laity are altogether called <HI>Populus.</HI> Thirdly, That this <HI>Po∣pulus</HI> is there also distinguisht into the <HI>Major,</HI> and <HI>Minor,</HI> now as by the <HI>Major</HI> can be meant none but the greater Nobility, so the <HI>Populus Minor</HI> can signifie none, but the Commons in general, unless you will suppose that the Kings design was one∣ly to extort Money from the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> and no others.</P>
<P>But to put it farther out of all dispute, that this Word <HI>Populus</HI> when put af∣ter, and distinct from <HI>Magnates, Barones,</HI> and the like in our ancient Historians and Records, does signifie the Commons alone; I shall prove to you by the Patent Roll of 19<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. 20.</NOTE> (the Year after your Dr. supposes the Commons were called to Parliament) where there is a Writ directed, <HI>Baronibus Militibus, &amp; Liber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Hominibus de Wallia,</HI> reciting that the <HI>Comites Barones &amp; Populus de Regno,</HI> had lately freely granted a 15<HI>th</HI> of all their Moveables, and therefore desires like aid from the <HI>Welch</HI>; now nothing can be plainer than that by <HI>Populus</HI> in this Record must be meant the Com∣mons; and yet it is also as evident from another Record now in the keeping of the Remembrancer of the Exchequer, that this 15<HI>th</HI> was granted the year be∣fore in the 18<HI>th</HI> of this King; for by this Writ, or Commission he appoints Com∣missioners for the Collecting of that 15<HI>th</HI> of all Moveables; which the King thus recites, the <HI>Archiepiscopi, Episcopi, Abbates Priores Comites Barones, &amp; omnes alii de Regno, nunc sicut alias de nobis &amp; Progenitoribus nostris liberaliter fecerunt,</HI> to have lately freely granted him; which can be no other than that mentioned in the Record of the 19<HI>th,</HI> unless you can suppose that there was a 15<HI>th</HI> granted two years toge∣ther, which is very unlikely, and more than the Nation could then well pay.</P>
<P>So likewise by the Parliament Roll of 1 <HI>Edward</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M.</HI> 20.</NOTE> ap∣pears that <HI>Hugh le Dispencer</HI> Jun. had been in the Reign of his Father, <HI>Per Considerationem Parium, &amp; Populi Regni, &amp; per Assensum Domini Edwardi tune Regis Angl.</HI> exiled and Disinherited for ever, as a Traytor, to the King and Kingdom; that is, he was banish by the Joint Consent of King, Lords and Commons; now if <HI>Populus</HI> in these Records signifies the Commons after the time you own they appeared in Parliament; I would be glad to see some better Reasons than you have hitherto given me to prove that it could not have the same signification be∣fore the 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> or 18<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> I. yet that <HI>Populus</HI> does also some∣time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> signifie both Lords and Commons appears from, <HI>Mat. Westminster</HI> where relating how King <HI>Edward</HI> I. in the 34<HI>th</HI> year of his Reign, made his Son a Knight, then he tells us, <HI>Pro hac Militia filii Regis Concessus est Regi Trigesimus De∣narius
<PB N="562" REF="303"/>
à Populo &amp; Clero, Mercatores verò Vicesimum concesserunt.</HI> Yet that the Com∣mons had also a share in this Grant, the Dr. himself acknowledges in his Glossary, under the same Heads in these words;
<Q>It is evident from this Record, (meaning that of the 34th of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. abovementioned) who were the <HI>Populus,</HI> or People in∣tended by the Historian in this place, to wit, the <HI>Comites, Barones, &amp; alii Magnates nec non Milites Comitatuum.</HI></Q>
Now I desire to know whether the Knights of the Shires were not then Commoners as well as now, tho' reckoned among the <HI>Mag∣nates,</HI> and as a Superiour Order to the Citizens, and Burgesses here called by a general word <HI>Mercatores,</HI> who then gave a 20th part of their Moveables by themselves?</P>
<P>But that the word <HI>Plebs</HI> does not only signifie the Lay Nobility, but the Commons too, in both the Quotations you have made use of out of <HI>Mat. West∣minster,</HI> is also as plain, for in the first Instance concerning the Reception of the Legates, is it to be imagined that none but Earls, and great Lords accompanied them, and that there were no Knights or Gentlemen amongst them; and as for the words <HI>Primates,</HI> and <HI>Optimates,</HI> I think I have sufficiently proved that those do not only signifie the Lords, or Greater Nobility, but the lesser also: Nay, the Chief Citizens, and Magistrates of Cities and great Towns.</P>
<P>As for the next Authority concerning the <HI>Plebs</HI> that Granted the Eigth Penny it is much more evident that the Commons as well as the Lords must be com∣prehended under that Term; And that this is so, I need go no further than the Dr's own Concession in the same place a little farther; which you may read,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 25.</NOTE> in these words; <HI>And that the Agreement for the Confirmation of the Charters here mentioned was made, and the Eighth Penny granted by the Earls and Barons, and</HI> perhaps <HI>the</HI> Knights of Shires; <HI>and that they were the</HI> Plebs <HI>that stood about the King in his Chamber, is clear from the Writ of Summons of Par∣liament for two Knights in every County, dated</HI> Septemb. <HI>the</HI> 15<HI>th. immediately follow∣ing, to come and receive the Confirmation of the Charters and his Letters, that the paying of this Eighth Penny should not prejudice the Commons for the Future, and to do further what by his Son and his Council should be Ordained.</HI> So that the Dr. himself is forced to confess, (tho' sparingly) that the Knights of Shires were likewise there, and comprehended under the word <HI>Plebs</HI> at the time of this Grant: The King held this Parliament at his Pallace of <HI>Westminster,</HI> in some of the Halls or great Rooms, and the Commons might very well sit in the now Court of Requests, (then called the <HI>Alba Aula,</HI> or <HI>White Hall</HI>) (where Parliaments have been frequently held) and from thence be sent for by the King into the Painted Chamber, or now House of Lords, where the King then sate; and which might in respect of the Hall from whence they came be very well called, <HI>Camera Regis,</HI> for none can imagine his Presence Chamber or Bed-Chamber could hold all that Company, and in that Room the King might make that Speech to them which this Author men∣tions, and then upon his promising to renew the Charters, followed the Grant∣ing of the Eighth Peny <HI>ab Incolis,</HI> by the whole People immediately granted the said Subsidy: Now the Dr. grants in this place, That the <HI>Incolae</HI> here meant by the Historian were the <HI>Incolae</HI> Regni, <HI>such Inhabitants as used to Pay Subsidies and Aids,</HI> only the <HI>Plebs</HI> must here signifie the Lay Nobility. Now, if the <HI>Incolae Regni</HI> were such us used to Pay Aids and Subsidies, who made this Concession,
<PB N="563" REF="303"/>
can any Man doubt, but that this Grant was made by their Representatives of the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses; for if the Tax was general upon the whole Kingdom (as it appears it was) can you imagine that the Citizens, and Burgesses, were not there present when this Tax was given, as well as the Knights of the Shires; since it was to be levied upon all alike? Nor is the Dr's Obje∣ction of any weight, <HI>That because the King not long after Summoned another Parlia∣ment when he was beyond Sea, to meet his Son Prince</HI> Edw. <HI>at</HI> Westminster: <HI>That therefore it was not probable, that if the Commons had been at the Agreement, and granting of the Eighth Penny in the King's Chamber they would have been dismissed, and called again about the same business in so short a time, seeing the Confirmation of the Char∣ters was dispatched in Six Days, when the Parliamement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et</HI> October <HI>the Sixth.</HI> For the Dr. is very much mistaken to imagine that this was the same Business they met about before, when the very Writ of Summons shews the contrary. For the Tax was given already, and therefore they could not meet about that, but the Truth was, the King went away in haste into <HI>Flanders</HI> without Confirming the Charters: So that before the People would give any more Money, his Son Prince <HI>Edward</HI> was forced to confirm them, (as the Dr. himself confesses in the same place) After the Confirmation of these Charters, and that the Earls and Barons were satisfied. But as for the Dr's wondrous discovery of the false bad Translation of the old French Coronation Oath, I do so far indeed agree with him, that the words <HI>le Commune aura elu,</HI> are not to be translated; which the Commons, or Vulgar People, but the whole Community shall chuse; ren∣dered here by the word <HI>Vulgus,</HI> by the Old Monkish Translator: yet this can by no means signifie only the Bishops, Abbots, Lords, and Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI>; (for who ever knew the word <HI>Vulgus</HI> to signifie the Superior Clergy and Nobility?) and so to exclude the whole Body of the People in general. But <HI>Mat. Westm.</HI> tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol</HI> 431. n. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Concessus es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (viz. to <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> I) <HI>Novenarius Dena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius à Vulgo, à Clero vero Denus ad Scotorum P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtinaciam reprimendam,</HI> who had then invaded <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and harrassed the other Northern Countries.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 25.</NOTE> Now pray read the Dr's Comment upon these words in his Glossary. <HI>Here</HI> Vulgus <HI>is the same with</HI> Populus <HI>and</HI> Plebs <HI>when opposed to</HI> Clerus, <HI>or joyned with it as a Distinct Body of Men, and</HI> Clerus &amp; Populus, Clerus &amp; Plebs, Clerus &amp; Vulgus, <HI>are the</HI> Clergy and Layety, <HI>in the meaning of this Historian; whether the Earls and Barons alone, or the Temporal Earls and Barons with the Commons were understood by them, that is, the Commons represented in Parliament, and not the Mul∣titude or Rabble.</HI> Which indeed is a worthy discovery of the Dr's. Nor do I know any body so mad as so to render it in the Coronation Oath: but that this word <HI>Vulgus,</HI> when put for the whole Layety of the Kingdom is very ancient in that Oath: See the Old Coronation Oath in <HI>To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle</HI>'s Collection of old Statutes, who transcribed it out of some ancient Latine Copy of that Oath, or else from that Clause in the Coronation Oath of R. <HI>Richard</HI> II. which is still to be seen upon record.</P>
<P>I beg your Pardon for speaking these so long upon the true signification of these words <HI>Clerus</HI> and <HI>Populus, Plebs</HI> and <HI>Vulgus,</HI> since there was a necessity for it, by reason of those false glosses that that Dr. has with so much arti∣fice put upon them, still using them like Charms to bewitch and impose upon his unwary Readers: especially since a right Notion of these words is absolutely

necessary for the right understanding the true sense and meaning of our Ancient English Historian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> after all this pother the Dr. makes about the significa∣tion of those words <HI>Populus, Plebs,</HI> &amp; <HI>Vulgus,</HI> as synonimous as he grants them to be, they must all signifie the whole Body of the People, as well the Commons as the Lords represented in Parliament, by his own confession; or else, I leave it to your self to consider who of the two is guilty of levelling Notions, your Dr. or Mr. <HI>P.</HI> since one does but allert with the general consent of Ancient and Modern Writers, that the words <HI>Barones</HI> and <HI>Baronagium Angliae</HI> did anciently take in more than the Lords, and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>: And the Dr. straight calls him a man of Levelling Principles, and that jambles the Commons together with the Lords, whereas your <HI>Dr.</HI> can when he pleases make the words <HI>Plebs</HI> and <HI>Vulgus</HI> to to signifie the great Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> contrary to the subject matter on which he discourses, and to their Genuine signification either in Ancient or Modern Latine.</P>

<P>I must consess you have now told me more than I ever yet heard or read of, or indeed thought could have been urged, for the Inferior Clergies having been once a part of the Civil, as well as Ecclesiastical Council of the Kingdom; and I will consider farther of it: But in the mean time let me tell you; you have not been yet so clear in your Explanation of the other opposite word <HI>Populus</HI>; for admitting I should grant you, that there were in some sort Commons in Parliament as represented by the lesser Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> who were not Lords, yet does it not therefore follow that there must have been another rank, or order of Persons beneath, or different from them, since (as I said it is, but how) 'tis only the Custom; and Law of each Countrey that can determine what is the Community or Representative Body of the People, so that there is no such cer∣tain Analogy between the <HI>Clerus,</HI> when taken for the Inferior Clergy, and the <HI>Populus</HI> when taken for the lesser Nobility; or Tenants <HI>in Capite.</HI> Since in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> tho' their great Council or Parliament might consist of the Abbots, and Inferior Clergy as with us, who did not hold <HI>in Capite</HI>; yet you cannot deny, but that the Temporal Estate or Layety; (at least of late Ages) wholly con∣sisted of the Earls, Barons, Lairds, or smaller Barons, together with the Bur∣gesses of Royal Boroughts, all which held <HI>in Capite</HI>; and for ought as I can see from any clear Proofs you have brought to the contrary did so from Times beyond all memory; and so it might have been in <HI>England</HI> too, for ought as I know, for tho' you have taken a great deal of pains to Answer the Dr's. and my Arguments against the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> being the Representatives of the whole Kingdom in Parliament before the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, and 18th of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the First: and also to prove that the words made use of in our ancient Hi∣storians, Records, and Acts of Parliament, are of a more comprehensive signifi∣cation than to be confined to them alone: But you have not as yet proved that these Gentlemen who you suppose to have had Places in our great Councils, besides the Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> were Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses; or whe∣ther all the Lords of Mannours, or great Freeholders in <HI>England</HI> appeared there in person for themselves, and their under Tenants; therefore I pray be a little more clear in this point, and shew me some Authorities that the Knights of Shires, Citizens and Burgesses have been always constituent Members of Parlia∣ment

<P>I confess it is not my humour to be positive in any thing that is in the least doubtful, or obscure, and therefore as I will not maintain that Knights of Shires always a constituent part of Parliament, before your Conquest, or presently were after, tho' it is positively asserted by the Author of the <HI>Modus tenendi Parliamen∣tum</HI>; since the Antiquity of that Piece is justly questioned by Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> and other Modern Antiquaries; so on the other side, I shall not assert, that they were not there at all; but this much I think I am able to prove, that they were Summoned to Parliament long before the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, or 18th of <HI>Edward</HI> the First. But as for the Cities and Boroughs that they had their Representa∣tives in Parliament at, or presently after your Conquest I think I can prove from as undeniable Testimonies as can be expected: Since all the most ancient Rolls, and Records of great Councils and Parliaments are long since lost, and de∣stroyed.</P>
<P>Yet to shew you, that we have some very ancient Authors that seem to men∣tion not only the Citizens, and Burgesses, but Knights of Shires to have been summoned before the times you insist upon; and if it prove so, whether they were there from the very Time of the Conquest is not material; since if I con∣fute your, and your Dr's. Opinion of the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, and 18th of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, I carry the Cause, and you may then invent if you can some other Epocha whereon to fix their first appearing at our great Councils.</P>
<P>I shall therefore give you another Quotation out of the same old Monk <HI>Sulcar∣dus,</HI> which immediately follows the conclusion of the Charter of K. <HI>William</HI> the First, to the Abby of <HI>Westminster,</HI> but now cited: and it has been made use of not only by Mr. <HI>P.</HI> in his <HI>Ancient Rights of the Commons,</HI> &amp;c. but by Sir <HI>William Dug∣dale</HI> himself in his <HI>Origines Iuridiciales</HI>; as also by the Author of <HI>Argumentum A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti∣normaunicum,</HI> to prove the Commons to have been summoned to a great Council, in the 9th Year of K. <HI>William</HI> the First, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1075. the words, as cited in Sir <HI>William Dugdale</HI> are these, That after the King had Subscribed his Name to this Charter, with the Sign of the Cross; adding many of the Bishops, Abbots, and Temporal Nobility, instead of <HI>Cum multis aliis,</HI> hath these words, <HI>Multis praeterea illustrissimis virorum personis, &amp; Regni Principibus diversi Ordinis omissis qui huic Confirmationi piisimo affectu testes &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>autores fuerunt: Hii autem illo tempore à Regia potestate diversis Provinciis; &amp; urbibus ad universalem Synodum pro causis cu∣juslibet Christiane Eccles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e audiendis, &amp; tractandis ad praescriptum celeberriumum Coeno∣bium quod Westmonasterium dicitur Convoceti.</HI> Now I shall only ob∣serve from this Author,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 273. <HI>Tit.

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you need not read from the beginning of that Paragraph, since I so far agree with the Dr. as that by <HI>Principes diversi Ordinus,</HI> are not to be understood (as this Author renders them whom the Dr. here writes against) the Chief,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> 301.</NOTE> or Principal Men of several ranks or con∣ditions; but the Chief, and Principal Men of both Orders; <HI>viz.</HI> of the Clergy and Laity; yet will it not therefore follow (as the Dr. here would have it) that these <HI>Principes diversi Ordinis</HI> were only Bishops, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Abbots, and great dignified Clergy-men only; and the <HI>Procenes,</HI> and <HI>Magnates,</HI> the Earls, Barons, and Tem∣poral Nobility alone; for though I grant he produces several Quotations out of <HI>Florence</HI> of <HI>Worcester, Malmsbury Eadmer,</HI> to prove that <HI>Principes Regni Ecclesiastici &amp; Secularis Ordinis; Primates Regni utriusque Ordinis, &amp;c.</HI> were at these Councils, yet I have already proved that the words <HI>Principes,</HI> and <HI>Primates</HI> do not in their proper signification signifie none but Bishops, or dignified Clergy-men on the Temporal Nobility only; since these words mean no more than Chief, Princi∣pal, or most considerable men both of the Clergy, and Laity, who had by rea∣son of their Offices, Dignities or Estates any place in our General Councils at that time; and which did certainly comprehend the Inferiour Clergy also, tho' the Dr. has made bold to pass them by without any notice taken of them; and if they were then there, by the same Rule the lesser Nobility or Commons were also summoned from divers Provinces, Cities, and great Towns.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, But pray see here; does not the Dr. prove plain enough, that this Gentleman he writes against is mistaken in his Translation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> and applying the words <HI>Provinciis, &amp; Vrbibus,</HI> for Chief Lay-men from di∣vers Countreys, Cities, and Burroughs; whereas the Dr. here proves that the words mentioned in this passage cannot here mean Lay-men sent from County to Cities, but only the Bishops, whose Seats are here called <HI>Vrbes,</HI> and which, as the Dr. shews us, were by a great Council held at <HI>London</HI> in the year 1077. being the 11th of King <HI>William,</HI> translated from Villages to Cities, as were <HI>Sherburn</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire</HI> removed to <HI>Sarum, Selsey</HI> to <HI>Chichester, Litch∣field</HI> to <HI>Chester,</HI> which was before this Council at <HI>Westminster</HI> cited by <HI>Sulcardus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 302.</NOTE> which this Author places in the 14th of this King. And the Dr. here farther proves from these words following, <HI>pro causis cujuslibet Christianae Ecclesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI>; that this Universal Synod being called for hearing and handling the Causes of every Christian Church, that these words every Christian Church must certainly mean many Churches in <HI>England,</HI> which in reason and probability could not be meant of the small Parish-Churches all the Nation over, and therefore must be understood of Cathedrals or Churches, where Bishops Seats then were, or where they had been, or were to be re∣moved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray give me leave to answer this Comment of your Doctors, before we proceed farther. In the first place, suppose I grant him that by <HI>Vrbes</HI> may here be meant such Cities as had Bishops Seats, yet does it not therefore follow that it shall signifie no other Cities or Towns but Bishops Seats only; for tho' I grant in the Modern acceptation of this word <HI>Vrbs,</HI> here in <HI>England,</HI> a City, and a Bishops Seat are one and the same; yet it is plain, that at first it was not so, for then there had been no need of the Law you mention, whereby it was ordained
<PB N="567" REF="305"/>
that Bishops Sees should be removed from Villages to Cities; nor it seems were all of them so removed at this Council you mention; since the Dr. shews us from this very place here cited, that some of them still remained in <HI>Villis &amp; Vicis,</HI> in Villages and small Towns; and therefore it is here said, <HI>Dilatum est ad Regis Au∣dientiam qui in partibus transmarinis tunc Temporis bella gerebat:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>And tho' the Dr. here supposes (tho I know not on what grounds)
<Q>that the persons summon∣ed by the King to this Synod from Provinces and Cities, were such as were concerned, or able to advise the King in this matter, of the conveniency of the places whither the Removals were to be made, as Deans, Arch-Deacons, and other dignified persons, and Church Officers as well of the Clergy, as Laity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And also the <HI>Principes Regni,</HI> the great Nobility who were in those days present in those Assemblies.</Q></P>
<P>Now I shall only observe from these words of the Doctors, that even in his own supposition all Cities had not yet Bishops Seats annext to them, and there∣fore the word <HI>Vrbibus</HI> cannot mean Bishops Seats alone, but any other great, or walled Towns. But the worst of it is, it falls out very unluckily for the Dr. that this Charter we now mentioned bears date <HI>A. D.</HI> 1075. two years before this Law for removing Bishops Sees to Cities was made; so that all his Learned Comment on that matter signifies just nothing, and this is one of the Doctors very rational conclusions, which have no other ground than his own Fancy to support them.</P>
<P>In the next place pray observe, the Dr. owns that by these <HI>Principes universi Ordinis,</HI> were meant the chief Clergy-men and Nobility he there musters up, but passes by, or else did not consider the whole Context of these words, <HI>hii autem illo tempori diversis Provinciis, &amp; Vrbibus ad universalem Synodum Convocati</HI>; which must certainly refer to the <HI>Principes Regni diversi Ordinis,</HI> to the chief and considerable Men both of the Clergy and Laity of the Kingdom, who were alike summoned from divers Countreys and Cities, and great Towns to this Synod. Now pray do you or your Dr. tell me (if he can) what Earls, Ba∣rons, or great Noble-men, were then summoned from Cities, or great Towns, as well as the Bishops and Deans of Cathedrals, which if you cannot do, I see no reason why we may not understand these <HI>Principes Regni,</HI> who were also sum∣moned from the Countreys and Cities for the Representatives of the Com∣mons of those Cities and Towns at that time.</P>
<P>In the next place▪ I think the Dr. is as much out in his interpretation of the word <HI>pro causis cujuslibet Ecclesiae,</HI> for the causes of every Cathedral Church, since it must certainly mean not only Cathedral Churches, but all other Churches, whether Parochial, or Conventual; for that it takes in the latter, appears by one great cause of the summoning this Council, which was chiefly for the confirmation of the Priviledges of the Abby of <HI>Westminster,</HI> which sure was no Cathedral Church, and yet must be some Church or Ecclesiastical Corpora∣tion, or else this Synod could have had nothing to do with it▪ And I doubt not but this General Synod might, if it had pleased; have either made more Pa∣rish Churches, or united others where there were many, as we find was done in divers great Councils of this nature; and should it not then have been said to have met <HI>pro causis cujuslibet Ecclesiae,</HI> for the business of each Parish, as well as
<PB N="568" REF="306"/>
Cathedral Church? Lastly, The Dr. will have all these great Clergy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Lay-men, only to meet at this Council, to advise the King about what farther removals were to be made of Bishops bees; as if thereupon he had had the sole power of making what Laws about them, without their consent, or that of the Lay-Nobility, who tho' he will have to be always present in such Synods and Assemblies, yet does he not give them any Votes therein; whereas it appears by this Charter in <HI>Sulcardus,</HI> but now cited, that the Bishops, Abbo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Earls and Barons, whose Names are to it <HI>consenserunt &amp; signaverunt</HI>; and it was <HI>ab ipso Rage &amp; supra dictis Personis testificata, consixmata &amp; auctoxi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ata</HI>; which if I understand Latine, signifies not only that they witnessed, but also assented to; authorized, and confirmed it; which also more plainly appears more fully by the conclusion of the Charter of King <HI>Stephens</HI> but now cited, all which the Dr. passes by as slily as a Commentator does those words in a Text of Scripture that make against his sense; for this had quite ruined and destroyed his fine notion of the Great Councils of the Kingdoms then wholly consisting of a few Bishops, Abbots, dignified Clergy-men, and great Noblemen who had no∣thing else to do there but to look on whilst the King alone made the Law.</P>
<P>To conclude, to shew you that this Assembly was not only an Ecclesiastical Synod, but Civil Council also; or Parliament as we now call it; I will give you two good Testimonies for it, that we are not alone in this Opinion, the first is from Mr. <HI>Somners</HI> Glossary, <HI>Parliamentum Synodus magna vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atur</HI>; and to confirm this there is written in an old hand in the Margin of this Manuscript of <HI>Sulcardus</HI> over against the passage now cited, this Note; <HI>Nota hic amn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rari at Rege sua auctoritate ad causas Religionis tractandas tam nobitas de Clero, quàm Prin∣cipes Regni cum aliis inferioris gradus, quorum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> videtur essa Parliamentum.</HI></P>

<P>Yet I suppose you cannot deny but that the Dr. has plainly proved from several Quotations from <HI>Gervas</HI> of <HI>Canterbury, Rich.</HI> of <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul∣stad,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 302.</NOTE> and the Continuator of <HI>Florence,</HI> that the word <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ia</HI> in this place signifies a Bishops Diocess; and therefore that the <HI>Principes Regni</HI> who were summoned out of those Provinces or Diocesses were only the Bishops, Abbots, and other great Clergy-men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>punc;</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will not deny but that this word <HI>Provincia</HI> does sometimes in our An∣cient Authors signifie in an Ecclesiastical sense the Diocess of a Bishops, us these Authors (the Dr. has here cited) shew us; yet that it must be taken in a more unlimited signification in this place, is also as certain; since besides that this word <HI>Provin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sia</HI> does most commonly signifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Shire or County (as I have al∣ready shown) the very context sufficiently proves it, since <HI>Bulcardus</HI> says ex∣presly, that the chief persons of both Orders were summoned from the Coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, or Provinces, as I already said, which when it refers to Lay-men us well as to the Clergy, I hope you will not affirm that it can signifie Diocesses only; but that besides the Bishops, and Abbots, there were a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more persons prosess at this Council, both of the Clergy and Laity, the Dr. himself confesses. Let us therefore, consult the Authors themselves which Dr. <HI>Brady</HI> has cited for the sense of this word <HI>Provincia,</HI> and let us see how fairly he has dealt with them. Now pray Sir observe, it is true, the same words are almost repeated <HI>verbatim</HI> in every one of these Historians,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> <HI>R. Ha∣gulstad,

<Q>Now had such a thing been done by Mr. <HI>Petyt,</HI> it would have been branded by the Dr. with the hard Terms of taking away, or leaving unrecited such words and matters as he thought would either advance or destroy his Assertions, as he (how justly I leave it to you to judge) accuses Mr. <HI>P.</HI> in his Title to his first Edition of his Answer to him.</Q>

<P>I cannot believe the Dr. had any sinister meaning in leaving out this passage, but did it either because (as I said but now) he supposed these expressions as only Hyperbolical phrases, by which these Monkish Writers used to express all the Ecclesiastical or Lay-members of those Councils, or else be∣cause he did not think it worth while, since he might not look upon this innu∣merable company of Clergy and People here mentioned to have had any share or voice in this great Council, but only to have come thither as idle Spectators,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well: I think I shall easily Answer your and the Dr's. Learned Observa∣tions: First, as for the Monkish Hyperbolical Phrases of <HI>innumerae</HI> or <HI>numerosa Cleri &amp; Populi multitude</HI>; I confess, you might suppose there was somewhat in them, if they had been peculiar only to one, or two of them; but when all these Writers do
<PB N="570" REF="307"/>
with one consent agree, in almost the same words, to express all the Members of such Councils; I cannot see how they could have writ thus, unless they intend∣ed to be understood literally, that there were great Numbers both of Clergy-Men and Laicks, who appeared as Members of those Assemblies, far more than the Dr's. Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> &amp; that they had also Votes therein, appears by that Passage in the Conclusion of King <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Charter, which I quoted but now out of <HI>Sul∣cardus</HI>; when speaking of this very Council in the 3d of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> which we last mentioned; that not only the <HI>Comites, &amp; Barones Regni,</HI> but the <HI>innumera multitudo cleri &amp; Populi,</HI> were not only present, but <HI>Religioso favore voluntatem, &amp; Assensum Authoritati nostrae paginae, &amp; Privilegio praebuerunt,</HI> i. e. yielded their good wills and consents to this Charter of Priviledges to the Abby of <HI>Westmin∣ster.</HI> And to shew you farther that this infinite multitude of Clergy-men and Laics were also part of this Council; Pray remember the passage I but now cited out of <HI>Florence</HI> of the Council held at <HI>London, cum innumera Cleri &amp; Populi multitudine,</HI> who all alike gave their consents to the Constitutions by <HI>placet, placet, placet,</HI> and consider what the same <HI>Sulcardus</HI> has said in the next Council of the 4<HI>th</HI> of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> when after <HI>Concilio adunato Cleri &amp; Populi,</HI> and a recital of the Bishops, he concludes with <HI>Monachorum &amp; Clericorum Plebisque infinitae multi∣tudinis,</HI> as all alike Members of it.</P>
<P>Now I shall leave it to your self, or any sober, unprejudiced person to consider, whether it is likely that so grave and august a thing as the R. Charter of a Prince should take notice of the frothy consent and applause of the meer Rabble, or Mob (whether of the Clergy or Laity) or so judicious a Writer as this Author, and the rest of the Historians, (now cited) should have nothing else to do, but to record to Posterity for a very remarkable Transaction, that a great multitude of the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uary, or vulgar sort of People came to these Assemblies only to shout, and make a noise, for good Victuals and Drink; and therefore the Dr. and you, I hope, will pardon me if I still keep my former Opinion, that both the Arch-Bishops <HI>Lanfranc,</HI> and <HI>Anselm,</HI> were not only named or proposed by K. <HI>William</HI> the First and Second in the Common or General Council of the Kingdom, but were also therein Elected, or Chosen by the <HI>Citrus</HI> and <HI>Populus,</HI> according to the manner of that Age, and the literal meaning of those Ancient Authors, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B▪ A. A.</HI> p. 300.</NOTE> whose words the Dr. either leaves out of strives to wrest to quite another se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses▪ nor to his Objections against the Election of <HI>Lanfranc</HI> at all considerable:
<Q>For as to the first Objection against the literal sense of the Old Author <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nted at the end of <HI>Taylor</HI>'s Gavel kind; that he could not be Elected <HI>consensu totius Populi Angliae,</HI> because, who can believe that all the People of <HI>England,</HI> or the hundredth part of them, ever knew or understood of <HI>Lanfranc</HI>'s being made Arch-Bishop.</Q>
Now pray let me ask you this Question; supposing this Election had been made in a General <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, of the Clergy alone, and the words had been instead of <HI>totius Populi, totius Cleri Anglicae,</HI> would it not have been meer cavilling to ask how all the Clergy of <HI>England</HI> could leave their Livings, and come up to give their Consents at this Election, or that the hundredth part of them ever knew of it, since every body is sensible those words are not to be understood in a literal, but legal sense, that is, the whole Clergy are said to give their Consents to a
<PB N="571" REF="307"/>
thing when they do it by their lawful Representatives, the Bishops and Procu∣rators of the Inferiour Clergy? And why may not the whole People of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> be as well said to give their Consents to this Election by their lawful Re∣presentatives at that time? But that we are not singular in this Opinion, pray see what Arch-Bishop <HI>Parker</HI> says in his <HI>Antiquitates Brittannicae</HI> of this Election of <HI>Lanfranc's; celeberrima est autem hujus, prae caeteris Electio, &amp;c. Electus est enim à Majoribus Cantuarensis Ecclesiae, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n access<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Procerum, atque Praesulum, totius∣que quasi Populi consensus in Aula Regis, quod sanè est inslar Senatus seu Parliamenti Anglicani.</HI> As for the next Objection against this Election of <HI>Lanfranc</HI>'s, it is yet weaker than the former, because the Dr. has answered this Question himself how the English Saxon Bishops, Barons, and the whole People should chuse a Stranger, a Person they had never known, and postpone all their deserving Countrey-men? Now pray read a very good Solution to this difficulty (if he may be believed) in his Answer to Mr. P. wherein he tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 14, 15.</NOTE> that King <HI>William</HI> had taken away from the English their Estates, and gave them to his Normans, and that this he did from his very first coming in, and then reckons up the Earldoms he gave to his Norman followers. Now if the English had then no Estates, they could sure have no Places or Votes in that great Council when <HI>Lanfranc</HI> was chosen; but if to solve this you will say as the: Dr. does in his Answer to <HI>Antin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s mannicum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 300.</NOTE> that this Council was held about the fourth year of the Conqueror, some years before he had made an absolute Conquest, and that the English Bishops, and Barons, and Freemen had still some Estates left, and therefore might then make the major part of this great Council, when <HI>Lanfranc</HI> was made Bishop, so would never have Elected him had it been left to their choice:
<Q>Pray tell me if the fear of refusing be a sufficient Objection that he was not Elected, whether or no it will not be as strong an Objection against his being Elected by the Seniors of the Church of <HI>Canterb.</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Gervase</HI> tells us expresly he was,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gervas.

And now suppo∣sing his Power to have been as great (as a Conqueror) in the Common Council of the Kingdom, as in the Chapter of <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI> why may we not say almost in the same words they could not; they durst not refuse him (who was already Elected by the Prior and Chapter of <HI>Canterbury</HI>) for fear of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing their Estates: But if an Election that cannot be refused, is none at all, the Dr. may do well to consider whether there was then, or is now, any Canonical Elections of Bishops in <HI>England</HI> at this day.</Q></P>

<P>Tho I think I have sufficiently at our last Meeting from the Charters of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> as also from the Words <HI>Communitas</HI> and <HI>le Commune,</HI> that
<PB N="572" REF="308"/>
the Common Council of the Kingdom consisted of many more Members than your Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI>; yet to let you see that the Historians and Armalists of those times did comprehend all the several Orders under the general Titles of <HI>Clerus,</HI> and <HI>Populus,</HI> or <HI>Magnates</HI> and <HI>Proceres</HI> you may see in the Chron. of <HI>Thom. Wikes, A. D.</HI> 1237. Where it is only said in general that the <HI>Clerus</HI> and <HI>Populus Regni</HI> did in that Year being the 9<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d</HI> grant the King a 30<HI>th</HI> of all their Moveables for the Confirmation of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and which is more remar∣kable, the Parliament which was held in 1264. being 49<HI>th</HI> of this King; is onely thus mentioned by this Author, in an historical way <HI>transacto siquidem vice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mo die N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tivitatis Dominicae sacta est London pes Comitem</HI> (seil, Leyeestriae) <HI>Convocatio non minima Procerum Anglicorum,</HI> &amp;c. Where in the Annals of <HI>Waverly</HI> in this Year it is one∣ly said, <HI>Factum est Parliamentum magnum Londonia,</HI> &amp;c. Now pray observe, that either the Commons are mentioned by <HI>Wikes</HI> under the Name of <HI>Proceres</HI> or not at all; and that under the Word <HI>Parliamentum</HI> the Commons were then compre∣hended, appears by the Agreement between the King and the Barons there extant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Annal. Waver∣ly,</HI> p. 217.</NOTE> which is said to be made, <HI>De unanimi as∣sensu, &amp; voluntate nostra (s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ili Regis)</HI> Edwardi <HI>Filii nostri Praele∣torum Vomitum, &amp; Baronum &amp; Communitatis dicti Regni nostri</HI>; now it must be granted, since it appears by the Writs of Summons of 49 <HI>H.</HI> 3. that the Commons were there; and consequently must be comprehended under this Phrase of <HI>Communitatis Regni,</HI> and if this had been the first time they had been summoned; 'tis strange none of these Authors should take any notice of so remarkable an Al∣teration, and change of the <HI>Constituent</HI> parts of our English Parliaments. But that the Knights, Citizens and B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgesses were also summoned in the next year in a Parliament of the 50<HI>th</HI> of this King, you may see in the said <HI>Wikes</HI> Chronicle,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Ann. Dom.</HI> 1265. where He sets down all the <HI>Constituent</HI> Estates of Parliament, which were summoned to meet at <HI>Westminster,</HI> at the Translation of St. <HI>Edwards</HI> Reliques in these Words, <HI>Con∣vocatis universis Angliae Praelatis &amp; Magnatibus nec non cunctarum Regni sui Civitatum paritir, &amp; Burgorum potentioribus ut Translationis Solemnia Celebrius illustrarent,</HI> where∣the Knights of Shires are comprehended under <HI>Magnates</HI> and the Citizens and Bur∣gesses are here stiled <HI>Potentiores Civitatum &amp; Burgorum.</HI> And that this was not only for a meer Ceremony, but for Parliament Business also, see the next page, where he tells us, <HI>Celebratae tundem tuntae translationis solemnitate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>perunt Nobiles</HI> (i. e. all the Estates above mentioned) <HI>ut assolent, Parliamentationis genere de Regis &amp; Regni negotiis pertracture,</HI> &amp;c. And in which Parliament the King so far prevailed as to obtain a 20<HI>th</HI> part of all Moveable Goods of the Laity. And yet the Continuator of <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> in the Affairs of this year takes no notice of this Parliament, but only says in General that St. <HI>Edwards</HI> Body was this Year translated into its new Shrine. And the Annals of <HI>Waverly</HI> Printed in the same Volume under this Year make mention of this Parliament in general terms, thus <HI>Facta Convocatione Episcopo∣rum, Comitum, Baronum, Abbatum, Priorum &amp; multerum aliorum.</HI> So uncertain a thing it is wholly to depend upon the general Expressions of Monkish Writers without comparing them and the Records together, and considering the Subject matter about which they treat; nor can we suppose that the <HI>Constituent</HI> parts of our Par∣liaments were shope and changed as often as they did their Phrases; and ways of
<PB N="573" REF="308"/>
expressing the parts of them. For they not foreseeing the differences that might arise about these matters, had no Reason particularly to recite the <HI>Constituent</HI> Members or Estates of Parliament, as often as they had occasion to mention them, it being very well known who they were at that time. But to prove fur∣ther, that it was not likely there was any Alteration in the <HI>Constituent</HI> parts of the Parliament, from what it was in the 49<HI>th,</HI> may appear by his Writ still extant among the Parent Rolls of the 54<HI>th</HI> of this King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Pat.</HI> 54. <HI>H.</HI> 3. m. 7.</NOTE> where it is expresly recited, that it not seeming safe to the <HI>Praelatis, Magnatibus, &amp; Communicati Regni nostri</HI> that both Him∣self and his Son Prince <HI>Edward</HI> should be both out of the Kingdom at once in the Holy Land, and that therefore he gives the whole Subsidy of a 20<HI>th</HI> granted him by the whole Kingdom to his said Son: and that it continued so in the begin∣ning of <HI>Edward</HI> the firsts Reign, appears by a Protestation in the 4<HI>th</HI> of this King; as it is found in the Patent Rolls, wherein he recites a 15<HI>th,</HI> to have been granted him of all Moveables, by the <HI>Comites, Barones, ac alii Magnates, &amp; Communitas Reg∣ni nostri.</HI> So that unless the Sense of these Words <HI>Communitas Regni</HI> must alter every Year, there is no Reason for us to believe any change to have been in the <HI>Constituent</HI> parts of Parliament since the 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d.</HI> this I think may be sufficient to shew you that before the time you mention nor only the Knights of Shires, but the Citizens and Burgesses did appear in Parliament both before your 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> 3<HI>d,</HI> and 18<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> I.</P>

<P>I believe the Commons might be comprehended under the general Words <HI>Magnates &amp; Proceres</HI> by <HI>Wikes's</HI> Chronicle in the 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> or else not be mentioned at all, which I rather incline to believe, and I must also confess that the other Passage out of the same Author concerning the Citizens and Burgesses being summoned either to a great Council or Parliament in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> is more than I before ever took notice of. Yet since this Author does not tell us, whether it was to the one, or the other; nor how ma∣ny of them were there, whether one onely, or more for each City and Burrough Town, or whether they were elected by the People or nominated by the King to appear there, does not appear from this Author, but as for the Words <HI>Commu∣nitas Regni</HI> mentioned in the Agreement of the 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> 3<HI>d,</HI> tho it might sig∣nifie the Body of the Commons in that Record; yet if they were not again sum∣moned to Parliament, till the 18<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the I. it signified onely the Body of the lesser Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> till after the 18<HI>th</HI> of that King.</P>

<P>I am sorry to see Prepossession and Prejudice has so much overrun you as to hinder you from closing with the Truth, for pray tell me, if this Author could in the 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> (when the Commons were summoned without dispute) comprehend all the Estates of that Parliament under the General Words of <HI>Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eres,</HI> and <HI>Magnates,</HI> and the Knights of Shires are understood by the same Word in the next Passage cited out of the same Author, why might not other Writers do so too in other Parliaments? as for your next Exception it is a very small Cavil; for it appears that this Summons of the Citizens and Burgesses at the Translation of King <HI>Edwards</HI> Relicks was to a Parliament by the Words that follow, <HI>Nobiles ut assolent, Parliamentationis genere de Regis, &amp; Regni negotiis per∣tractare</HI>; and why these Citizens and Burgesses should not be as well Elected by
<PB N="574" REF="309"/>
their respective Cities and Burroughs this Year as well as the last, as it appears they were by the Writ to the Cinque Ports; which the Dr. and Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> has given us;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.</HI> p. 140. <HI>Prins Parlia∣ment Register.</HI></NOTE> I desire you would give me any satisfa∣ctory Argument to the contrary. As for you Objection against the Words <HI>Communitas Regni</HI> being to be understood for the Bo∣dy of the Commons in 54<HI>th Henry</HI> 3<HI>d,</HI> it is altogether as unreason∣able; since this is to make the <HI>Constituent</HI> parts of the Parliament, alter not onely when Writers shift their Phrases, but when they do not; and that without any other Reason, but because the Writs of Summons and Parliament Rolls of those times are all perisht, and to deny the Commons were there onely for that Reason; is altogether as unjust as for any Court of Justice to turn a man out of the actual and long Possession of an Estate meerly because his Writings and Evidences by the carelessness or roguery of his Servants have happen'd (a great many) of them to be lost or burnt.</P>
<P>But fully to convince you (if possible) that Dr. <HI>Bradyes</HI> Opinion of the Commons not being again summoned from the 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> till the 18<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the first is a meer Fancy of his own, and contrary to the express Au∣thorities both of Historians and Records. And to come to plainer proofs, pray in the first place take notice, that it appears by a Writ of the 11<HI>th</HI> of King <HI>Edward</HI> the I. to the Archbishop of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI> acquainting him with the Rebellion of <HI>Lewellyn</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Walliae.</HI> m. 4. n. 2. <HI>dorso.</HI></NOTE> that he had <HI>de Consilio Praelatorum, Procerum &amp; Mag∣natum Regni, nec non totius Communitatis ejusdem,</HI> resolved God willing to put an end to this <HI>Welch</HI> Rebellion; so that this war seems to have been resolved upon at the Parliament held the Year before, and now mentioned in this Record; a War which that Valiant, and Fortunate Prince effectually con∣cluded by the total subduing of <HI>Wales,</HI> and killing of <HI>Lewellyn,</HI> whose Head was cut off and sent to <HI>London,</HI> the particulars of which War <HI>Knighton,</HI> as well as other Historians relate at large;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 2463.</NOTE> and also that pre∣sently after <HI>David</HI> the Brother of this <HI>Lewellyn,</HI> the cause of all these Mischiefs was (as this Author shews us) <HI>in Magno Parliamento</HI> at <HI>Shrews∣bury</HI> Condemned, and afterwards hang'd, drawn and quarter'd.</P>
<P><HI>Walsingham</HI> is more short in the Relation of this Parliament, one∣ly says,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Walsing. Hist. Aug.</HI> fol. 51.</NOTE> that in the 11<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the I. <HI>Habitum est Parliamen∣tum</HI> at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> in which this <HI>David</HI> was Condemned and Ex∣ecuted as before. But <HI>Thomas Wikes,</HI> who lived at this very time in his Chronicle,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chron</HI> Thom. Wikes, <HI>Fol.</HI> 111.</NOTE> but now cited, will better instruct us than either <HI>Walsingham</HI> or <HI>Knighton,</HI> and his account of this Parliament is as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1282. <HI>Circa festum sti Michaelis Rex convocari fecit apud Salopesberiam Majores Regni sui &amp; Sapientiores tam de Civibus, quam de Magnatibus &amp; fecit illuc addaci</HI> Da∣vid, <HI>qui apud Rothelan fuerat captivatus ut super exigentiam Delicti' sui corpore subiret Iudicium,</HI> &amp;c. and then relates at large the manner of his Execution, from which Passage we may observe, that this Author makes it plain who were the <HI>Communitas Regni</HI> mentioned in the Record of the 11<HI>th</HI> of this King; and who constituted this great Parliament at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> viz. <HI>Majores &amp; Magnates Regni,</HI>
<PB N="575" REF="309"/>
which last, as I have now often proved, takes in the Knights of Shires, and the wisest of the Citizens.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But yet this Author says no more but that the <HI>Majores Regni &amp; sapientiores tam de Civibus, quam de Magnatibus,</HI> were called to this Parliament wherein <HI>Lewellyn</HI> was condemned: Now it doth not appear that these <HI>Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> were Elected, or that there were any Burgesses chosen for the Burroughs, or that there were any Knights chosen by the Counties; there were indeed <HI>Magnates</HI> called to this Parliament, but they might be all Tenants <HI>in Capite.</HI></P>

<P>Well then, since you will not be satisfied without direct, and evident proof, such as neither your self nor Dr. <HI>B.</HI> will I hope deny; pray take this which Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI> has not long since communicated to me; and which he has lately dis∣covered in <HI>Rotulo Walliae,</HI> in a bye Roll not taken notice of by any Body as I know of before;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Walliae</HI> 11. E. 1. m. 2. <HI>dors.</HI> Id. ibid.</NOTE> it is a formal Writ of 11<HI>th Edward</HI> I. for summoning the Temporal Lords to be with that King at a Collequy (or Parliament) <HI>opud Salop in Crastino Sti. Michaelis</HI>; and there is in the same Roll a second Writ directed to several Cities, and Burroughs for Electing two Citizens; and two Bur∣gesses to this Parliament with a void space to insert more Names.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id. Ibid.</HI></NOTE> And also a third Writ is there directed to the Sheriff of every County in <HI>England</HI> to cause to be chosen two Knights, <HI>pro Communitate ejusdem Com∣mitatus.</HI> And lastly, there is a 4<HI>th</HI> Writ directed to the Justices and others of the Kings Learned Council. With the same Preambles to each of them, all be∣ing commanded to appear at the same time and place; now what can Dr. <HI>Brady</HI> say to this, that he who was so long Keeper of these Records, and sure ought to have perused them, (as he did many others of the same Reign,) yet has either willfully or carelesly passed by this so memorable a Record. And so I hope, this will convince you for the future of the danger of being over positive in an Opini∣on, because it could not presently be confuted; and let you see that it is not at all improbable, but that the like Writs of Summons would appear as well before the 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> as in the rest of the Years of his own, and his Sons Reign, had not those Records been lost and destroy'd, which considered, we have Rea∣son to thank God for those that the Iniquity of the times have yet le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess you have told me more than ever I yet thought could be produced against the Drs. Opinion; and I should be throughly convinced could you shew me any Writs of Expences for the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, who appeared at this Parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will not averr against an express Record, tho the Writs of Ex∣pences for that Year are lost (being never entred upon the Roll) by the Omi∣ssion of the Clerks, who as Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> acknowledges, oftentimes neglected the Entries of Writs of Summons themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.</HI> 4<HI>th Part of Parliament Register,</HI> p. 12.</NOTE> as well as of Expences; but if this were any material Objection, then there should have been no Commons summoned to any Parliament from the 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d.</HI> to the 28<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the first; when the fist Writs of Expences (except those of the 49<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d</HI>) do first appear upon the Rolls, and so you must then go from the Drs. new Notion of the Commons being again summoned in the 18<HI>th</HI> of this King; but to shew you that
<PB N="576" REF="310"/>
these expences for the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses could be no new things; pray peruse the Clause in this second Writ. <HI>de expensis Militum &amp; Burgensium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. Claus.</HI> 28. <HI>E.</HI> 1. m. 12. <HI>dorso.</HI></NOTE> of the 28<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> I. we have upon the Rolls, the Writ is to the Sheriff of <HI>Sammershire</HI> to pay to the Knights of that County, <HI>Venientibus ibidem nobisoum de diversis negotiis nos, &amp; Populum Regni nostri specialiter tangentibus Rationabiles expensas su∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in veniendo ad nos ibidem, morando, &amp; inde ad propria redeando</HI> (and now observe what follows) <HI>prout, alias in Casu Consimili furi consuerit:</HI> Now pray tell me, how this last Clause could ever be true, if the Knight of Shires, Citizens and Burgesses had never been summoned to Parliament, since the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> which was but 32 Years, or the 18<HI>th</HI> of this King, but 10 Years before this Writ, was published all over the Kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess what you now say, seems to carry some weight with it; but yet in my Opinion falls far short of a Prescription, since a thing might be said to be done; as in like Cases was accostomed, tho it had never been practised above 20, or 30 times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see neither you nor your Dr. by Reason of your different imployments had ever any true Knowledge of the Nature of Tenures and Prescription; accor∣ding to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> which He is not to be blamed for, had he not ta∣ken upon him to be so great a Master in both; but I hope he will for the Future remember, that old <HI>Adage ne sutor ultra Crepidam,</HI> therefore to set you Right for the future, you must know that the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses have e∣ver claimed, being summoned to all Parliaments by Prescription, as I shall prove by and by; but as for that part of it called Custom, my Lord <HI>Cook<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> tells us in his Notes upon <HI>Littleton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 106.</NOTE>
<Q>That in every Custom there be two Essential parts; Time and Usage, Time out of Mind, and Continual Peaceable Usuage without lawful Interruption.</Q>
Now the Common<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have in all times beyond the Memory of Man, challenged to have enjoyed, both those Essential parts of Common Law or general Custom. So that these words <HI>Praut C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>su'Cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mili consuevit</HI> must be by Implication of Law extend beyond the times of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI> the 1<HI>st.</HI></P>
<P>And for proof of this, I shall shew you what claimes the Commons have made to this Usage from time immemorial; therefore I shall begin with Mr. <HI>P's</HI> first Argument in his Rights of the Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Page</HI> 7.</NOTE> asserred, Where the Burgesses of St. <HI>Albans</HI> in their Petition to King <HI>Edward</HI> II. in Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot.

<P>I confess the Gentlemen of your Party make a great deal of Noise with this Quotation, but if it be strictly lookt into, I believe it will prove of no such great consequence as you would make it. For Mr. <HI>P.</HI> hath concealed the main Cause of these Burgesses pretending a Right of sending Members to Par∣liaments, and therefore 'twill not be amiss to give you the rest of it at large.</P>
<P><HI>Ad Petitionem Burgensium villae de Sancto Albano sugg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rentium Re∣gi, quod licet ipsa tenent villam praedictam de Rege in capite &amp; ipsi</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.A.P.</HI> p. 38.</NOTE> <HI>sicut caeteri Burgenses Regni ad Parliamen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a Regis cum ea su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>noniri contigerit per duos Comburgenses suos venire debeane prout totis retroactis temporibus ve∣nire, consueverunt pro omnibus servitiis Regi faciendis, &amp;c.</HI> By which words, as the Dr. very well shews us it is evident, that the Burgesses of St. <HI>Albars</HI> claim'd not, nor prescribed to come to Parliaments as meerly from a Burrough, but as from a Town that held in Chief of the King, and this Service was inci∣dent to their Tenure, and was such as the King's Progenitors had accepted in lien of all Services due by reason thereof.</P>
<P>And farther, the Answer to this Petition is remarkable, which amounts to no more than this, that if it did appear by the Roth of <HI>Chancery,</HI> that the Bur∣gesses of St. <HI>Albans</HI> were wont to come to Parliaments in the time of the King's Progenitors, <HI>then such as have been called</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> to Parliament) should be called when there was necessary for it.

But besides, the Doctors errour in supposing that no ancient Cities or Burroughs had any Right of sending Members to Parliament, but only as they held of the King <HI>in Capite,</HI> his mistake is yet much more gross in his construing those remarkable words in the King's Answer to the Burgesses of St. <HI>Albans, Et tunc fiat eis super hoc Iustitia, vo∣catis evocandis si necesse fuerit.</HI> Thus,
<Q>And then let them have Iustice in this matter, and such as have been called, may be called, if there be necessity. <HI>Upon which words you have also from the Dr. put this pleasant gloss;</HI> Hence 'tis clear the King and his Council were equally judges when it was necessary to call them, and for them to come; as they were of their Rights and Pretences to come.</Q>
But I must needs tell you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> think nothing can be more absurd, and contrary to the genuine sense of this Re∣cord, than the Doctor's construction, who will needs have the words <HI>evocatis evocandis,</HI> only to mean a Calling, or Summoning to Parliament, which is quite con∣trary to the true sense of the King's Answer to this Petition; for if that had been his meaning▪ that those only should be summoned to Parliament whom the King pleased to call, to what purpose were these words, <HI>scrutentur Rotuli, &amp;c. de Cancell. si temporibus Progenitorum Regis Burgenses praedicti solebant venire vel non?</HI> For if their coming to Parliament had been a matter of meer grace and favour, and not of right, &amp; so wholly left in the King's breast whether they should come, or not it, was in vain for him to command the Rolls of <HI>Chancery</HI> to be searched whether the said Burgesses us'd to come to Parliament or not in the times of his Progenitors; or if it had not been a matter of right, why should it be here said, that upon search of the Rolls, <HI>Tunc fiat Iustitia,</HI> let Justice be done, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there never was such a right of Prescription by which they claimed? But I much wonder that the Dr. (so great a Critick in Records) should ever construe them <HI>evocatis evocandis,</HI> a summoning or calling to Parliament; and I desire you would shew me in what Parliament Roll, or Ancient Record you can find <HI>eve∣ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<P>I shall no longer contend with you about the genuine sense of these last words, since perhaps you may be in the right; but yet for all that, it does not appear, that the King and his Council did by this Answer allow this Petition of the Town of St. <HI>Albans</HI> to be true, that they had sent Burgesses to Parliament in the time of his Predecessors, much less that any other City of Burrough in <HI>England</HI> were then allowed such a right by Prescription.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant indeed that this Petition doth not absolutely allow the matter of fact, (as it concerns the matter in dispute between them and the Abbot) to be true, as it is there set forth, neither yet does it condemn it for false; but whe∣ther it were true, or false, it matters not, for both the Petition and the Answer do sufficiently prove the Point for which we make use of it; (<HI>viz</HI>) that it was then received for a general Custom, or Law, time out of mind, that the Cities and Burroughs had sent Members to Parliament according as in the Petition is set forth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.R.C.</HI> p. 10.</NOTE> otherwise it can scarce be supposed (much less believed) that the Burgesses of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> or the Pen-man of this Petition should dare to tell the King, and his Learned Council, in the face of the Parliament, so great, and ridiculous a Novelty to be recorded to Posterity, as that they and their Predecessors in the time of King <HI>Edward I.</HI> and his Proge∣nitors, had sent two Burgesses to every Parliament, or that the King and his Council should have ever received this Petition without indignation, and a se∣vere rebuke for their Impudence; If all the World the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> knew, (as certainly they must (were it true) that there was never any Election of Burgesses to Parlia∣ment before the 49th of <HI>Henry III.</HI> (which was but fifty years before the 8th of <HI>Ed. II.</HI>) who from thence had appeared no more till the 18th of <HI>Ed. I.</HI> which was but 24 years before the delivery of this Petition, a time which must have been then fresh in the memories of most of the Kings Council there present: Where∣as they allow this general Claim of Prescription, and every person, (tho' but meanly skill'd in our Law) does understand a general Prescription; <HI>viz. à tempore cujus contrarium memoria hominum non existit,</HI> what it was then, and so remains, by the Law of <HI>England</HI> at this day, as appears by our Ancient Records, Law-books, and Judicial Proceedings.</P>
<P>And surely the Burgesses of St. <HI>Albans</HI> did not ground their Petition of Right upon an Affirmation <HI>in Nubibus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 11.</NOTE> but the Justice &amp; certainty of their Claim, as they very well knew, which so they prayed it might be examined by uncontroulable proofs: The Rolls of <HI>Chancery,</HI> and the King, Chancellor and all the Council, did no less know there were such
<PB N="580" REF="312"/>
Entries on the Rolls, and therefore order their search; whereas if the very ground of their Petition had been notoriously false, and idle (as it must have been if neither this, nor any other Burrough had sent Burgesses to Parliament before the 49th of <HI>Henry III.</HI>) then instead of recording this Petition and Answer, to future Ages, they would with contempt and indignation have rejected it, nor would the Abbot of St. <HI>Alban</HI>'s Council, and the Sheriff of <HI>Hertford</HI> against whom this Petition was exhibited, have been wanting in their own defence to have shewed that this Ancient Prescription not only of this, but of all other Bur∣roughs was a meer Chimera and Fable: But instead of this we do not find they made any opposition against it, because they knew they had been summoned and appeared at divers Parliaments before that time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parl. 3. p. 202.</NOTE> as you may see in <HI>Prins</HI> Parliamentary Register they were in the 28th of <HI>Edward I.</HI> which is almost as early as we have any Writs of Summons left us, to the Commons of this King's Reign: And tho' it is true, the Sheriff of <HI>Hertford</HI> in this 28th returns that the Bailiffs had made no Return of the Precept sent them; yet this plainly proves that they were then looke upon as a Burrough, and that it was very well known, that it was wont to send Bur∣gesses to Parliament, or else it had been a vain thing for him to have sent them any such Precept at all: And tho' it is also true, there are no more Returns from St. <HI>Albans</HI> left us till the 35th of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, yet that is no good Ar∣gument against their Appearance in the former years, since the Writs and Re∣turns upon them being in loose bits of Parchment, might very well be lost, as well as they are for many other places: But that the Burgesses of St. <HI>Albans</HI> were summoned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parl. 4. p. 36. B. 7.</NOTE> and appeared in Parliament in the 35th of <HI>Edw. I.</HI> appears (tho' the Returns be lost) by the Writs of Expences of this year (being the first we have left us in <HI>Prin</HI>'s Parlia∣mentary Register) for the Cities and Burroughs; in which Lift the Burgesses of St. <HI>Albans</HI> are first upon the Roll; and that they were in Parlia∣ment before this time, may further appear by that Clause at the end of the Writ which I have already taken notice of, <HI>viz.</HI> That they were to have their Experces for coming, staying, and returning, <HI>prout in casu consimili fieri consuevit</HI>; which words relate to Ancient Custom, and extend to St. <HI>Albans,</HI> as well as no any other Burrough there mentioned: And that they also were summoned, &amp; appear∣ed in <HI>primo &amp; jecundo</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, (in whose Reign this Petition was exhibited,) you may see in <HI>Prin</HI>'s Parliamentary Registers, both third and fourth parts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 200 p. 900.</NOTE> in the last of which you may find the Names of the Burgesses returned in the first and fifth of this King, as they might have been seen also in the second: Had not the Re∣turn (as Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> then acknowledges) been torn off▪ tho' it is plain that they appeared there; and so may be likewise lost for all the rest of the years of this King till the Second of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, when we find they appeared again, and so continue to send Burgesses to this day. And if it be a good Argument of their Non appearance from the defect of Records, I'll undertake to prove that <HI>London</HI> and several other Cities did not send any Citizens to Parliament in seve∣ral Kings Reigns, as you may see in this List of Towne (whose Writs of Expences we now mentioned) of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5th of King <HI>Edward</HI> the First<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where <HI>London,</HI> and
<PB N="581" REF="312"/>
most other great Cities are omitted, and yet St. <HI>Albans</HI> is in. To conclude, it is cer∣tain that this was no new Claim of this Burrough, as appears by a Writ of the 5th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Second to the Sheriff of <HI>Hert∣ford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Breve</HI> 5 <HI>Ed.</HI> 2. <HI>in Bend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llo.</HI></NOTE> that the Bailiffs of the Abbot had refused to Levy the Ex∣pences for <HI>Ralph</HI> and <HI>Peter Picot,</HI> who had served as Burgesses for the said Town in the last Parliament; whereupon the said <HI>Ralph</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> set forth before the King, that the said Town used not to be Taxed with other Burroughs of the said County for the Expenses of Knights, <HI>totis temporibus retroactis</HI>; but that it is a Free Burrough, and used to be sum∣moned to Parliaments, which have been summoned by the King and his Proge∣nitors <HI>temporibus retroactis</HI>; and that the Burgesses of the said Town used to re∣ceive their Expences as the Burgesses of other Burroughs of the Kingdom; to which Plea and Petition of the said Burgesses; when the King had appointed a day both to the said Burgesses and Bailiffs of the Abbot, to appear before him in Chancery, they failing at the day appointed, the King therefore Issued out this Writ to the Sheriff of <HI>Hertford</HI> to summon the said Abbot and Bailiffs to ap∣pear again before him, to shew cause why the said <HI>Ralph</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> should not receive their Expences as aforesaid.</P>

<P>But that it was not only the Opinion of the Burroughs of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> and admitted by the King and his Council, but that also that it was the belief of suc∣ceeding Parliaments, that the Commons were part of the great Council of the Kingdom long before the 49th of <HI>Henry III.</HI> for proof of which, I desire you to call to mind that King <HI>Iohn</HI> in the 14th of his Reign made himself and Crown tributary to the Pope.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.R.C.</HI> p. 24. <HI>Vide Mat.

<P>But <HI>Anno</HI> 40 <HI>Edw.

<P>As for this Argument I need trouble my self no further than to give you the Dr's. Answer in his own words;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.A.P.</HI> p. 70.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>All that the Resolution of this Parliament in this case proves, is that King <HI>Iohn</HI> could not subject himself, his Realm or People, without their Assent, but
<PB N="582" REF="313"/>
proves not, who they were that in such Cases at that time gave, or denied their Assent, or how they did it, or whether 153 years before this Resolution, the Commons were represented by Knights, Citizens, and Burges<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es as at this day. The Prelates, and Barons gave their Answer first, that such a Subjection could not be made without their Assent, and then the Commons were asked what their Thoughts were, and they answered in the same manner, and in the same Words, the Barons had done, and when they answer altogether, They do it in the same form of Speech conceived first by the Barons, without any Con∣sideration, whether the Commons were the same Body of Men, at the time of Executing the Charter of King <HI>Iohns</HI> Subjection, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as at that present, or no.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must freely tell you, I am not at all satisfied with this Reply of the Drs. for if there is no heed to be taken of the House of Commons Answer to the Pope, given in so solemn a manner as this was, there is no Credit to be gi∣ven to any thing they could say, if they are once suppos'd to speak like Parrots by Roat, and only as they were taught by the Lords without any Consideration of the Truth or Falshood of what they averred. And tho the first Proposal of this matter was by the King to the Lords, yet the Pope then threatning to Ex∣communicate the King, and put the whole Realm under an Interdict; it was cer∣tainly the Interest as well of the Commons as the Lords to avoid the blow by a wary and true Answer to the Popes demands; for had their Answer been so idle and frivolous, as you would make it, it had been advantage enough for the Pope to have return'd in answer to this Letter, (had what the Dr. alledges been true) that the upstart House of Commons had nothing to do to meddle or treat of any such matter, since they were none of the parties to the agreement, nor one of the Estates, at that time when King <HI>Iohn</HI> resign'd his Crown, and made himself and Kingdom Tributary to his Holinesses Predecessours, nor was the space of an hundred fifty three years from the time of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> to the 40th of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, so far beyond the memory of man, as that so memorable a Transaction could not be well known to the Pope, as well as to the House of Commons then in being, since the making them a 3d Estate, fell out but in the time of all their Grandfathers at farthest, so that it is scarce possible that the memory of so remarkable a Transaction of which the whole World then rang, should be lost in two or three Generations.</P>
<P>But I shall now proceed to shew you, that as it was the express Judgment both of the Lords and Commons, that King <HI>Iohn</HI> could not make the Kingdom Tributary to the Pope without their Consent in Parliament; so was it the Judg∣ment also of the whole House of Commons in the 2d of <HI>Henry</HI> the 5th,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. R. C.</HI> p. 39.</NOTE> and admitted by that Noble Prince and the House of Lords, that they had ever been a member of Parliament, and that no Statute, or Law could be made without their Assent, as appears by a Petition or Protestation presented by the said Commons to the King in Par∣liament, a Copy of which I shall now read to you, as far as it concerns the mat∣ter in Question;

<P>In the first place give me leave to tell you, that I do not find at all by the Kings Answer to this Petition, that the King allowed the matter of Fact there∣in set forth to be true, but rather the contrary, as you may see by the Answer it self in these words, the King of his Grace especial granteth, that fro hens∣forth nothing be enacted to the Pet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ions of his <HI>Comune</HI> that be contrary of their asking, whereby they should be bound without their Assent, saving alway to our Leige, <HI>i. e.</HI> Royal Lord his <HI>Real</HI> Prerogatys to grant, and deny, what him lust of their Petitions, and askings aforesaid.</P>
<P>And I shall farther give you the Drs. Answer to this Argu∣ment, which is to this Effect;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.</HI> p. 86.</NOTE>
<Q>The design of this Petition was not to set forth the Antiquity of their Existence, but their Right, that nothing might be enacted without their Assent contrary to their intent and liking; and to shew that it was never done since the Commons were a third Estate, or (as they say) a Member of Parliament, there∣fore 'tis needless to prove that which no Body denies, that the Assent of the Commons was then and is now required to the making of all Statutes, and Laws, but pray give me leave to ask you (with the Dr) what'were the Com∣mons of <HI>England</HI> as now represented by Knights, and Citizens, and Burgesses, ever an Essential <HI>Constituent</HI> part of the Parliament from Eternity, before man was created? Or have they been so ever since <HI>Adam</HI>? Or ever since <HI>England</HI> was Peopled? Or ever since the <HI>Britains, Romans</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> inhabited this Island? Certainly there was a time when they began to be so represented, and that is the Question between us, concerning which, whether you or my self be in the Right, I durst leave to any impartial Judge.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>But notwithstanding your Drs. Answer, I think under favour the King, and Lords did here allow the Substance of this Petition or Claim, as the main Ground and Foundation on which it was built, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Commons had <HI>ever been Members of Parliament</HI>; and therefore that no Law, or Statute should be made without their Assents (which encroachment upon their Liberties, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seems had been before endeavoured by the King and Lords) and therefore let me tell you, that the Answer of the King in Parliament, is rather a full Concession of the Truth of the Commons claim; otherwise it is not to be imagin'd that the King and Lords would have left such a Claim as of ancient Right without any denial or Protestation against it, but instead of this, the Kings and Lords al∣low the whole to be true; onely the King reserved to himself his Negative Voice
<PB N="584" REF="314"/>
of granting, or denying what he pleased, which the Commons themselves do also allow him in the Conclusion to the Petition it self, as you may see if you please to read it at large. And father, that this Affirmation of the Commons was no other, then a Renovation, or Memorial of the Ancient Law of the Land in that Point is more fully explained, and Confirmed by a Peti∣tion to King <HI>Edward</HI> 2d in Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.

<P>And besides this, I can shew you divers precedents to the same purpose and particularly, a Declaration, or Protestation to <HI>Edward</HI> 3d. by the Commons in Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Parl.</HI> 81.

(Pt. 1. <HI>m.</HI> 52.) where∣in they pray against a pretended Statute made by the King and the Lords, a∣gainst those who in the Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th are called Lollards in which they set forth that the said Statute was never assented to by the Commons; and therefore pray, that it be annulled: and pray observe the Reason, for that it was not their intent, to be justified, nor to oblige themselves, or their Succes∣sors to the Prelates, more than their Ancestors have been in times pass'd.</P>
<P>From all which, we may observe that the Commons do by all these Petitions and Protestations make as strong a claim by Prescription for themselves, and their Ancestors not being bound by the Acts of the Bishops and Lords, as the King could make for himself, and his Ancestors, touching his own Prerogative by Pre∣scription. But as for your Queries on this Petition, since they are not your own, give me leave to tell you, I look upon them as impertinent, for who ever suppos'd that the Commons claim'd a right by Prescription ever since the Creati∣on, or ever since the first Peopleing of this Island, since any Body may see, that this Word <HI>ever</HI> is to be understood according to the Nature of the Subject in hand, <HI>viz.</HI> from the first Institution of the Saxon Government in this Island, now
<PB N="585" REF="314"/>
pray give me leave to put you a Case; suppose you should affirm, that the Crown of <HI>England</HI> hath ever been Successive, and not Elective, wou'd it not be meer Cavilling to ask you, Whither it was so, <HI>pure Divino</HI> ever since <HI>Adam</HI>? but as you will leave it to any impartial judge, who is in the Right, you or I, so shall I likewise leave it to them to consider, which is most likely, that your Self, your Dr. and some of our Modern Antiquaries, should make the House of Commons no ancienter than about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d, or middle of <HI>Edward</HI> the 1st Reign, or the constant Judgment of both Houses of Parliament, with the Assent of the King, and his Learned Council, who have insisted upon the Con∣sent of the Commons, as their ancient and undoubted Right beyond all time of Memory.</P>

<P>I must confess you have proved it plain enough, that it was the constant opinion of more than one Parliament; that the Commons had been before the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d, Members of the great Council of the Nation: But how long before that they do not set forth: but since Parliaments, are no more infal∣lible than general Councils, I hope you will pardon me, if I do not give abso∣lute Credit to their Testimony, since in an illiterate Age, as that was in which the Commons make this Petition; it might happen that not onely they but the King Himself, and his Council at that time might not certainly know, how long, or how little a time the Commons had been summoned to Parliament, therefore since all the Writs of summons to them before the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d are lost; I pray shew me from this general Right of Prescription, you so much talk of, that there must have been any Commons summoned to Parliament before that time; for I have now somewhat very Material out of Mr. <HI>Prins</HI> Parliamentary Register to Object against Mr. <HI>Lambard's</HI> Argument from the Plea of the Te∣nants in ancient demesne being exempted by Prescription, from paying to the wages of Knights of the Shires; (as you told me at our last Meeting but one) but first let me hear the rest of your Arguments from this Prescription of Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses appearing in Parliament, before the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d; for since you have now proved they were there by an undeniable Record in the 11th of <HI>Edward</HI> I. I shall now confine my self to Sir <HI>Henry Spelmans</HI> and Sir <HI>William Dugdales</HI> (as well as the Drs. first) Term of 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall observe your desires, and in performing of which, I shall pursue this Method; I shall first give you a general Definition of Prescription, and shall then prove that the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses have always claimed to ap∣pear in Parliament by vertue of this general Right of Prescription. Now the Terms of the Law tell us,
<Q>That Prescription is, when a man claimeth any thing, for that he and his Ancestors and Predecessors, whose Estate he holds, had, or used any thing in all Times whereof no memory is to the contrary; now pray let us see to what time this is limited, that shall be said to be within Me∣mory, and what was anciently counted beyond time of Memory in a Prescripti∣on, which may be best learnt from a Petition of the Commons to King <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Parl.</HI> 43. E. 3. n. 16.</NOTE> in the 43d of his Reign, which is to be found in the Parliament Rolls of that Year, wherein among o∣ther Petitions of the Commons, this is one, which I shall render and abridge out of <HI>French.</HI></Q>
<Q>Item, because the whole time of
<PB N="586" REF="315"/>
King <HI>Richard</HI> I. is held for <HI>temps de Memorie,</HI> that it would please the King far∣ther to limit this time; so that it do not pass the Coronation of King <HI>Edwards</HI> Grandfather to the King that now is; (but mark the Kings Answer to this Peti∣tion.) Let the Law continue as hath been hitherto used, until it be otherwise Ordain'd;</Q>
so that since there has been no Alteration in this Point from the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, then the Time beyond Memory, or whereof there is no Memory to the contrary, continues still beyond the time of <HI>Richard</HI> the I. for <HI>Littleton</HI> tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Sect.</HI> 170. p. 115.</NOTE> that all the time of <HI>Ri∣chard</HI> I. is time of Memory; and therefore Sir <HI>Edward Cooke</HI> in his Comment upon him, says,
<Q>That this was intended from the first year of his Reign, for (from that time) being indefinitely doth take in all the whole time of his Reign, which is to be observed.</Q></P>
<P>Having fixt the certain time of a general Prescription beyond Memory, I shall now proceed to shew you, that the Claim of the Commons appearing at the Common Council or Parliament of the Kingdom is beyond that time; which since I cannot do directly, (by reason of the loss of the Records of Parliament of those times) any farther then has been already in the Case of the Burgesses of St. <HI>Albans</HI> (which alone is, I think, sufficient to satisfie any reasonable man) we must therefore make use of such Collateral Proofs, and Records, which tho they not directly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Inter Commu∣nia in scacca∣rio penes Re∣memorat.</HI></NOTE> yet by undeniable Consequence will prove the Point in Question, I shall therefore in the first place make use of a Writ in the Exchequer of the 34th <HI>Edward</HI> I. directed to the Barons thereof, reciting, that whereas the Men of <HI>Coventry</HI> set forth in their Petition to the King, that the said To all is not a City, Burrough, nor Demesne of the Kings, so that the Townsmen were not wont to be taxed as Citizens, and Burgesses, or Tenants in ancient demesne, in any Taxes granted to the King, and his Progenitors, but only with the Com∣munity of the said County of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and yet that the Taxers and Collector; of the said County have endeavoured to levy a 30th of their Goods (towards an aid granted by the Communities of the Cities and Burroughs to the King) to their Damage and Impoverishment; and therefore pray remedy: the King there∣fore Orders, that the Rolls be searcht concerning, such Taxations in the said Town; and if it evidently appear by them, that it is as they set forth; and that the said men were always taxed with others without the Towns, Burroughs, and Mannors aforesaid; in all payments of this sort, that then they should not permit the said Taxers, and Collectors to distrain the said Inhabitants to pay the King by reason of the said Concession of a 30th otherwise, <HI>quam in totis tem∣porious retroactis in hujuscemodi casu fieri consueverit,</HI> &amp;c. from which Record we may draw these Conclusions, First, That this Town of <HI>Coventry</HI> did not hold of the King, and yet was a Burrough, and as such sent Members to Parliament, in the 26th, 28th, and 30th of <HI>Edward</HI> I. as appears by the return of Writs of that Year.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Prins Par∣liament Regist.</HI> Part 2d. p. 40.55.</NOTE> Secondly, That yet it prescribed, <HI>Totis temporibus re∣troactis,</HI> in all times pass'd to be taxed with the Body of the County, and not with the Communities of the Cities and Bur∣roughs in all Taxes granted to the King and his Progenitors; which plainly shows, that the Cities and Burroughs granted
<PB N="587" REF="315"/>
Taxes by themselves in the times of his Progenitors, that is, in the time of King <HI>Iohn</HI> at the least. Lastly, That the King orders the Rolls to be searcht, which had been idle direction, had it then been known, or believed, that the Ci∣ties and Burroughs never gave any Taxes for themselves in Parliament before the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, but little above forty years before the date of this Writ.</P>
<P>I shall shew you a like Writ (which is to be sound in the same place) for the Towns-men and Tenants of <HI>Beverly</HI> in the County of <HI>York,</HI> in 8<HI>vo.</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, seting forth in their Petition, that altho' they had been Taxed to to the 20th lately given to the King <HI>per Communitates Comitatuum,</HI> by the Taxers and Collectors of a Subsidy of the 20th in the said County, altho' they and their Ancestors had been accustomed to be Taxed to all Aids, as well to the King, as to his Propenitors, granted <HI>per Communitates Comitatuum ejusdem Regni,</HI> with the Community of the County, and not with the <HI>Communitates Civitatum &amp; Bargorum</HI>; yet that the Taxers and Collectors of the 15th, lately granted by the Commons of the Cities and Burroughs do grievously distrain them to their great damage, and therefore pray Remedy; whereupon the King commands that the Rolls be searcht of such like Taxations, and if it appear that the said Town has always been hitherto Taxed, as they in their Petition set forth, that then they shall be discharged from the said 15th.</P>
<P>From which Record we may conclude that this Town of <HI>Beverly,</HI> tho' an Ancient Burrough, (and as such was summoned to send Bur∣gesses to Parliament in the 26th of this King) yet did not hold o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the King <HI>in Capite,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Prin's Parliam. Reg.</HI> part 2. p. 46.</NOTE> nor in Ancient Demesne. Secondly, That Aids had been given the King and his Progenitors <HI>per Communi∣tates Comitatuum, i. e.</HI> by the Commons of the Counties, which could not be done but by their Lawful Representatives, and that in Parliament; but how far these Progenitors must extend, I need no repeat to you; the ground of which Petition being admitted by the King in Parliament.</P>

<P>These Authorities, tho' material, yet do not in my Opinion reach the point you were to prove; <HI>viz.</HI> That the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses appear∣ed in Parliament, before the Reign of <HI>Richard I.</HI> for both these Authorities, (tho' admitted for good) yet reach no higher than King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s time, which is within memory, as your self have now set forth, since the word Progenitors need not be extended any further than the time of that King, who was great Grand-father to <HI>Edward</HI> the First and Second, to whom these Petitions were made by these Towns-men, and so do not clearly amount to your full time of prescription; <HI>viz.</HI> before the Reign of <HI>Richard I.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, pray remember, that if you grant this, you have lost your Cause, since certainly the Reign of King <HI>Iohn</HI> is long before the 49th of <HI>Henry III.</HI> but since you will be so over-critical, I will shew you some Claims by prescription beyond all time of memory, made by the Tenants in Ancient Demesne, from being Taxed to contribute to the wages of Knights of Shires; and if they thus prescri∣bed, it is plain there must have been Knights of Shires chosen, against paying whose wages they prescribed to have had this priviledge: Now this prescription must be very Ancient, since, as Mr. <HI>Lambard</HI> shews us in the place I have quoted, there
<PB N="588" REF="316"/>
has been no new Tenants made in Ancient Demesne, since the time of <HI>William I.</HI> But pray see the Writ it self in the Old Register of Writs, which is there put down only as a Form for drawing of all other Writs of this kind there to be found for other Towns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fol. 261.</NOTE> (and particu∣larly the Tenants of <HI>Odiham</HI> in <HI>Hampshire</HI>) whenever there was occasion; and therefore it is not to be wonder'd that neither the Name of the King, nor of the place be expressed in words at length. The Writ it self is not very long, there∣fore I shall give it you in Latine as far as is material: <HI>Rex Vicecomiti L. salutem monstraverunt nobis homines, &amp; Tenente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de Manerio de F. quod est de Antiquo Dominico Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one.

L.

<P>But there is yet a perfecter Writ of this kind in the 50th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third extant on the Rolls directed to <HI>Iohn de Cob∣ham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Claus.</HI> 50. <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 2. <HI>m.</HI> 19 <HI>dorso.</HI></NOTE> and four other Knights therein named, reciting that whereas <HI>Simon</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> claims as well for himself as his predecessors, and their Tenants hitherto, <HI>à tempore quo non extat memoria,</HI> for certain Lauds held in <HI>Gavel-kind</HI> in the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> which ought to be free from the Expences of Knights coming to our Parliaments, as well as those of our Proge∣nitors; and concludes with a <HI>Supersedeas</HI> to the said Sheriff not to molest the said Tenants until such time as the King be further informed and that He by the Advice of his Council has ordained what is to be done in the premisses; from both which Writs we may draw these Conclusions; First, That there was at the time of the granting these Writs a Claim by prescription time out of mind allowed for all Tenants, holding of the Arch-Bishop in <HI>Gavelkind</HI> to be exempted from contributing to the wages of Knights of the Shire, or else these Petitions, and the Writs upon them had been idle and ridiculous.</P>
<P>Lastly, That this Claim of being thus exempted time out of mind (which as I have already proved, extend, beyond the time of <HI>Richard</HI> the First) is allowed by the King himself for good in both these Writs, only in the last the King will
<PB N="589" REF="316"/>
be informed whether they are Tenants in <HI>Gavel kind</HI> or not; so that the Conclu∣sion must be, that if these Tenants in Ancient Demesne, and <HI>Gavel-kind</HI> were always exempted from paying to the wages of Knights of the Shires beyond me∣mory, <HI>i. e.</HI> by prescription, then certainly those Knights must have been chosen time beyond memory. I could give you several other Writs of like nature, but I will not over charge you. Now certainly if the Knights of Shires were thus Elected time beyond memory, the Citizens and Burgesses must have been so too, since in <HI>Scotland</HI> where there were for a long time no Commissioners for the Shires, yet the Cities and Burroughs ever sent Delegates to Parliament, as your Dr. himself allows.</P>

<P>I must beg your pardon if I cannot come over to your Opinion, concern∣ing this prescription of Knights of Shires, Citizens and Burgesses appearing in Parliament before the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third; since Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> in his second and third part of his Parliamentary Register has proved;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> Observa∣tions on Writs of Summons, part 2. p. 173. &amp; part 3. § 8. <HI>per totum.</HI></NOTE> 1. That all the words you insist upon to prove this prescription, are to be understood in another sense than what you would now put upon them; so that tho' Mr. <HI>Lambard</HI> and others of great note lay the Original Title and Right of all our Countreys, Ancient Cities and Burroughs Electing and sending of Burgesses to Parliament, and to be by prescription time out of mind long be∣fore the Conquest; yet against this Opinion Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> argues thus (whose Argu∣ments I shall contract because it would be tedious to recite them all <HI>verbatim.</HI>) First, That as for the wages of Knights of Shires (which is the principal thing you insist on in this last Argument) the An∣cientest Writs extant for their wages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part 2. p. 175.</NOTE> are those of 28th and 29th of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, and no Records or Law-books I have seen derive their Title higher than the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the First:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 12.</NOTE> The first Statute concern∣ing them is that of the 12th of <HI>Richard II.</HI> which only enacts that the Levying Expences of Knights shall be as hath been used of old time.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 1.</NOTE> The next Statute is of 11 of <HI>H.</HI> 4th, and enacts that Knights of Shires unduly returned, shall lose their wages of the Parliament of old time accustomed, not at, or before the Con∣quest accustomed: Yea no man can prove there were any Knights for Coun∣ties Elected, and sent to Parliaments by the King's Writs before the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, not to the Reign of the Conquerour, or before the Conquest, as Mr. <HI>Lambard</HI> would strain it. Now as for the words <HI>Antacessores &amp; Progenitores</HI> in the Writs you have cited, the former may very well signifie the Ancestors of those Inhabitants of Burroughs or Towns, and the latter the Predecessors of the King that then was, which in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, and <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, when those Writs were granted, need extend no higher than the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third; and as for the other words in these Writs, as <HI>totu tim∣poribus retroaclis</HI>; and <HI>a tempore quo non ixtai memoria,</HI> they must have the like in∣terpretation, or what is equivalent to it; <HI>viz.</HI> in all times passed, or time out of mind, <HI>i. e.</HI> before there were any Knights Elected for the Countreys, they were always free from contributing to their wages, so that this prescriptions need not extend higher than the 49th of <HI>Henry III.</HI> above mentioned; since which
<PB N="590" REF="317"/>
time it is true (as they there set forth) that they and their Ancestors in all times, or time beyond memory, have always used to be quit from such Ex∣pences of Knights: Now there were many Prescriptions and Customs in use in <HI>Edward</HI> the Third's time, and since, which may be well said to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out of mind, yet certainly had their Original not before, but long since the Conquest, as you may read in <HI>Brooks, Fitzherbert,</HI> and other Law-books, Title, Custom, and Prescription, and <HI>Cook's</HI> first Instit. <HI>My Lord Ho∣bard</HI> in his Reports;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fol. 58.113.</NOTE> <HI>That which hath been used, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but two, or three Ages only, or out of the memory or mind of men then being, is reputed a Legal Custom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 117, 118, 198, 199.</NOTE> <HI>or Prescription</HI> 34 Henry VI. Brook<HI>'s Tit. Prescription,</HI> therefore this Prescription of Tenant's in ancient De∣mesne to be exempted from contributing to Knights wages, will no ways warrant Mr. <HI>Lambard</HI>'s Conclusion from it; <HI>Ergo,</HI> There were Elections of Knights of Shires before the Conquest. I am certain that at this day Tenants in Ancient Demesne can plead that both they, and their Ancestors, time out of mind, never were accustomed to pay Excise for any thing for which Excise is now paid; will it therefore follow, <HI>ergo,</HI> all other places, now subject to pay Excise, were liable to it before the Conquest, when it is a duty imposed but since the late Wars. So that Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> here proves, that your, and Mr. <HI>Lambard</HI>'s Argu∣ment from the Tenants in Ancient Demesne, and <HI>Gavel-kind,</HI> not paying in all times passed, or time beyond memory to the wages of Knights of the Shires, is altogether fallacious, and inconclusive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray Sir give me leave to reply to your Answer before you proceed to speak of Borroughs. First, let me tell you, Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> very much forgot himself when he here says, that the first Writs for wages of Knights of Shires are but of the 28th,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R.A.P.</HI> 141.</NOTE> or 29th of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, since you know better; for your Dr. has printed the Writ of Expences for the Knights of Shires that served in this Parliament of the 49th of <HI>Henry III.</HI> and you your self have urged it to me, that this was the first time, that these Knights had their Expences allowed them, because there was no Clause of, <HI>prout in Casu simili,</HI> expressed therein; which I told you might be only through inad∣vertency of the Clerks, since the Dr. there gives us another Writ of the 42d of that King, whereby it appears that the four Knights of Counties who had ap∣peared before the King and his Council at the foregoing Parliament, were or∣dered their Expences, for going, returning, and staying at the said Parliament, which shews that these Writs were no new things, and if so be these Knights had their Expences allowed them only for their Attendance at a Parliament, it is much more reasonable and likely they had their Expences allowed, when they made a part of it.</P>
<P>But to put this out of all doubt, Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> himself has cleared this point not on∣ly by printing this very Writ in the 4th part of his Parliamentary Register, but by declaring in the very first Section of that Volume, that tho' after this Writ no more are to be found of this sort extant upon the Rolls of <HI>Henry III.</HI> till the 28th of <HI>Edward I.</HI> yet they were constantly Issued but at the end of every Parliament held after the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, till the 28th of <HI>Edward</HI> the First (being 35 years space) as this Clause in the Writs of 28, 29, and 33th of <HI>Edward I. prout
<PB N="591" REF="317"/>
alias in Casu consimili fieri consuevit</HI> assures us; but all the bundles of Writs from the 49th of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nry</HI> the Third till the 29th of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, being lost, and no Writs of Summons from 49 <HI>H.</HI> 3 entred in the Clause Rolls till 22 <HI>E.</HI> 1. tho' returnable into Chancery, no wonder that these Writs <HI>de Expensis</HI> (not return∣able at all) were not enrolled till 28 <HI>E.</HI> 1. after which they were usually endor∣sed on the Clause Rolls till the Second of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth. So that by Mr. <HI>Prin</HI>'s own confession, the loss of the Writs from the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> 3. till 28 <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. is no Argument at all to prove that there were no such Writs before the 49th of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. unless you could prove to me that the Writs and Records of all those Parliaments had been so well preserved, that there are none lost or imbezell'd, which Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> acknowledges to the contrary; for if they were lost after the 49th of <HI>H.</HI> 3. pray give me a reason why the like Writs of Summons and Expences, might not be lost as well before that time.</P>
<P>Having, I think, sufficiently answered Mr. <HI>Prin</HI>'s Argument from the not find∣ing any Writs of Expences before the 28th of <HI>Edward</HI> 1. from what he himself sold afterwards upon better consideration; I shall now proceed to reply to that other part of his Argument from the equivocal use of the words, <HI>old times accu∣stomed,</HI> and in <HI>a tempore quo non extat memoria</HI>; which he will have to signifie a space of time only beyond the memory of any man living, whereas the words custom and accustomed, when used of any general custom or usage all over the Realm is still to be taken in much larger acceptation, as all our Law-books will teach you: But I shall not dwell upon this, but shew you that those Authors whose works you have read, had no true notion of this expression in our Ancient Records and Pleadings; <HI>viz. a tempore cujus contraii memoria non existit</HI>; which has been always understood (as <HI>Littleton</HI> here tells you) for a time beyond the Reign of King <HI>Richard I.</HI> So that where-ever you find these words, <HI>totis temporibus re∣troactis,</HI> or <HI>de Temps dont momorie des Homes ne curg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> al <UNCLEAR>contrarie</UNCLEAR>,</HI> in any Records, they are always to be understood of a time older than that now mentioned; you may prove a contrary usage if you can; but before that time no Deed can be given in Evidence, nor Custom alledged beyond it: And that this is not the sense of <HI>Littleton</HI> alone (who indeed makes a query about this time beyond memory) I appeal to all our Year-books, and if you please to see all the considerable Law-Learning at once about this Point, pray consult <HI>Roll</HI>'s Abridgment (or Com-mon-place-book) Title,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 269.</NOTE> <HI>Prescription,</HI> where he gives you these Conclusion, from the Year-books which I shall here read to you in English.</P>

<P><PB N="592" REF="318"/>
<Q>So it seems by these words <HI>a tempore cujus contrarii memoria non existit,</HI> is properly and generally intended for all the time before that; and before the Statute of Limitation, was meant of that against, which no proof could be made to the con∣trary either by Testimony, or Evidence in any time before, without any limitation of time, the 34 <HI>H.</HI> 6.36. <HI>B.</HI> 37, seems to prove this:</Q>
So that the time of all Pre∣scription was in those days the same with the time of Limitation of Seisin in a Writ of Writ, as <HI>Littleton</HI> tells us. And since you have not as yet brought any considerable proofs (but only bare negative ones which have been answered,) against this Prescription of the Election of Knights of Shires time beyond me∣mory; what you have said to the contrary is little to the purpose; for all the Modern as well as Ancient Law-books are against this notion of Mr. <HI>Prin</HI>'s; for in Judge <HI>Telverton</HI>'s Reports,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 31, 32.</NOTE> <HI>Gibson</HI> and <HI>Holcrose</HI>'s Case you will see, that whereas unity of Possession is by the Sta∣tute of the Dissolution of Monasteries a good discharge of Tithes; yet if the Mo∣nastery were founded <HI>deins Temps de Memoire</HI> (as this Abby of <HI>Vale Royal</HI> was in the time of <HI>Ed▪ I.</HI>) a constant Unity, since the Foundation was held by the whole Court for no good discharge of Tithes by Prescription as the Plaintiff had laid it; for the Defendant shewing that the said Abby was founded since time of memory (tho' above three hundred years old) was a sufficient confessing and avoiding.</P>
<P>So that Mr. <HI>Prin</HI>'s Arguments whereby he would have the words, all times passed, and Time of which no memory is to the contrary to signifie a much less space of time in these Writs I have now cited; and to be restrained within the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, will not signifie much: since they are expresly against all our Law-books, neither doth he cite any Cases for his Opinion out of <HI>Brook</HI> or <HI>Fitzherbert,</HI> tho' he quotes their Titles; but as for this Quo∣tation from <HI>Cook</HI>'s first Institutes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 113.</NOTE> there is nothing there to countenance his notion, more than he tells us that from <HI>Bracton,</HI> and <HI><UNCLEAR>Fleta</UNCLEAR>,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P 113.</NOTE> (upon the words <HI>de Temps dout memorie, &amp;c.</HI>) <HI>docere opertet longum tempus &amp; longum usum; viz. qui excedit memoriam hominum, tale, enim, tempus sufficit pro Iure</HI>; but without telling us what was then un∣derstood
<Q>by this <HI>memoria hominum,</HI> and a little after upon these words, <HI>Ascun proof al contrarie</HI>; for it there be any sufficient proof of Record, or Writing to the contrary, albeit it exceed the memory, or proper knowledge of any man living, yet it is within the memory of men: For memory is twofold; First, By knowledge by proof, as by Record or sufficient matter of writing. Secondly, By his own proper knowledge, and for this he cites divers. Year-books in the Mar∣gin:</Q>
But as for all that, long Quotation Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> has here given us, I know not whence he had it; for there is not any thing in <HI>Hobart</HI>'s Reports to that pur∣pose in the places he has cited: And as for the Year-book of 34 <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, and <HI>Brook,</HI> they are both directly against his notion, as you may see by what <HI>Rolls</HI> has been already quoted from the same places: And tho' it is true in Prescriptions of ways, &amp; Commons, and other such petty thing, laid time beyond memory, the Judges, or Jury are not so exact as to make the Plaintiffs prove their Prescription beyond the time of any man then living; yet if they prescribe for never so long, it is still in the power of the Defendant to prove that there was no such Prescription, and this as high as before <HI>Richard</HI> the First, but no higher;
<PB N="593" REF="318"/>
and thus high we assert the coming of Knights of Shires to Parliament: for I do not pretend to lay it as high, as the Conquest or before, as Mr. <HI>Lambard</HI> does; if it prove beyond the time now specified, it is sufficient to disprove Mr. <HI>Prins</HI> Notion.</P>
<P>But to let you see, I am a fair Adversary, I will admit for once that this time beyond Memory, shall be taken in a sticker, litteral Sense, for only as far as is beyond the Memory of any man living. Now pray see what you will get by it, if you remember that the Writ I but now cited from the Register for the Te∣nants in ancient demesne their being discharged from Contributing to the wages of Knights of the Shires, was laid, <HI>a tempore cujus contraii memoria non existit,</HI> and these Writs are proved also to have been issued within the 15th of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2d. and if so, pray reckon onwards, and see if the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d. (when you suppose Knights of Shires to have been first chosen) does not fall within the memory of most men then living, for <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d reigned somewhat more than seven years, after this 49th, to which seven years, if you add the al∣most 35 years Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I. It makes 42 years, then add these 15 years of <HI>Edward</HI> the II. and (if you please) see if whole makes above 57 years; which certainly was within the Memory of many Men then living, and it had been a sensless thing for the Chancellor and Clerks of Chancery that then were, to have granted these Writs of Exemption for a time beyond Memory, when they themselves might have remembred when wages for Knights of Shires first began.</P>

<P>As for what you have said for this Prescription of Knights of Shires, I will not dispute it farther with you, since it is a Point of your Common Law, (in which I confess my self but meanly skilled) but I shall take farther time to advise with those that know better; in the mean time, as for the Cities and Burroughs let them have appeared when you will, their coming to Parliament, could not be so ancient as before the time of <HI>Richard</HI> I. much less the Conquest, as you suppose; since Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> hath in the same second part of this Parliamen∣tary Register traced the summoning of the Burroughs to their very Original; and proved it could not be ancienter then the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d. I shall here contract his Arguments, and give you them, as I did the former. First,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Part</HI> 2. p. 214.</NOTE> He here proves that there were never but 170 Cities and Burroughs, who sent any Members to Parliament; of which 170 (in his Catalogue) nine of them never had but one or two Precepts, and others but four Precepts of this Nature sent them, upon none of which Precepts the Sheriffs made, any returns of Burgesses, as these <HI>Ballivi Li∣birlatis nullum mihi dederunt responsum,</HI> or <HI>nihil inde secerunt,</HI> attest; whereupon they never had any more Precepts of this kind sent them to this Day, Christ-Church in <HI>Hampshire</HI> onely excepted, which of late years hath sent Burgesses to Parlia∣ment, so that in Truth there were only 161 Cities and Burroughs in <HI>England,</HI> that ever sent Members to Parliament, during all the precedent King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Reign, <HI>viz.</HI> From the 26th of <HI>Edward</HI> I. to the 12th of <HI>Edw.</HI> the 4th. Secondly, That 22 more here named of these 161, never elected and returned Burgesses but once, and no
<PB N="594" REF="319"/>
more during all the said time. Thirdly, That many more of these ancient Burroughs here named never sent Members,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 225.226.</NOTE> some of them more then twice, others thrice, others four, others five, others six, others seven, others eight times and <HI>Lancaster</HI> has but 13 Electi∣ons and Returns of Burgesses, and no more during all the above mentioned Reigns. Fourthly, That altho some of these Burroughs here named, who sel∣dom sent any Burgesses, tho they were summoned by the Sheriffs Precepts to E∣lect Burgesses without any great intervals of time to six or seven Succeeding Par∣liaments, yet most of them had along discontinuance of time, some of above 200, others above 300 years distance between those few respective Re∣turns, of which he here gives you several Instances, and referrs you to his pre∣cedent Catalogue of Returns for the proof of it. So that there were but 112 Cities and Burroughs (taking in the Cinque Ports, and all) who sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Members to Parliament in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I. seven of which made onely one return, and no more, for ought I can discover before or after <HI>Edward</HI> 1st Reign, till of very late Years.</P>
<P>Yet that in <HI>Edward</HI> the 2ds Reign, there were Precepts issu∣ed by the Sheriffs and returns of Burgesses for 19 new Burroughs here named,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 227.228.</NOTE> which (for ought I can discover) never elected any Burgesses before. Fifthly, That under this long Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d. there were Sheriffs Precepts issued to 19 new Borroughs re∣turns made upon them to serve in Parliaments or great Councils who never sent any Members before; and Precepts to more, that made no returns at all thereup∣on; as for the Cinque Ports of <HI>Dover, Romney, Sandwich, Winchelsey, Hastings, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the</HI> and <HI>Rye</HI>; though there be no Original Writs for, or returns of their electing and sending Barons to Parliament now extant, before the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, yet it is apparent by the Clause Rolls, that they sent Barons to Parliament in 49th of <HI>Henry,</HI> and during the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> 1st and 2d. of which more anon. Sixthly, That King <HI>Richard</HI> the 2d, <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th, and <HI>Henry</HI> the 5th, created no new Burroughs at all, neither were there any Writs or Precepts issued to, or Election of Citizens, or Burgesses by any new Cities or Borroughs, but such as elected them before their Reigns. Seventhly, That about the midst of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th long Reign there were Precepts issued to, and returns made by five new Burroughs and no more, which never sent Burgesses to Parliaments be∣fore, <HI>viz. Gatton,</HI> in <HI>Surrey, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ytesbury, Hyndford, Westbury,</HI> and <HI>Wootton Basset</HI> all in <HI>Wiitshire,</HI> yet very poor inconsiderable Burroughs, tho they elect Burgesses at this day. That during <HI>Edward</HI> the 4th Reign, there was one new Burrough, (here named) which began to send Burgesses to Parliament under him, though it never sent any before.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but how came this about, that so many new Burroughs were made in some Kings Reigns, and few or none in others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and so many omitted, that had served before in other Parliaments.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray read on and you will see, this Author gives us a very good account of that; and impures it to two Causes. First, The Partiality, and Favour of the Sheriffs, and the Ambition of the Neighbouring Gentry, who desired to be elected in such new Burroughs. Secondly, The meer Grace, and Favour of the King,
<PB N="595" REF="319"/>
who by divers Charters to new Corporations have given them the Priviledge of sending Burgesses to Parliaments. For Proof of which, pray see what this Author here farther says. It is evident by the precedent Secti∣ons, and Catalogue of ancient Cities,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 228.229, 234.</NOTE> Burroughs, Ports, and their returns of Writs and Election, before specified with these general Clauses after them, <HI>Non sunt aliae,</HI> or <HI>ullae Civitates nec Bur∣gi in Balliva mea,</HI> or <HI>in Comitatu praedicto, praeter,</HI> &amp;c. as you may see by the re∣turn of the Sheriff of <HI>Bucks, Anno</HI> 26 of <HI>Edward</HI> I where he denies there were any Cities or Burroughs, in his whole County, and yet the very next Parliament but one, within two years after, the Sheriff of <HI>Bucks</HI> returns no less then three Burroughs, <HI>viz. Agmundesham, Wycombe</HI> and <HI>Wendover,</HI> with the Burgesses Names that were returned, so that the 78 new Burroughs here named were lately set up in the Counties, since <HI>Edward</HI> the 4ths Reign by the Practice of Sheriffs, and the Ambition of Private Gentlemen seeking to be made Burgesses for them, and Consent of the poor Burgesses of them, being courted and fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted by them for their Votes without any Charters from the King; and are all me in poor inconsiderable Burroughs set up by the late Returns and Practices of Sheriffs.</P>
<P>And tho others may conceive, that the Power of our anci∣ent Burroughs or Cities Electing,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 230.</NOTE> and sending Burgesses, and Citizens to our Parliaments proceeded originally from some old Charters of our Kings heretofore granted to them, and to which Opinion I once inclined; yet the Consideration of the new discovery of the old Original of Writs for Electing Knights, Citizens and Burgesses I found in <HI>Caesars</HI> Chappel, hath rectified my former mistake herein and abundantly satisfied me that neither bare ancient Custom, or Prescription before or since the Conquest, not our Kings Charters but the Sheriffs of each Counties Precepts and Returns of Elections of Burgesses and Citizens for such Burroughs and Cities, as they thought meet by Authority and Power, granted to them in, and by this general Clause in the Writs of Summons issued to Sheriffs, for every County before every Par∣liament enjoyning them in these Words, <HI>Tibi praecipimus firmiter injungentes, quod de Comitatu praedicto duos milites, &amp; de qualibet Cititate duos cives, &amp; de quolibet Burgo duos Burgesses at discretioribus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. <HI>p.</HI> 231.232.</NOTE> &amp;c. <HI>sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dila∣tione Eligi▪ &amp; eos ad nos ad dictos diem, &amp; locum venite facias,</HI> &amp;c. By vertue of which general indefinite Clauses used in all Writs of Summons ever since 23d of <HI>Edward</HI> I. without designing what particular Cities, or Burroughs by Name within each County, the Sheriff should cause to Elect▪ or send two Citizens or two Burgesses, but leaving it wholy to each She∣riffs Liberty and Discretion to send the Writ directed to him to what Cities and Burroughs he pleased; thereupon every Sheriff used a kind of Arbitrary Power in the Execution of this general Clause, according as his Judgment directed or his Assertions, Favour, Partiality, Malice, or the Sollicitations of any private Burroughs to him, or of Competitors for Citizens or Burgesses places within his County swayed him; this is most apparent by some Sheriffs in several Counties returning more Burroughs, and Burgesses then their Predecessors, others fewer, some omitting those Burroughs returned by their Predecessors, others causing Elections, and Returns to be made for such new Burroughs, which never ele∣cted
<PB N="596" REF="320"/>
or sent any before, nor after their Sherivalties, as is evident from the Re∣turns, <HI>Annis</HI> 28.33. <HI>E.</HI> 1. and 34. of <HI>E.</HI> 3. for <HI>Div<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.

Annis</HI> 33. and 34. of <HI>E.</HI> 3. for <HI>Sommerset. Annis</HI> 25.27. and 28. <HI>H.</HI> 6 for <HI>Wilts,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>So that the first Writs or Memorials of any extant on Record for electing Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses to come to Parliament are those of 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> 3d, but these Writs onely commanded that the Sheriffs cause to come two Knights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of each County; and the like Writs were directed to the Cities of <HI>London Lincoln,</HI> and other Burroughs of <HI>England</HI> to elect two Citizens and two Burgesses for each of them, and the rest of the Cities and Burroughs in <HI>England</HI>; the like Writs were also issued to <HI>Sandwich</HI> and the rest of the Cinque Ports; without expressing their Names, or Number in each County; and this form I conceive (says Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI>) continued till 23d of <HI>Edward</HI> I. when the aforecited general Clause authorizing, and intrusting every Sheriff to cause two Citizens, and two Burgesses to be ele∣cted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> out of every City and Burrough in his County; was first put into the Writs, by Authority and Colour whereof every Sheriff sent Precepts to what Cities and Burroughs of his County he pleased.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have with Patience heard this long History of Mr. <HI>Prins</HI> concerning the Election of Citizens and Burgesses, from which I must notwithstanding make bold to differ, for tho I own him to have been a man of great Learning and In∣dustry in matter of Records, yet I doubt he was often too quick in taking up of Opinions upon slender grounds; therefore for the answering of him, I shall first shew you the improbability of his Suppositions, and in the next place shall make use of no other Confutations then what his own Book will afford us, as to the Writs of Summons, Returns and other things he lays so much stress upon; in the first place, for the Notion of Sheriffs sending Precepts to what Cities and Burroughs they pleased; and consequently making as few or as many send Mem∣bers to Parliament as they would, that this was not so at first; is evident from those very Writs of 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d, by which it appears that they were not then directed to the Sheriffs, for any more then to the Counties; but as for the Citizens and Burgesses, and Barons of the Cinque Ports, they were then directed to themselves; and he also confesses, that this continued so from that time till the 23d of <HI>Edward</HI> I. so that all this while (being about 28 Years) it seems the Nomination of what Cities and Towns should send Members to Parlia∣ment did not depend upon the Will of the Sheriffs, but upon somewhat else; and I have asked you once (tho without receiving any answer) what Rule <HI>Si∣mon Montfort</HI> went by to tell what Cities and Burroughs, were to send Members and what not; since the Words are onely in general, <HI>de quolibet Burgo,</HI> &amp;c. and therefore pray answer me now if you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I conceive in the first place, as for the Cities, <HI>Simon Montfort</HI> sent to those that were anciently esteem'd so, <HI>viz.</HI> such as had Bishops Sees annext to them, such as <HI>London, Lincoln,</HI> and particularly named in these Writs and others of the same rank, and as for the Burroughs, tho we have not the returns of them left us; yet I suppose they were such Walled, or other Towns; as were of some considerable Note in <HI>England</HI>; such as he thought were most proper for his turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="597" REF="320"/>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>That this could be no Rule, appears by this clear Proof, First▪ That neither <HI>Coventry</HI> and <HI>Litchfield,</HI> tho the Sees of the Bishops, were not counted Cities in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the first nor long after; nor yet <HI>Ely,</HI> for it appears by the Lists, that Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> hath given us, that it never sent Burgesses, but only once and that to a great Council till of late years. So that the Sees of the Bi∣shops was it seems no general rule to make Places capable of sending, or not send∣ing of Citizens to Parliament.</P>
<P>And in the next place as to Burroughs, that is pure Imagination, that none but considerable or walled Towns sent any Burgesses at first; whereas in the first List of returns, which Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> has here given us of the 26th and 28th, of <HI>Edward</HI> I. which are the first extant (for ought I know, except those of 23d, which I have never yet seen) besides the Shire Towns of the Counties, there are returns of a great many small Burroughs, which never had any Walls, nor yet (for ought as we can find) had any thing remarkable to make them be pircht upon to send Burgesses more than others; but of these I shall speak more by and by, onely shall remark this much, that there must have have been some other Rule besides <HI>Montforts</HI> own Will, for all this; and what this rule could be, unless an ancient Prescription in those Towns to send Mem∣bers, I desire you or your Dr. would shew any good Reason, or Authority to the contrary.</P>
<P>And after the 23d of <HI>Edward</HI> the I. when Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> supposes that the Sheriffs by this general Clause in the Writs began to take upon them, this new Authority of sending Precepts to, and making Burroughs of what Towns they pleased; this could not in the first place extend to such as were before that Counties of them∣selves, such as <HI>London, York, Bristol,</HI> &amp;c. nor yet such as were Ancient and opulent Cities, such as <HI>Canterbury, Lincoln, Exeter,</HI> &amp;c. who were not made Cities by having Bishops Sees annoxt to them, but were such long before Christianity was preacht to the English <HI>Saxons,</HI> as I have already proved▪ nor could this Power of the Sheriff extend to the Cinque Ports, whose Rights of sending two Barons for each Port was sure very well known and setled in the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d, as ap∣pears by these general Words at the foot of the Writ, <HI>similiter mandatum est sin∣gulis Portubus pro se,</HI> without naming them in particular; so that if it had not been sufficiently known what Ports were thus to send, all the Sea Port Towns in <HI>England</HI> might have had Precepts sent them, as well as the Cinque Ports; who had at first their Summons directed to the Barons and Baylifts in general; nor is there any Writ found directed to the Warden of the Cinque Ports to Summon each of them to send Burgesses,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 246.</NOTE> till the 17th of <HI>Edward</HI> ad, as Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> here shews you, so that in all these Elections and Returns (being above 20) the Sheriff could have no Power; and therefore did not depend upon his good Will and Pleasure alone, as this Author would have it.</P>
<P>But to come to that, which Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> chiefly insists on, <HI>viz.</HI> the putting in and leaving out divers of the smaller Burroughs in so many Kings Reigns, and which he attributes wholy to the favour or partiality of the Sheriffs. I shall first argue against the improbability of the Notion, and then shall Confute it by plain proofs from Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> himself. First, It is not at all likely, that the
<PB N="598" REF="321"/>
King should ever trust the Sheriff with this great Prerogative of making what, or as many Burroughs as he pleased in a County: Since that could not be then done without some particular Writ or Charter, for otherwise this had made the Power of the Sheriffs more Arbitrary than that of the King himself, it he had in those Reigns, you treat or, no other Rule to go by than his own humour, passion, or interest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nor would the King have ever endured such an Innovation, since it would have been in the power of the Sheriff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to have made as many Burroughs as they pleased, and to have encreased the House of Commons to an unreasonable bulk, wineh was against all Rules of Policy for him to suffer. Lastly, Neither would the House of Commons themselves have suffered this Encroachment; for since most of the Cities and Burroughs of <HI>England</HI> sent Members in Parliament before this Innovation of the Sheriffs began, they would never have quiet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> per∣mitted new Men to be sent in among them from obscure places they never heard of, without either turning them out themselves, or complaining to the King in Parliament of so great an Abuse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what can you say against direct matter of fact? has not Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> here plainly proved to you, that the Sheriffs did in those times exercise an Arbitrary Power in this matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Parliam. Reg.</HI> Sect. 8.</NOTE> returning some Towns out of ill will only, to charge them with Electing Burgesses, to make them liable to the payment of wages to them, omitting others also out of spight, as appears by this Petition of the Towns-men of St. <HI>Al∣bans</HI> you have now cited; a great many of which were so long omitted, that they came at last to lose all right of sending any more,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> 238.</NOTE> till it came to be again revived of late years (as in the Case of divers Burroughs whose names Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> has here given us) who by Orders of the Long Parliament in 1640. again sent Members to Parliament after some Ages intermission. Pray now tell me what other satisfactory account can be given for the making of so many new Burroughs, and omitting so many old ones, but the Arbitrary power of the Sheriffs, who then took upon them to do what they pleased in this matter, as appears by so many Instances he has here given us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, since the improbability, (I may say impossibility of the thing) will not satisfie you, I doubt not but to shew you that tho' the Sheriffs might some∣times abuse the trust committed to them in sending Precepts to the Burroughs that were not liable to them, yet that for all this they never exercised that Arbi∣trary Power you fancy of making and unmaking. what Burroughs (and conse∣quently as many Parliament-men) as they pleased. Now to prove this from Mr. <HI>Prin</HI>'s own Instances and Authorities, I shall reduce all the Causes of this Abuse to these Heads: 1. The Favour, or Malice of the Sheriffs. 2. The Am∣bition of the Neighbouring Gentlemen who desired to get to be Elected at such Burroughs. Or lastly, from the desire of those Towns themselves to get this priviledge among them of Electing and Returning Members to Parliament. To begin with the first of these, it could never proceed from the Favour of Sheriffs to such Towns, because the charge of wages to the Burgesses was then so great (when two shillings a day was more than ten shillings is now) that they could never look upon it as a favour to have this charge imposed upon them, unless it were some few who were very large, and in a rich and flourishing condition, and
<PB N="599" REF="321"/>
those always sent Burgesses to Parliament before the Sheriffs had this power com∣mitted to them, as you supposed by that general Clause in the Writ of sending Summons to the Cities, and Burroughs; nor could the Sheriffs (if they would) have long continued to lay this burthen upon any Town out of Malice; for if such Towns could not afford this extraordinary Charge of sending Burgesses to Parlia∣ment, they might have 'scaped it whenever they would, either by making no Returns at all to their Precepts sent them, as Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> here shews in the Lists he has given us of Returns, very many of them did; or else they might have taken that Remedy against it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 233.</NOTE> which (as this here Author
<Q>expresly acknowledges) divers Towns did, who being maliciously charged by the Sheriffs to send Burgesses, when both unwilling, and unable; and who upon their refusal to Elect, returned Burgesses for them against their wills, whereupon they complained to the King or Parliament of the Abuse, and so were eased of this Charge and Trouble, or else eased themselves; other Burroughs growing very poor, and unable to send Burgesses to Parliament, and defray their Expences, were thereupon discharged by the Sheriffs who made special Returns in their Favour (and of these he gives you several Instances in his Collection of Returns for the County of <HI>Bucks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 233, 236.</NOTE> or else for Poverty, as in the Case of <HI>Lancaster</HI>) others procured perpetual, or else temporary Exemptions from the King, or the King and his Council from sending Burgesses to future Parliaments; and upon some one, or more of these Precedent grounds they quitted, waved, or lost their Ancient Priviledge of sending Burgesses, which they rather reputed a charge, burthen, and oppression, than an honour; and of this he gives as a remarkable Instance in <HI>Toriton</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 239.</NOTE> which after having Elected and Returned Burgesses to no less than thirty two Parliaments,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 241.</P></NOTE> yet in the 42d of <HI>Edward</HI> 3. upon their Petition to the King in Parliament obtained a Patent to be exempted for ever, which he here gives us, as also a temporary Exemption from King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second to the Town of <HI>Colchester</HI> for five years in regard of their great Charge in building their Town∣walls; which shews that the Burgesses wages was then a great burthen upon Towns tho' rich and flourishing in Trade, as appears by <HI>Colchester,</HI> which was then able to Wall their Town at their own Expence: And I could shew you more such Exemptions as these, were it not too tedious; and I doubt not but there were many more such than what are entred upon the Rolls.</Q></P>
<P>Now that we may apply what Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> has here said to our present purpose, it is plain, that tho' the Sheriffs might sometimes oppress some Towns by sending Precepts to them to Elect, which ought not have sent Members to Parliament at all; yet that he could not make new Burroughs without the Inhabitants consent is plain by his own shewing, since they could be eased of that Charge when∣ever they pleased: And I desire you, or any one selfe, to shew me any City, or considerable Town in <HI>England,</HI> that thus began first to send Citizens, or Bur∣gesses to Parliament by the Sheriffs Arbitrary Power; not but that some Towns might complain of this Abuse of the Sheriffs without any just cause,
<PB N="600" REF="322"/>
as in this Petition of <HI>Toriton</HI> now mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> the Pa∣tent of Ex∣emption, <HI>Parl. Regist.</HI> part 2.</NOTE> where they set forth, <HI>quod villa praedicta ad mittend. aliquos homines pro dicta villa ad Par∣liamenta nostra onerari non debtat, nec aliquos homines praedicta villa, ad Parliamenta nostra vel Progenitorum nostrorum miserit, nec mit∣tere consueverit ante annum Regni nostri vicesimum primum, &amp;c.</HI> Now, tho' this Petition was false in matter of fact, since it appears by the Returns that they had sent Burgesses to Parliament long before, in the Reigns of <HI>Edward</HI> the First and Second; yet the ground of their Petition was right, that they ought not to send any Men to Parliament, unless they had been accu∣stomed so to do in the time of this King's Progenitors, which had been a vain Plea, if it had been in the Sheriff's power (as of right) to have summoned what Towns they pleased to Parliament, since then there could have been no Cu∣stom pleaded against it.</P>
<P>This being once granted by Mr. <HI>Prin,</HI> or proved from the nature of the thing, we shall now come more particularly to give an account how several Towns might come to be put in or lest out of the Sheriffs Lists of the Burroughs without grant∣ing them this Arbitrary Power of making what Burroughs they pleased. Now these 170 Cities and Towns Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> has given us, and which have had Precepts sent them at any time, may be divided by him into these three ranks; the first is of those (being nine in number) which he says never made any Returns to the Precepts sene them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V. Parl. Regist.</HI> part 2. p. 224.</NOTE> and so continue to send no Members to this day (except <HI>Christ-Church.</HI>) Now these nine Towns either had a right to send Burgesses to Parliament in the King's Reigns, in which they received those Precepts, or they had not; if they had such a right, the Sheriff's did but their duty to send them Precepts as well as to the rest of the Burroughs of the County, for sure they had some Rule for doing it, more than their own private fancies, since the very Writs of Summons (from whence you would deduce this power to the Sheriffs) only recite a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>qualibet Civitate, &amp;c. &amp; de qualibet Burgo, &amp;c.</HI> which had been mighty uncertain if it had not been then very well known what Towns were then Cities, and what Burroughs; and sure these nine Towns must have then been Burroughs (in Reputation at least) or else they could never have had one, two, or more Precepts sent them (as Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> here owns they had) and they might have had many more such for ought we know, had all the Sheriffs Precepts, and the Re∣turns upon them been preserved, as most of them are lost, or mislaid, as I shall shew more at large by and by: Or if these Towns had no right at all to send Burgesses to Parliament, it was not in the Sheriffs power to impose it upon them, since they might have refused it if they pleased; and so take it either way, no∣thing can be argued from the loss or omission of the Returns for these Burroughs, that they either had, or had not any former right to Elect, since this might happen from the negligence of the Bailiffs, or Constables of the Town, or else from their own desire to be excused from the Charge. Thus in the 28th of <HI>Edward I.</HI> the Sheriff returns that the Bailiffs of St. <HI>Albans</HI> had made no Return of his Precept;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 201.</NOTE> neither is there any Returns of such Precepts to this Burrough all the Reign of this King; does is therefore follow, that this Town had no more. Precepts sent them in all his
<PB N="601" REF="322"/>
Reign, when I have shewed you the contrary by the Writs of Expences in the 35th of <HI>Ed. I.</HI> or that they had no other right to appear in Parliament as a Bur∣rough, but what the Sheriffs Precept first gave them, when you see they claimed by their Petition to <HI>Ed.</HI> the 2d. to send Burgesses to Parliament in the Reign of this King and his Progenitors.</P>
<P>The second Rank of Towns are such for which are found for some one, for some three, and for others more Precepts, with Returns of Elections made thereupon, and yet those that have made most Returns do not amount to during the Reigns of <HI>Ed.</HI> 1, 2, and 3. <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. <HI>Henries</HI> the 4th, 5th, and 6th, to above thirteen Returns. Well, granting all this, will it therefore follow, that they had no other right than the Sheriffs good will and pleasure; since if they had a right, and were willing to preserve it, they might have petitioned the King in Parlia∣liament against this Abuse of the Sheriffs? and if they were willing to give up their right by reason of the great charge and trouble of sending their Members, <HI>volenti non sit injuria,</HI> does it therefore follow that no others liad any other right to Elect, but what the Sheriffs Precept gave them? only forsooth, because no more Returns appear either in the loose Bundles of Returns, or upon the Clause-Rolls; or that therefore there were never any more Elections and Returns made than what Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> has here given us; which is a very fallacious Argument, con∣sidering how imperfect those Bundles of Returns are, out of which he has ex∣tracted them, a great many of the Precepts and Returns being no doubt lost and broke off the Files in the removing of the Records from one place to another; besides the whole Bundles of Returns of several years in divers Kings Reigns, that are quite lost, or so mislaid, that no body can find them. And for the truth of this Appeal to Mr. <HI>Petyt,</HI> who assures me he found the Returns of the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses to Parliament of the 23d of <HI>Ed. I.</HI> in an old Chest in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> among other things of a quite different nature, which Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> ne∣ver saw, or else certainly he would have given in the Returns to this Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parl. R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gist.</HI> part 1. p. 33.</NOTE> as well as he does the Writs of Summons to it; and yet that even these were not always entred upon the Clause-Rolls, but lay scattered up and down the Chappel of the White-Tower;
<Q>Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> himself confesses (in his Introduction to his third part of his Parliamentary Register) that he found no less than ninety five loose Original Writs for Elections and Returns of Knights, Citizens and Burgesses to Parliaments and great Councils in the Reign of <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. which were never entred on the Clause-Rolls, and lay there until he found them buried in dust and rubbish, as well as oblivion in a confus'd Chaos scattered from each other, and intermixed with many hundred thousands of other Writs and Records of various kinds.</Q>
<Q>Now what if these Writs and Returns had never been found? so that by his own shewing it is no ways certain that there were never any such Writs issued, or Returns made for the Counties, Cities and Burroughs, than those he had before sound and published; and he himself also here confesses, that by
reason of the negligence of Record-keepers, there are more Writs and Returns of Elections extant from some Counties than for others, tho' all had the like Writs sent them:</Q>
And if this was so as to the Counties, it was likewise so as to the Cities and Burroughs; the returns of which are commonly endorsed on
<PB N="602" REF="323"/>
the back of the Precepts; and where they were not so endorsed, were much more likely to be lost; and farther that the Clause Rolls are no exact Rule, for the Summons of Knights or Barons of the Cinque Ports and Burgesses,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parl. Regist.</HI> 3<HI>d. Part.</HI> p. 243.</NOTE> appears by Mr. <HI>Prins</HI> own shewing, <HI>viz.</HI> That there are no Writs of Summons to the Cinque Ports entred on the Clause Rolls; for most part of the Years of <HI>Edward</HI> 1, 2, and 3d. in the List he has here given us of those Years; now if so many considerable Burroughs, as the Cinque Burroughs, could be thus omitted, what can we expect for most of the smaller, and most inconsiderable Burroughs in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude this Head, if by Mr. <HI>Prins</HI> own Consession, the Entries of Ele∣ctions, and Returns upon the Clause Rolls are so very imperfect; and that the loose Bundles of Summons, Precepts and Returns are far more imperfect (so many of them being lost) pray tell me, how can Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> or any one else can frame any Argument from these that remain, that there were never no more Precepts and Returns from any Burroughs than those he has published us.</P>
<P>But to come to his third Rank of Burroughs, <HI>viz.</HI> such as for whom their appear no Precepts nor Returns till the Reigns of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the 2d. <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d. and other succeeding Kings;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 227.</NOTE> all which Burroughs he therefore supposes to have been all newly made in those Kings Reigns, because there are no Precepts or Returns from them sooner; it must there follow that the Sheriffs made all these Burroughs at their Pleasure; but Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> has done well here to adde, that they never elected or returned any before, for ought he can find to the contrary, since it might appear to the contrary (for ought he could tell) if the returns of the Sheriffs in the Reigns of the former Kings had not been so many of them lost, since he here confesses, there are no Original Writs and Returns for the Cinque Ports to be found be∣fore the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3d, who yet sent Members to all Parliaments in former King Reigns; or how can he tell, but divers of these Towns might have been created Burroughs by the Kings special Writs or Charters tho now lost; or perhaps unknown to this Author, who could not be supposed to understand the Original of all the Burroughs in <HI>England</HI> their sending Members to Parlia∣ment; but that he is certainly mistaken in making several Burroughs to have been but new, because no Returns are to be found from them before the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2d, may appear by these, for Example, First, <HI>Litchfield</HI> which was long before that time a Bishops See; and sure then if not a City, yet an an∣cient and considerable Burrough. Secondly, Old <HI>Sarum,</HI> which was in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d, a Bishops See (till it was removed) and so consequent∣ly by your Rule New <HI>Sarum,</HI> ought to pass for a City, and if not, was certain∣ly a very ancient Burrough; and as such sends Burgesses by Prescription to this day, tho the Town be quite destroyed; the like I may say of <HI>Gatton</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> which tho Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> will have but to be a new Burrough, because no Returns appears to have been made for it, by the Sheriffs till the Reigns of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th, yet this is no certain Rule; since it was a very old Burrough and had anciently been so Considerable as that we find several great Councils held at it in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Times; tho it be certainly now reduced to a small Hamlet of half a score Houses;
<PB N="603" REF="323"/>
now I will leave it to your self to judge, whether the Sheriff, would have pitcht upon so small and inconsiderable a place as this, to make a Burrough of, had it never sent any Burgesses to Parliament before that Time. And I doubt not, but those Gentlemen that know the rest of the Towns, he has there mentioned with <HI>Gatton</HI>; could say as much for the Antiquity as Burroughs, if you please to in∣quire about them.</P>
<P>But I have held you too long upon this Head, and therefore shall proceed to those two that remains, <HI>viz.</HI> The Ambition of Neighbouring Gentlemen to make as many Burroughs as they could, that they might be chosen at them; and the desire of such Towns to be made Burroughs to receive the advantages of the Money spent among them at such Elections; the first of these in the Times we are now speaking of, could be no cause of their sending Members to Parliament; since it is certain that before the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, none were Elected for any City or Town, but Persons free of, or actually Resident in such Cities and Bur∣roughs, as appears by the Statute of 1 <HI>Henry</HI> the 5th, which does but recite and confirm this ancient Custom, so that this Trick of chusing Members for Bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Ale, has been introduced but of late Ages, <HI>viz.</HI> Since the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, when Gentlemen began first to be chosen for Cities and Burroughs; and if that is so, the last cause falls off it self, <HI>viz.</HI> the desire of such small Towns to Elect, since if they could get nothing, but rather loose by their sending Burgesses to Parliament, and paying them their Wages (as they must do as long as they chose from among themselves) it is unreasonable to believe, that they ever should desire this as a Priviledge; and therefore it is onely, since the neglect of this good old Law for Wages, that so many Burroughs (which Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> here mentions to have had Precepts again sent them of late Years to Elect Members after some Ages Intermission) desired to have this Priviledge renewed to them; as was done in the Case of those Burroughs he here men∣tions; which yet certainly had been very gross,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 238.</NOTE> and contrary to all common Right, if the House of Commons had not then be∣lieved those Burroughs to have a had higher Right by Prescription than the She∣riffs Precepts gave them; as for the last Rank, <HI>viz.</HI> those Burroughs created by the Writs or Charters of our Kings, I need say but little, since this Author here grants such Creations to have been good before the Statute of 5th of <HI>Richard</HI> the 2d, but not since tho I cannot see any Reason for it; why he should give the She∣riffs such Power of making new Burroughs after this Statute, in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> 6th, as he does in the Case of <HI>Gatton,</HI> and those other Burroughs he there men∣tions with it; and yet deny this King the like Prerogative. But yet for all this, as I will not say there were none; so are there but very few Examples of Char∣ters, that conferr upon any City, or Burrough a Power to send Members to Parliament, who had it not before by Prescription, tho I grant that Priviledge may be mention'd in the Charter, and so put it in the Power of the Major, and Aldermen to Elect for the future, when it was the whole Populace, or all the Inhabitants of that Town that were to Elect before.</P>
<P>But to shew you from the very Statutes themselves, that Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> has here cited, that the Right of the Cities and Burroughs to appear in Parliament, was not anciently looked upon to have had no other Original then the Favour of the
<PB N="604" REF="324"/>
Sheriffs. Pray read these Clauses of the Statutes he has here quoted;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 240, 241.</NOTE> the first is that memorable Statute of the 5th of <HI>Richard</HI> 2d. 2d. <HI>Parl.</HI> c. 5. (now mentioned, and which I have alrea∣dy cited) which expresly Enacts,
<Q>That all, and singular Persons and Commo∣nalties which from henceforth shall for time to come have Summons of Parlia∣ment shall come from henceforth as before to Parliaments, in the manner as they be bound to do; and hath been accustomed within the Realm of <HI>England</HI> of old time, and whatever Person of the said Realm; which from henceforth shall have the said Summons (be he Archbishop, Bishop, Abbot, Prior, Duke, Earl, Baron, Banneret, Knight of Shire, Citizen of City, Burgess of Burgh, or other singular Person or Commonalty) do absent himself and come not at the said Summons, (except he may reasonably, and lawfully excuse himself to our Soveraign Lord the King) he shall be amerced, and otherwise punished according as of old times hath been used to be done within the said Realm in the said Case; and if any Sheriff of the Realm be henceforth negligent in making his returns of the Writs of the Parliaments, or that he shall leave out of the said Returns any Cities, or Burroughs which be bound, and of old Times were wont to come to Parliament, he shall be punished in the manner as was accu∣stomed to be done in the said Case of <HI>Old Time,</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> (<HI>d' Anciente</HI>) From which Statute we may draw these Conclusions.</Q>
First, That the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses; are as supposed by this Statute to have a like Right to have Summons to Parliaments as hath been accustomed of Old Time, as well as the Lords, Spiritual and Temporal here mentioned. Secondly, That by these Words have been accust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med of Old Time (or <HI>d' Anciente</HI>) we are to under∣stand a general Custom of the Realm; Time out of Mind, that is by Pre∣scription; so that if the Bishops, Abbott, and Temporal Lords, are here ac∣knowledged to have had a Right to sit in Parliament by Prescription; so have the Commons likewise by the same Words equally applyed to all the Orders here mentioned; Lastly, That if the Sheriffs shall neglect in making Return to any such Cities and Burroughs, which were thus bound to come to the Parlia∣ment of Old Time, he shall be punished, as hath been accustomed to be done in all time past (or <HI>d' Anciente</HI>) now pray tell with what colour of Justice, the Sheriffs could be thus punisht, if there had been no certain rule to know what C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ties and Burrough were bound to come to Parliament of Old Time, but it had been wholy left at the Sheriffs Discretion, which they should Summons, and which they would omit; let us next compare this with the Statute of 23d of <HI>Henry</HI> 6th, c. 15. (which Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> has here also given us) reciting,
<Q>That divers Sheriffs of Counties have sometimes returned none of the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses lawfully chosen to come to the Parliaments; but such Knights, Citizens and Burgesses have been returned; which were never duely chosen, and other Ci∣tizens and Burgesses than those which by the Mayors and Bailiffs were to the said Sheriffs returned, and moreover by no Precepts to the Mayors, and Bai∣lifts, or to the Bailiff or Baili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i, where no Mayor is, for the Electing of Citi∣zens and Burgesses to come to the Parliament; and then appoints the Penalties, for the said abuses and neglects.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="605" REF="324"/><Q>Now pray let me ask you, whether this bare Abuse of the Sheriffs, and neg∣lect of the duty of their Office here condemned by this Statute (and for which the former Statute of <HI>Richard II.</HI> declares them punishable at Common law, (as this Act makes them liable to it by Statute Law) could give them such an Arbitrary Power, as this Author fancies. much less can serve to corroborate his Opinion (as he here supposes it does) concerning the true original, con∣tinuance, discontinuance, reviving and antiquating Parliamentary Cities and Burroughs, not by Charters, and Patents from the King, or Prescription time out of mind, but by the Sheriffs Arbitrary Power and Returns, by the fore∣cited general Clauses in the Writs?</Q></P>
<P>But since I confess I have dwelt too long on my Answer to Mr. <HI>Prin</HI>'s Argu∣ments, I shall conclude with only giving you one Record, which I hope will sufficiently satisfie you, that not only St. <HI>Albans,</HI> but several other Antient Bur∣roughs claimed to send Burgesses to Parliament by Prescription, which appears by a Writ or Commission, reciting a Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition of the Town of <HI>Barnstaple</HI> to King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, and his Council in Parliament, which is to be found in the Patent-Rolls of the 17th of this King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part. 1. m. 20. <HI>dorso.</HI></NOTE> seting forth that the said Town had been a Free Burrough <HI>à tempore c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jus contrarii memoria non exis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it</HI>; and as such enjoyed divers Li∣berties, and Free Customs by a Charter of King <HI>Athelstan,</HI> and this among others, <HI>ac quod ad singula Parliamenta n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stra, &amp; dictorum Antecessorum nostrorum,</HI> (among which the said King <HI>Athelstan</HI> must certainly be reckoned for one) <HI>duos Burgenses pro Communitate ejusdem Burgi mittere solebant</HI>; and therefore that Charter being lost, they desire a Confirmation of it from the King, whereupon He by this Commission directs a Writ of Enquiry to several Gentlemen and others therein mentioned, to enquire if the said Burgesses had enjoyed all those Liberties so granted by the said Charter of King <HI>Athelstan,</HI> or not; which would have been ridiculous if the King and Council had been satisfied that no Cities and Burrough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sent any Members to Parliament under the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, and not before the 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third; and this Authority is the more remarkable, because <HI>Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣staple</HI> is one of Mr. <HI>Prin</HI>'s Modern Burroughs, for which he can find no Precepts or Returns earlier than the 26th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, tho', no doubt, (as ap∣pears by this their Petition) in the 17th of this King, it had sent Burgesses to Par∣liament many Ages before, tho' the Precepts and Returns upon them be all lost.
<Q>And that not only the Cities and Burroughs do thus claim by prescription, but that the Knights of Shires have always claimed the same Priviledge, may appear by another Petition of the Commons House extant on the Par∣liament-Rolls of the 51th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. 5. n. 45.</NOTE> which I shall contract and put into English out of French, reciting thus,
be∣cause of Common Right (in the Roll <HI>de Commune d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oit</HI>) of the Realm there are, and shall be Elected two from every County of <HI>England</HI> to come to Parliament for the <HI>Commune</HI> of the said Counties: And also the Prelates Dukes, Barons, Counts Barons, and such as hold by Barony, which are, and shall be summon∣ed by Writs to come to Parliament, except the Cities and Burroughs who ought to Elect from among themselves such as ought to answer for them.</Q></P>
<P>Whence we may conclude, that the Commons then claimed to come to Par∣liament
<PB N="606" REF="325"/>
of Common Right, (that is, by Common Law, or general Custom of the Realm, time out of mind) as much as the Bishops, Abbots and great Lords. 2. That neither the Bishops, Lords, nor Tenants <HI>in Capite</HI> had any Authority to impose Taxes, or make Laws for the Commons of the Counties, or these for the Cities and Burroughs, without their consents, because they had each of them Repre∣sentatives of their own Order to answer for them in Parliament.</P>

<P>I must confess this would have been absolutely convincing, could we have seen this Charter of K. <HI>Athelstans</HI>; but since the Towns-men of <HI>Barnstaple</HI> do only in their Petition (among others) set forth this priviledge of sending Burgesses to Parliament; now who can tell whether there was any such thing in their Char∣ter or not, since they confess they had lost it? Or granting it was as they set forth, yet is will sufficiently evince that the right of Cities and Burroughs to send their Representatives to Parliaments, was not, as you suppose, as ancient as the Government, but had its Original from the Grants and Charters of former Kings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to these Objections, we can have but all the proof that this Subject is capable of at such a distance of time; but if I were a Jury-man in this matter I should rather believe that the Town of <HI>Barnstaple</HI> had such Charter not long before they made this Petition to King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third; and that there was such Clause therein as they here set forth, than that these Towns-men should be so impudent as to desire a new Charter of Confirmation from him of all their priviledges (of which this of Electing Burgesses was one) if there had never been any such Clause in it at all. But as for the other Objection, that if it were so, then it appears that all the right of Cities and Burroughs sending Mem∣bers to Parliament, is derived from the Grants and Charters of former Kings, it is very fallacious; as you will find if you consider and compare the Ancient right of the Bishops, and Abbots; as also of all the Temporal Nobility to come to the great Council of the Kingdom, which as to the first of them I proved to be as Ancient as Christianity it self, among the English Saxons: And as for the Priesthood and Nobility in general, to have been as old as the Institution of the Government it self. Now, tho' you grant that long before the Conquest our Kings had the nomination of Bishops, and Abbots, and also the making of Alder∣men, Earls and Thanes, who made the Temporal Nobility in those great Coun∣cils; will it therefore follow that because our Kings were thus entrusted by the people with this prerogative of naming and investing Bishops and Abbots <HI>per An∣nulum &amp; Baculum,</HI> and also of creating those great Men now mentioned, that there∣fore all the right either Order had to appear at those Councils, not only pro∣ceeded from, but depended wholly on the King's good will and pleasure; and that he could have chosen whether he would have named any Bishops, or Abbots to vacant Sees, and Abbeys, or made any Aldermen, Earls, and Thanes, or not, but have changed the whole frame of the Government into an Absolute Despotick Monarchy, by destroying the great Council of the Kingdom; whether you believe the Clergy, Nobility and People would have suffered any of those Kings to have made such an Innovation? Apply this to the right of the most of An∣cient Cities and Burroughs in <HI>England</HI>; and see if it do not exactly agree with this parallel Case of the Bishops, Abbots, and Temporal Nobility; since as there
<PB N="607" REF="325"/>
were Priests and Nobles, who from the very first Institution of our great Coun∣cils did not owe their Original to the King, but brought it with them out of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> and to whose Suffrages the first Saxon Kings owed their Elections; so no doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were there divers Cities and Towns in <HI>England</HI> so considerable from the time of the Expulsion of the <HI>Britains,</HI> that it was thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to pitch upon them as most able to send Representatives to the great Councils of the Nation, that so they might imitate their old Government in their own Countrey, in which the great Cities and Towns had always a considerable share, as they have in the <HI>German</HI> Diets to this day; tho' the King might then (as he is now) be en∣trusted with the Prerogative of making new Cities and Burroughs with like priviledge, with the old ones; tho' this was but rarely practised till the Reign of King <HI>Iames I.</HI> The two <HI>Vniversities,</HI> being some of the first Corporations on which he conferred this priviledge by Charter, of Electing and sending two Burgesses to Parliament; which power has, I confess, been exercised even to a grievance in the Reigns of his Son, and Grand-sons; so that it were to be wisht, that there was a Law passed, that no New City or Burrough should be made for the fu∣ture without an express Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>Now I would very gladly hear what you can further say to so many weighty Authorities, which I have now given you; for evident it is, that if they are compared and considered in series of time, that neither <HI>Edw.</HI> 2d or 3d, nor their Judges or Learned Council, no nor the Parliaments of their, and suc∣ceeding times, had ever heard any thing of Dr. <HI>Brady's Annus Mirabilis,</HI> or 49th of <HI>Henry</HI> 3d. which was but 43 years before the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> 2. his Grand-child, and little above 60 years before that of <HI>Edward</HI> his great Grand-son.</P>

<P>Well, notwithstanding all this, whosoever will reflect upon what the Doctor hath writ, may suspect that the Judges (nay Parlia∣ments) were very ignorant in the History of this Nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.A.P.</HI> p. 13.</NOTE> or that they spoke out of design. And it is a great Argument that the Lawyers studied and knew only Popular and Lucrative Law, and not the Con∣stitutions of the Nation before their own time. And tho' I must confess what you have now said may seem to me to carry some weight with it; yet since I do not easily change my Opinion, upon the first hearing of a new Argument, or Authori∣ty; give leave better to consider what you have said; but in the mean time, since you have now mentioned the <HI>German</HI> Dyets, pray Sir, before we leave off, shew me what you undertook to prove at the first entrance on this Subject; <HI>viz.</HI> that in all the great Councils, or Assemblies of Estates in <HI>Europe,</HI> which are derived from the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Goths,</HI> there are found Representatives for the Plebeians or Commons distinct from the Clergy, and greater, and lesser Nobility.</P>

<P>I readily agree to your desires; but since my own Notes concerning this matter are very long, and that I have them not about me, pray give me leave to make use of the Authority of Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> an Author, you have no reason to look upon a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> partial, since he was not only remarkable for his great skill in History, but also (as being a great Friend and Disciple to Sir <HI>Robert <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilmer</HI> in Politicks) was a vehement assertor of Absolute Monarchy, and an utter Enemy to the Power of Parliaments; yet this very person in his Treatise called, <HI>The Stumbling of Disobedience and Rebellion,</HI> &amp;c. printed 1658. in his 5th Chapter (I have al∣ready
<PB N="608" REF="326"/>
quoted for the Inferiour Clergy's being anciently a part of the great Coun∣cil or Parliament of the Kingdom) proves the Uniformity of the three Estates to have been the same in all the Christian Kingdoms on this side of <HI>Europe,</HI> he runs thorough them all, beginning with <HI>Germany</HI>; which I shall contract, because he there says a great many other things not so material to our present purpose.</P>
<P>And first beginning (as of right) with the <HI>German</HI> Empire, <HI>Thuanus</HI> gives this Note in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>August. Thuan. hist. lib.</HI> 2.</NOTE> <HI>Imperium in tria omnino membra dividitur,</HI> that the Empire is divided into <HI>three Estates,</HI> over all which the▪ <HI>Emperor</HI> is the Head or Supreme Prince. Of these the first Estate is <HI>ex sacro Ordine,</HI> of the holy <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> composed of the three <HI>Spiritual Electors,</HI> together with the residue of the Arch bishops and Bishops, and many Abbots, Priors, and other Prelates. The second is of the <HI>Nobility</HI> con∣sisting of the three <HI>Temporal Electors,</HI> the Dukes, Marquesses, Lan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>graves, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣graves, Earls and Barons, of which there is no determinate number; the Em∣peror having power to add daily to them, as he sees occasion.

<P>Next pass we over into <HI>France,</HI> and there we find the Subjects marshalled in∣to <HI>three Estates,</HI> whereof the <HI>Clergy</HI> is the first. <HI>Rex coactis</HI> tribus <HI>Ordinibas,</HI> Sa∣cerdotio, <HI>Nobilitate, Plebe, subsidia rei pecuniariae petiit.</HI> So <HI>Paulus Aemilius</HI> doth inform us: Out of these <HI>three</HI> are chosen certain <HI>Delegates</HI> or <HI>Commissioners,</HI> some for each <HI>Estate,</HI> as often as the King's occasions do require their meeting, the time and place whereof is absolutely left unto his disposing; and these thus me: do make up the <HI>Conventus Ordinum,</HI> or <HI>L' Assemblie des Estats,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> men call it, in form much like the <HI>English</HI> Parliament; [and of the meeting of these <HI>three Estates,</HI> not only this <HI>Author,</HI> but all the other <HI>French Historians</HI>; and in particular <HI>Phil. de Commines</HI> make frequent mention.]</P>
<P>Pass we next over the <HI>Pyren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,</HI> to the Realms of <HI>Spain,</HI> and we shall find in each the same <HI>three Estates,</HI> whose meeting they call there by the name of <HI>Curia.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bodin. de Re∣pub. lib.</HI> 3.</NOTE> the Court, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, by way of emi∣nency; consisting of the <HI>Clergy</HI> the <HI>Nobility,</HI> and the <HI>Commi∣sioners</HI> of the Provinces and most Ancient Cities. For proof of which we need but look into the <HI>General History of Spain</HI> translated out of <HI>French</HI> by <HI>Grimston,</HI> and we shall find a <HI>Court</HI> of Parliament for the Realm of <HI>Aragon,</HI> consisting of the <HI>Bishops, Nobles, and Deputies of Towns and Commonalties, having place in the said Estates</HI> convened by K. <HI>Iames</HI> at <HI>Saragassa Anno</HI> 1325. for setling the Succession,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.

Also for <HI>Castile,</HI> we find a <HI>Parliament of Lords, Prelates, and Deputies of Towns summoned</HI> at <HI>Toledo</HI> by <HI>Alfonso</HI> the Noble, <HI>Anno</HI> 1210. up∣on occasion of an Invasion made by the <HI>Moores</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id. lib.</HI> 10.</NOTE> another before that at <HI>Burgos,</HI> under the same King, <HI>Anno</HI> 1179. for levying of Money on the People to maintain the Wars: Also that great Convention of the States held at <HI>Toledo</HI> by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the <HI>Catholick</HI> 1479. for swearing to the Succession of his Son <HI>Don Iohn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id. lib.</HI></NOTE> in which the <HI>Prelates,</HI> the Nobility, and almost all the Towns and Cities which sent Comissioners to the

Assembl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, are expresly named.

<P>Now let us take a view of the Northern Kingdoms, and still we find the Peo∣ple ranked in the self same manner, and their great Councels to consist of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> the <HI>Nobility,</HI> and certain <HI>Deputies,</HI> sent from the <HI>Provinces</HI> and Cities, as in those before.

<P>I will not deny, but there were Representatives of the Cities, and great Towns in the great Councils or Assembly of Estates of all those Kingdoms you have now mention'd out of Dr. <HI>Heylins</HI> Treatise; yet whether they were there from the very first Institution of those Governments is much to be doubted. But since I have not now leasure to inquire into the Original of all these Kingdoms; nor at what time each State began to come to these great Councils; give me leave in the mean time to remark, that all these Kingdoms (except <HI>Sweden</HI>) came nearer to that Constitution; which we suppose to have been anciently in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and also other Kingdoms where feuda∣tory Tenures were observed, and consequently none but the Chief Lords or Barons by Knights Service,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>That this is a meer surmise of yours, I think I can easily prove; for in the first place, as for the Bishops, Abbots, and Clergy, who still made the first Estates in all these Kingdoms; nothing is more certain, than that they never any of them held of the King by Knights Service, and therefore could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their great Councils by that Tenure▪ that Institution being for ought as I know peculiar to <HI>England,</HI> and introduced by your Conqueror, as you your self acknowledge; and as for the Temporal Nobility, you will find, that in <HI>France</HI> not onely those Noblemen, that held of the King by Military Service, but those who held <HI>in libero Alodio</HI> without any such Service, at all, had places, either by themselves or their Deputies in the Assembly of the Estates, so likewise for the Cities and Towns that sent Deputies to it: I believe you will not find that any of them held of the King <HI>in Capite</HI>: and to come to <HI>Germany</HI>; you are likewise as much mistaken in fancying, that all the Imperial Cities were Subject immedi∣ately to the Emperor before they became so; for <HI>Hamburgh</HI> and <HI>Lubec</HI> were Subject to their own Princes, the former to the Duke of <HI>Holstein</HI> and <HI>Sleswic,</HI> and the latter to Earls of its own; till at last they either purchased their Liberties
<PB N="611" REF="327"/>
they enioy from their Princes; or else cast them off and were after received into the Body of the Diet by the Bulls or Char∣ters of several Emperors;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. I. Angel. We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>denhagen de Rebus Han∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aticis,</HI> cap. 2. p. 30.</NOTE> and so likewise <HI>Brunswick</HI> was always a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e City, till it was united to the Empire by its own Consent: I could shew you the like of several other Cities, now called Im∣perial, who held anciently not of the Emperour, but either of their own Earls, or Bishops, tho I grant it was the Charters of the Emperor with the Consent of the Dyet, that gave them a place in those As∣semblies: and tho it is true, that in all the rest of these Kingdoms, the meer Ru∣sticks or Paisants have no Representatives in their great Councils; yet this makes no Alteration in the Case, if you please to consider it, for the Nobility and Gen∣try are the only true and proper owners of the Lands, of those Kingdoms, all the Rusticks or Paisants being meer Vassals, and in <HI>France</HI> almost Slaves to their No∣bility, and Gentry who (as I have already said) had all alike Votes in their Assem∣bly of Estates, as well those who held of the King in Chief by Knights Service, as those that did not; whereas it was always far otherwise in <HI>England,</HI> where the meanest Freeholder was always as free as to his Person, and Estate as the greatest Lord of whom he held, and hence it is, that we have had from all Times those of the degree of Yeomen, so peculiar to <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Fortiscut</HI> in his Treatise <HI>de Laudibus Legum Angliae,</HI> takes notice, who if they lived on their own Lands, had no more dependance on the Noblemen, and Gentlemen than they have now; and therefore it was but Reason, that these should have their Representa∣tives in Parliament; as well as the Inhabitants of the Cities and Burroughs, who had most of them a far less share in the Riches; and real Estates of the Kingdom. Secondly, Pray take notice, that in the rest of the Kingdoms of <HI>Europe,</HI> except <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> there was no difference in Point of Priviledges as to being taxed, or having Voices in the great Council of the Kingdom between the higher Nobility; such as had the Titles of Dukes, Marquesses, and Counts; and sim∣ple Gentlemen, whereas in <HI>England</HI> it has been always otherwise (at least since the Conquest) and the Earls, and Barons, had by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tenures Places, as Lords or Peers in the great Council of the Kingdom, and so made a distinct Body from the rest of the People; whereas in other Countreys, the higher Nobility and Gentry are reckon'd as all one Estate, and therefore it was but Reason, that the rest of the Inferior Nobility or Gentry should have their Representatives in this great Council or Parliament, or otherwise they would have been as very Vassals as to their Estates, to the great Barons, and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> as the Boors in <HI>Germany,</HI> or the Paisants in <HI>France</HI> were to their Lords, by whom they were taxed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Pleasures; which they never were in <HI>England,</HI> as we can find either from History or Records. So that tho I grant that it is the municipal Laws of each Kingdom, or Nation, that must determine what are the governing part of the People in those Countreys; yet tho that was not absolutely the same in all of them as it is in <HI>England,</HI> yet we find it so in the main; and the Repre∣sentatives of the Cities and Towns do sufficiently assert the Right of the Plebians or Common People, who make the 3d Estate in those great Councils. But I must here except <HI>Sweden</HI> in which it is certain that the meer Rusticks or Boors had always their own Deputies in their Dyets, as well as the Cities and
<PB N="612" REF="328"/>
Towns; and if <HI>Sweden</HI> had this priviledge, I cannot see why the English Gentry, and Yeomanry (who make but one body of Commons) might not have had the like, till you can shew me more sufficient proofs to the contrary.</P>

<P>Well Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I shall consider of what you say, but since it grows late, that we may wind up this Conversation as fast as we can, give me leave to tell you, that tho' I should admit all that you have hitherto averred for truth, and that we should grant the Commons of <HI>England</HI> to have been as ancient a part of the great Council, or Parliaments, as any of the other two; what is that to the main Point in question between us. <HI>viz</HI> that of Non-resis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance of the King upon any ac∣count whatsoever? or how can you justsfie those of the Clergy, Nobility, and Gentry of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for taking up Arms against the King, and con∣tributing so much as they have done to the driving him away and in bringing things to this confusion they are now in? since, let your Constitution of great Councils and Parliaments be never so ancient, let us also for once suppose them (as you do) to have a share in the Legislative Power of the Nation, yet how can this authorize them (much less any private persons out of Parliament) to take up Arms against the King, or those commissioned by him, since the whole current, both of Common as well as Statute-Law runs directly against you, and all with one con∣sent assert that the disposal of the <HI>Militia,</HI> or Military Force of the Kingdom has been even so absolutely in the King's power, and at his disposal, that no man can without being guilty of Treason, take up Arms (whether offensive or de∣fensive) without his Commission to authorize him to do it; so that no Govern∣ment in the World is more averse to all forcible Resistance than our own, the King having been even from your time beyond memory so fully possest of the whole <HI>Militia,</HI> or power of raising offensive or defensive Arms in this Kingdom, that it is expresly forbid by the Statute of the 7th <HI>Ed. I.</HI> against coming to Parliaments and Treatises with force of Arms, in which the King sets forth, <HI>That in the last Parliament the Prelates Earls, Barons, and the</HI> Commonalry (<HI>in La∣tine</HI> Communitas <HI>or Body of the Realm</HI>) <HI>have said that to us,</HI> (i e. <HI>to the King</HI>) <HI>it be∣longeth, and our part it is through our Royal Seign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury to defend</HI> (that is, in old French, to forbid) <HI>force of Armour, and all other force against our Peace, at all times when it shall please us, and to punish them according to our Laws and Vsages of our Realm, and hereunto they are bound to Aid us as their Soveraign Lord as oft as need shall be.</HI> From whence you may observe, that it is the King's Prerogative to forbid all manner of Arms or Armed force within the Realm; so that no man can lawfully Arm himself without his Authority: And this is further confirm'd by the Statute of 25 <HI>Ed.</HI> the Third, concerning Treasons, wherein it is declared (without any excepted Cases to the contrary) <HI>That to Levy War against our Lord the King in this Realm, or to be adherent to the King's Enemies in his Realm, giving them Aid or Com∣fort in the Realm, or elsewhere, is Treason.</HI> And Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> upon this Statute saith thus, <HI>That this was High Treason before by the Common Law, for no Subject can Levy War within the Realm without Authority from the King; and if any man Levy War to expulse Strangers, to deliver men out of Prisons, to remove wicked Councellors, or against any Statute, or to any other End, pretending Reformation on their own heads without Warrant, this is Levying of War against the King, because they take upon them Royal Authority.</HI> From which Statute, as also from your own Oracles (Sir <HI>Ed.
<PB N="613" REF="328"/>
Coke</HI>'s) Interpretation of it, you may observe that it is not only Treas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to make War against the King's Person, but to take Arms to make any Reformation or Alteration in Church, or State, without the King's Authority; nor can any Sub∣ject of <HI>England</HI> justifie the taking Arms upon any account whatsoever, unless it be by the King's Commission; and therefore all the Judges of <HI>England</HI> in the Case of Dr. <HI>Story,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Dyer</HI>'s Reports.</NOTE> who was Executed for Treason in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> did with one consent agree, that the very Consultation concerning making War against the Queen, shall be interpreted a making War against her Person, and supposes a design against her Life: So that nothing seems plainer to me, than that by the Ancient as well as Modern Laws of <HI>England,</HI> all defensive as well as offensive Arms are expresly forbidden and condemned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I shall be able to make out, notwithstanding what you have now said, that all Resistance of the King, or those commissioned by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im, is so far from being Treason, as you suppose, that it is every mans duty to oppose him in case he goes about to set up, instead of a Legal Monarchy, a Tyrannical Arbitrary Power in this Nation, since this is but to preserve the Original Con∣stitution of Parliaments, which in some cases cannot be maintained without such a Resistance be allowed. But to proceed to the Authorities you bring from our Statutes; as for the first, you urge from that 7th <HI>Edward</HI> the First; I think that can by no means do the business for which you design it; for in the first place, this is only Declaration of the Bishops, Lords and Commons of the Land, that it belongs to the King to defend (<HI>i. e.</HI> forbid) all force of Arms; but mark Sir, what force? sure it is only meant of such Force as belongs to the King's Prerogative to forbid; <HI>viz.</HI> force of Arms against the Publick Peace, and such as he might punish according to the Laws and Usages of the Realm; and therefore the Statute expresly declares▪ that (as Subjects) they are hereunto bound Aid him their Soveraign Lord the King at all times when need shall be; but does this Act any where say, that he hath an Irresistible Power to disturb this Peace by his own private Illegal Commissions, or that any men are bound to assist him in it; or because (for example) he hath Authority to punish all men according to Law that shall come to Parliaments with force of Arms, that there∣fore he hath an unlimited power of raising what Forces he would, and in prison∣ing or destroying the whole Parliament if he pleased, and that no bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might resist him, if he had gone about so to do. The like may be said, if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should notoriously, and insupportably by force invade all the Civil Liber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> and Pro∣perties of his Subjects by Levying Taxes, and taking away the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Estates by down-right Force, contrary to Law, now can any body in his senses believe that the Act of 25th of <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. was made to prevent all Resistance of su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Tyrannical Violence and that the Resistance of those Forces (whether forreign or domestick) that might be sent by the King's private Commissioners to murder or enslave us, is making War against his Person, or that it comes within any of the Cases ex∣pressed in that Statute, and therefore cannot fall within the compass of Sir <HI>Edw. Coke</HI>'s Comment upon this Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ute, all the offences therein specified being Trea∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns at Common Law before that Statute was made; nor is the Reformation there mentioned, to be understood of a just and necessary Defence of our Lives, Liber∣ties,
<PB N="614" REF="329"/>
Religion, and Properties, as setled and established by the Laws of the Land, to be looked upon as making War against a weak or seduced King, but is rather in defence of him, and the Government, by opposing Tyranny, which will certainly bring both him and us to Ruine at last; so the Reformation he there mentions is only to be be understood of such Insurrections and Rebellions as have been made under the meer pretence of Religion, or obtaining greater Liberties for the common sort of People than they had by the Law of the Land, such as were the Rebellions of <HI>Wat Tyler</HI> in King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, and Mortimers in <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry</HI> the 6th Reigns, not to mention the other Rebellions raised by the Papists in the times of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reigns; all which being begun by Seditious or Superstitious men, were certainly rank Re∣bellions, and so are and ought to be esteem'd by all good Subjects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant these pretences seem very fair and specious, yet notwithstanding this your pretended right, or a necessity of Resistance of the King, or those commissioned by him in case of Tyranny, has been still looked upon as Rebel∣lion in all Ages, and the Actors dealt with accordingly where ever they were taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not deny but as long as Arbitrary and Tyrannical Princes could get the better of it, and keep the Power in their own hands, they still Executed for Traytors whosoever opposed or resisted their wicked and unjust Actions, tho' they were never so near Relations to them; thus both <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the Second put their Uncles the Dukes of <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>Gloucester</HI> to death meerly because they joyned with the rest of the Nobility and People to prevent their designs. So that it is not the Execution of the Man, but the Cause that makes the Traytor, since Princes are seldom without a sufficient number of Judges and Jury∣men to condemn whomsoever they please to fall upon.</P>
<P>But that the Clergy, Nobility and People of <HI>England</HI> have always asserted this right of Self-defence in case their Liberties and Properties were uniustly invaded by the Tyrannical or Arbitrary Practices of the King, or those about him; I think I can prove by giving you the History of it in so many Kings since your Conquest, as will render it indisputable, if you please to give me now the hear∣ing, or else to defer it till the next time we meet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess I was so weary of sitting up so long at our last Conversation, that I made a Resolution not to do so any more; and therefore since it grows late, let us leave off now, and I promise to meet you here again within a night or two, and then I will hear how well you can vindicate your right of Resistance from Law or History; but if you have no better proofs for it than the Rebel∣lion of the Barons in King <HI>Iohn</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Third's Reigns, you will scarce make me your Convet, since Impunity does never sanctifie a wicked action, or render it the more lawful; and you have already given it me for an Axiom, that <HI>a facto ad Ius non valet consequentia.</HI></P>

<P>I accept of your Appointment with thanks; but pray do not for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>judge my Arguments till you hear them; and as for the Axiom, I allow it for good, provided I may urge it in my turn; but in the mean time I shall wish you good night.</P>

<HEAD>The PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Must beg your pardon, if I have exceeded my intended design, (in the Preface to the first of these Dialogues) of reducing what I had to say on the Subjects there laid down into eight Discourses; Since being obliged to vindicate the Antient Constitution of Parliaments, from the Cavils of some late writers; there was a necessity of considering what Dr. <HI>Brady</HI> had with so great industry heaped together against the House of Commons, being antiently a constituent part of our Par∣liaments, before the <HI>49th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>III.</HI> in the doing of which, if I have proved too prolix, I can only say I could not avoid it, without baulking those Arguments the Doctor has made use of to support his opinion.</P>
<P>But having already treated in the third and fourth Dialogues, upon the Questions of Passive Obedience, and Non-Resistance, as a Moralist, and a Divine; I come now to handle the same Question as a Lawyer; and to examine whether by the ancient Laws, and Constitutions of our English Government, and by the late Statutes of the thirteenth and fourteenth of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>II.</HI> all taking up of Arms against the King, or those Commissioned by him, be ab∣solutely forbidden, and declared Treasonable; in the doing of which I can assure you, I have not failed impartially to set down, what∣ever I have either heard or read materially urged for one or the other opinion, and I have also consulted some of the wisest and most Iudicious Members of the long Parliament of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>II.</HI> to learn what was then the sense of both Houses of Parliament, con∣cerning the words of that Oath; but whether I have any ways mistaken
<PB REF="331"/>
the sense of those August Assemblies; I humbly submit it to the judg∣ment of this present Parliament. For <HI>cujus est condere, ejus est interpretari</HI>: and I hope for the like ingenuity from those, who give a different and stricter interpretation to the words of those Statutes, and the Oath therein contained; which tho' it be now no longer en∣join'd, yet since it may still be thought to bind such as have taken it, it was very necessary to inquire what was the true intent of those that imposed it; that is indeed, what is the legal sense of the words of that Oath.</P>
<P>But as to the inconveniencies, and mischiefs that may arise from the Peoples judging what Commissions of the Kings are Legal, or Illegal; and either resisting them: or yielding obedience to them, as they shall see cause: I have only this to say, that I desire those of the contrary opinion, seriously to consider all the inconveniencies and mischiefs that may happen on the other side; if the King is invested with an absolute irresistible power not only to issue what commissions, but to whom and to what ends he pleases, tho' never so illegal, and ar∣bitrary: and that the whole Nation must yield an active obedience, or at least a passive submission to them without the least resistance, no, not so much as to assist any Foreign Prince, who should come in to their assistance▪ as his Present Majesty (when Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>) gene∣rously did: And when any man has without prejudice and passion considered consequences; I shall freely leave it to him to embrace which side he pleases, since I hope it is neither Heresie, nor Treason, to be of either; and therefore I only desire the Reader to peruse this discourse without passion, or prejudice, and then it is indifferent to me what party he takes; since I think men may be honest and, con∣scientious who believe either way; and I do not expect, nor desire any man to be of this, or that opinion, farther than his reason shall guide him in which if he be mistaken he has no body to blame but himself; since he is not sit to judge who is to be trusted with arguments only for that, which he already believes to be the right side.</P>
<P>I have no more to mind you of at present, but to suppose these Pa∣pers to be written before their present Majesties were declared King and Queen;) and in a time when every body not only thought, but spoke freely.</P>

<HEAD>THE Ninth Dialogue BETWEEN Mr. <HI>FREEMAN</HI> a Gentleman, AND Mr. <HI>MEANWELL</HI> a Civilian.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, I am glad to see you again so soon, for I was just now looking over some of our Old Historians, that lie here upon the Table, to rub up my Memory for sufficient Instances and Authorities, that it hath been always the received and constant Custom and Practice of the Clergy, Nobility, and People of this Nation, to defend the Ancient Government of this Kingdom by general Councils or Parliaments, as also their just Liberties and Properties, not only by Remonstrances, and Petitions to, but by Force too, against the King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and those commissioned by him, in case they found them evidently, and vio∣lently invaded, beyond what any fair, or gentle means, and intercession were able to redress: And for proof of this, I shall go as high as the Times of the Kings of the West Saxons, from whom all the Kings of <HI>England</HI> before the Con∣quest were descended, after the Kingdom of the West Saxons had prevail∣ed over all the rest. I shall therefore begin with the Reign of <HI>Sigehert</HI> King of the West Saxons, who, as I told you in your Sixth Conversation, breaking the Laws and Constitutions of the Kingdom, and Tyrannizing over all form of People, was in a general Council of the whole Kingdom deposed, and expelled into the Forrest of <HI>Audredswald,</HI> where he was afterwards slain by a Hogheard. As the Saxons Annals under the Year 755. as also <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> and <HI>Mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sbury</HI> relate. I shall not mention the Deposition of King <HI>Edwin,</HI> by the <HI>Mercians</HI> and <HI>Northumbrians,</HI> and their chusing his Brother <HI>Edgar</HI> in his stead, because not done by the Common Council of the whole Kingdom; and that also for slight, and insufficient grounds.</P>
<P><PB N="616" REF="332"/>Therefore since the Times before the Conquest do afford us no more ex∣amples of this kind among the Kings of the West Saxon Race; (to which I only confine my self) since those Kings being for the most part at Wars with the <HI>Danes</HI> to the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, had somewhat else to think on than the making themselves Absolute, or Tyrannizing over their Subjects; but indeed, there is scarce to be found in History a Succession of more mild, just and valiant Princes, than <HI>Egbert</HI> the First King of all <HI>England,</HI> and his Descendants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray Sir tell me to what purpose you cite these Instances of the Nobility and People of <HI>England</HI> deposing and casting off their Kings in the Times before the Conquest; is it that you would justifie that Common-wealth Principle, that the Parliament hath the like Power to depose the King at this day in case of any Infringement of the Fundamental Laws, of the Kingdom, or breach of the Ori∣ginal Contract (as those of your Party now term it?) if you do, pray speak plain, and then I shall know what Answer to give you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho'l assert it (as undeniable in matter of fact) that the English Saxons did often exercise that Power they had reserved to themselves, of Electing and Deposing their Kings, when they became insupportable for Tyranny or Mis∣government, as appears not only in the Kingdom of the West Saxons, I have now instanced in, but in almost all the other Kingdoms of the <HI>Heptarchy</HI>; in which there are to be found many more Instances of the Deposition of their Kings, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what were in the West Saxon Kingdom▪ &amp; this wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then very just and necessary, since these Kingdoms were all Elective; and none of them Hereditary; and that the general Meeting of the great Council of the Nation was always at set, and constant Times; and did not depend upon the Will, and Pleasure of the King, either to call or dissolve them, as I have already proved; and that this Power was no unusual thing; I appeal to all the Antient Kingdoms of <HI>Europe</HI> founded after the same Model as ours; and which I mentioned at our last Meet∣ing; so that nothing is more frequent in their Histories and Annals, than the Deposing of their Kings for the above-mentioned Crimes of Tyranny, or Mis∣governments▪ But that some of these <HI>Gothick</HI> Kingdoms, as <HI>Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Swe∣den</HI>▪ whilst they continued Elective, have exercised this Power even till of late, is so notorious in matter of fact, that it needs no proof, since the Kings of those Kingdoms held their Crowns at this day by that Title, and on those Conditions, which the Nobility and People gave them, after the Deposition of their Pre∣decessors.</P>
<P>But tho this were so anciently also in <HI>England,</HI> it does not therefore follow that it must be so now, for since the Crown of this Kingdom became Heredi∣tary, and that the Calling and Dissolving of great Councils or Parliaments came to depend wholly upon the King's Will; I must allow, that the Case is quite al∣tered and that the Two Houses of Parliament have now no power to de∣pose the King for any Tyranny or Misgovernment whatsoever. The first Par∣liament of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second in the Act for attainting the Regicides have actually disclaimed all Coercive Power over the King; and yet for all that, the Nobility▪ and People of <HI>England</HI> may still have a good and sufficient Right left them of defending their Lives, Religion, and Liberties against the King, or those commissioned by him in case of a general, and universal Breach and Invasion
<PB N="617" REF="332"/>
of the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, or Original Contract, (if you will call it so) and not to lay down those Defensive Arms till their said just Rights and Liberties are again restored, and sufficiently secured to them: So that tho' I will not bring the Custom of the English Saxons as a precedent for the Parlia∣ment's Deposing of the King; yet I think I may make use of it thus far, that this Nation has ever exercised this necessary Right of defending their Liberties, and Properties, when invaded by the King, or his Ministers, either by colour of Law, or open Force: And that this hath been the constant practice from almost the Time of the Conquest down to later Ages, I think I can make out from suffi∣cient Authorities, both from Histories and Records.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' your Doctrine is not so bad as I expected, yet it is still bad enough; and I never knew this Right of Resistance carried home, but that it always ended in Deposing, and Murdering of the King at the last; as we have seen in our own Times: But let the constant practice have been as it will, I am sure such Resistance hath been always condemned by our Ancient Common▪Law, as well as Modern Statutes, as I shall prove farther to you by and by; and therefore pray give me leave to tell you, that the never so constant practice of an unlaw∣ful thing, can no more justifie the doing of it, than that constant usage, time out of mind, for Thieves to Rob between <HI>London,</HI> and St. <HI>Albans</HI>; not that I fore-judge you, or refuse to hear any Instances and Authorities from Histories or Records to make good your Assertion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for your patience; what therefore if I prove that such Re∣sistance has been not only actually exercised by the Clergy, Nobility and People in former Ages, but that it hath been also allowed by our Kings, and ap∣proved of by great Councils or Parliaments in those Times for lawful, and the Actors in it wholly indemnified and saved harmless, nay, a power given them, and that by the King himself, to resist him, and defend themselves in case he broke his Charters, and Agreements made to, and with his Nobility and People, or else with some Forein Prince; may appear from this remarkable Instance of King <HI>Henry II</HI> at the end of whose Reign <HI>Hoveden</HI> in his Annals,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Poster.</HI></NOTE> gives us the Conditions of the Peace made in the last Year of this King between him, and <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> with the Consent of their Bishops, Earls, and Barons, where among other Articles you will find this for one, particularly relating to the Barons of <HI>England,</HI> who were also to swear to the Peace, in these Terms, <HI>Et omnes Barones Angliae jura∣bunt, quod si Rex Angliae noluerit has Conditiones tenere, quod ipsi tenebunt cum Rege Franciae, &amp; Comite Richardo, &amp; cos adj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vabunt pro posse contra Rege<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Angliae, &amp;c.</HI> Whence we may without doubt conclude, that the Resistance of Subjects in some cases against their Kings, was then allowed of, even by the King himself, and thought not inconsistent with the Allegiance they bore him, tho' it might sus∣pend it for a time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess this Instance would be of some weight, were it not for the Cri∣tical Time when this Peace was made; <HI>viz.</HI> when <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> the King's Eldest Son, had Rebelled against his Father, and taken part with the King of <HI>France</HI>; and had drawn over a great many of the <HI>Norman,</HI> and <HI>Pictavian,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Barons to his Party; which when King <HI>Henry</HI> perceived, this very
<PB N="618" REF="333"/>
Author you have quoted here, tells you, <HI>Quod Rex Angliae in arcto positus <UNCLEAR>Pacem</UNCLEAR> fecit cum Rege Philippo</HI>; that is, was constrained to make Peace with him; so that King <HI>Henry</HI> being in this streight, the King of <HI>France,</HI> and Earl <HI>Richard,</HI> with the Barons of his Party, forced King <HI>Henry</HI> to sign what Conditions they pleased; for there it no such Clause so much as mentioned for the <HI>French</HI> Barons.</P>
<P>But make the most of it, it is but a Temporary Relaxation of Allegiance from King <HI>Henry</HI> to his Barons, and the King might surely thus release them if he pleased: But it is plain, they could not have acted thus without this Condi∣tion had been expresly inferred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, supposing King <HI>Henry</HI> to have been never so much constrained to the making of these Conditions, and that it was his own Act that rendred it lawful, it still proves, as much as I urge it for, <HI>viz.</HI> that neither the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> then thought this Resistance absolutely unlawful; for then the King's own Act could never have dispensed with it.</P>
<P>But to shew you farther, that the People of this Nation have ever maintained this Right of Resistance, even with the allowance of our Kings themselves; and for the doing of this, I shall proceed with the earliest Instances of this kind after the Conquest; <HI>viz.</HI> in the Time of King <HI>Richard</HI> the First, during whose absence in the holy Land, he had committed the Government of his Kingdom to <HI>William</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi, R. Hovedens Annal, parte posterior.</HI> 399.</NOTE> who abused his Power by an Arbitrary and Insolent Carriage, affronting and oppressing <HI>Iohn</HI> Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> the King's own Brother, and <HI>Geoffry</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>York,</HI> the King's base Brother, whereupon they rose up against him; and having the Bishops, the Earls and Barons of their side, ap∣pointed the said Bishop a day to answer to his Crimes in the King's Court, or great Council of the Bishops, Lords and Tenants <HI>in Capite,</HI> then called <HI>Curia Regis,</HI> where when he refused to appear, they all with one consent came to <HI>London,</HI> and fought with the Followers and Adherents of the said Chancellour by the way; when they came to Town, Earl <HI>Iohn,</HI> with the Arch-Bishops of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Rouen,</HI> with all the Earls and Barons, together with the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> met in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church-Yard, and there it was proposed, that the said Chancellour should for his Evil Government he deposed and banisht the Kingdom, and so he immediately was by the general Consent of the Common Council of the Kingdom; so that you see the Nobility, Clergy and People, had then no no∣tion of an Irresistible Power in the King; and those put in Commission by him, when they found their Power to grow Tyrannical, and Insupportable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if I forget not, you omit one material Circumstance in this Aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir, which seems to make against you, which is, that Arch-Bishop of <HI>Rouen,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> the Earl <HI>Mareschal</HI> did at that time produce the King's Letters, signed with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, wherein he had appointed that they two should be associated in the Government with the Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> and that he should do nothing without their privity and consents; and of those associated with him in the business of the <UNCLEAR>Kingdom</UNCLEAR>; and that if he offered to do otherwise, he should be deposed: So that it seems what they now acted, was not so muchin opposition to the King's Commission as to the Bishops, who had refused to obey his Commands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess it was as you set forth; yet this makes nothing against my
<PB N="619" REF="333"/>
Opinion; since it is apparent that Arms were taken, and this Resistance made by the <HI>major</HI> part of the Bishops, Earls and Barons, together with the <HI>Londoners,</HI> before ever it was known that such Letters were written by the King: And so it seems they would have done much the same thing if there had been no such Letters sent by the King at all. You may also remem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er that all these proceedings also were approved of, and confirmed by the King himself.</P>
<P>But that I may proceed in my History of Non-Resistance, I come to the Reign of King <HI>Iohn</HI> his Brother, who when he had refused the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and all the Bishops, Earls and Barons of the King∣dom, to confirm the great Charter of King <HI>Henry</HI> the First,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat. Paris, A.D.</HI> 1215. p. 252. <HI>&amp; dein.</HI></NOTE> they, together with the rest of the great Men and People of the King∣dom, of all degrees and conditions, took up Arms, and made a vast Army, resolving never to lay them down, till he had new granted, and confirmed the Charters of Liberties, and Forrests; till at last the King finding himself almost quite forsaken, so that he had scarce five Knights left about him; he was at last forced to meet the said Bishops, Earls, Barons and People at <HI>Runne-Mead,</HI> and there to grant them that great Charter, which has been the Subject of so much discourse between us; so that you see here that the Church of <HI>England</HI> in those Times (if the Bishops and Clergy are the Repre∣sentatives of this Church) had then no notion of this Doctrine of Passi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Obe∣dien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to the King's Absolute Will and Commands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny the matter of fact to be as you say, but yet you may re∣member that the same Author tells us, that the Pope thought the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 166.</NOTE> hardly dealt withal in this matter, so that he gave Audience to the King's Ambassadors concerning the Rebellions, and Injuries, which the Barons of <HI>England</HI> had committed against their King; and that upon a solemn hearing of the whole business, and after a consultation with his Cardinals, he did as Supreme Lord of <HI>Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and,</HI> (after King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Re∣signation of his Crown to him) by his Bull then published make void the said great Charters of Liberties, and Forrests; and condemn all the Barons proceed∣ings, as against their Duty, and Allegiance to the King their Soveraign Lord; so that it seems this was not approved of any where but by the Actors, the Pope thereupon Excommunicating the Barons, and Suspending the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terbury</HI> for joyning with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you will make nothing of this Objection;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 230.</NOTE> for it appears from the same Author, that the Pope had before this Excommunicated the King; and as far as lay in his power, depriv'd him of his Kingdom, and absolved all his Subjects of their Allegiance; so that it is plai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it was not out of any true Principle, or hatred of Rebellion, and Resistance in Subjects, that the Pope had thus acted; but purely to gratifie the King at this juncture of time, and to defend him in his Tyranny▪ and breach of his own Charters, because he was then become his Vassal, and so he cared not how much he oppressed his Subjects, because he was thereby the more able to pay him the Tribute, before promised; and he could also expect the more securely to extort Money from the whole Kingdom: But that this Bull of the Popes was contrary to the King's own Express Act and Agreement, appears plainly by that Clause,

which is still to be found in a Charter under the Seal of this King; and which seems to have been the Heads of the great Charter, (according to which it was drawn into the Form we now find it in <HI>Mat.

<P>I grant the Clause is there as you quote it; yet I much doubt whether it was of any validity, being no doubt drawn up by the Barons then in Arms, and which the King durst not at that time refuse, and so he was indeed under a kind of dures<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when he did it.

<P>I think all this may very easily be solved,: For in the first place, K. <HI>Iohn</HI> was no more compelled to agree to this Clause, than he was to the Charters themselves; and if those were lawful, and reasonable, so was this Resistance too, since there was no other way or means lest to preserve them, in case the King should go from his own Acts, and break through all he had done; so that if the ends were lawful, the means to preserve it must be so too; or else those Charters would have signified nothing any longer than the King pleased: As for the other part of the Objection, that this Resistance was still to be, saving the Person of the King and Queen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that this did not consist with the Ba∣rons, after making War against his Person, and casting off all Allegiance to him: It was not their faults, but the King's, if they could not perform this Agree∣ment, since the King by making War upon the Clergy, Nobility and People, by his open, and notorious breach, and recalling of these Charters, calling in Stran∣gers to his assistance, and declaring he would no longer govern according to Law, had made it absolutely unpracticable to preserve their Allegiance to him any longer; so that they never cast off their duty as Subjects, till he had cast off his duty as a King, and then what was there else left to be done but to pro∣vide for their own safety, by calling in a Forein Prince to their Assistance, as soon as they could? since there was no other way left them to defend them∣selves against those Troops of Strangers the King had invited over; and though many of them with their Captain <HI>Hugh de Boves,</HI> had been cast away, and
<PB N="621" REF="334"/>
drowned in a Tempest at Sea, yet more were daily expected: So that if Ty∣rants should suffer nothing for the breach of their own Charters, and Oaths, they would be in a better condition, by their violation, than the observing of them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or by the making them, they for the present quiet the Minds of their discontented Subjects, and when they please may break them all again, when they have got power, if no body must presume to resist them; or not think them as much Kings when they destroy, and oppress their People, as when they protect, and preserve them by governing according to the Laws of the King∣dom. But pray what have you to say against that general Resistance that was made by almost all the Bishops, Barons, and great Men of <HI>England</HI> against his Son <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, about the frequent and notorious violations of the great Charters which his Father and himself had so often sworn to, and confirmed, and for which he had received such great Benevolences and Subsidies from the Nation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I answer this Question, pray take notice that I am not at all satisfied with your Arguments; that when ever Subjects shall think themselves injured, and oppressed by their Soveraigns, that then they may cast off their Allegiance to them; if they cannot have the Remedy they desire; since this were to make them both Judges and Parties too in their own Cause; which is altogether unjust, and unreasonable, between private Men, much more between Kings and Subjects. But passing by this at present, I shall tell you my Opinion of this Resistance of <HI>Simon Montfort,</HI> and the Earls and Barons his Adherents, that it was down-right Rebellion, and tended only to dethrone the King, and make him a meer Cypher, and to devolve the whole Government upon themselves; as appears by the <HI>Oxford</HI> Provisions recited by so many Authors of that Age; and which were afterwards condemned, (and consequently those violent means by which they were obtained) by <HI>Lewis</HI> the Ninth King of <HI>France,</HI> who in an Assembly of his Estates, upon a solemn hearing of the whole difference between King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, and his Barons, declared these <HI>Oxford</HI> Provisions null, and void. So far was this good and pious King from countenancing any Rebel∣lion (or Resistance, as you term it) of Subjects against their lawful Soveraign.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>For all this, I cannot find that the King of <HI>France</HI> did then at all condemn this defence the Earls and Barons had before made of the Liberties granted them by the great Charters; for tho' he restored the King to his former Power, by avoiding the <HI>Oxford</HI> Provisions, yet at the same time when this was done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 992.</NOTE> (as the Continuator of <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> tells us) he ex∣presly excepted the Ancient Charters of King <HI>Iohn, Vnivers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li [seil. Angliae] concessae,</HI> and from which <HI>per illam sententiam in nullo intendibat pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tus derogare</HI>; and if he did not in the least intend to derogate from them, he could not with any Justice condemn the only means the Barons had to maintain them; after so many Trials, and fresh Promises and Oaths of this fickle inconstant King all broken, and laid aside; so that you may as well or better alledge the Pope's shameful Absolution of this King from this Oath he had made to observe the great Charters, as an Argument why they should not be any longer bound by them, nor the Barons obliged to defend them; as this Sentence of the King of <HI>France</HI> to render the Resistance the Barons had made in defence of the great
<PB N="622" REF="335"/>
Charters to be unlawful: And that King <HI>Henry</HI> himself did afterwards allow this Resistance for good and lawful; Pray see the Agreement which was not long after made in full Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Pat.</HI> 49 <HI>H▪</HI> 3. <HI>M.</HI> 5.</NOTE> in the 49th between the King, the Prince, and all the Prelates, Earls and Barons of <HI>England</HI>; whereby he obliged himself to observe all the Ar∣ticles and Ordinances which had been before agreed upon at <HI>London</HI> in the 48th Year of his Reign: And then follows this Clause in the Record (which the Doctor himself has printed in his Appendix at the end of the first Volume of his Introduction to English History) which I shall here translate out of French, because it is very old and obscure, it is thus:
<Q>And if our Lord the King, or Monsieur <HI>Edward</HI>; (<HI>viz.</HI> the Prince) shall go against the Peace and Ordinance aforesaid, or shall grieve the Earls of <HI>Leicester</HI> or <HI>Gloucester,</HI> or any of their Party by reason of any of the things aforesaid; that then the great Men, and Commons of the Land, (in French <HI>hauz Homes, &amp; Comun de la Terre</HI>) shall rise against them to grieve them to the utmost of their power, and shall be obe∣dient to them in nothing, and in doing all things as if they were bound to them in nothing, until these things shall be amended and maintained according to the Ordinance of the Peace aforesaid; and to this our Lord the King, and Monsieur <HI>Edward,</HI> and the great Men of the Kingdom, have sworn upon the holy Gospels, to keep and maintain the things aforesaid.</Q>
And with this Re∣cord agrees this King's Latine Charter, much to the same pur∣pose recited in the Annals of <HI>Waverly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 217.</NOTE> <HI>An.</HI> 1264. only the words there are more general, that if the King or Prince should break the said Peace by hurting or falling upon any of the said Earls of <HI>Leicester,</HI> or <HI>Gloucester,</HI> or any of the Persons above-mentioned, <HI>Liceat omnibus de Regno nostra contra nos insurgere, &amp; ad gravamen nostrum, opem &amp; operam dare juxta posse, ad quod ex praesenti praecepto nostro omnes &amp; singulos volumus obliga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i, fideliter &amp; homagis nobis, facto non obstante.</HI> So that you see here, that by the Judgment of the King himself, and the whole Parliament, this Resistance might be exercised not∣withstanding the Homage they had done him. And this is that Form of the Peace which I have before cited to you to have been made (as appears by a Writ to the Sheriff of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> to be seen upon the same Roll,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Claus.</HI> 49 <HI>H.</HI> 3. <HI>m.</HI> 5.</NOTE> and in the same Membrane) <HI>unanimi consensu &amp; voluntate nostra, &amp; Edwardi filii nostri Primogeniti, Praelatorum, Comitum, Ba∣ronum, &amp; Communitatis Regni nostri, &amp;c.</HI> which Doctor <HI>Brady</HI> thought fit to conceal, and not publish with the former Record, because the word <HI>Communitas</HI> did not at all suit with his Notions in this place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess this so solemn an Agreement upon the Record would have been very considerable, had it been made, whilst the King and Prince had been free,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R.A. P.</HI> 135. <HI>&amp; dein.</HI></NOTE> and in their own power: whereas the Dr. has made it plainly appear, that the King and Prince were at this time in the power of <HI>Simon Montfort,</HI> and his Adherents, who called that famous Parliament of the 49th, to which we suppose the Commons were first summoned;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> 143.</NOTE> and therefore the Prince was not delivered at this time (any more than the King his Fa∣ther) out of their power, and was only taken out of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle, and made a
<PB N="623" REF="335"/>
Prisoner at large under a Guard (as his Father was) until he made his escape from his Keepers at <HI>Hereford</HI> Castle: So that I do not at all value this Agreement, because made by duress; tho' I confess the words of the Records are express, that it was <HI>de unanimi co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sensu &amp; voluntate nostra, &amp;c. Edwardi Filii nostri.</HI> But it appears plainly, that by this Agreement the King had discharged himself of all Royal Power, and confirmed this Agreement, whereby the whole Government of the Kingdoms, and Nomination of all the great Officers of the Crown was put into the hands of Nine Earls and Barons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>At this rate no Act that a King can do when he hath the worst of it, tho' confirm'd by a Solemn Oath (as this was upon the holy Gospels) can ever be binding; for it is but alledging that it was done by duress, and it is sufficient to render it null and void: But be it as it will, this was certainly the general Consent, Act and Declaration of the whole Nation assembled in Parliament, and that owned by the King himself, and his Son the Prince, and all his Party.
<Q>And farther, that this Resistance of the Earl of <HI>Gloucester</HI> (who was one of these Ba∣rons) was not after counted for Treason, or Rebellion, appears by that Pardon of the said Earl which we have before cited
to have been made by this King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Pat.</HI> 51 <HI>H.</HI> 3. <HI>m.</HI> 161</NOTE> with Assent of the King of <HI>Almaine</HI> (his Brother) and the Counts and Barons, and Com∣mons of the Land, in which he pardoned the said Earl, and all his Company, (and also all the Londoners) all rancour and ill-will; and in the same man∣ner as the King quits and discharges the Earl, and his Company; so does the said Earl hereby for himself, and all his Company, remit to all those that were of the Party of the King, any thing done since that moment (that is, that Civil War in which the Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> had so great a share) so that you see this Resistance of the Earl of <HI>Gloucester</HI> was within two years after the Battle of <HI>Evesham</HI> so far from being looked upon as Rebellion, that the Pardon is made mutual, not only for the Earl, and those that followed him, but also for those that had taken the King's part.</Q></P>
<P>But I shall come now to his Son, and Successor, King <HI>Edward</HI> the First, where we shall find this Doctrine of Resistance asserted more than once, not only by private men, but by the whole Parliament, as appears by those Letters that were written by the King's command or (permis∣sion at least in the 29th of his Reign) in the name of all the Earls,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Mat. Westminist. Anno</HI> 1301. p. 436.</NOTE> Barons, <HI>&amp; tota Communitas Angliae,</HI> to Pope <HI>Boniface</HI> the Eighth, in vindication of the King's Superiority over <HI>Scotland</HI>; to which you will find this remarkable passage, <HI>Nec etiam permit∣timus, nec permittemus, sicut non possumus nec debemus praemissa tam insolita, indebita, &amp; praejudicialia, &amp; alias inaudita, praelibatum Dominum nostrum Regem, etiam si vellet <UNCLEAR>fa∣cere</UNCLEAR>, modo quolibit attemptare</HI>: Which restraint of the King's Will must certainly mean some what more than a bare Remonstrance or Declaration against it; since we have seen in our own Times, Kings make nothing of meer verbal Declarations of the Two Houses of Parliament, if they had a mind to do a thing they thought belonged to their Prerogative, tho' the Parliament declared against it. And to let you farther see that this Doctrine was at this time generally believed, and practised all over <HI>Europe,</HI> you will find almost the same Clause in the Letters
<PB N="624" REF="336"/>
which were written in the Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> the fair King of <HI>France, Anno</HI> 1203. (which falls about the 30th of our King <HI>Edward</HI> the First) and were sent to the same Pope <HI>Boniface,</HI> upon the occasion of his manifold Usurpations upon the Church of <HI>France,</HI> in the name of the whole Clergy of that Kingdom;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prin</HI>'s second Vol. of Pap. Usurpations, p. 954.</NOTE> whereby it not only appears that this was done in a general Assembly of Estates, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Clergy, Barons, <HI>&amp;c. &amp; Communitates Villarum</HI>; but they also there declared, <HI>expressius, viva voce, Quod si praesatus Dominus Rex (quod absit) tolera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l dissimula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e veilet, Ipsi</HI> (scil.

<P>But the Barons and People of <HI>England,</HI> did actually put this Doctrine in Execution, some few years before this Letter, I now mentioned, was writ to the Pope; which transaction I shall give you almost <HI>verbatim</HI> out of <HI>Mat.</HI> of <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI> and <HI>Henry de Keyghton,</HI> in <HI>Anno</HI> 1297. (being the 26th of <HI>Edward</HI> the First) when the King having extorted a great sum of Money from the Clergy, and People, contrary to Law, and being then going into <HI>Flanders,</HI> he called a Par∣liament at <HI>Westminster,</HI> where most of the Earls and Barons refused to appear, until such time as their Petitions for the ease of their Countrey were heard; and that the King would again confirm <HI>Magna Charta</HI>: Yet nevertheless the King upon his confession of his Male Administration, which he made before all the People, with Tears in his Eyes, and promise of amendment, then obtained of the Commons an Aid of the Eighth Penny of their Goods: But as soon as the King was gone over, the Constable, and Earl Mareschal, with other Earls and Barons, went to the Exchequer, and there forbad the Judges to levy the said Tax upon the People by the Sheriffs, because it was done without their know∣ledge, without whose consent no Tax ought to be exacted, or imposed; so that the said Earls and Barons being thus gathered together, and the greater part of the People joyning with them; at last Prince <HI>Edw.</HI> then Lieutenant of the King∣dom, was forced to call a Parliament; to which the Earls and Barons came at∣tended with great multitudes, both of Horse, and Foot, but would not enter the City of <HI>London,</HI> till the Prince had in his Fathers name confirmed the great Charters, and had passed the Statute <HI>de Tallagio non concedendo</HI>; both which were afterwards again confirmed by the King his Father some time after his Return.</P>
<P><Q>And this will serve to explain the last Article in this Statute, which compre∣hends the King's Pardon or Remission to <HI>Humphrey</HI> Earl of <HI>Her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford</HI> and <HI>Ess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x</HI> then Constable, and <HI>Roger Bigot</HI> Earl of <HI>Norfolk</HI> Mareschal of <HI>England</HI> (the two principal Leaders in the late Resistance) with all other Earls, Barons, Knights, and Esquires of their Party, all Leagues and Confederacies; as also all Ran∣cour, and Ill-will, with all other Transgressions against them, <HI>&amp;</HI> And pray see Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI>'s Comment on these words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d Instit. 1. p. 536.</NOTE> you compare our English Histories with this Act of Parliament, the Old saying shall be verified, <HI>That Records of Parliament<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the truest Histories.</HI> The King had conceived a deep displeasure against the Con¦stable, Mareschal, and others of the Nobility, Gentry, and Commons of the

So careful were the Lords and Commons to preserve their Ancient Laws, Liberties, and Customs of their Countrey; so that it is plain that Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> then thought the Lords and Commons had not transgressed in thus standing up, tho' with force of Arms, for their just Rights and Liberties; and which sufficiently proves that this Author did not conceive such a Resistance to be making War against the King, and so Treason at that time at Common Law, and consequently not to be afterwards Treason by the Statute of 25th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third (as you would have it) since that Statute d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es not make any other Overt-acts to be Treason, but what had been so by Common Law before this Statute was made.</Q></P>
<P>But in the Reign of this King's Son <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, there were much more pregnant, and fatal proofs of the exercise of this Right of Resistance by the Earls, Barons, and People of <HI>England</HI> against <HI>Peirce Gaveston,</HI> whom having been before for his Mis-government of the King, banisht the Realm by Act of Parliament, and coming over with the King's License, but without any re∣verse of the said Act; <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> the King's Uncle, with the rest of the Earls, Barons, and Commons of the Land, took up Arms against him: And tho' he raised some Forces by the King's Commission, yet they fought with him, and took him Prisoner, and beheaded him, near <HI>Warwick.</HI> Some years after which the said <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> with <HI>Humphrey de Bohun</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford,</HI> together with divers other Earls and Barons, took Arms, and spoiling the Lands of the two <HI>Spencers,</HI> Father and Son, came up to <HI>London,</HI> where the King had called a Parliament; in which the King was forced to banish the said <HI>Spencers</HI> out of the Kingdom, tho' they quickly returned again; against whom when the said Earls above mentioned, and divers other Barons and Knights again took Arms; but being fail'd by some of their Consederates, were over-power'd by the King's Party, and the Earl being taken Prisoner, was attainted, and beheaded at <HI>Portfract</HI>; yet was the this Judgment against the Earl; and those of his Party afterwards reversed in Parliament, in 1 <HI>mo. Edward</HI> the Third, and their Heirs restored in blood; as also to the Lands of their Fathers; as besides the Act it still to be seen upon the Rolls, appears more plainly by a
<Q>Writ of this King's reciting;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Claus.</HI> 1. <HI>E.</HI> 3. p. 2.</NOTE> that whereas at a Parliament at <HI>Westminster,</HI> among other things it was agreed by the King, the Prelates, Earls, Barons and Commons of the Kingdom, that all those who were in the Quarrel with <HI>Thomas</HI> E. of <HI>Lancaster</HI> against the <HI>Spencers,</HI> should have their Lands and Goods restored, because the said Quarrel was found, and adjudged by the King, and the whole Parliament, to be good and just; and that the Judgments given against them were null and void, and there∣fore
<PB N="626" REF="337"/>
commands restitution of the Lands and Tenements now in the Crown to the Executors of the said Earl; and the like Writs are found for the other Lords and Gentlemen that had been of his Party.</Q></P>
<P>And further, that not only this Resistance made by this Earl, and the rest of his followers, but also that which this King himself made together with Queen <HI>Isabel</HI> his Mother against the Mis-government of the King his Father, through the evil Counsel of the two <HI>Spencers,</HI> appears by the Act of Indemnity passed in the first Year of this King, in the preamble of which there is recited a short History of the wicked Government and Banishment of the <HI>Spencers,</HI> Father and
<Q>Son; and also how <HI>Thomas</HI> late Earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> was by their procurement pur∣sued, taken, executed, disinherited; and how the said <HI>Spencers,</HI> and <HI>Robert Bal∣dock,</HI> and <HI>Edmund</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> by the Royal Power they had usurped, had caused the King that now is, and the Queen his Mother, to be utterly forsaken of the King his Father, and to be Exiled from the Realm of <HI>England</HI>; and that therefore the King that now is, and the Queen his Mother, being in so great Jeopardy in a strange Countrey, and seeing the destructions, and disinherisons which were notoriously done in <HI>England,</HI> upon holy Church, the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and the Commonalty of the same, by the said <HI>Spencers, Robert Baldock,</HI> and <HI>Edmund</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> by the Encroachment of Royal Power to themselves; and seeing they might not remedy the same, unless they came into <HI>England</HI> with an Army of Men of War, and have by the Grace of God with such puissance, and the help of the great Men and Commons of the Realm vanquished and de∣stroyed the said <HI>Spencers, &amp;c.</HI> therefore our Soveraign Lord the King, by the Common Council of the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other great Men, and of the Commons of the Realm have provided, and ordained <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as follows; That no great Man, nor other of what Estate, Dignity or Condition soever he be, that came in with the said King, that now is, and with the Queen in Aid of them, to pursue their said Enemies, and in which pursuit the King his Father was ta∣ken and put in Ward, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shall be impeached, molested or grieved in person, or in goods, in any of the King's Courts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the pursuit, and taking in hold the body of the said King <HI>Edward,</HI> nor for the pursuit of any other persons, not taking their goods, nor for the death of any Man, nor any other things perpe∣trated, or committed in the said pursuit, from the day of the King and Queens Arrival, until the day of the Coronation of the said King.</Q></P>
<P>This Act of Indemnity is so full a Justification of the necessity, and lawfulness of the Resistance that was then made against King <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, and his wicked Councellors the <HI>Spencers,</HI> that it needs no Comment: And tho' King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third took warning by the example of his Father, and was too wise then to follow the like Arbitrary Courses; yet <HI>Richard</HI> the Second his Grand∣son, being a wilful, hot headed young Prince, fell into all the Errours of his great Grand-father, and found the like, if not greater Resistance from his No∣bility and People; for when he had highly mis-governed the Realm by the Advice of his favourites, <HI>Alexander</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>York,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and others; a Parliament being called in the 10th Year of his Reign, the Govern∣ment of the Kingdom was taken out of their hands, and committed to the Bishops of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Ely,</HI> with <HI>Thomas</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> the King's Uncle, <HI>Richard</HI>
<PB N="627" REF="337"/>
Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and nine or ten other Lords and Bishops; but notwithstanding this, the King being newly of Age, refused to be governed by the said Duke, and Earls, but was carried about the Kingdom by the said Duke of <HI>Ireland</HI> and others, to try what Forces they could raise, and al∣so to hinder the said Duke and Earls from having any Access to him: But see what followed these violent, and arbitrary courses, as it is related by <HI>Henry de Knighton,</HI> who lived and wrote in that very time, and is more exact in this King's Reign than any other Historian;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 2697.</NOTE> he there tells us,
<Q>that when <HI>Thomas</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and the other Bishops and Earls now mentioned, sound they could not proceed in the Government of the King and Kingdom, according to the Ordinance of the preceding Parlia∣ment, through the hinderance of <HI>Mich. de la Poole, Robert de <UNCLEAR>Vere</UNCLEAR>,</HI> Duke of <HI>Ire∣land, Nich. Brembar,</HI> and <HI>Robert Tresillian</HI> Chief Justice, and others, who had se∣duced the King, and made him alienate himself from the Council of the said Lords, to the great damage of the Kingdom; whereupon the said Duke of <HI>Glou∣cester,</HI> and the Lords aforesaid, with a great Guard of Knights, Esquires, and Archers, came up towards <HI>London,</HI> and quartered in the Villages adjacent; and then the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the Lord <HI><UNCLEAR>Lovat</UNCLEAR>,</HI> the Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> the Lord <HI>Eures,</HI> with others, went to the King in the name of the the Duke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> 2700.</NOTE> and Earls, and demanded all the persons above-men∣tioned to be banished as Seducers, and Traitors to the King; and all the Lords then swore upon the Cross of the said Arch-Bishop, not to desist till they had obtained what they came for; the conclusion of this Meeting was, that the King not being able to withstand them, was forced immediately to call that remarkable Parliament of the 11th Year of his Reign, in which <HI>Mich. de la Poole,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Ireland</HI> were attainted, and <HI>Tresillian,</HI> and divers other Judges sentenced to be hanged at <HI>Tyburn</HI> upon the Impeachment of the said Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> for delivering their Opinions contrary to Law, and the Articles the King had not long before proposed to them at <HI>Nottingham.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I shall omit the Resistance which <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> made after his Ar∣rival by the Assistance of the Nobility and People of the North of <HI>England</HI> against the Arbitrary Government of this King, being then in <HI>Ireland</HI>; not only because it is notoriously known, but because it was carried on farther than perhaps it needed to have been, and ended in the Deposition of this King. Only in the first Year of <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th, there was the same Act of Indemnity almost word for word, passed for all those that had come over with that King, and had as∣sisted him against <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, and his evil Councellors, as was passed be∣fore in <HI>primo</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third. I shall not also insist upon the Resistance of <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th, who took up Arms against the Evil Government of the Queen and her Minion the Duke of <HI>Suffolk</HI>: because you may say, that this was justifiable by the Duke of <HI>York</HI> as right Heir of the Crown; nor will I instance in the Resistance made by the Two Houses of Parliament, during the late Civil Wars in the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, since it is disputed to this day, who was in the fault, and began this Civil War, whether the King or the Parliament: Only thus much I cannot omit to take
<PB N="628" REF="338"/>
notice of, that the King in none of his Declarations ever denied but that the People had a right to Resist him in case he had made War upon them, or had introduced Arbitrary Government, and expresly owned in his Answer to one of the Parliaments Messages, that they had a sufficient power to restrain Ty∣ranny, but denied himself to be guilty of it; and still asserted that he took up Arms in defence of his just Right and Prerogative, to the Command of the <HI>Militia</HI> of the Kingdom, which they went about to take from him by force.</P>

<P>I have with the greater patience hearkened to your History of Re∣sistance in all the Kings Reigns you have mentioned, because I cannot desire any better Argument to prove the unlawfulness of such Resistance, than those Acts of Pardon, and Indemnity: You cannot but confess, have still followed it even when the Barons proved most fortunate, as in that of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, to the Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and those of his Party; and that of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, to the Constable and Mareschal, and their followers; nay, after the former Kings had been unjustly deposed, we still find the Actors and Complices of such wicked Actions, did not think themselves safe till they had an Act of Indemnity passed to them, of all the Robberies and Murders they had committed in the War, as your self have recited in the two Acts of Parliament in the Reigns of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth. Now if these Resistances had not been downright Rebellions in the Eye of the Law, to what purpose were these Acts of Indemnity passed, since no man needs a Pardon, but rather merits a Reward for defending the Government Establisht according to Law?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>In answer to this Objection (for which I am already prepared, since I foresaw you might make it) pray give me leave to ask you whether you can find the words Treason, Rebellion, Robbery, or Murder, in any of these Acts of Pardon? and if you cannot, whether you think Treason, or Murder, could be pardon'd by general words or not; and the reason why I ask this Question, is, because if they could not, then the consequence will be, that none of these Par∣liaments supposed that the Resistance that had been made, or all the other Acts performed in pursuance of such Resistance, were looked upon by those that had done them, no nor by the Parliament it self, to be Treason, Rebellion, or Murder, since certainly those that were Actors in such Resistances, and taking up of Arms, having the power in their hands, would not have fail'd to have had those words inserted into those Acts of Indemnity, if they had supposed them∣selves guilty of those Crimes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say that the words Treason, and Rebellion, or Murder, are expresly mentioned in these Statutes, since even the Actors in them did not think it for their Credits to own themselves to have been guilty of any such Crimes; yet all the particular words and expressions in these Acts amount to the very same thing, for the taking up Arms with one that is not King, against him that is, &amp; the actually seizing upon his Person, and keeping him in hold, was Treason at Common Law before the Statute of the 25th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third; and is not taking mens Goods by force, and destroying their Persons in time of Peace, Rebellion, and Murder at Common Law? So that if these were the Facts, they had been guilty of; and if these Acts were Treason, Rebellion, Robbery, and Murder, then certainly all Treasons, Rebellions, Robberies and Murders
<PB N="629" REF="338"/>
are likewise pardoned by those Statutes: And tho' 'tis true, the Law is now, that no pardon of Treason or Murder shall be good, unless those Offences are particularly named;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stat. 2. chap. 1.</NOTE> yet this was so ordained by the Statute of the 13th of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, by which it is particularly provided, that no pardon shall be allowed before any Justice for the death of a Man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Treason, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unless the same Murder, Treason, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be specified in the said Charter, before which Statute Sir <HI>Ed∣ward Coke</HI> in his second Instit. tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 236.</NOTE> that by the pardon of all Felonies, Treason was pardoned, and so was Murder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny but that these Facts you mention were Treason, in strict∣ness of Law, before the making that Statute; yet does it not follow that even these may be in some cases justifiable (as well as binding a King, when he is out of his Wits) if the publick Peace of the Kingdom, and preservation of the Go∣vernment according to the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom require it: Thus for example; suppose King <HI>Iohn,</HI> after he had made actual War upon his Barons and People, had happened to have his Forces routed in the Field, can any one believe that it had been unlawful for them to have secured his Person to prevent his making a new War upon them? and yet this by the Letter of the Law had been Treason. Now there are many actions, which in strictness of Law are Treason, yet being for the publick defence and security of the Nation, deserve a pardon of course: Thus if Forein Enemies should Land in <HI>England,</HI> and a Neighbouring Nobleman or Gentleman, who has no Command over the <HI>Militia</HI> of the Countrey, should raise on the sudden such a Force of his Tenants and Neighbours, as were sufficient to make ahead against them till the <HI>Militia</HI> of the Countrey could come in to their Assistance; tho' this taking up of Arms with∣out an Express Commission for it, be a high Misdemeanour; (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay Treason, ac∣cording to your Principles) yet I suppose you will not deny but that the persons engaged in it, do not only deserve pardon, but thanks for their Courage, and so speedy Assistance of the Government. And I remember I have read a fa∣mous Instance of this kind, that when the Traytors concerned in the Powder-Plot found themselves discovered, they fled into <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> and thence in∣to <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> and were pursued and taken by the High Sheriff of that County in <HI>Staffordshire</HI>; which tho' a great Misdemeanour, since no Sheriff can justifie carrying the <HI>Posse Comitatus</HI> out of the County; yet this was so well taken▪ that King <HI>Iames</HI> the First rewarded him, and (as I take it) Knighted him for his pains.</P>
<P>But to apply this to the matter in dispute, tho' it is true, taking, and impri∣soning the King's Person is Treason in the Eye of the Law; yet (as in the case of <HI>Edward</HI> the Second) if the Government could not be restored to its pristine State without that extremity, it must, and will ever deserve a pardon; and therefore you see the Parliament in the first of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, not only par∣dons, but justifies the doing of it, because done for that end.
<Q>So likewise the Statute of the 11th of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, Chap. 1. not only indemnifies, but justifies the Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> the Earls, Lords, and all others of his Party, for taking up Arms against the persons above-mentioned, tho' maintain'd and back'd by the King himself, as being done for the weal, and safeguard of the King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="630" REF="339"/>
the maintenance of the Crown, and Salvation of the Realm:</Q>
So much for the Point of making War against the King, and imprisoning his Person; so that if taking up Arms for the safeguard of the King, and Salvation of the Kingdom, were just, and necessary to be done, the consequences of it, <HI>viz.</HI> the taking of mens Goods, and killing of these that resist them, cannot be Robbery, or Mur∣der, because done in a State of War; which can never be carried on without such Acts of Hostility: And therefore you see in the Act of Pardon to the Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and to the <HI>Londoners</HI> granted in Parliament of the 51th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third (which I have now cited) those that took part with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King are as ex∣presly pardoned, as those that were with the Earl; and in the like pardon to the Constable and Mareschal in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the First (which I now also quoted) those Lords would not own they had transgressed; but the words are only, <HI>etiam transgressiones si quas fecerit:</HI> So that since such Reformations could not be brought about without violence and blood-shed; and some Irregularities, which in times of Peace could not be justified by the strict Letter of the Law, it was but reason, that for the quieting of mens minds, and their future security, they should be indemnified for what they had done with so good an intent, and for the common good of the Kingdom: But that such Acts of Pardon do not relate to the Titles such Kings had to the Crown, but only to their being Kings in the Eye of the Law, appears by a like Act of Pardon passed in Parliament in the first of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh to pardon, and save harmless all those that came over with the King, and all that helped him to recover his just Right to the Kingdom against King <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, there called, <HI>that Vsurper:</HI> So that you may see such Acts of Pardon do not concern the just Titles of Princes, nor the Justice of the War, but are to quiet mens minds under the new Government; whereas those that took part with the Usurper, were not pardoned, but left to the Law, since the present Government would not take care for their security that had obstructed its settlement. So the Act of Oblivion of the second of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, tho' it pardons Treasons expresly, yet it as well pardons the Treasons of them that had Commissions from King <HI>Charles</HI> the First or Se∣cond, as well as those that acted by Commissions from other pretended Autho∣rities: So that you see in the Judgment of this so modern a Parliament, men might be supposed to be guilty of Treason, tho' they had taken part with the King, and had acted by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Commission, if the things commanded were il∣legal.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have taken a great deal of pains to justifie taking up Arms against, nay, Imprisonment of our Kings, when that which you call the preser∣vation of the Government requires it; that is, when there is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>action in the Kingdom strong enough to make a disturbance; for it was very well said by <HI>Tacitus</HI> in the speech he makes for <HI>Otho</HI> to the Souldiers, to take up Arms, and kill <HI>Galba,</HI> then Emperour, that it was in vain to speak more for the justifica∣tion of that Action; <HI>quod Laudari non potest nisi peractum</HI>: Treasons, if successful, have never wanted a sufficient Party in the Nation to make up a Parliament to countenance them, and to pardon, nay justifie all those that have been Actors in them; as we may see by those Acts of Indemnity you mention; and there∣fore I am not the more convinced, that such Resistance was lawful, notwithstand∣ing
<PB N="631" REF="339"/>
those specious Declarations of Parliament, of their being made for the pub∣lick good, and preservation of the King and Kingdom.</P>
<P>But you have done very warily to pass by without any Justification, the Deposition of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, as also, that of the Resistance (as you call it) of <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> against King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second; as also his Deposition, tho' done in Parliament; since all the proceedings against this King were repeal'd in Parliament, in the first of <HI>Edward</HI> the 4th, as appears by the Parliament Rolls of that King's Reign, wherein the taking up Arms against King <HI>Richard</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> is said to be done contrary to his Faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Parl.</HI> 1 <HI>Ed.</HI> 4. <HI>m.</HI> 9. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> and Legiance, and his taking the Crown called Usurpation, and the killing of King <HI>Richard</HI> his Soveraign Lord, termed (as it justly deserved) Murder▪ and Tyranny, which does (tho' not directly, yet) by consequence, condemn his De∣position too, since he is after that here called King; and you do as warily pass by the late Rebellious War of the Long Parliament against King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, as also his horrid Murder before his own Gates; because you know cry well, that this Doctrine of Resistance seldom stops with a bare Refor∣mation of what is amiss; but commonly ends with the Murder, or Deposition of the King, or else driving him from his Throne, as we now find it by woful ex∣perience in the Person of our Unfortunate King, who was so lately forced to quit this Kingdom for the security of his Person; and therefore to put an end to this part of the Dispute, the Parliament of the 13th of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se∣cond were so sensible of the great Mischiefs that attended this Rebellious Do∣ctrine, as having been the destruction of one of the best Princes that ever Reign∣ed, and the occasion of the loss of so many brave Men; besides the ruine of so many great and Noble Families, that they were resolved to do their utmost to prevent it for the future; and therefore the King and Parliament in the 13th and 14th of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, passed those remarkable Acts concerning the Settlement of the <HI>Militia</HI> in the King and his Successors, to take away all dispute about it, tho' they declare it to have been his Ancient Right; and there∣fore to take away all pretence for taking up Arms either by the Two Houses of Parliament, or any other person whatsoever; they, in preamble to both these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. Chap. 6.</NOTE> that these Acts thus expresly declare,
<Q>Forasmuch as within all His Majesties Realms and Dominions the sole Su∣preme Government, Command and Disposition of the <HI>Militia,</HI> and of all Forces by Sea and Land, and of all Forts and Places of Strength is, and by the Law of <HI>England</HI> over was the undoubted Right of His Majesties and His Royal Predecessors, King and Queens of <HI>England</HI>; and that both, or either Houses of Parliament cannot, nor ought to pretend to the same, nor can law∣fully raise, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evy War offensive or defensive, against His Majesty, His Heirs▪ or Lawful Successors; and yet the contrary hereof hath of late been practised almost to the ruine and destruction of this Kingdom; and during the late Usurped Governments, many Evil and Rebellious Principles have been distil∣led into the minds of the People of this Kingdom, which unless prevented, may break <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth to the disturbance of the <HI>Peace</HI> and Quiet thereof, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And in pursuance of this Statute, it was likewise ordained by the Authority
<PB N="632" REF="340"/>
aforesaid, in the 2d Statute for the <HI>Militia</HI> in the 14th year of the same King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 3d.</NOTE> wherein not only the same preamble is recited <HI>verbatim,</HI> as before in the former Statute, but it is also Enacted,
<Q>That no person, (no not a Peer of the Realm) shall be capable of acting as Lieutenant, Deputy Lieutenant, Officer, or Souldier, by vertue of this Act, unless after the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy they take this Oath fol∣lowing; <HI>viz.</HI> I <HI>A. B.</HI> do declare and believe, that it is not lawful upon any pretence whatsoever, to take Arms against the King; and that I do abhor that Traitors Position, that Arms may be taken by his Authority against his Person, or against those that are Commissioned by him in pursuance of such Military Commissions; and it is also to be noted, that all Mayors of Cities, or other Corporations, were obliged by a former Statute of the 13th of this King to take the same Oath:</Q>
From both which Statutes, and Declaration, we may draw these Conclusions; First, That the <HI>Militia</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Command of all Military Forces and War-like Affairs) are declared to be wholly in the King. Secondly, That either, or both Houses of Parliament cannot make any War offensive or defensive against him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Pray mark that. Thirdly, That the contrary pra∣ctice hath tended almost to the destruction of this Kingdom, and that many evil and Rebellious Principles (whereof this without doubt is intended for the chief) have been instilled into the minds of the People, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And lastly, That in pursuance thereof, all persons above-mentioned were not only obliged to re∣nounce taking up Arms against the King upon any pretence whatsoever; but also against any that shall be authoriz'd by the King's Military Commissions, without any Exceptions. And it is farther Enacted, That all Clergy-men should be obliged to take this Oath as well as the Laity; and it is likewise there or∣dained, That all Clergy-men who were to enjoy any Livings or Preferments in the Church, were likewise for the space of Twenty Years next ensuing, ob∣liged to subscribe this Declaration; so that it is no wonder if the Loyal Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> think themselves not only tied by the Express Rules of Scripture, but also by the Laws of the Land, strictly to observe this great Law of Passive Obedience, and Non-Resistance: Now pray see here the Doctrine of Non-Resistance in its full amplitude;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iov.</HI> p. 219.</NOTE> yea, this very Doctrine declared to be the Law of this Kingdom, and that by two express Acts of Parliament. And can you think the Two Houses were not in earnest when they made this Declaration; surely had they not been so, they had been very ridiculous to jest with all our Laws and Liberties, had they not been, I say, verily perswaded of the truth of this Doctrine by Law as well as by Scripture: So that I hope you must now be forced to confess, that even our own Representatives have solemnly renounc'd for themselves and the whole Nation, all right of Resistance, so much as defensive, against those Commissioned by the King, upon any pretence or occasion whatsoever; and we have left us nothing whereby to defend our selves against our Kings, or those Commissioned by them (no not if they never so much abuse their power) but the old Primi∣tive Artillery of <HI>Preces,</HI> and <HI>Lachryma.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for what you have more than once said, that this Doctrine of Re∣sistance, if carried home, always ends in the Deposition▪ and Murder of the
<PB N="633" REF="340"/>
King, tho' it hath I grant sometimes happened, yet that has not been always so, but most often to the contrary, as appears in those Resistances that were made in the Reigns of King <HI>Richard</HI> the First, <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, <HI>Edward</HI> the First, and divers times in <HI>Edward,</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the Second's Reign, before things were driven to that extremity, as they afterwards were; and as I will not justifie the Deposition of those Princes, tho' done by Parliament, yet will I not absolutely condemn them, since no Act of Parliament hath, as I know, ever done it: And tho' it is true, all the proceedings in Parliament against <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, are taken off the Rolls, yet was it not done by Order of Parliament, but by <HI>Richard</HI> the 2d alone, when he by his exorbitant courses feared to be served after the same manner; but that there was in those times some Ancient Law extant, which was also destroyed by that King, appears by that remarkable Declaration of the Lords and Commons in Parliament, sent by way of Message to the King (then wilfully absenting himself from the Parliament) by the Duke of <HI>Gloucester</HI> his Uncle, and the Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> who sure were too great to tell so notorious a Lye:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 2683.</NOTE> The Speech you will find at large in <HI>Knyghton,</HI> beginning thus; <HI>Domine R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x.</HI> And after many Petitions, and good Advices, at last thus concludes; which I shall give you in Latine,—<HI>Sed &amp; unum aeliud: de animo nostro superest nobis ex parte Populi vestri vobis intimare, habint enim ex antiquo Statuto, &amp; de facto non longe retroactis temporibus experienter quod dolendum est habito, si Rex maligno Consilio quocunque, vel inepta con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>macia aut contemptu, seu protervae voluntate singulari, aut quovis modo irregulari se alienaverit à Populo suo, nec voluerit per jura Regni, &amp; Statuta, &amp; laudabiles Ordinationes cum salubri Consilio Dominorum, &amp; Procerum Regni, gubernari, &amp; regulari, sed captios<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in suis in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anis Confiliis propriam voluntatem suam singularem proterve exercere, tunc lici∣tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> est iis cum com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uni assensu Populi Regni, ipsum Regem de Regali solio abrogare &amp; propinquiorem aliquem de stirpe Regis loco ejus in Regni solio sublimare.</HI></P>
<P>From whence you may observe, that the Lords here relate to an Ancient Statute or Law then in being, tho' the execution of it on the person of his great Grand-father <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, was but of times not long passed; and that King <HI>Richard</HI> might as well destroy the Record of that Law, being not then commonly known, or in private mens hands, as well as he did divers other Records, as appears in the 24th Article against this King, wherein it is set forth,
<Q>That the said King had caused the Rolls of the Records touching the State, and Government of this Kingdom to be defaced and razed, to the great prejudice of his People, and the disinherison of the said Realm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
So that nothing is more certain, than that the Two Houses of Parliament, at that time, did look upon it as their undoubted right to Depose the King in case he violated the Fun∣damental Laws and Constitutions of the Kingdom; tho' how this could consist with that Power which the King then exercised, of calling and dissolving Parlia∣ments at his pleasure, I do not understand, since it can never be supposed that a King, if in full power, would permit a Parliament, called in his name to sit, to Depose himself for Evil Government.</P>
<P>As for the Resistance made by the Two Houses against King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, I shall not undertake to justifie, for the Reasons already given; as also because it it was not a <HI>War</HI> undertaken by the general consent of the whole Kingdom, but
<PB N="634" REF="341"/>
carried on chiefly by the Puritan or Presbyterian Party: For tho' the City of <HI>London,</HI> and many other great Towns were for the Parliament; yet it is also certain, that the <HI>major</HI> part of the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>England</HI> fought for the King, and were so considerable a number, as to make an Anti-Parliament at <HI>Oxford</HI>; so that this War could never have happened, had not the King parted with the power of disobeying of the Parliament out of his hands; much less will I justifie the Murder of this King, or of any others above-mentioned, as be∣ing no necessary consequences of that Resistance I only allow for lawful, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the whole or <HI>major</HI> part of the Nation; nor were <HI>Edw.</HI> the Second, or <HI>Richard</HI> the Second put to death by any Act or Order of Parliament, but were murdered In Prison; and the Murderers of <HI>Edward</HI> the Second were afterwards attainted by Act of Parliament, and Executed as they deserved: But as for the Murder of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, it is not to be taken into this account, it being not done by the Authority of the Lords and Commons in Parliament, but by a Factious Rump or Fag-End of the House of Commons, who fate by the power of the Army; after far the <HI>major</HI> part of the Members who were for the King were shut out of doors, and the Lords Voted useless and dangerous.</P>

<P>I confess you have made as good an Apology for these Actions as the matter will bear; but that neither of the Two Houses can at this day have any Coercive Power over the King, or to call him to an account for any thing he has done, appears by the express Declaration of both Houses in the Statute of the 12th of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, as also in those but now cited, in which they utterly disclaim all making War, whether offensive or defensive against His Majesty; much less can he be subject to any other Coercive or Vindictive Power, or ought any ways to be resisted by private persons; therefore supposing I should grant (as I do not) that the Parliaments had formerly a power of De∣posing of their Kings, or that the Clergy, Nobility and People had formerly a right of taking up Arms against the King in case of notorious Tyranny, and Mis∣government; yet is all such Resistance expresly renounced, and declared unlaw∣ful by the Oath and Declarations now cited; so that tho' in the dark Times of Po∣pery such Resistance might be counted lawful, not only by Laity, but also by the Bishops and Clergy, who ought to have taught the people better Doctrine; yet I think it had been much better for the Nation to have endur'd the worst that could have happen'd from the Tyranny of Kings, than to have transgrest the Rules of the Gospel, and the constant Doctrine of the Primitive Church by Re∣sistance, and Rebellion against the Supreme Power of the Nation.</P>

<P>I shall not now maintain that the Two Houses of Parliament have any Authority at this day to Depose the King, or maintain a War against him, upon any account; yet that they have still a power to judge of the King's Actions, whe∣ther consonant to Law or not, and whether he has not broke the Fundamental Constitutions of the Kingdom, is no where given up, as I know of: But that Re∣sistance in some cases is not contrary to the Doctrine of the Gospel, I have already proved, and that it was not directly contrary to the Laws of the Land before these Statutes, you do partly grant. But since the main strength of your Cause, lies in this Oath appointed by these Acts of Parliament, therefore if I can give a satisfactory Account of the true meaning and sense of these Acts, to be

otherwise than you suppose, I hope you will grant that Resistance may still be lawfully made by the whole body of the people in the Cases I have now put, against any persons, who under colour and pretence of the King's Commission should violently assault their persons in the free exercise of their Religion, as it is by Law Established, or should go about to Invade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Just Liber∣ties, and Properties, which the Fundamental Laws of <HI>England</HI> have conferr'd up∣on every Free-born Subject of it.</P>
<P>And in order to the clearer proof of this, I shall make use of this Method: I shall first explain the Terms of this Declaration, and then I shall proceed to shew you that in a legal sense all Defensive Arms, or Resistance of the King's Person in some cases, or of those Commissioned by him is not forbidden, nor in∣tended to be forbid by these Statutes and Declarations: First then; By taking Arms against the King, is certainly meant no more than making War against the King, according to the Statute of the 25th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, which de∣clares making War against the King to be Treason, and this is unlawful upon any pretence whatsoever. Secondly, The Clause by his Authority against his Person, is only to be understood of the King's Legal Authority; and by his Person is meant his Natural, and Politick Person when acting together, for the same ends, as I shall shew you by and by: So that both these Statutes are but de∣claratory of the Ancient Common Law of <HI>England</HI> against taking up Arms, and making War against the King, and do not introduce any new Law con∣cerning this matter; so that whatever was Treason by the Statute of the 25th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, is Treason by these Statutes, and no more; <HI>viz.</HI> all taking up Arms, or actual making War against the King in order to kill, depose, or im∣prison him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> shews us in his third Institut. in his Notes upon this Statute; yet notwithstanding after this Statute of the 25th of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the Clergy, Nobility and People of <HI>England</HI> assembled in Parliament, did suppose it still lawful to take up Arms against those illegally Commissioned by the King in case of notorious Misgovernment and breach of the Fundamental Laws of the Nation, as appears by that general Resistance made by reason of the evil Government of the Duke of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and those concerned with him, in the 11th of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, which, as I have already proved, was allowed for lawful by Act of Parliament, and consequently by the King's own consent, without which it could never have been so declared: The like I may say for that Resistance which was made in King <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth's Reign by <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Graston</HI>'s Chronicle, p. 627.</NOTE> and the Earls and Barons of his Party agaist the Evil Government of the Queen, and the Duke of <HI>Sommerset,</HI> who governed all Affairs in an Arbitrary, and yet unsuccessful manner, by reason of the easiness and weakness of King <HI>Henry</HI>: But tho' this Resistance was also approved of in the next Parlia∣ment of the 33d Year of this King, yet I shall not so much insist upon it, because I know you will alledge that this was made by the lawful Heir of the Crown against an Usurper, since the Crown was not long after adjudged to be his right, tho' King <HI>Henry</HI> was allowed to wear it during his life; yet however it shews the Opinion of the Clergy, Nobility and People of <HI>England</HI> at that time concerning the lawfulness of such Resistance, before this Declaration of the Estates of the
<PB N="636" REF="342"/>
Kingdom concerning the Legality of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Title was made in the Parliament above-mentioned.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the Parliament by these Statutes of the 13th of <HI>Charles</HI> the Se∣cond for the <HI>Militia,</HI> never intended thereby to enable, or leave it in the power of that King or his Successors, to make this Kingdom an absolute Despotick Mo∣narchy instead of a limited one, as they must have done, had they declared that the King, and those Commissioned by him, might do what they pleased with the Religion, Lives, Liberties, and Estates of the People of this Nation, and that it was Treason to resist in any case whatsoever; sure they could not but re∣member that Commission of Sir <HI>Phelim Oneals,</HI> in the year—41. whereby he pretended to be impowered, to drive the English Protestants out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to set up the Popish Religion in that Kingdom, and restore the Irish to their Estates; and sure divers of them could not be unmindful that this was to give away all right of Self-defence in case any future King should by his own innate Tyrannical Temper, or the evil Counsel of wicked men be perswaded to use Force upon the persons of the Lords and Commons, either whilst they were actually sitting, or in their passage to the New Houses, since by this Act or Oath, if understood in your sense, they must have barred themselves, and the whole Nation, of all right of Self-defence, in any case whatsoever, tho' of the greatest extremity; and therefore I doubt not, but the intent of this Parliament was to leave things as they found them; and as it was absolutely unlawful for the People of this Nation to take up Arms against the King, so it is also as unlawful in him, or those Commissioned by him, to make War upon the People, or to disseize them by force of their Religion, just Rights, Liberties or Estates; and if the King hath a right to defend himself, and his Crown and Dignity against Rebel∣lion, so must the People of this Nation have a right likewise to defend them∣selves against Arbitrary Power, in case of an Invasion of any of the Fundamental Rights above-mentioned; or else all bounds between a Limited and Despotick Power will be quite taken away, and the King may make himself as absolute as the King of <HI>France,</HI> or great Turk whenever he pleases.</P>

<P>I will not dispute with you about bare matter of fact, or that a prevailing Faction might not in turbulent times, and during the Reigns of weak and ill ad∣vised Princes, take upon them by force of Arms to remove Evil Counsellors, and to put the Government of the Kingdom in what hands they pleased, and then procure Acts of Parliament to indemnifie themselves for so doing; yet I cannot allow that even such Acts could make it lawful to take up Arms against the King, or those Commissioned by him, upon any pretence whatsoever: So that tho' I grant that the intent of this Parliament of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, was not to make any new Law against Resistance, or taking up Arms against the King, yet was it their design so to explain the Ancient Statute of the 25th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, that none should for the future doubt in the least, that all taking up Arms, or Resistance of the King, or those Commissioned by him, upon any pretence whatsoever, was unlawful and treasonable; and for this we need go no farther than the very words of these Declarations, which the Parliaments of the 12th and 13th of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second have made concerning this matter; as first, in the Statute of the 12th of <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 30. for attainting the Regicides, that two
<PB N="637" REF="342"/>
Houses of Parliament expresly declared,
<Q>That by the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, neither the Peers of this Realm, nor the Commons, nor both toge∣ther in Parliament, nor the People collectively, or representatively, nor any other persons whatsoever, ever had, hath, or ought to have any Coercive Power over the persons of the Kings of this Realm:</Q>
Whereby not only all the Traiterous Examples of the Depositions, and Imprisonments of King <HI>Edward,</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, are expresly condemned, but also all taking Arms to force the King to redress our grievances, whether he will or not: And farther, that all Arms, whether offensive or defensive, are expresly forbid.
<Q>Pray mind that Clause in the Preamble to these Acts of the <HI>Militia</HI> I now mentioned, where∣in that Parliament expresly renounces all taking up Arms, as well defensive as offensive, against the King; and the words of the Oath it self are yet more strict, that it is not lawful upon any pretence whatsoever, to take up Arms against the King:</Q>
Now can any thing be plainer than that all defensive Arms, tho' for our Religion, Lives and Liberties, or whatsoever else you please, are expresly declared to be against the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>But as for the dreadful consequences of this Law, if never so strictly taken, they are not so bad as you are pleased to fancy; for as to your instance of Sir <HI>Phelim Oneal</HI>'s pretended Commission from King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, you may be very well satisfied, that it was a notorious piece of forgery, since besides that good King's constant denial of any such Commission granted by him, Sir <HI>Phelim,</HI> when he came to suffer in <HI>Ireland,</HI> for raising that horrid Rebellion, did voluntarily at the Gallows acknowledge, that he had forged it himself, by putting the Seal of an old Patent which he had by him to that pretended Commission you now mention: Nor in∣deed can it ever enter into my head, that any King should grant a Commission to destroy or make War upon his People as long as they continue in their duty to him, tho' of a different Religion from himself; tho' perhaps he may think fit for some reasons, to disarm them, or deny them the publick Exercise of their Religion, or render them uncapable of bearing any Offices of publick Trust in the Kingdom; but if these should be lawful Causes of Resistance, why the Papists should not be allowed it as well as the Protestants, I can see no reason to the con∣trary. As for your other Instance, that the Parliament by renouncing all de∣fensive Arms, must be supposed likewise to give up all right of Self-defence in case the King, or any Commissioned by him should use any violence to the per∣sons of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, or in going thither, this is so unlikely, and remote a case, that it hardly comes under the considera∣tion of a bare possibility: But however, let the worst that can be happen, I am very well satisfied that the Parliament was then so thoroughly convinced of the Mischiefs had befallen this Nation by this Republican Doctrine of Resistance, ha∣ving been the cause of the destruction of the best Constituted Church and Go∣vernment in the World; as also of the murder of one of the best Princes that ever Reigned, that they were resolved rather to trust to the Coronation Oaths, and innate goodness of our present and future Kings, than to suppose any War could be lawfully made against them, upon any account whatsoever, which would have been expresly contrary not only to the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but the known Laws of the Land.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not deny but the persons of the Kings and Queens of this Realm, are, and ought to be sacred, and inviolable, and yet no man will therefore say, that they are irresistible too in all cases whatsoever; as if the King (for example) should attempt to ravish Women, or rob, or murder men upon the High-way, or in the Streets, as the Ancient Historians relate of <HI>Nero</HI> and <HI>Commodus</HI> the Em∣perours, and as is reported of the last King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and which was one of the reasons of the Estates of the Kingdom removing him from the Government: And as our <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth is related by our Historians to have robbed Men up∣on the High-way before he was King; so if he had gone about to continue the same frollick after he came to the Crown; I do believe his Person, and all those that Robbed by his Commission, had not been irresistible; nor would it have been Treason within the Statute of the 25th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, tho' he was then actually King, any more than it would have been Treason had the like happened when he was Prince, tho' he was expresly with∣in that Statute, and yet this would not have contradicted the Parliament<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Declaration in the 12th of <HI>Car.</HI> the 2d. That neither the Parliament nor the People having Coercive Power over the persons of the Kings of this Realm; since by Coercive Power must be here understood, his being subject to the pe∣nalties of the Law, or being called to an account by any ordinary Jurisdiction; but there is a vast difference between that, and Resistance for Self defence, since I may use this against the violence of my Father in the State of Nature, as I have already proved; tho' I cannot justifie the punishment of my Father, or calling him to an account as his Superiour; therefore it is only in the King's Politick Capacity that he can be said to do no wrong, since you see he may per∣sonally commit the greatest Crimes imaginable, tho' his person is unaccountable for want of a Superiour Power to call him to an account; yet is it not so with those who act by his Illegal Commissions or Commands, since having delegated the Executive part of his Regal Power to his subordinate Ministers, and Officers; 'tis they that are accountable and punishable too by the Law of the Land in case they any way transgress, or violate it, by his illegal Commissions or Commands, as I shall prove more at large by and by. And as no War properly so called can be made against a single person, but against a Man as he is aided or assisted by many others: So this War against the King can only be interpreted of such Wars or Rebellion as are made against him in his politick capacity as he is King, and Supream Governour of the Realm, and the Commander of all the <HI>Militia</HI> thereof to Legal intents, and for the defence thereof against Forein or Domestick Enemies; nor was there any great fear according to the Ancient Legal Constitution of this Kingdom, that this could often fall out, or indeed he put in practice by the Kings of this Realm, if we consider the Ancient Form of order∣ing the Forces, or <HI>Militia</HI> of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>For in the first place I desire you to observe, that by the Common Law of <HI>England</HI> before these Acts of the <HI>Militia,</HI> the King himself could not but in case of Invasion or Insurrection Levy or keep on foot any standing Forces in <HI>England,</HI> unless for Forein Succours, which was usually by Contract with some great Lord or other Person, or by Tenure against the Scotch and Welch; and as for the <HI>Militia,</HI> it was never reduced into Troops, Companies, or Regiments, till the
<PB N="639" REF="343"/>
Spanish Invasion, as will appear by all Acts of Parliament in the Statutes at large where Acts for the Assize of Arms were made only for Men, to provide and have in readiness such Horses and Arms, to shew them before the King's Com∣missioners when they should be required to take view of them, a Regiment∣ed <HI>Militia,</HI> being of no elder date than Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> King <HI>Iames</HI> the First did by Act of Parliament in the first year of his Reign repeal all former Acts for Assize of Arms, and never established any thing in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thereof. So it stood till King <HI>Charles</HI> the Seconds time, that these new Acts for the Mili∣tia wer made. And (to confirm this point beyond all dispute) in all the quar∣rels between the King and the Barons, and <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> the Parliament still refused to meet unless the Forces were disbanded that were raised upon those occasions. Nor had any King standing Forces or Guards, till King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Time, when that of the Yeomen was settled by a special Act of Parliament; and what is most remarkable, the Commons in the Long Parlia∣ment of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second did by their Votes entered upon their Journals declare and assert, that by Law no Armed Force could be kept up in time of Peace, except the <HI>Militia</HI>; and as for Foreign Succours, they were obliged to be car∣ried immediately to the Port of their discharge, and were not to exceed one Month at furthest from the time of their first Muster; as for Castles and Forts within the Realm, they were all supplied and defended by Tenures; but for the <HI>Militia,</HI> of old time, it was in the Sheriffs of the Counties to make use thereof for the Execution of the Laws, and defence of the Kingdom, except in the cases aforesaid; and it was Treason for any Subject to Levy Souldiers, ex∣cept by the King's Commission, and in the cases aforesaid; or so much as to Ride or go Arm'd, as may appear by the Statute of <HI>Northampton,</HI> in the 2d of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third; much less was it lawful for them to take up Arms, unless in their own defence against Illegal Violence, and in such manner as the Law directs; and it was one of the Articles that was adjudged to be Treason in Parliament against <HI>Mortimer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> Parliam. Roll. 410 of <HI>Ed</HI> 3. <HI>de Reg. de Mort. Mar.</HI> Art. the 2d.</NOTE> that he Rid Armed to Parlia∣ments, and threatned the Prelates and Peers that did any thing against his will, and caused the King to make War on his Nobles, who advised the King to Levy War upon his Subjects.
<Q>See <HI>Coke</HI>'s 4th Institutes Title Council-board, where the 4th Article against the <HI>Spencers</HI> is, that they falsly and maliciously had counselled the King to raise Horse and Arms in destruction of the good People, against the Form of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and so by their Evil Counsel would have moved War within the Realm to the destruction of Holy Church and of the People for their proper quarrel; so that taking Arms by the King against his Subjects, and the Subjects against the King, was both alike against Law.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2ly, That taking Arms against the King in construction of Law, is Levying War; but this by no means extends to defensive Arms in maintenance of the Law, which is allowed and enjoyned; and that nothing else was here mean, is plain, since by the subsequent words in this Oath it is restrained to the taking Arms by his Authority against his Person, or those Commissioned by him▪ which shews that nothing here is intended to be forbidden, but taking up offensive Arms upon popular pretences without and against the Authority of the Law,
<PB N="640" REF="344"/>
which is further explained in another Test by the Authority of both Houses of Parliament.</P>
<P>Thirdly, 'Tis observable, this is but a Test upon some that were to come in∣to Offices, and can by no means make any change in the Ancient Law, which cannot be changed by Implication; nor does this amount to so much; the first part of this Oath requiring only that the party admitted into Office, shall so de∣clare and believe,; and tho' the second Clause call it a Traiterous Position, yet this is restrained only to these two particulars, That Arms may not be taken up by the King's Authority against his Person, or those Commissioned by him, which can have reference to nothing but that distinction taken up in the late Times of Civil War, when the Parliament pretended to take Arms, and grant Commis∣sions in the Name of King and Parliament, by vertue of that Authority which they supposed he left with them at <HI>Westminster</HI>; so that this Clause can by no means exclude any Arms made use of for Legal defence according to Law.</P>
<P>Fourthly and lastly; Tho' the words against those Commissioned by him may seem to extend the matter further, and is mistaken by some, as if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t re∣quired at least Passive Obedience to all Commissions of the King, tho' never so illegal; yet there is not the least colour for it, since nothing is a Commission but the King's Legal Command or Authority pursuant to some Law, and for putting the same in Execution, which is the Legal definition of a Commission; and when this Test was first brought in to the second Parliament of King <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d, and that the word Legal was offered to be added to the Bill; upon a long De∣bate it was only left out, because it was declared by all the Lawyers in the House, (even by Sir <HI>Hen. Finch,</HI> then the King's Sollicitor) and agreed to by the whole House, that it was clearly implied, and could bear no other con∣struction, but that all Illegal Commissions were Null, and void, and in no Legal sense could be called Commissions; so that taking up Arms in the defence of the Law, and pursuant thereunto, cannot in any wise be called a taking Arms against the King's Person, or those Commissioned by him; and farther that by the words, in pursuance of such Military Commissions are meant such as are warranted by that Act, &amp; such as the King may issue, by his Royal Authority which is bounded by Law, and consequently cannot grant any Commissions, but what are according to Law; so that if these Commissions are granted to persons utterly disabled by Law to take them, as all are that will not take the Test appointed by the Act of the 25th of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, intituled, An Act to prevent the dangers that may arise from Popish Recusants; as also all Commissions to do any Illegal, vio∣lent action, are absolutely void, and consequently may be resisted; or else our <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> with all the other Laws that establish Liberty and Property, as also our very Religion it self Established by Law, may be either undermined by the King's new Dispensing Power, or else subverted by open force; and every Commission▪ Officer in a Red Coat, will be as sacred, and irresistible as the King himself.</P>
<P>But to conclude; That the Instances I have given, that the King's Commis∣sion may be abused to the destruction of the Nation, nay of the whole Parlia∣ment, are not so unlikely and remote as you imagine. Pray let me put you in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that as for that pretended Commission to Sir <HI>Phelim Oneal,</HI> tho' it is true,
<PB N="641" REF="344"/>
it did prove afterwards to be forged, yet was it not known to be so till long af∣ter; and therefore having all the signs of a true Commission under the King's great Seal, the poor Protestants in <HI>Ireland</HI> were to have had their Throats cut ac∣cording to this Oath, before ever they could be satisfied whether it were true or not: But that a Popish King persecuting and destroying his Protestant Sub∣jects only for matters of Religion, is not so improbable a thing as you would have it; the French King's late Dragooning, Imprisoning, and sending to the Gallies all that refused to renounce Heresie, (as they call it,) and subscribe to the Articles of the Romish Religion, has given us but too sad, and recent an ex∣ample; and how you can assure me that the King acting upon these very Prin∣ciples, and being governed by like Confessors, will never do the same things, I should be glad to receive some better satisfaction than his bare word to the contrary. Nor yet is my other Instance of its being left according to your Doctrine in the King's power to make a violent assault upon the persons both of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, whenever he pleased, with∣out any Resistance whatsoever, so remote and improbable as you are pleased to make it; since you may find it still upon Record among the Articles exhi∣bited in Parliament against <HI>Robert de Vere,</HI> Duke of <HI>Ireland, Robert Tresilian</HI> Chief Justice, and Sir <HI>Nicholas Brembur</HI> in the Parliament of the 11th of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Rot. Parl.</HI> 11 <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. <HI>pars secunda.</HI></NOTE> (which I have already mentioned) the 15th Article of which was,
<Q>That they by their false Council had caused the King to command the said <HI>Nicholas,</HI> being then Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> suddenly to rise with a great power to kill and put to death the said Lords; (<HI>viz. Thomas</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and the other Lords there named) and the Commons (<HI>viz.</HI> of the Parliament of the 10th of this King) who were not of their Party and Conspiracy; for the doing of which wickedness, the said grand Traitors above-said were parties and presents to the destruction of the King, and his Realm:</Q>
So that if this Treason had not been discovered, and that no private persons might then resist those Commis∣sioned by the King, it would have been Treason according to your principles, for the said Lords and Commons, to have resisted those that were thus sent to assault them, and take away their Lives; and what hath once happened, 'tis not impossible but it may happen again. And we may remember how about little more than 30 years since that the K. of <HI>Denmark</HI> shut up the Senators, and Nobility of the great Council of that Kingdom in <HI>Coppenhagen,</HI> and threatned them with Death, or Imprisonment if they refused to give up all their Liberties, and from an Elective King make him and his Successors absolute hereditary Monarchs, as they are at this day by means of the Bishops and Clergy of that Kingdom, who then basely gave up, and betrayed the Liberty of their Countrey; and what they have now got by it, they best know; therefore this is a thing to be consi∣dered as a necessary consequence of your sense of this Oath: So that upon the whole matter, and considering the late Scene of Affairs, I darst leave it to the Judgment of any indifferent Foreiner, tho' a Papist, which was most likely be∣fore the unexpected coming of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> into this Kingdom, that the People should rise up in Arms, and expel the King from his Throne, or that he should by vertue of the pretended sense of this Oath, backt by your
<PB N="642" REF="345"/>
Doctrine of Passive Obedience, have enslaved this Nation, and set up what Go∣vernment and Religion he pleased.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess you have given a very cunning, and specious gloss upon the words of this Oath, and Declaration of the Parliament of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second; but whether it is legal or not, I very much doubt, since I never heard of it before; and I could have wisht, that if they designed not to lay a snare upon Mens Consciences in this great point, that they would have been more clear in expressing all those Cases wherein it might be lawful for us to resist the King, or those Commissioned by him; as also who should judge when the King's Commissions are so illegal and violent as to require Resistance; for if every pri∣vate Subject may judge of the legality, or illegality of the King's Military Com∣missions, and can raise a Party strong enough to make opposition against those that are Commissioned by them in the Execution of the King's Orders, a dis∣contented Party of this Nation may soon find a pretence to raise another Rebel∣lion, and Civil War as dreadful as the former; and notwithstanding your great care and concern for the King's person, which you grant to be sacred and in∣violable, could it long continue so; for if the King himself appeared at the Head of his Men to command, and encourage them in their duty, it would be much worse, as long as the matter they took up Arms for, should be by them accounted a violation of the Laws. Thus we may remember, that tho' the Par∣liament of—41. did pretend to take up Arms for defence of the King's per∣son, and only to take away Evil Councellors; yet did they for all that, order their Generals and Officers to fight a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much when the King was personally present, as at any other place or time; so that His Majesties person (had not God thought fit to order it otherwise) might have been as well destroyed in the Battles of <HI>Edg-hill,</HI> or <HI>Naseby,</HI> as his great Grand-father King <HI>Iames</HI> the Third of <HI>Scotland</HI> was in that Battle against his Rebellious Subjects headed by his own Son: So that according to your interpretation, instead of mending the matter, this Parliament of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second had only left it far worse than they found it: For whereas the Long Parliament made themselves the sole Judges, and Redressers of the King's Violations of the Peoples Rights: Now ac∣cording to your interpretation of this Oath, and Declaration of the Parliament of King <HI>Charle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s the Second, every private Man may not only judge of the King's Violation of the Law by his Military Commissions, but also make Resistance against them when-ever they think themselves able so to do; and then notwith∣standing, that Parliament utter renouncing all Arms, whether offensive, or de∣fensive, to be raised by themselves against the King, they would have still left a power in any part of the People strong enough to make this Resistance which they had renounced for themselves, who are their Lawful Representatives. Thus for example, supposing the last Civil War had begun upon the account of raising of Ship Money, which whether it was lawful, I will not now dispute; it was sufficient that all the Judges except two gave their Opinions for it; and if any County in <HI>England</HI> strong enough to make an Insurrection, had rose in Arms up∣on the Levying of this Tax (as it has several times happened even about Taxes granted in Parliament) this Tax (tho' small) yet being lookt upon against Law, must have engaged the whole Nations in a Civil War, and also endangered His
<PB N="643" REF="345"/>
Majesties person in case he had appeared in the Field with those Men he had raised to subdue that Rebellion; so that I am still satisfied that it is far better to suffer a mischief than an inconvenience; that is, it is better to trust to the King's Conscience, and Discretion, what Commissions to grant, tho' sometimes perhaps they may chance to be illegal, than to leave it in the power of the people to rise in Rebellion when-ever they think such Commissions to violate their supposed, or pretended Liberties and Properties.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you will not argue against the Resistance of the King's person in case he should go about to Ravish, Rob, or Murder his people: But now you raise another difficulty who shall judge, and consequently make this Resistance against the King's Commissions, when executed by illegal persons, to illegal and violent ends; for if the people may judge for themselves of the illegality of such Commissions, a Rebellion may be raised, and His Majesties person en∣dangered, notwithstanding all the provision the Parliament have made against it. But before I answer this Argument of yours, pray give me leave to ask you one or two Questions; Do you think the King's Late Declaration for the Dis∣pensing Power, and the Commissions granted thereupon to be according to Law or not?</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess I think they are unlawful, yet it does not follow that they may be therefore resisted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not ask you that now; but only tell me whether you think the Bi∣shops are obliged in Conscience to disperse that Declaration, or the Clergy to read it in their Churches? and whether those have done well who have refused to read it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must tell you, I am so good a Protestant, and so true an English∣man, that I cannot allow the King that power; and therefore I must grant that the Bishops did nobly, and like true Christian Bishops to refuse to disperse it; and where it was dispersed the Inferiour Clergy have done very well not to read it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, notwithstanding all the dreadful Mischiefs proceeding from private Subjects juding of the legality, or illegality of the King's Declarations, and Commissions, or Commands; yet they may, it seems, not only judge whe∣ther they are lawful, or not; but a disobedience to them may not only be law∣fully exercised, but is very commendable: Now what is this disobedience to these Commands, but a Moral, or Civil Resistance of the King's Power in this matter? and why may not such a Judgment he made by the People in as plain a case, and also Resistance follow thereupon against such violent illegal Com∣missions (suppose to raise Money without Act of Parliament, or to Dragoon Men to go to Mass) since the violence is more evident and apparent in this case upon Mens persons, than in the other upon the bare Consciences of the Bishops and Clergy? for the force being more immediate, and pressing upon their Per∣sons and Estates, there is no other means left but to resist it if they are able.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I can give you very good reasons to satisfie you, why, tho' I grant private Subjects, may judge of the Legality or Illegality of the King's Com∣missions, and also refuse to obey His Illegal Commands, and also that all pub∣lick Officers ought to take care at their peril how they act by or execute such
<PB N="644" REF="346"/>
Illegal Commissions; yet that it does not therefore follow that such illegal Commissions or Orders though executed upon the whole body of the People, may be resisted by them; for all limitation of the Royal Power being only voluntary, and proceeding from the meer grace, and favour of our Kings, they are not compellable by force, or resistable if they should im∣pose their own Proclamations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. R.</HI> p. 190. <HI>&amp; de∣inde.</HI></NOTE> or Edicts upon us instead of Laws. For tho' I grant that the King hath no Just, or Legal Authority to act against Law, and that if he knowingly put any Subject to death contrary to Law he is a Murderer; and no Prince can have any such Prerogative, as to commit open downright mur∣ders; either in his own person or by those who act by Commission from him; but what follows from hence? That they may resist or oppose them if they do. This I absolutely deny, because God and the Law have Commanded us, not to resist, and I see no inconsistency between those two Propositions; That a King hath no Authority to act against Law, and yet that neither He, nor those commissioned by Him though acting against Law may be resisted. Both the Law of God, and the Laws of our Countrey suppose these two to be very consistent.</P>
<P>For notwithstanding the possibility that Princes may thus abuse their Power, and transgress the Laws whereby they ought to govern, yet they also command Subjects in no case to resist, and it is not sufficient to justifie Resi∣stance if Princes do what they have no just Authority to do, unless we have also a just Authority to resist, he who exceeds the just bounds of this Authory is lyable to be called to an account for it, but he is accountable only to those who have a Superior Authority to call him to an account. No Power whatsoever is ac∣countable to an Inferior, for this is a contradiction to the very Notion of Power, and destructive of all Order and Civil Government. Inferior Magi∣strates are on all hands acknowledged to be lyable to give an account of the abuse of their Power, but to whom must they give an account? Not to their Inferiors, not to the People whom they are to Govern, but to Superior Magi∣strates, or to the Soveraign Prince who Governs all. Thus the Soveraign Prince may exceed his Authority, and is accountable for it to a Superior Power; But because he hath no Superior Power on Earth, he cannot be resisted by his own Subjects, but must be reserved to the Judgment of God who alone is the King of Kings.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place I deny (and I have sufficiently proved the con∣trary) that all Limitation of Royal Power proceeded at first from the meer grace, and favour of our Kings, since the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> has been from its first Institution Limitted by Laws, and the People have likewise always enjoyed a property in their Lives, Liberties and Estates by the same Laws: Tho' I grant, you and I are thus far agreed, That the King hath no Just and and Legal Authority to act against Law, and that if he put any man to Death, or take away his Estate contrary to it, it is Murder, and Robbery: And likewise that the Subjects may be capable of Judging concerning such illegal Commands; but you will not allow, that if such a Limitted Monarch should send his Mercenary Forces to take away our Estates, or to Dragoon us till we
<PB N="645" REF="346"/>
will own our selves of his Religion, that those Instruments of his Tyranny may be resisted; or that I have brought any reason for it. Whereas if you had but attended better to my discourse at our 3d and 4th Meetings, you might have remembred that I plainly enough proved to you, that God hath not given Princes, nor those Commissioned by them, any Authority to Mur∣der, or enslave their Subjects; and your self then granted, <HI>That every Man hath power to defend his Life against him who hath no Authority to take it away</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S.C.R.</HI> p. 59.</NOTE> which holds more strongly in our Constitution; where if the King give a Man a Commission to act contrary to the Law of the Land, it is altogether void, and the People may as well justifie their Resistance of those Officers, or Souldiers who should come to Dragoon, or persecute them, for professing the Religion Established by Law, as if he had sent them downright to cut their Throats; and this being their Right by the Laws of God, and Nature, whether God hath taken away this Right by any ex∣press Precept in the holy Scripture, I also examined at those Meet∣ings; but whether any Municipal Law of the Land hath restrained us from it, I have also now considered, and proved it contrary to the true intent and mean∣ing of these Acts concerning the <HI>Militia.</HI> And therefore to say, that it is not suf∣ficient to justifie Resistance if Princes do, or command what they have no Legal Authority for, unless we can also shew an Authority to resist, is a mistake, if by Authority you mean an express Civil Law for it, because such Resistance in ab∣solute Monarchies is justifiable by that which is <HI>Prior</HI> to all Civil Laws, the Right of Self-defence, or Preservation: And so likewise in Limited Kingdoms there is the same necessity of Defensive Arms upon a general Breach, or Vio∣lation of any Fundamental Constitution of the Government, since it cannot be kept, or maintained without such Resistance be allowed.</P>
<P>So that if the King hath no Authority to act contrary to Law, he cannot sure delegate that to others, which he had not in himself; and consequently such Commissions to Persecute, or Murder Men contrary to Law, being in themselves void, the persons that Execute them being no Officers, may be justly resisted, and the Resistance of such an Illegal Act doth not at all derogate from his Sove∣raignty as King, since (as I told you before) that is limited only to the per∣formance of Legal Acts, and extends not to Illegal Orders, or Commands; and as for the rest of the Reasons you give against this Resistance, <HI>viz.</HI> because he who exceeds the just bounds of his Authority, is liable to be called to an ac∣count for it, only by those who have a Superiour Authority to do it; Whereas no Power whatsoever is accountable to an Inferiour: You do but impose upon me and your self, the same Fallacy which you have so often made use of, in making, being accountable, all one, with irresistible, which are vastly different, and therefore your Conclusion is as false, that because the Soveraign Prince may exceed his Authority, and is only accountable for it to God; that therefore he cannot be resisted by his own Subjects; for he may be resisted, and yet be still unaccountable, those two differing as must us Self-defence does from punish∣ment, as I have more than once told you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot rest satisfied with this Reply; for though I so far agree with
<PB N="646" REF="347"/>
you,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. C. R.</HI> p. 192, 193.</NOTE> that an Act without a Legal Authority carries no Obligation at all along with it, and therefore cannot oblige the Subject to Obedience: Now this is true, if by Obedience you mean an Active Obedience; for I am not bound to do an ill thing, or an Illegal Action, because my Prince commands me; but if you mean Passive Obedience, it is as manifestly false; for I am bound to obey, that is, not to resist my Prince when he offers me the most unjust and illegal Violence. Nay it is very false and ab∣surd to say, that every Illegal is an Inauthoritative Act, which carries no Obli∣gation with it. This is contrary to the practice of all Human Judicatures, and the daily Experience of Men, who suffer in their Lives, Bodies, or Estates, by an unjust, or illegal Sentence. Every judgment contrary to the true meaning of the Law is in that sense illegal; and yet such illegal Judgments have their Authority, and Obligation, till they are rescinded by some higher Authority. This is the true reason of Appeals from Inferiour to Superiour Courts, to rectifie Illegal Proceedings, and reverse Illegal Judgments, which supposes, that such Illegal Acts have Authority till they are made null, and void by a higher Power: And if the higher Powers, from whence lies no Appeal, confirm and ratifie an Unjust, and Illegal Sentence; it carries so much Authority, and Obli∣gation with it, that the Injured person hath no Redress, but must patiently sub∣mit, and thus it must necessarily be, or there can be no end of Disputes, nor any Order, or Government observed in Human Societies.</P>
<P>And this is a plain Demonstration, that tho' the Law be the Rule according to which Princes ought to exercise their Authority and Power; yet the Autho∣rity is not in the Laws, but in the Persons that Execute them: For otherwise why is not a Sentence pronounced according to Law by a private person, of as much Authority as a Sentence pronounced by a Judge? or how doth an Illegal Sentence pronounced by a Judge come to have any Authority? For a sen∣tence contrary to Law cannot have the Authority of the Law: And why is a Legal, or Illegal Sentence reversible, and alterable, when pronounced by one Judge, and irreversible and unalterable when pronounced by another? For the Law is the same, and the Sentence is the same, either according to Law, or against it, whoever the Judge be: But indeed the Authority of the person is not the same, and that makes the difference. So that there is an Authority in per∣sons in some sense distinct from the Authority of Laws, nay superiour to it: For there is such an Authority, as, tho' it cannot make an Illegal Act Legal; yet it can, and often doth make an Illegal Act binding and obligatory to the Subjects when pronounced by a competent Judge.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think notwithstanding all you have now said your distinction of a Supreme Authority in Persons above, and distinct from the Authority of Laws will prove a meer Notion, for you grant that the King hath no Just or Le∣gal Authority to act against Law, and that if he put any man to death con∣trary to it, it is downright murder; but you will not allow that if the King should thus murder never so many thousands, either he, or those Instruments of Tyranny may be resisted; And therefore you would fain top upon me your old distinction of an Active, and Passive Obedience: The former of which I very well understand, but as for the latter I have long since proved, that
<PB N="647" REF="347"/>
it is so far from being any Obedience, that it is indeed downright Disobedience, or a refusal to do that which the Prince Commands, so that truly your self have taught me to distinguish between the King's Personal Authority and his Legal, for otherwise, why are you not as much obliged to yield an Active Obedience to the King's Personal Illegal Commissions or Commands as to his Legal ones, if there were no difference between them? So then all the difference between us lyes in the measure of the Disobedience, you main∣taining that it is sufficient not to yield Obedience to such Illegal Commissions and Commands; and I that besides this denyal of Obedience, (if it be in a fundamen∣tal point, and that which generally concerns the whole body of the Kingdom) that they may not only be disobeyed but resisted too, if forced upon us with vio∣lence; and therefore all that you have said to prove that the Authority to which we are bound to submit, consists not in the Laws, but in the Persons tho' acting contrary to Law; is according to your own way of reasoning altogether unconclusive.</P>
<P>And farther, when you say, that it is false, and absurd to affirm, that every Illegal, is an unauthoritative Act which carries no Obligation with it; I shall prove, that this absurdity lyes wholly on your side. For 1. Legal and Authoritative,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I. R. S.</HI> p. 15.</NOTE> are all one in our Law, for that which is not Legal carries no Authority along with it; so that Illegal Authority is in plai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> English, unlawful, lawful Power▪ nor had K. <HI>Charles</HI> 1. any such extravagant Notion of his Royal Authority, (who cer∣tainly understood his own Power better than you or I,) when he owns in his Declaration to the Long Parliament dated, from <HI>Newmarket</HI> 1641. <HI>That the Law is the measure of his Power,</HI> which is as full a Concession of the thing I affirm as words can express; For if the Laws be the measure of it, then his Royal Power, or Authority (which is all one) is Limited by it. For the measure of any thing is the Limits or bounds of the thing Limited, and when it exceeds those bounds it is an Illegal, and consequently an Unautho∣ritative Act, which carries no Obligation either Active or Passive along with it. So likewise in the said King's answer, to both Houses concerning the Militia, speaking of the Men by them named to him to be Commissioners for it; He thus replyed, If <HI>more Power shall be thought fit to be granted to them than by Law is in the Crown it self, His Majesty holds it reasonable, that the same be by some Law first vested in him, with Power to transfer it to these Persons</HI>; &amp;c. In which Passage it is granted, that all the Power, or Authority of the Crown concerning the Militia is by or from the Law, and that the King hath no more Authority than what is vested in him by the Law of the Land.</P>
<P N="2">2. Your Argument from the practise of Human Judicatures is also very fal∣lacious, for you Argue from the bare abuse of a Trust, or Commission, with the Execution of which all Judges &amp; Officers must be intrusted, to that which is quite of another Nature, (<HI>viz:</HI>) When the Person intrusted Acts directly contrary to his Commission, or without any Commission at all: And therefore you are quite out in your Law, when you tell me, that an Absolute Illegal Judg∣ment is valid, till it be reversed, for if it be appearantly contrary to the known Forms of Law, and practice of the Kingdom, it is so far from being
<PB N="648" REF="348"/>
valid, that tho' it be put in Execution, it would be lookt upon as null, and done without any Authority at all: As suppose the King in per∣son, or any Inferiour Judge,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I.R.S.</HI> p. 15, 16.</NOTE> should condemn a Man to die, ei∣ther contrary to the Verdict of his Jury, or without any Jury at all; this is so far from being Authoritative, or valid, that such a Judgment is void in it self, and those are guilty of Murder, who execute it, and it will need no Writ of Error to reverse it: But I suppose by Illegal Judg∣ments, you mean such Judgments, which have some Error in them, either in matter of Law, or Form, for which they may be reversed: I grant if these should not be lookt upon as valid, and hold good till they are reversed in a higher Court, there could not be any Judgment given at all, since all Human Judicatories whatsoever are subject to Errors and Mistakes; and there is sure a great deal of difference between such actions as are done by that Authority which the Law entrusts them with, tho' not duly exercised, and those violent and illegal acts which a Prince, when he persecutes, and enslaves his Subjects, performs by his wicked Instruments, contrary to all Divine and Human Laws: So that the validity of such an Erroneous Judgment, is not from the Judges personal Authority, above the Law, nor from his mistake or ignorance of the Law, but from that high Credit and Authority which the Law hath given to all Courts and Judicial Proceedings, which if they are done in due form, are to be taken for Law, however unjust and must be presumed to be free from Error, till they are reversed in some higher Court.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if you please better to consider of it, you will find a necessity of owning a Supreme Power in the King beyond all Appeal, or Resistance,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S.C.R.</HI> p. 196. <HI>&amp; deinde.</HI></NOTE> and that there must be a personal Authority in him; antecedent, and superiour to all Civil Laws; for there can be no Laws without a Law-maker; and there can be no Law-maker unless there be one, or more persons invested with the Power of Government, of which, making Laws is one principal branch; for a Law is nothing else but the publick, and declared Will, and Command of the Law-makers whether they be a Soveraign Prince, or the People.</P>
<P>And hence it necessarily follows, that a Soveraign Prince does not receive his Authority from the Laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibidem</HI> 197. <HI>&amp; deinde.</HI></NOTE> but Laws receive their Authority from him: And I must be still of the same Opinion as to <HI>Bracton</HI>'s words, which you before quoted, <HI>Lex facit Regem,</HI> the Law makes the King; by which I cannot believe that that great Lawyer meant that the King received the Soveraign Power from the Law, for the the Law hath no Authority, nor can give any, but what it receives from the King; and then it is a wonderful, riddle, how the King should receive his Authority from the Law. And therefore I must stick to my former Inter∣pretation, that when he says the Law makes the King, that is, it distinguisheth him from a Tyrant, as appears from the reason he gives for it, <HI>i. e. Non est enim Rex ubi dominatur voluntas &amp; non Lex,</HI> he is no King that Governs by his Arbitrary Will, and not by Law, not that he is no Soveraign Prince, but he is a Tyrant and not a King.</P>
<P>And hence it as evidently follows, that the Being of Soveraign Power is
<PB N="649" REF="348"/>
independent on Laws, that is, as a Soveraign Prince doth not receive his Soveraign Power from the Law, so should he violate the Laws, by which he is bound to govern: Yet, he is not to be resisted, much less doth he for∣feit his Power. 'Tis true he breaks his Faith to God, and his Countrey, but he is a Soveraign Prince still. And now I hope it plainly appears that every Illegal act the King doth, or Illegal Commission that he grants, is not an inauthoritative Act, or Commission, but layes on the Subject an Obligation to yield if not Active, yet a Passive Obedience. And in the King's most Illegal acts, tho' they have not the Authority of Laws yet they have the Au∣thority of Soveraign Power, which is irrisistible, and unaccountable. In a word it doth not become any Man, who can think three consequences off, to talk of the Authority of Laws in derogation to the Authority of Soveraign Power; The Soveraign Power, made the Laws and can Repeal them, and Dispense with them, and make new Laws; The only Power, and Autho∣rity of the Laws is in in the Power, that can make, and execute Laws; Soveraign Power is unseparable from the Person of a Soveraign Prince; tho' the exercise of it may be regulated by Laws, and tho the Prince doth very ill who having consented to such a Regulation, breaks the Laws, yet when he acts contrary to Law, such acts carry Soveraign, and irrisistible Authority with them, while he continues a Soveraign Prince.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very well satisfied, notwithstanding all you have hitherto said, that the Government of <HI>England</HI> owns no such thing as this Arbitrary Power with which you would invest the King; since I have already proved at our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th meeting that the King is not the Sole Legislator, and consequently not the Sole Supreme Power. So likewise our Law it doth as little understand any such thing as a Personal Authority in the King, antecedent and Superiour to all Laws. For since God hath now left off making Kings by his own spe∣cial appointment, as he did among the Jews, every King must either be so by the Law, or Custome of that Countrey, or else a bare possession of the Throne <UNCLEAR>is</UNCLEAR> sufficient to make him so; and then every Usurper hath as much right to a Crown as the most lawful Prince, and <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> was as rightful a Prince as King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second. It is true the first King of any Race could not be invested with the Crown by the same Law, as his Successors are, that is, by an Hereditary proximity of Blood; Yet such a King, whenever he began to be so, could have no Legal Right, without the Election, Recognition, or Consent of the People. And as for an Hereditary Right, that is but a Right by the Law of the Land, or general Consent of the People, (testified by an uninterrupted Custom) to entail the Crown on such a Family, so that in either Case they are Kings by Law; and therefore I conceive it can be only in this sense, that <HI>Bracton</HI> says <HI>Lex facit Regem,</HI> i. e. The Law of the Kingdom, makes the King, which more plainly appears, by what immediately follows, <HI>attribuat igitur Rex Legi, quod Lex attribuit <UNCLEAR>ei</UNCLEAR>,</HI> viz. <HI>Dominationem, &amp; Potestatem,</HI> in which words nothing seems more plain, than that the King ought to yield the like Domi∣nion, and Power to the Law, as the Law had given him before; or else how could <HI>Bracton</HI> call the Law (in the place I have already cited,) the Kings Supe∣riour?
<PB N="650" REF="349"/>
And if the Kings Title to the Crown were not by Law? How came it to pass that the <HI>Stewards</HI> for Example had a better Tittle to the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> than the <HI>Bayliols</HI>? but only that the Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that is the Con∣sent of the States of that Kingdom, made them so, for otherwise any man that looks upon the Pedegree of both those Families, will see, that <HI>Bayliol</HI> according to our rules of Descent was the nearer of Blood to the last King <HI>David</HI> than <HI>Bruce,</HI> and was so ajudged, upon a solemn hearing by our King <HI>Edward</HI> 1. ih Parliament. And as for <HI>William</HI> whom you call the Conquerour under whom all our present King's do claim at this day, he could have no just Right, or Title to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> by Conquest, but by the Election, or Sub∣mission of the People declared by them at his Coronation. And therefore that Law by which he was made King must be precedent, or at least concur∣rent with his being so; and upon whatever terms, or Conditions he then ac∣cepted it, his Successours are bound both by the Laws of God, and Man to ob∣serve them. And therefore whatever you have built upon, or would infer from these Principles is of no force. And If the King be the Sole Soveraign Power, that makes the Laws, repeals them and dispenses with them when he pleases; I would be glad to know upon what grounds so many of the Bishops and Clergy refused to read the King's Declaration of Indulgence, Since cer∣tainly if he alone made the Laws, he also could dispense with them; But I shall say no more of these Points now because they are not directly to the matter in hand.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for what you say concerning the King's not being the sole Supreme Legislative Power, I confess you and I have discoursed long upon that point; and if I were thoroughly satisfied of it, I could much easier assent to what you have said; as also if you could prove to me, that the King received his Power from the People, and not from God, the matter would be yet plainer; for then it would evidently appear, that the People might have reserved to themselves such a Right of Resistance as you now maintain; but that they never could have such a power in <HI>England,</HI> from the Constitution of this Monarchy, I need go no farther than your own Instance of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, who owed all his Right to this Kingdom to the power of the Sword, and not to any Heredi∣tary Right, much less Election, or Confirmation of the People, as I think Doctor <HI>Brady</HI> has proved beyond dispute in his Learned Answer to <HI>Argumentum Antinor manleum</HI>; so that since we owe all the Rights and Liberties we enjoy to the gra∣cious Concessions of our Kings of this <HI>Norman</HI> Race, we ought not in reason, or gratitude to resist them, if they should sometimes encroach upon what we take to be part of those Liberties so granted; no not if the King (who derives an Indefeasible Right to the Crown from the Title of the first Conqueror) should go about to take away all those Liberties, nay our very Religion and Property too from us.</P>
<P>But I have not time to pursue this Argument further now, and therefore shall leave it to another opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for what you have now said concerning <HI>William</HI> the First's having no Right to the Crown of this Kingdom, but what he owed to his Sword, is false in matter of fact, it being more than that Prince himself ever asserted or pre∣tended
<PB N="651" REF="349"/>
to; and in the next place, as for your Dr's. proving him an Absolute Conqueror over the English Nations, supposing he had done it (which yet I positively deny) yet will not this serve to do the business for which the Doctor urges it; <HI>viz.</HI> to set up an Arbitrary, Irresistible Power in that King, and all his Successours, but may be urged against him to a quite contrary purpose, as I shall shew you more at large, whenever you please to discourse farther upon that Subject: And as for all those things we call Legal, our Rights and Priviledges, which you say were wholly granted us by the Charters of his Successours, I have already proved that to be false in matter of fact at our fifth Meeting, where I shewed you that the English Nation had the same Liberties, as to their Persons and Properties in their Estates before your pretended Conquest, as they en∣joyed afterwards; and that <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was but the recital and confirmation of our Ancient English Laws, as <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> affirms in the place I here formerly cited; but admitting these Liberties and Priviledges you mention had been owing to the favour and bounty of former Kings, yet can I see no Rebellion or ingratitude the People of this Nation are guilty of, if they keep and defend them now they have them, but would rather betray a servile, base spirit if we part with them: For since it is a Maxim in Law, concerning all Grants, as well from the Crown as private persons, that they ought so to enure <HI>ut Res magis <UNCLEAR>va∣leat</UNCLEAR>, quem pereat; i. e.</HI> that the Parties to whom the Grant is is made, may not lose the benefit of it; when ever the Grantor pleases. Therefore it is also a rule in such Grants, that they are still to be interpreted in favour of the Grantee against the Grantor, and also, that the Grantee shall not be left without some means or remedy of keeping, and defending his right against the Grantor whenever he goes about to take it away; nor do I know any exception there is for the Kings Grants more than those of private Subjects;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bract.</HI> l. c. 8. <HI>Fleta.</HI> l. 1. c. 17.</NOTE> since both <HI>Bracton,</HI> and <HI>Flita</HI> tell us <HI>non debet esse Rege major in Exhibitione Iuris, minimus autem esse de∣bet in judicio suscipiendo si pecatur</HI> (which I take to be the true reading of that place, and not <HI>peccat, parcat,</HI> or <HI>petat</HI>) (as di∣vers copies have it.) That is, as the King is the greatest in distributing of right, or Law to his Subjects, so ought he to be no more than the least of them in submiting to right judgment if he be Petitioned to, and that it be required of him, (either of which senses this word will well bear,) but if he absolutely refuses to do this, but will take away their Rights and Li∣berties by force, and will deny them the benefit of the Laws, what other remedy is there left them but a general resistance? since otherwise the King may alter the Government and take away all our Legal Rights and Liberties, whenever he pleases.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess this dispute concerning the Resistance of those commission∣ed by the King; and the Kings being the Sole Legislator, and Original of all the Civil Liberties, and Priviledges we now enjoy: hath carryed us from the main points in this Question: pray therefore satisfie me (if you can) those great Objections I have made. First how this Resistance can consist with with that sacredness, and inviolableness which you your self suppose to be due to the Kings person, for either this Resistance in case of an invasion of
<PB N="652" REF="350"/>
our Civil Rights must be made even when the King's Person is actually present, to back those Illegal Commissions, or it must be forborn out of that due Reve∣rence, and Care of his Royal Person, which the Law enjoyns. If the former, the King's Person is in danger to be destroyed whenever a factions Party is strong enough to rise in Arms and oppose the King's Commissions upon pretence of their being against Law: But if on the other side this Resistance is not allow∣able when the King's Person is present, then all such Resistance will signifie no∣thing, since as soon as ever the King in Person shall appear in the Field to back his Commissions; all your Defensive Arms (as you call them) must be imme∣diately laid down, unless they mean to destroy the Sacred Person of the King: So that take it either way, all Resistance is either Illegal, or else unpracticable. Secondly, I can as little understand (as I told you before) how the Two Houses of Parliament should renounce all taking up Arms, as well offensive as defensive against the King for themselves, and yet should leave a Power in the diffusive Body of the Nation; nay, in any part thereof strong enough to make a Rebellion, which they thought unlawful to exercise themselves. Lastly, By what Legal Authority the People, or any part of it, can justifie the taking up even defensive Arms, since you your self acknowledge that no Arms can be taken up regularly, but by the King's Authority; and you have also disclaimed all taking up of Arms by his Authority against his Person, or against those Commissioned by vertue of such Authority; tho' I confess, you except the Cases of Self-defence, and in maintenance of the Law; yet I cannot find those Exceptions allowed of in any of our Law-Books, either ancient or modern.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope to give you such Satisfaction to every one of these Objections you have made, as may serve any indifferent person; therefore as to the first, con∣cerning the Sacredness of the King's person, which I allow of as well as you, we must in the first place distinguish between such Commissions as the King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssures by colour of Law, when the Judges for example had given their Opinions in the Case of Ship-money; for they being the sole Interpreters of the Law in the Intervals of Parliament; I do acknowledge that their Determinations are not to be opposed by force; but legally reversed when the next Parliament mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and they are then to answer in Parliament for their false Interpretations and Opi∣nions; as <HI>Tresillian</HI> and his Companions did in the 11th of <HI>Richard</HI> II. and as the Ten Judges did upon the two Houses Declaration against Ship-Money, and their Impeachment thereupon. Thus, tho' Mr. <HI>Hammpden</HI> refused to pay Ship-Money when demanded of him, and rather chose to lye in Prison than pay it, yet it had been downright Rebellion, in case any resistance had been made by him against the levying of it: But had this Tax been laid by the King's sole Power, without such colour of Law, I doubt not, but resistance might have been made even against those that were Commissioned by Him to levy it; and if any one Town, or Hundred, were not strong enough to seize such Officers as presumed thus to levy it against Law, <HI>the Sheriffs</HI> of every County in <HI>England</HI> might have raised the <HI>Posse Comitatus,</HI> and seized all such Offenders and carried them to Jayl; since the King's Commissions never did, nor can indemnifie the persons so Commissioned, in case the thing they were about to execute was con∣trary

to Law: and for this, I need go no farther than the Old <HI>Mirror of Iustices,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 1. <HI>Sect.</HI> 10.</NOTE> which is owned for good Law at this day, which speaking of Robbery, and the several Kinds thereof, has this passage, which I shall here render out of the old Law French; <HI>Into this Offence</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> Robbery) <HI>all those fall, that take other Mens Goods by Command∣ment of the King, or any great Lord, without the Owners consent.</HI> Where you see there is no difference at all made between those that took away other Mens Goods by the Command of the King, or any other, but it was Robbery in all of them alike, and consequently the Actors might be alike seized, and punished as Robbers: The same is also allowed, by the Statute of the 20th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th. whereby the King's Purveyors are forbid to take any thing to the value of 40 <HI>s.</HI> or under,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 8.</NOTE> without ready Payment in hand, of any person <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that it then should be lawful for every one of the King's Liege-People to retain their Goods and Chattels, and to resist such Purveyors and Buyers. So likewise the last Clause in this Oath, <HI>viz.</HI> In pursuance of such Military Commissions seems to restrain it to such Commissions as were granted by the King's Authority, that is according to Law, and no other.</P>
<P>So that you see by the old Law of <HI>England</HI> the King's Commission did not render any man irresistible, unless he executed it according to Law: since the Constable of each Town might raise the Inhabitants thereof, to seize such Wrong-doers; and if they were not strong enough, the High-Constable of the Hundred might raise the whole Hundred; and in case they were not sufficient; the High Constable might crave Aid of the Sheriff, and assemble all the several Hundreds of the County till these Malefactors were seized: So that as long as there were no standing Forces kept up, in the Nation, (as I have shown you there was not till the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second) there could never be my Clashing between the King's Civil, and Military Commissions; and this is one great Reason why no King of <HI>England,</HI> since the Act <HI>de Tallagio non Concedend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was so hardy as to issue any Commissions to levy Money without colour of Law▪ because they knew they were void in themselves, and consequently would be resisted by the whole Nation. So that this would not have been taking up Arms by the King's Authority against those Commissioned by him, but only in order to bring those to Justice who had not any Commissions at all to do what they did; the Law taking no Cognizance at all of the King's Personal Commissions, when absolutely against Law.</P>
<P>Nor if the King had joyned his own Presence to such illegal Commissions, would it have mended the matter, or rendered these Robbers of other m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Goods, any more irresistible than they were before; since the King can give no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Authority to do that which he has not Power to do himself, and therefore face his single Person may be resisted in case he go about to Ravish, Rob, or Murder People; then sure his joyning himself with such Men, tho' never so nu∣merous, can never make him more irresistible than he was; unless you will suppose that the King may not rob with a few, without resistance; but may justifie the doing of it with an Army: and if so, pray tell me, what number they must be to render the King, and all those with him, thus irresistible? And therefore it is no wonder if our Law has made no express Provision for
<PB N="654" REF="351"/>
resisting the King's Person, since it had so high a regard for his Honour, as not to suppose He could be guilty of making War upon his People: But if the King shall be among such wrong doers, either by Force, or Fraud, the case will be otherwise. Thus when K. <HI>Edward,</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, joyned their own presence to the Illegal Actions of the two <HI>Spencers,</HI> and <HI>Robert de Vere</HI> Duke of <HI>Ireland</HI>; yet the Nobility and People took no notice of that, but prose cuted them, notwithstanding the Kings personal joyning himself with them; and <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> tho' he had the worst of it, and was taken and execu∣ted, yet was his Attainder reversed in Parliament, as I have already said; and his Quarrel with the <HI>Spencers</HI> declared to be good and just; as the like resi∣stance was also declared to have been for the safety of the King, and safeguard of the Realm, in the Parliament of 11th of <HI>Rich.</HI> the Second, wherein the Duke of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the rest of his Faction were Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emned, as I have already shewn you: and tho' I grant that in such a division between the King and his People, his Person may run a great hazard; yet it is his own fault, and not theirs, if it so fall out; and they are not to lose their Lives, Liberties and Properties, in case the King will fully joyn himself with Murderers, or Robbers, since this is not to resist Royal Authority, but Illegal Force, without any Authority at all; and if he will thus expose himself to the mercy of blind Bullets, charge is to be given to all, not to kill him wilfully, or wittingly, since we are never to despair of his Repentance, till he absolutely renounces all reconciliation with his People: and thus, even in the midst of such a resistance, the King's person may be as safe as he can be in such Circumstances, though not so safe as if he were in his own Pallace. But if an Army of wicked and lawless men must not be resisted be∣cause they have got the King's person on their side; then Prince <HI>Edward</HI> (after∣wards K. <HI>Edward</HI> the First) could not have justified his fighting with <HI>Simon Montfort,</HI> and those of his Faction, who had, as you your self acknowledged, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Person of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third into their Power, and acted all things in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Name, and by his seeming Authority; as the Historians of those times ex∣presly tell us: and the King being in <HI>Montfort</HI>'s Army at the Battel of <HI>Ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sham,</HI> was in great Danger, being then wounded in the Neck with an Arrow: So that if this Oath had been then to be taken in this sense, this rescuing of the King by his own Son out of the hands of these wicked Councellors, had been taking up Arms by his Authority against his Person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray give me leave to answer this instance you have now brought, be∣cause I think it does rather make against, than for your Opinion: I grant Prince <HI>Edward</HI> might well justifie his fighting with <HI>Simon Montfort,</HI> tho' he had the King's Person then in his Power, because the Prince very well knew that his Fa∣ther was carried about with them as a Prisoner against his will; and therefore ought to release him, tho' with some hazard to his Father's Person; since it could not be otherwise brought about. But sure there is a great deal of diffe∣rence between fighting to release my Prince, when made a Prisoner against his will, and fighting against him to take him away from Evil Councellors, whether he will or not; as the Long Parliament did against King <HI>Charles</HI> I. tho' they knew he was in the Head of his Army with his own consent; and this was sure taking up Arms by the King's Authority against his Person, and is that which is to be
<PB N="655" REF="351"/>
expresly disclaimed by this Oath; and will be also Treasonable, if done in any Case whatsoever where the King shall think fit to be at the Head of his Forces, whether the thing be lawful or unlawful for which they are raised.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, it seems the fear of endangering the King's Person is nothing, if the end for which it be done be lawful. And why it may not hold in other Cases as well as this, I can see no reason. I grant that what the Parliament did was unlawful, because the Occasion of the War began on their side, as it was then said; but supposing the King made War upon the People, I doubt not but the Case had been otherwise. And for proof of this, pray give me leave to put you a Case which may well happen, now we have a Standing Army distinct from the Militia: Suppose that in a Suit with a great Favourite of the King's, a Man recovers a House and Lands against him by a Judgment at Law, and he also by Course of Law put into Possession thereof by the Sheriff; afterwards the King's Commission is obtained by the Interest of this Favourite, to Command an Officer, and some Companies of Souldiers of the Standing Army, to take Possesion of this House, and deliver it back to the person who first had it. The Man in Possession being a stout, and powerful Person in his Country, hearing of it, resolves to maintain the Possession of his House according to Law, and therefore gets in good store of his Tenants, &amp; Neighbors to defend it: The Officer comes with his Soldiers, &amp; Summons the House; they within, refuse to yield up the Possession; whereupon an Assault ensues, in which a great many are Killed; The Man in Possession is by the King's command, Indicted for Treason or Murder for fighting against those commissioned by the King. Now, pray tell me, whether the Judges ought, ac∣cording to their Oaths, to direct the Jury to find this Man, and those of his Party guilty of the Crimes above mentioned, or not; and whether the Officer and his Souldiers are not rather to answer for this Offence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I cannot deny but this Military Commission to put a Man out of his Freehold is Illegal, and consequently void; and so may be resisted; since I know the Law says, That a man's House is his Castle, and he may justifie the defence of it against all Subjects whatsoever; but what is this, to resisting the King's Person, who was not there; for if he had, I doubt not but this Person ought to deliver it up to the King, rather than endanger His Majesties Sacred Person. Nor is this resistance considerable, it being only in a particular Case, which can no way by a general Rebellion alter this Government over the whole Nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>You speak agreeable to your own Principles. Well, but suppose the King should be perswaded by some very ill men about him to play this or the like trick, whenever he had a mind to favour one party more than another, and so should hinder the execution of the Law whenever he pleased, can you think the Nation would long endure this, without any resistance: Or suppose, to make the Case more general, the King should undertake to lay a Tax upon the whole Nation without consent of Parliament, and fearing it should not be Levyed, should resolve to do it by his Officers and Soldiers of his Standing Army; and lest they should be resisted, should march with them in person, from one County throughout to another to see the Money raised: Do you think the whole Nation out of pure deference to the King's Person were bound to permit him to do
<PB N="656" REF="352"/>
whatever he pleased, and let the Soldiers take this Tax, which they were certainly not obliged to Pay, had he not been personally there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I am of that opinion that they ought; for it were better to Pay it, then that a Civil War should happen about it, in which the King's Person, as well as the Government, may be destroyed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you are of this opinion, because you fancy that the whole Govern∣ment consists in the King's Person alone, which it does not; but in the Legisla∣tive Power, which is not in the King alone; but in the King together with the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament: Therefore you are mistaken in supposing that this Resistance must needs alter the Frame of the Government, since it is undertaken to maintain the fundamental Constitution of it; for if the King may take what Money he pleases from the People, and make what Laws he will without the Parliament, and without supposing it lawful to resist him if he does, the Fundamental Constitution of this Kingdom will be but a Jest, con∣sidering how light some Princes make of their most Solemn Declarations to their People; nay, their very Coronation Oaths now adays: And it is a strange Paradox that one man may defend his Life and Property against the King's single Person, in case he go about to Rob or Murder him; and yet that a whole Na∣tion should not have the like Right; and that a Prince may not Rob or Murder men by himself, yet may do it without any resistance, in case he can raise an Army to back him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let what will happen, I am for understanding this Oath and Declara∣tion, in the strict literal sense, which you by your false glosses go about to destroy; therefore to tell you plainly my mind, I think, neither one single Person, nor yet the whole Nation can justifie resistance of the King's Person, no, tho' he should go about to Rob or Murder me; it were better I were killed, or lost all I had, than that the Sacred Blood of my Prince should be shed by my hands: Since the whole Parliament have on behalf of the People actually re∣nounced all defensive Arms against the King, (by which I suppose they mean all defensive Arms against his Person;) nor have you as yet answered my two last Objections, concerning that Renunciation of the Two Houses, and the want of a competent Authority to raise the Arms of the whole Nation in case of that which you call a General Invasion of Mens Religion, Liberties, and Properties; if ever any such thing should happen, as it is not likely it ever will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Principles and Mine are so diametrically opposite, that it's no wonder we may draw quite contrary Conclusions; for whereas you suppose that Nations were made for Princes to Govern, and dispose of at their Pleasure, with∣out any resistance on the Peoples side, let them do what they will: I suppose that Princes are made for the common good of their People; and where their Happiness and Preservation do not interfere, ought inviolably to be preserved; but when through the Folly, Negligence, or Tyranny of Princes, that which was ordained for their Protection proves their Ruin and Destruction; I think the Preservation of the Princes Person ought to give place to the Publick Good; and better that he than the whole Nation should perish; which though it was the opinion of <HI>Calaphas</HI> in relation to our Saviour, yet it is so well approved of, that it is said by the Evangelist St. <HI>Iohn,</HI> that he spake not that of himself, but
<PB N="657" REF="352"/>
being High Priest that year he Prophecyed. For there may be a Common Civil Government without a King, but there can be no King without a Peo∣ple. Of this Opinion our English Ancestors always were, who though they often resisted, and sometimes deposed their Kings; yet they still maintained Kingly Government, though with the change of the person. And if it fail'd in the last Civil War, it was because it was at last managed by a faction of men of quite different Principles both in Religion and Politicks, and not by the No∣bility and Gentry of the Nation, whose interest it was, and ever will be to maintain the ancient Government of a limited Monarchy; without falling into a Common-wealth or giving up their just Rights, and Liberties to an Ar∣bitrary Power.</P>
<P>But to answer the rest of your objections, which, if what I have already layd down be Law, and reason too, may be easily done. As to the first Objection, The two Houses might very well renounce the power of making any War offensive or defensive against the King, and yet leave the right of resistance for self defence and preservation to the whole nation in general; since the former was necessary unless they would have asserted a right in themselves of sitting whether the King would or not, and waging a War against him whenever they pleased; after he had actually dissolved them; which would be to set up two equal absolute powers at once in the Kingdom. But that they did not renounce it for the whole Kingdom, is plain; for though by the Statute of the 12th of <HI>Charles</HI> the II. they disclaim all coercive power over the Kings person for themselves and the People either collectively or representatively, yet do they neither there nor in any of these Acts for the Mili∣tia renounce all defensive Arms for the defence of their Religion, Liberties, and Properties: There being a great deal of difference between such a defence and a coercive power over the King, as I have already sufficiently proved; nor indeed was it in the power of the Parliament to have done it if they would, since they are but Trustees for the People to preserve their just right and had no power so really to give up their Religion, Lives, Liberties, and Properties to the Kings mercy. So that this renunciation of all defensive Arms on the be∣half of the whole People had been absolutely void in it self: And since it would have rendered the legal constitution of the Government of this Kingdom wholy precarious, if notwithstanding the illegality of the Kings Commissions, and their being void if granted to illegal purposes; the King's presence shall render it downright Treason to resist them. And if this be so, the last difficulty will be easily answered, <HI>viz.</HI> By what Authority or Commission the People may make this general resistance? To this I say, That in the first place all Commissions granted to persons uncapable by Law to take them, or for illegal purposes, are to be supposed to be issued contrary to the Kings will and knowledge, and therefore are to be look'd upon as void in Law; and consequently the Persons not to be commissioned at all, and so may be resist∣ed by the Kings legal Officers all over <HI>England,</HI> as I have already proved; but if once the King should Countenance and Abett such Robbers by his own personal presence, this resistance may then be made, and justified by the whole nation, not by the King's Authority against his Person, but by another
<PB N="658" REF="353"/>
higher and precedent right, <HI>viz.</HI> The Right of Self-defence, and the Com∣mon-safety of the whole Nation; which the People must have reserved to themselves at the first Institution of the Government, or else all Monarchies would be alike and there would be no difference at all between absolute and limited Kingdoms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not trouble my self about other Kingdoms, but this much I firmly believe that our Kings are absolute Monarchs notwithstanding they have limited themselves by Law to the manner of their administration of these grand essentials of Government, the making of Laws, and raising of money; so that since the supremacy of the Government is still in themselves as Gods Vicegerents here on Earth, and not as the Peoples Deputies; I cannot but still understand this Oath in the strict litteral sence in which I am confident this Parliament meant it, and therefore since they have expresly declared the Law to be so, I will not be wiser than the Law; especially since it is most agreeable to the Scriptures, and the known doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that the Kings Person is not only unaccountable, but irresistable too upon any pretence whatsoever; and I think I am able to shew you that it is much better for this Nation or any other of a like constitution to suffer the worst that may happen from the ill Government, nay Tyranny of our Kings, than to involve themselves in blood and confusion by Rebellion and Ci∣vil Wars; as often as the People shall judge, though never so falsly, that their fundamental Rights and Priviledges are forceably invaded by the King.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have very expresly proved at our 5th meeting, and that from undoubted Testimonies from our ancient Histories, and Writers of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> as also from the whole constant Tenour of the Statute Law of this Nati∣on that the Kings of <HI>England</HI> are not limited by their own concessions in the manner of the Administration of their Soveraign Power, but from the first con∣stitution of the Government; and if the King be not the sole supreme Legislative power, I care not what some Divines have writ to the contrary; and since it is a Law question, the supreme Authority alone ought to decide it. And therefore it is no matter in this case what the Scriptures say, nor yet the Church of <HI>England,</HI> the former hath not, and the latter cannot determine what is the Legal constitution of the Government in this Nation; and where the su∣preme power resides: and therefore suppose it to have been the intent of this Parliament never so much to bar all resistance of the Kings Person in any case what∣soever, yet I am sure it was not in their power to do things absolutely inconsi∣stent and contradictory in themselves, as they must have done had they made the Persons of all Officers however commissioned by the King absolutely irresisti∣ble; and much more if they had induced the Kings Presence with an absolute power for them to commit the most violent and illegal action; and yet have supposed they had thereby altered nothing in the constitution of the Govern∣ment, though they had rendred it instead of a Limitted, an Absolute Despo∣tick Monarchy; which as I am not yet convinced it was in their will, so neither was it in their powers to grant if they would: And therefore as I do not desire to be wiser than the Law, so I cannot allow this to be any Law at all in the sense you would put upon it; so that make the most of it this was but the unwary declara∣tion
<PB N="659" REF="353"/>
of a Parliament of very young Men, not long after the King's coming in; who thorough the great Abhorrence they had of the late Civil War raised by the Parliament, under colour of the King's Authority, were drawn in before they were aware, to be a little too free in their Expressions, not considering the con∣sequences that might follow: But when this sond Fit was over, and that a standing Army had been raised in <HI>England</HI> under pretence of the Dutch War, and that the King had by his Declaration of Indulgence made some approaches to an Arbitrary Power, and in order thereunto, would in that very Parliament in 1675. have imposed this very Oath or Test, not only upon those who were to take it before, but upon all Peers and Parliament Men before ever they sate in the Two Houses, as also, upon all Officers in Church and State, to the very Ju∣stices of Peace; so that the Disguise being now seen thorough, it made divers of the Peers, even those of greatest Loyalty and Wisdom stiffly to oppose the laying this Test upon all the Clergy, Nobility, and Gentry of the whole Nation, as it was then the design of the Bishops and Court-Party to have done: Which vigo∣rous Opposition, tho' in the smaller number, yet met with such good success, that the Bishops and Lords of the contrary Opinion, could not then carry it; and the Eyes of the whole Nation were afterwards so much opened, that the King durst never offer this Test any more to either of the Two Houses: So that if you will but consider this matter of Fact, how this Test was first obtain'd; and how afterwards, when it was thought to be intended to set up Arbitrary Power, was also as vigorously opposed by them; and their being sensible that the Parliament had gone too far already in doing what they had done: I think none can take this Oath in your sense except those Cler∣gymen, who will allow none to be of their Church, but those who are for this Passive Obedience; according to their prejudicate Notions of Loy∣alty, or else some few mercenary Lawyers, who in hopes of Preferment (which they can never otherwise obtain) would interpret this Oath in such a sense as should make us all Papists, and Slaves too, whenever the King has a mind to it. Now which of these extreams are worst, that the people should judge for themselves (tho' perhaps erroneously) when the King, or those acting by his illegal Commissions, shall violently assault them in their Religion, Lives, Liberties and Estates; that thereupon they make Resistance with one consent, when they find themselves brought to this extremity; or else that the King should be thus invested with an irresistible Power of doing whatever he pleased with us; I durst leave to any indifferent person to judge.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have told me more concerning the History of this Oath, than ever I knew before; but let the legal sense of it be what it will, and setting aside the Precepts in Scripture for absolute Submission without any resistance, I think I am able to prove from your own grand Topick of the common good and preservation of Mankind; that it is much better to submit to the worst, and greatest Tyrant that ever was, than to resist him, if he be our lawful Prince, for if you consider what is the Subject of all Humane Happiness and Contentment, it is certainly life; now what Tyrant ever in his whole Reign
<PB N="660" REF="354"/>
destroyed so many Mens lives by force,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> An An∣swer to Dr. <HI>King</HI>'s State of the Prote∣stants in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> p. 32, 35, 36.</NOTE> or unjust Prosecutions, as a Civil War, if carried on with violence and animosity does in a years time; so vast a distance there is between the Evils of Tyranny and Rebellion, and so much is the Remedy worse than the Disease; the Cruelty of a Tyrant (says one) is like a Clap of Thunder, it strikes with great terrour; but Civil War is like an Inundation, it sweeps away all before it, without noise: Thus one Man brought to the Scaffold by the Arbitrary Command of a Tyrant, makes more noise than ten Thousand killed in the Field in a Civil War, but that does not make the Evil the less, but the greater Evil while we are made willing to destroy our selves, and do it more effectually in one day, than the bloodiest Tyrant could find in his heart to do in his whole Reign: All the men put to death by the Arbitrary Commands of Tyrants since the begin∣ning of the World in all the Kingdoms of it, will not amount to half the num∣ber of those who have perish'd in the Roman, or English Civil Wars; so much safer are we in God's hands than in our own, and in theirs under whom God hath placed us; and tho' he often makes them like the Sun, and Sea, (tho' highly useful in themselves) scourges for our Sins, yet he has promised to keep their hearts in his hand, and to turn them as seemeth best unto him; we have more Promises of safety there,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ps.</HI> 68.30.</NOTE> than when we are delivered over to the Beasts of the People, whose madness <HI>David</HI> compares to the raging of the Sea.</P>
<P>In short, The strict Restraint of the People by Government is their truest Liberty and Freedom, since if they were at Liberty from Government, they would be exposed to Combat one another: which would be worse than the greatest slavery in the World: the great mistake is in the foolish Notion we have of Liberty, which generally is thought to consist in being free from the lash of Government, as School-boys, from their Master, and proves in the consequence only a Liberty to destroy each other; and yet it is for such a Liberty as this, that men most commonly begin Civil Wars, and fall a cutting of each others Throats. Therefore tho' I grant it were much better for all Princes to let their Subjects live happily, and enjoy a competent share of Ease and Plenty; but on the other side, if they will not permit them so to do, but will tyrannically op∣press them, it were much better for them to sit down contented with poverty, nay, slavery it self, rather than to destroy so great part of a Nation, as may be lost in a Civil War, whenever it begins. Thus even the Poet <HI>Lucan,</HI> tho' of <HI>Cato</HI>'s party, reckoning up the Miseries of the Civil Wars of <HI>Rome,</HI> which were all for Liberty, as if envying the happy Condition of those, who lived under absolute Tyrants, crys out,
<Q><L>Faelices Arabes, Medio{que} Aeaque Tellus,</L>
<L>Quos sub perpetuis tenuerunt Fata Tyrannis.</L></Q>
I could give you instances of the truth of this in most Nations, enough to make a History: and if such a History were written, of the Mischiefs of this false and pretended Liberty, and good of the people, I durst undertake the Compa∣rison,
<PB N="661" REF="354"/>
that more visible Mischiefs come upon the people, more destruction of the publick good, and greater loss of Liberty and Property by this one Method, than by all the Tyranny and Violence of Mankind put together: and consequent∣ly, that there is no Comparison 'twixt the Evils of Tyranny, and of a Civil War, for publick good; and that the Mischiefs of this pretence of publick good, is infinitely less tolerable, and a more Universal Ruine to the people, than any Tyranny of lawful Governors, that ever was in the World; whereas this is by many degrees the greatest, and most lawless Tyranny, and always brings grea∣ter mischief along with it, such as Confusion, Rapin, Violence, Contempt of all Laws, and legal Establishments, with more intolerable Evils of all sorts, than those it pretends to remedy.</P>
<P>But of all pretences for Rebellion, Religion is the most ridiculous; since a Man's Religion can never be taken from him, or a false one imposed upon him, whether he will or not; and also because a Civil War introduces greater immo∣rality, and more loosens the Reins of Discipline, and is more contrary to the Spirit of true Religion, than any other Thing in the World: true Religion is not propagated by the Sword, it is a small still Voice that cannot be heard in War; War confounds it, and debauches it, the most profligate, and licentious Court bears no proportion in wickedness to the lewdness, blasphemy, and con∣tempt of all that is Sacred, which reigns, and overflows in Camps. It was an old and true Saying, <HI>Nulla sides, Pietas{que} viris qui Castra sequuntur.</HI></P>

<P>I see when neither the Scripture, nor the Law can justifie your absurd Doctrine of Passive Obedience; then you fly back to your old Topick the Law of Nature and common good of Mankind: I allow your Principles, but not the deductions you draw from thence, which are indeed but Paralogisms, as I will shew you by and by; but I see there is nothing so false and absurd, which Preju∣dice and Education will not make men swallow; I confess, you have made a long and ingenious Harangue in a Commendation of the Benefits of Tyranny and Slavery: which had you done only for an exercise of your Wit, I should have ranked it with <HI>Cardan</HI>'s Panegyrick of <HI>Nero,</HI> and the praise of the Government; but if you vent such Notions in good earnest, I cannot forbear shewing you the absurdity of them.</P>
<P>First therefore admitting what you say for truth, that a Civil War does de∣stroy more men in one Battel, than the greatest Tyrant hath ever done in his whole Reign; Is this an Argument that no man may defend either his Life or Liberty against Arbitrary Power? if this were true Reason, it were the greatest folly in the World for the <HI>Poles,</HI> or any other Nation that are at Wars with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> ever to resist them; for their Emissaries might thus make use of your Argument to make them submit to them: Life is the only state of Happiness in this World; and without which nothing can be enjoyed: It is therefore better for you to be made Slaves than to venture a Battel; for in the Fight God knows how many of you may be destroyed, whereas if you quietly submit, we promise to hurt none of you, we will only carry you away, and sell you for Slaves, and sure Slavery is better than Death; for even Slaves enjoy a great many Comforts of life, tho' with some hardships, and you may be redeemed again, or make your escape; but life once lost can never be recovered: The same Argument a

Tyrant may use for the exercise of his Arbitrary Power over mens lives; that he will not (nay, cannot) destroy the whole Nation, but only use them as Butchers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Sheep, cull out the fattest, and let the poor ones live, thrive and grow fat, till they are likewise ready for the Knife: This perhaps may be a proper life for those Beasts that cannot live without Man's protection; but what man of any courage or sense, would be willing to live under a Government where his Poverty was to be his only Protection? who would not venture his life in one brisk Battel, rather than live in such a vile and slavish Condition? and who would not rather argue thus, It is great odds, if among so many Thousands, I am the person ordained for Death; or if I am, I may perhaps purchase Victory for my Countrymen, and Liberty for my Posterity; but let the worst happen, I ven∣ture my life for the publick good; and it is better once to die, than always to live in fear.</P>
<P>But if the Calculation of the number of mens lives, that may be lost in the recovery, or maintaining any right whatever, should be the only rule to render War either reasonable, or lawful; I doubt whether most of the Wars Princes make for small Territories, or Punctilio's of Honour; (as lowering the Flag for example) nay, even for the recovery of their Crowns, when unjustly detained or taken from them, can upon your principle ever justifie either Princes in Conscience to make such Wars, or oblige Subjects in prudence, (according to your Rule of the publick good) to fight in such quarrels; since none of them but often cost more Lives to defend, or regain them, if lost, than the things are worth that the Princes of the World usually make War about, against each other.</P>
<P>But if you tell me, that men are bound by the Law of God, and of their Country to assist their Prince in any Wars he shall Command them; without inquiring into the Consequences of it: and let what will happen as to the loss of mens Lives, Estates or Liberties; that we are likewise to obey and submit to lawful Princes; because, let them tyrannize, enslave or destroy us never so much, yet God has put us into their hands; and we are safe in God's hands whilst we are in theirs; This is all a meer fallacy, for what is this to your main Argument from the destruction of Mankind; for, if so many men are to lose their lives in the War, what difference is it as to them, whether the War be made by a lawful or unlawful Power, it is still upon this Principle unlawful to be made, and consequently unlawful to be fought for; and if you once grant that Princes may tyrannize without resistance, kill or enslave any of their Subjects; what difference is it, as to the people that are to suffer it, whether he be a lawful Prince or a Tyrant or Usurper that does it: for as for being delivered by God into the hands of a lawful Prince to be dealt withal as he shall think good, it is all meer Jargon: pray prove to me (if you can) that whil'st a Prince thus ty∣rannizes, oppresses, and enslaves his people, that God ever thus deliver'd the people into his hand for that design, or that whil'st he does so, he acts as God's Minister. This I have urged you to prove at our 4th meeting; but since you could not do it, I take the case for desperate.</P>
<P>But to answer your Comparisons of the Sun and Sea, to which, you compare lawful Princes that turn Tyrants; they are as easily retorted upon you: if the
<PB N="663" REF="355"/>
rays of the Sun are too hot, we may resist them, and put on thicker Cloaths: or set up shelters to defend our selves from them: the like we may say of his malignant Influences or Effects upon mens Bodies, could there be any means found out as easily to avoid them. So likewise for the Sea, suppose the break∣ing in of it upon any Country to be sent by God for their Sins, you will not say it is unlawful for the people to make Banks or Dikes, or use any other natural means to keep it out, or to drain it away; and the case is the same as to Tyranny, for if resistance be as natural a means against it, as these I have mentioned are against the too violent heat of the Sun, or breaking in of the Sea, I cannot see why we may not as lawfully exercise it; But since we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alking of Waters, this puts me in mind of the place you have now cited out of Proverbs, <HI>That the heart of the King is in the hand of the Lord</HI>; which without doubt is a great truth: but then you should have added what immediately follows; <HI>as the Rivers of Waters he turneth it whithersoever he will</HI>; now, how does God turn Rivers of waters? it is not by any super-natural means, but either by a strong VVind, or else by the hands of Men. So likewise that <HI>Solomon's</HI> Comparison of God's turning the Hearts of Kings like Waters, is but an allusion to the Custom of those Eastern Countries,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Dr. <HI>Pa∣trick</HI>'s Para∣phrase, and Annotations on this Text.</NOTE> that as a Gardiner draws the streams of water through the trenches he cuts, into what part of the Garden he thinks good; so doth God turn the Hearts of Princes to act, or do quite contrary to their first intentions, nay, to what they have actually done before; but how, is this perfor∣med? it is only as he makes use of the Gardiner to turn the streams of Water; it is wholy by Humane means, such as Advice of good and wise Counsellors, and a prudent Consideration upon it; to which also may be added, the Resistance of their Subjects, when after all Remonstrances and In∣treaties to the contrary, Princes still go on outragiously to oppress them; when they see they will no longer bear it, and find themselves engaged in a trou∣blesom War with them, they then see their Errour, and send to their Subjects and offer them terms of Peace. Thus divers of our Kings hearts were turned, when they saw the Nation would all as one Man resist their tyrannical Arbitrary Proceedings, they came to Terms with them, and granted them <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and other good Laws for the security of their just Rights and Liberties: But as for what you say of our being safe in the hands of Tyrants, as being in God's hands; I grant we are still in God's hands even when we fall under the power of Thieves and Robbers; But is our safety then so great, as when we are out of their hands? Or, may we not get from them by force, if we are able?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.

<P><PB N="664" REF="356"/>As for unnecessary Wars undertaken, without any such cause, for meer pre∣tences of Liberty, and the publick good; and which may have sometimes caused many more Mischiefs and Inconveniencies than those they pretended to cure; meerly does it therefore follow that no Wars, tho' against insupportable Tyranny, and for self-defence have never been nor may be undertaken by any Nation in the World? and that the state they are in after such a War, is always much worse than it was before; which is notoriously false, as you may see by so many instan∣ces I have given you from our own Histories; as I could also shew you from other Countries, such as the <HI>Switzers</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> who have by defending their Liberties when unjustly oppressed, brought themselves into a state of Plenty, Liberty, and Safety; and therefore notwithstanding your making so light of mens Just Rights, Liberties and Properties, there are certainly such things that distinguish a free people from slaves, as any who will but travel into <HI>France, Turkey,</HI> or any other Arbitrary Government, may easily satisfie themselves: and if these things ought to be really esteemed, as the causes of all the earthly happi∣ness we enjoy, then certainly they may be defended, and fought for; and if in the purchase of them many mens Lives happen to be lost, this is no necessary consequence; since such Reformations are often brought about with very little Bloodshed; as appears by many instances I have now given of such resistance, and may more evidently appear by this late great and wonderful Revolution; but admitting it should happen, (as you say) and that a great part of a Nation should be destroy'd in a Civil War for their just Rights and Liberties; yet it is still upon your own Topick better for Mankind that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t should be so, if true Li∣berty (I do not mean from lawful Authority) may be but obtain'd at last there∣by, since life is not to be esteemed only for meer living, but living happily, <HI>non est vivere, sed valere vita</HI>; and life is enjoyed by Slaves in Galleys, as much as by the greatest Prince, yet no rational man but will allow that Men may venture their lives, rather than suffer themselves, and their Posterity to fall into that miserable Condition; the like he may, if they were only to be reduced to the Condition of the meer Peasants in <HI>France,</HI> or ordinary Christians in <HI>Turkey</HI>; and if so, I think I may then safely affirm, that it is better that half the people of any Country should be destroyed by a Civil War, if their just Rights, and Liberties may be preserved to them, and their Children at the last, then that Slavery, with all its consequences, such as Ignorance, baseness of Mind, Cowardice, Beggary, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should ever be entailed upon a Nation; for as for the loss of Men, it may be made up again in some Genera∣tions; but when Mens civil Liberties and Properties are once lost, they cannot without some rare and unexpected Revolution be ever regained; as we see in the Subjects of all sorts in <HI>France, Turkey,</HI> and <HI>Muscovy,</HI> &amp;c. at this day: and therefore if you please better to consider, the real Liberties of a people (such as we contend for) are not that of School-Boys to be free from the Lash of their Masters, however that if such a Discipline were to be exercised upon Men all their life-times, I think no man but would say it were worth venturing his life, rather than to fall into so miserable a state; so that what you cite from the Poet <HI>Lucan,</HI> is only to be taken as a Poetical Exclamation against the Miseries that Civil Wars often bring upon a Nation; but to say that it was <HI>Lucan</HI>'s Opinion that Subjection under the severest Tyrant was better than the Liberty the people
<PB N="665" REF="356"/>
of <HI>Rome</HI> enjoyed, is to suppose that either you or I have never read that Author since nothing is more plain, than that the main design of that Poem is to magnifie <HI>Cato</HI> and <HI>Pompey,</HI> who fought for the Liberty of their Countrey above <HI>Caesar,</HI> and those that joyned with him to destroy it: As for all the rest that you have said, that you could make a History of greater Miseries, as loss of Liberty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that have come upon whole Nations by fighting for their Just Rights and Liberties against Tyrants, than by all the Tyranny, and Violence of Mankind; I think you would have a hard task to make it good, since I suppose under Absolute Mo∣narchies it is unlawful for the People to take up Arms, till they are either like to be enslaved, or destroyed by the Tyranny of their Prince, or else so intolerably op∣prest by his Souldiers, that they can scarce even in a state of War live in a much worse condition; and if they are ever subdued and reduced to their former condi∣tion, they cannot be worse than what they were under before: The like I may say as to Limited Monarchies, or Common-wealths, that degenerate into Tyran∣nies, the People may perhaps better their condition by Resistance, and recover their Liberties, but cannot be in a worse, if, they are overcome; for I do not allow such Resistance lawful till the very Fundamental Constitutions of their Government, whereby it is distinguisht from an Arbitrary Despotick Power, be actually invaded, or taken from them; so that let the worst that can happen, they can scarce fall into worse condition than they were before: And as for <HI>England,</HI> we may speak it experimentally, that of all the Resistances that have been made by the <HI>Major</HI> part of the Nation, or greater part of it in defence of their Just Rights and Liberties, every one of them have happened for the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, and been a means of restoring this Kingdom to its former Estate; except the last, in which I grant we lost it by that War; yet that was not from the Do∣ctrine it self, but because the War was begun and carried on by a Violent Faction upon unjust grounds, and, which was worse, the Government and Disci∣pline of the Church as Establisht by Law was altered without any Legal Power; all which could never have happened had not that War been not only begun, but continued to the very last by a Standing Army, which could give what Laws they pleased even to those that pretended to command them: So that why the Abuse of this Right once in a Thousand years should be made any just Argument against the ever using it at all, I can see no reason in the World for it.</P>
<P>As to the rest of your Discourse against making any War about Religion that is also as fallacious; for tho' I grant that true Religion is not to be propagated, yet I think it may lawfully be defended by the Sword, especially where it is the received Establish'd Religion of a Nation, or else the defence of Religion against Infidels would be no Argument at all to fight against a Turkish or Popish Prince that unjustly invaded us: For tho' it is true that Religion cannot be taken away from any Man without his consent, yet a Man may be taken from his Religion; and when the Professors are destroyed either by Martyrdom, or violent Persecu∣tion, as bad, or worse than death, what will become of the Church and Religion Establisht by Law, when all the Persons that constitute that Church are driven away, destroyed, or made to renounce it? And for this we need go no farther than over the Water to our next Neighbour. It is likewise as fallacious what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> urge of the great Corruption of Manners by Civil Wars, which if it be any Argu∣ment
<PB N="666" REF="357"/>
at all, is so against all Standing Armies whatever, whether raised by law∣ful or unlawful Powers: And I think there was much more debauchery in the King's late Camp at <HI>Hounslow-heath,</HI> as also in all places where they quartered, than was lately at <HI>York,</HI> or <HI>Nottingham,</HI> among those that took up Arms in defence of their Religion or Civil Liberties unjustly invaded by the King and his Ministers; nor does it always happen that Armies raised for defence of Religion and Civil Liberty must prove debaucht, since we may remember that the Parliament Ar∣my (to its praise be it spoken) was infinitely more sober, and outwardly reli∣gious than the King's; but if you will say that this proceeded from their Prin∣ciples, as well as good Discipline, I know no reason why Men who fight in defence of their Religion and Civil Liberties, may not upon Church of <HI>England</HI> Principles as to Church-Government and Common-Prayer, and also by a strict Discipline, be as little debaucht as any Standing Armies the most lawful Monarch can main∣tain; who if they lye idle, as ours have done all this King's Reign till now of late, are more likely to fall into all the wickedness that attend a loose Discipline, and want of Imployment, and consequently may also corrupt the Places where they Quarter by their ill example.</P>

<P>I shall not longer argue this point since I see it is to no purpose. But you have not yet told me what these fundamental Rights and Liberties are, that you suppose the People may take up Arms to defend; nor yet what num∣ber of the Nation may thus judge for themselves, and take up Arms when they please; for it may so happen that the whole Nation may be divided as to their opinions concerning these things: And the South part of <HI>England</HI> (for example) may think their Religion, and Liberties in great danger, and that it is very necessary to take up Arms for it, when the North parts are not under those apprehensions, but lye still; as was lately seen in the riseings for the Prince of Orange.</P>

<P>As to the first of these queries I think I can easily give you satisfaction and such as you can have nothing material to reply to: And as for the other though I do not say I can give you such an answer as will bear no exception or reply, yet I doubt not but it will be that which may very well be defended and may serve to satisfie any indifferent and unprejudiced person; And which if not allowed will draw much worse consequences along with it. And therefore as for the just Rights and Liberties we contend for, they are only such as are contained in <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and the Petition of Right, and are no more than the immemorial Rights and Liberties of this Kingdom, and that first. In respect of the safety of mens lives and the liberties of their persons: aly. The securi∣ty of their Estates and Civil Properties. And 3ly. The enjoyment of their Re∣ligion as it is established by the common consent of the whole Nation. All which I will reduce to these plain Propositions.</P>
<P N="1">1. That no Freeman of <HI>England</HI> ought to be imprisoned, or ar∣rested contrary to Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Pryns</HI> 1<HI>st.</HI> part of the Vindication of the Rights of English Freemen.</NOTE> without specifying the cause of his commitment in the warrant or mittimus, whereby he is sent to prison: And he ought not to be sent out of the body of the Country, or Jurisdiction where the crime was supposed to be committed, unless he be removed by due course of Law: nei∣ther
<PB N="667" REF="357"/>
ought he by the Law of <HI>England</HI> to be detained in Prison without Trial only for a punishment; but ought to be Tried the next Assizes or Goal-deli∣very, or within some reasonable time to be allowed of by the Court. And this was Common-Law many Ages before the Act of <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> made in the 31st of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, which does but ascertain that Law concerning bail∣ing men for all manner of Crimes in case no Prosecution come in against them: much less can the King or any Court below the whole Parliament banish any man the Kingdom in any case unless by some known Law already made whereby he is bound to abjure it upon a lawful Trial by his Peers and conviction by his own Confession.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor can the King nor any Courts of Justice condemn a man to loss of Life, or Members, without due Trial by his Peers, and Legal Judgment given thereupon.</P>
<P>And for proof of this I need go no farther than <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and the Pe∣tition of Right which are both but declaratory of the Common-Law of <HI>England<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> see therefore <HI>Magna Charta cap.</HI> 29. Whereby it is declared, and enacted, that no freeman may be taken and imprisoned, or be disseised of his freehold, or Liberties, or his free customs, or be Outlawed, or exiled, or in any man∣ner destroyed but by the lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the land, which is also farther confirmed and explained by these Statutes, <HI>viz.</HI> the 37, 38, 42. of <HI>Edward</HI> III. and 17. of <HI>Richard</HI> the II. all which are summed up,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 18.9.3. <HI>Cap.</HI> 6.</NOTE> and more particularly declared against, contrary to the fundamental Laws of the land in the Petition of Right exhibited to King <HI>Charles</HI> the I. in Parlia∣ment in the thirtieth of his Reign; wherein the late imprisonment of the Kings Subjects without any cause shewed, and the denial of <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> are ex∣presly resented; as also putting Souldiers and Mariners to death by Martial Law in time of peace: And the King's answer to this Petition is remarkable, The King willeth that Right be done according to the Statute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Customs of the Realm,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hwaths</HI> Hist. Col. pt. 1. p. 597. 598. 625.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which not satisfying as too doubtful and general, the King at last gave this full and clear answer in legal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm, <HI>Soit Droit fait comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> il est de∣sirè.</HI></P>
<P>The Second point in relation to our Civil Properties is this, That no Tax, Taillage or Aid shall be laid or levy'd by the King with∣out the consent of the Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Earls, Barons, Knights, Burgesses, and whole Commonalty of the Realm in Parliament; this was first of all granted by the 56th Law of <HI>William</HI> the First, which I have already cited; as also more parti∣cularly forbid by the Statute <HI>de Tallagio non concedendo</HI> in the 34th of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, which was but a revival, or explanation of the former Law of <HI>William</HI> the First, and also by the 25th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, whereby it is Enacted,
<Q>That no person should be compelled to make any Loans to the King against his will, because they are against Reason, and the Franchise of the Land; and it is also provided, that none should be charged by any Charge or Imposition called a Benevolence, nor by such like Charge, which is also more fully set forth in the said Petition of Right, to have been lately executed by certain Commis∣sioners;)
<PB N="668" REF="358"/>
as also that divers other Charges have been layed and levyed by Lords-Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contrary to the Laws and free Customs of the Realm.</Q></P>
<P>The Third Point declared against in this Petition of Right, is against Quar∣tering of Soldiers (tho' they pay for their Quartors) contrary to the Will of the Owners and Inhabitants, much more when they did take free Quarter in time of Peace, as hath been too much practised of late: So that by the Common Law of <HI>England,</HI> not only Private-houses, but Inns, and Ale-houses are not compel∣lable to Quarter Soldiers, unless they will: so much was this Nation anciently a Stranger to standing Armies; and Quartering of Soldiers in time of Peace; that there was no Provision made for it, either at Common-Law, or by any Sta∣tute that I know of.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, That no new Law can be made without an express Act of Parliament; or the joynt-consent of the King, Lords and Commons: and therefore that Par∣liaments ought to be duely summon'd and held for the good and safety of the Kingdom, by Common as well as Statute Law, once every year, and according to more modern Statutes, once in three years at least; or whenever there is a just and necessary occasion for it: And for proof of this, I need go no farther than the old English Saxon Law, which ordains, that the great Council, or <HI>Mycel</HI> Synod should be held twice in the year, as the an∣cient Mirrour of Justices recites, and the constant Custome long after the Conquest, in which there never passed a year without a general Council of the whole Kingdom; and when this came by degrees to be discontinued, then were those Statutes of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, and <HI>Richard</HI> the Second made; whereby it was enacted that a Parliament should be held every year, and oftner if there were occasion.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, Since the Legislative Power of Parliaments is the very Soul, and Es∣sence of the Government, the Election of Knights, Citizens and Burgesses to sit and serve in Parliament, ought to be free; and all the Members of Parliament who have places there, either by Patents or Writs of Summons, as the Lords; or else by Election or Writs, as the Bishops ought to be present, and there to have freedom of Speech and Votes, without any Guards to over-awe or terrifie them; and none to be forced, threatned, bribed or tamper'd with to give their Votes contrary to their Consciences; either by the King or any of his Ministers: This is ordain'd by the Stat. of <HI>Westm.</HI> 1 <HI>Chap.</HI> 5. whereby it is expresly provided that all Elections ought to be free; which Sir <HI>Edward Cook</HI> in his Notes upon this Statute extends to Elections of Knights of Shires as well as other Elections since. I have sufficiently proved, that the Commons elected Members to Par∣liament, when this Statute was made; and that this was the ancient Law of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>N.</HI> 36.</NOTE> you may see in the Rolls of Parliament. 1 <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. wherein it is alledged as by the Parliament, as one of the Articles against <HI>Richard</HI> the Second in these words: <HI>Item licet de stato &amp; consuttudine Regni sui in Convocatione enjuslibet Parliamenti Populus suus in singulis Comitatibus Regni de∣beat esse liber ad eligendum, &amp; deputandum Milites pro hujusmodi Comitatibus ad inter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssendum Parliamentis, &amp; ad exponendum corum gravamina, &amp; ad prosequendum pro reme∣diis superinde prout videntur expedire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="669" REF="358"/><HI>Tamen praefatus Rex ut in Parliamentis suis liberius consequi valeat suae temerariae voluntatis effectum, direxit mandata sua frequentius Vicecomitibus ejus ut certas Personas per ipsum Regem nominatas, ut milites C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mitatuum, venir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saciant ad Parliamenta sua; quos quidem Milites eidem Regi faventes induc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re poterat, prout frequentius fecit, quando{que} pro minas varias, &amp; terrores, &amp; quando{que} per munera ad consentiendum illis qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a Regno praedicto pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ejudicialia fuerant, &amp; Populo quam plurimum onerosa,</HI> &amp;c. So that you here may see, that it was then judged by the whole Parliament to be a brench of one of the Fundamental Liberties of the Nation, for the King to make false re∣turns to be made of Parliament-Men, as also, to corrupt, or over-awe their Votes, either by Promises or Threat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings.</P>
<P>But to conclude, that we have such things as Fundamental Laws, and Privi∣ledges, I shall go no farther than King <HI>Iames</HI> I. his Speech confirmed by an Act of Parliament of the First year of his Reign; wherein it is recited,
<Q>That the King hath vouchsafed to express many ways, how far it is, and ever shall be from his royal, and sincere care, and affection, to the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> to alter, or innovate the Fundamental Laws, Priviledges, and good Customs of this Kingdom, whereby not only his royal Authority, but the Peoples Security of Lands, Livings, and Priviledges (both in general and particular) are preser∣ved and maintained, and by the abolishing, or alteration of which it is impos∣sible, but that present Confusion will fall upon the whole State, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rame of this Realm.</Q>
So that if this Judgment of the King and both Houses of Parliament was true; sure we may justly suppose, that things of such vast concernment deserve our contending for, by all means possible and lawful to preserve them; for what the Nobles of the Land upon occasion once said with one Voice in full Parliament, every Free-born Subject of <HI>England,</HI> may as well say at this day, <HI>Nolumus Leges Angliae mutari</HI>; which is a Maxim that ought to be imprinted upon the Hearts of all true Englishmen; who, (as my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> very well observes) take themselves to have as good Title to their Laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>Ba∣con</HI>'s Let∣ters p. 43.</NOTE> as to the common Air they breathe in; and King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, somewhere says,
<Q>That it was his Maxim, that the King's Prerogative is to Defend the Peoples Liberties, and that the peo∣ples Liberty strengthens the King's Prerogative:</Q>
For indeed, if the Foundations are destroyed, the Superstructure cannot stand; and if this Rule had been well observed by this King's Sons, we had not been reduced to this great Confusion we now lye under. For my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> calls those Flatterers who put the King upon such Dangerous Courses,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 41.</NOTE> as great Traitors to him in the Court of Heaven, as he that draws his Sword against him:
<Q>And King <HI>Iames</HI> I. in his Speech in Parliament, 1609. Calls all those who perswade Kings not to be confined within the limits of their Laws, Vipers, and Pests, both against them, and the Common-wealth.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I shall not go about to defend such ill men, whoever they be; yet since such Insinuations are done privately, and in a Corner it is very hard for Subjects to judge when such Evil Councils are in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>used into the Ears of Princes; and much more unjust for them to make any resistance on pretence to remove them: and therefore besides the absurdity of making Subjects both
<PB N="670" REF="359"/>
Judges and Parties, you have not yet told me, what number of men must be at once oppressed in their Fundamental Rights (as you call them) and who may make this resistance; for methinks it is very absurd to give one County, for ex∣ample, upon the account of free Quarter, a Power of rising in Arms and re∣sisting the King's Officers and Soldiers, when perhaps all the rest of the Nation where no Soldiers are, feel no such thing.</P>

<P>I am not so unreasonable, as to maintain that Subjects ought to take Arms merely because the King gives too much ear to Flatterers and wicked Mini∣sters, or is too much led by them; let him be so, provided the people do not smart for it. But if once it comes to that pass, that they grow intolerable, and set the King upon a General Invasion of the peoples Rights in any of the great Points I have now laid down, let them look to themselves, if they will not per∣mit a Parliament to sit, and redress those Grievances▪ they must expect the Nation will rise at last against them, as they did against <HI>Gaveston,</HI> and <HI>Spencers</HI>; and make them undergo that punishment they so well deserve: But as for what you say of making the people Judges, when their Rights and Liberties are inva∣ded; the Consequence is as bad if the King alone shall judge, as for example in the Case of Ship-Money, the Judges gave their Opinions that the King might raise Money for Ships of War in case of Necessity, without any controul; but if he be sole Judge of this Necessity, he might lay this Tax as often, and raise it to what degree he pleased. Therefore as I shall not deny that the King may judge it fit to do a great many things against the strict Letter of the Law, in cases of urgent necessity; but it will be at his peril if he judge amiss; as for example, Every man's House is his Castle, and he may lawfully defend it against all Illegal Commissions: Yet I think no man will deny, but that in case of a Fire in <HI>London,</HI> the King may by Common Law command his Officers to break open some of the next Houses, and blow them up with Gun-powder to stop the Fire; but admit he should out of malice, or mis-information command some Houses to be blown up that stood a Mile off, under pretence of stopping the Fire, do you think the Owners were bound to stand still, and let them do it?</P>
<P>But if the People must not judge when their Fundamental Rights and Liber∣ties are invaded, because they will be both Judges and Parties; then no man whatever by this Argument ought to defend himself against the violence of ano∣ther; for who can be judge, but he that feels the blow? Nor indeed could Princes make so much as Defensive Wars, since whenever they do so, they are themselves both Judges and Parties, as I told you at our Third Meeting, when I answered (as I then thought) all your Arguments against the peoples ever judging for themselves. So that if it be proved that the people in a limited Kingdom remain, as to the defence of their Lives, Liberties, <HI>Religion,</HI> and Pro∣perties, always in the state of Nature, in respect of their Prince as well as all the rest of Mankind, they must certainly make use of defensive Arms when ne∣cessity requires it, or else become Slaves whenever he pleases to make them so; may people have no right to judge of his Violence and Oppressions?</P>
<P>But as for the number that are to make this Judgment and Resistance there∣upon; I grant in most Cases this is not to be done, as long as the Oppression is begun by colour of Law, without actual violence. Secondly, when it con∣cerns
<PB N="671" REF="359"/>
only some particular Bodies of Men; thus if free Quarter should be ta¦ken in one or two Towns or Counties I do not allow it a sufficient cause for all the Neighbouring Towns, much less the whole County, or the Neighbouring Shires to take an Alarm, and rise in Arms upon it, since, perhaps, the King may know nothing of it: and if he were once informed of it, would redress it; but can you affirm the Case would be the same if this Grievance should become ge∣neral, all over the Nation? and that the King should be so far from redressing it, that he should put out a Declaration, setting forth that it was his Preroga∣tive so to do; would not the whole Nation then take it for granted, that the King's Design was to govern by a standing Army, who should live upon the people, and devour them (as they do in <HI>France</HI>) to the very Bones; and might not they make Resistance against these Robberies and Oppressions? the same I say for all other breaches made in any other of our Fundamental Rights; I do not allow any resistan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to be made, till it become a general Oppression upon all, or the major part of the Nation, and without all hopes of being other∣wise remedied, and this must be also so evident, that there can be no doubt or denial of the Matter of Fact: for so long as the Case is disputable, or the Grie∣vance is not of a general concern, I grant the people ought never to stir; but of this they alone must Judge; since our Constitution has left us no other Judges of these breaches, but the diffusive Body of the whole people in the intervals of Parliament.</P>
<P>But for your last Question, as to the number that may thus rise to make this Resistance, I answer thus, that when once the Mischief becomes general, and without all other remedy; any part of the People who think themselves strong enough to defend themselves against such violence, may begin to rise if they can, till the rest of the Kingdom can come into their assistance; as I told you the Town of <HI>Brill</HI> did against the Tyranny of the Duke <HI>D'Alva,</HI> in the beginning of the Belgick Wars, and it was soon after seconded by the revolt of divers other Cities and Towns in those Provinces; till the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were quite driven out.</P>

<P>I do not deny but you speak more moderately on this Subject than most of your opinion, who think every private man has a right to take up Arms and raise a Rebellion, whenever he judges his Person or Estate is invaded; or inju∣red by the Government. And indeed this remedy of Resistance seems at first sight prety tolerable, if it were not that we very well knew that this many-headed Beast, the Multitude, is very apt to be deluded by the cunning Spee∣ches, and sly Insinuations of factious and ambitious Men, whose Interest it will always be to fish in troubled Waters, and raise Disturbances to make them∣selves the Heads of a Party: Thus in the Year—42. what Lies and Stories were there raised to incense the People against that good King, to make them take up Arms against him, as an Invader of their Liberties; and one that was about to make War upon them; And who that is not over-partial to his own Opinions, does not see, that the Nation has been blown up into a flame by the lying Reports of a French League, and a Supposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irious Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>; neither of which, I durst pawn my life, have the least tittle of truth in them; so that this Doctrine can scarce fail▪ almost every time it is put in practice, to bring all Government to Anarchy and Confusion.</P>

<P>I have already in part answered this Objection at our Third Meeting; but since you will urge it over again, I shall in the first place admit the Matter of Fact to be as you say, that the People may, by some turbulent Demogogues, be sometimes so far incensed as to take up Arms when there is no just Occasion▪ but let me tell you▪ I doubt that neither of the Instances you have given, will make good your Assertion; for in the first place, as to King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, it is said by all Writers on the Parliaments side, that the King by leaving his Par∣liament, and going to <HI>York,</HI> and there taking a Guard when no Enemy was near, and when the Parliament had as yet, raised no Forces at all; as also by his going to <HI>Hull</HI> to remove the Magazine of Arms that lay there, in order to put them into the hands of an Army, to make War upon the Parliament, who then de∣manded the Settlement of the Militia, to be in Commissioners of their Nomina∣tion; that he thereby broke his Coronation Oath, whereby he was Sworn to Govern according to Law, and not by force. But as for what you say, as to the present juncture of Affairs: I never can desire a more plain proof of the Peoples necessity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aking up defensive Arms; since admitting that neither of the Reports concerning the French League; and the false Birth of this sup∣posed Prince be true; yet, I think, the Nation has had sufficient Provocations to rise as one man, and joyn with the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> for the obtaining of a free Parliament to set all things right, which the King's violent illegal Admi∣nistration has so much discomposed. But admitting the utmost you can sup∣pose, that sometimes the people may Judge amiss, as well as the King, and through that mis-information may take up Arms against their Prince, when there is no real Occasion; shall this abuse of a right be a sufficient cause against there ever exercising of it at all; I am sure this is no good Argument against the natural Right of Self defence between private persons in the state of Na∣ture, that some men do often abuse it; nor can I see how upon these Grounds, even Soveraign Princes may be allowed to make so much as Defensive Wars, (as I said but now) since they may pretend that themselves are wronged, and invaded, or at least are like to be so, when no such thing was really done, or intended; and so by their mis-judgment or false pretences, many millions of Lives may be lost▪ What then? must no Princes ever make War at all, till all the World be satisfied of the Justice of their Quarrel? If so, I doubt the last War of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second made against the Dutch, and this late War the King of <HI>France,</HI> has now made upon the Empire, should never have been by your Principles so much as begun; much less carried on with so great an Effu∣sion of Blood, and the Destruction of so many Cities and Towns: and whe∣ther this, as well as Tyranny at home, is not more often put in practice by Princes, than any Resistance this Nation, or all the Subjects of the World have made against such Tyranny, and Arbitrary Power, I leave it to your self, or any indifferent Person to judge.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not but I may very well join issue with you upon this point, for I think that upon those very conditions, and grounds you have now laid down the Clergymen, Lords, Gentlemen, and Commons of this Kingdom, who have either come over with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> or have taken up Arms in defence of his Late Declaration cannot justifie themselves by any of the Instances you
<PB N="673" REF="360"/>
have given for joyning themselves with him in Arms, for tho' I grant His Ma∣jesty by hearkning too much to Popish Counsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may have done many things which in strictness of Law cannot be justified; yet since they do not strike at that which you call the fundamental constitution of the Government, and has been also done without any force on the People of this Nation; but hath been either transacted by Judgment of Law, or the colour of it at least, <HI>viz.</HI> by the opinion of all or the Major part of Judges; all the Parties above men∣tion'd, ought (according to your own Principles) to have waited for the meet∣ing of the next Parliament, to whose determination they ought, by the Law of the Land, to have referred all such grievances, and violations of Laws which they had to complain of; and if then the King had refused to have remedied them, they might have had some colour (I do not say right) for taking up Arms▪ and doing what they have done; whereas I cannot see how you can, even upon your Principles defend the late risers from wilful Rebellion against the King.</P>
<P>And for proof of this, I need go no farther than the Prince of <HI>Oranges</HI> Late Declaration, which being drawn by the best advice of the Male-contents then in <HI>Holland</HI>; would not fall to mention all the violations of Law, which they thought his Majesties Government had been guilty of ever since his coming to the Crown, and therefore not to insist upon the want of right, which I conceive the Prince had to concern himself with the affairs of another Kingdom, which he had no right to: I shall however mention every Article, in which his High∣ness conceives the Religion, Laws, and civil Liberties of this Nation to be endan∣gered. In the first place as to the dispensing Power, which the King has lately assumed to himself in matters of Religion; and thereby putting into Offices and Commands persons uncapable by Law of bearing them, without taking the Test; as I shall not now dispute the Legality or Illegality of the Kings Declara∣tion concerning it, so as to that part of it that concerns Liberty of Conscience, or dispensing with the Papists and Dissenters to meet in Assemblies for their Re∣ligious Worship notwithstanding all the Acts made against Mass and Conventicles, it was no more than what King <HI>Charles</HI> the IId. had done before with the Advice of his Privy-Council; in which if it had been Rebellion to have opposed him, sure it is the same crime in the Reign of his Brother.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since I foresee your discourse upon this Subject is like to be long; and to consist of many more heads than I doubt my memory will serve to bear away; pray give me leave to answer all your instances one after another as you propose them. First then as to the late Declaration concerning the Dispensing Power, it was so far from being done by Law, or so much as the Colour of it, that be∣sides its being against divers express Acts of Parliament, which tye up the Kings hands from dispensing with the Act against publick Mass and Conventicles; as al∣so that disable all Persons whatever to act in any publick Imployments, till they have taken the Test appointed by the said Act, (in which all non obstances are expresly barred.) But this Declaration was never so much as shewn to the Privy Council, till it was ready to be published, and then indeed the King caused it to be read in Council, declaring that he would have it issued forth, tho' without ever
<PB N="674" REF="361"/>
Putting it to the Vote, or so much as asking the consents of the Privy Councel∣lours there present; though I grant the Title of it sets forth, that it was done by his Majesty in Council, to impose upon the Nation that stale cheat, where∣by this King, (as well as the last) would have had us believe, that their Decla∣rations had been issued by the consent of the Council, when God knows there was no such thing.</P>
<P>And as for any judgment, or opinion of the Judges to support it, and make it pass by colour of Law, it was never, as I can hear of, so much as propos'd to them in their judicial capacities, though perhaps it might be propos'd to the Lord Chancellor, and some of the Judges who were of the Cabal, which is no∣thing to the purpose; all that I ever heard to have been brought judicially be∣fore them, was the Case of Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> taking a Commission for a Collo∣nel of a Regiment; after he had openly declared himself a Papist; in which great point though I grant the Major part of the Judges gave their opinion for the dispensing Power, yet was it only in the case of Military commissions, as several of them afterwards declared, and not of all sorts of Imployments, as well Civil, as Military, much less for Popish heads of Colledges, Parsons and Bishops to hold their Livings, Headships, and Bishopricks, if they pleased to turn to the Romish Religion; or that the King should please to bestow them up∣on Popish Priests, it would have been as legal in the one case as in the other; Since as for Popish Heads of Colledges, and Parsons, we have had too many instances of it, and if we had none for Bishops, we must thank either the con∣stancy of most, or the timorousness of some of them, if they have not openly declared for the Romish Religion, and yet might have kept their Bishopricks, notwithstanding; but I do not at all doubt but that such a general dispensation for professed Papists to take and hold all sorts of Offices, and places of Trust, not only Military, but Ecclesiastical and Civil, would have in a little time brought all Offices and Imployments into their hands.</P>
<P>Nor is this dispensing power in matters of Religion, the sole thing aimed at by this Declaration, as appears by the very words, and whole purport of it, which is not confined to matters of Religion only, but claims an unlimited power of dispensing with all sorts of Statutes in all cases whatever, none excepted: and if so, pray tell me, what <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> or the Statute <HI>de Tallagio non concidendo,</HI> or any other Law, will signifie, whenever the King pleases to dispense with them, either as to raising Money, or taking away mens Lives, or Liberties, or Estates, contrary to Law; nay the Papists already give out (and that in Print) that all Laws for taking away Religious Orders, and Suppressures of Monasteries, are against <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> by which holy Church (that is, the Popish Religion then in being) is to injoy all her ancient Rights, and Liberties; and the Abbots, and Priors, do thereby, as well as the Bishops, and Lay Lords, reserve to them∣selves all their Ancient Rights, and free Customs: now whether this unbounded Prerogative would not quickly have destroyed not only the Ecclesiastical, but Civil constitution of this Kingdom, as they now stand establisht by Law, and would have soon introduced both Popery, and Arbitrary Government on this Nation, I leave it to your self, or any indifferent person to consider.</P>
<P><PB N="675" REF="361"/>And though I do not say, that the bare giving of Papists or Protestant Dis∣senters a Liberty of Religious Meetings, or Assemblies for Mass, or Preaching, is an infringment of the free exercise of our Religion establisht by Law, yet pray take one thing along with you, which is a matter of great moment both to the Dissenters, and to our selves; that if the King can thus by his Prerogative give both Papists, and Fanaticks a Liberty to meet publickly contrary to Law; let the latter look to it; for he may by the same Prerogative (whenever he pleases) dispense only with the Papists, and keep the Laws still on foot against the Dissenters; nay, he may by the same unbounded Prerogative, dis∣pense with all the Laws for the publick exercise of our Religion, and under pretence of dispensing with them only in some particular cases, shut up our Church Doors one after another, beginning with the Cathedrals, and so proceed∣ing by degrees to Parish Churches: and though I grant King <HI>Charles</HI> the IId. did assume a power of dispensing with all Statutes concerning Religious Meetings contrary to Law; yet the Nation had not then any sufficient reason to rise in Arms against this Declaration; since it did not extend the Kings Prerogative beyond those Acts concerning Religious Worship: and farther the Nation was not out of all hopes of having it redressed by the next Parliament, and so was not in that desperate condition in which it was lately, before the Prince of <HI>Oranges</HI> coming over. And you may remember that the Late King upon the joint Ad∣dress of the Lords and Commons against that Declaration was forced to call it in, and cancel it, which certainly ought to have been better considered by his Ma∣jesty, and those of the Popish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unto that advised him to issue out the late De∣claration, so expresly contrary to Law, and the sense of both Houses of Par∣liament, and which gave the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the rest of his Bre∣thren a sufficient ground of petitioning against it; and this was so evident, that a Jury in which the greatest part were high Prerogative Men could not upon a fair trial, but acquit them.</P>

<P>I shall not further dispute this point, since you have dwelt so long upon it, though I must still tell you, I do not look upon this as a sufficient cause for the Nations taking up arms for a reason I shall shew you by and by; and there∣fore I shall now proceed to the next head complain'd of in the Princes late Decla∣ration, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the late Commission for erecting a new Court for Causes Eccle∣siastical, but as I will not enter upon the question of the Legality of it; so on the other side it was also done by colour of Law; and the King as supream head of the Church, was told by his Ministers that he had power to erect what new Court Ecclesiastical he pleased, provided it was not of the same kind with the High Commission Court, which had been abrogated by the Stat. of the 17th of King <HI>Charles</HI> the I. as likewise particularly excepted in the Proviso, in the Stat. of the XIIth of King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. for restoring Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction to the Bishops Courts: so that admitting that Court was not legal; yet the Persons who advised the King to erect it, and the Commissioners who sate in it were only answerable for it; in the next Parliament; and though the Bishop of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> was suspended, and the President, and Fellows of <HI>Magdalen</HI> Colledge were unjustly expelled by this Court, yet sure none of these miscarriages could give the Subjects of this Kingdom any just pretences to take up Arms to redress them,
<PB N="676" REF="362"/>
being done (as I said before) by colour of Law, without any force or violence; and was also submitted to by the Parties against which these Decrees were given, and was at the most but a matter of particular concern, and reacht no farther than the said Bishop and Colledge, and did not touch the Religion and Civil Liberties of the whole Kingdom: and consequently was not of that general im∣portance, as to be any just cause of the whole Kingdoms taking Arms, much less for the Kings Officers and Souldiers to run over to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> as they lately have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>To answer what you have now said concerning the Ecclesiastical Com∣mission; that I must also tell you was issued forth without so much as any colour of Law for it; and though the late Chancellor, and some of the worst, and most Mercenary Judges countenanced it by appearing for and acting in it, yet it is very well known that it was never proposed to all the Judges to be argued in the Exchequer Chamber, as it ought to have been, before a thing of that great impor∣tance to the whole Nation had pass'd the Seals; as to what you say, that the Kings Ministers told him it was according to Law, and that they alone ought to answer for it in the next Parliament, and that no publick disturbance ought to have been made about it, because the things that, that pretended Court did, were but of a particular concern, and only reacht the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and one sin∣gle Colledge; that is but a fallacy which you put upon your self; for sure if you had better consider'd of it, you would find that what these Commissioners have already done is of a little more publick concernment than you are aware of, for pray tell me, why by the same Law, by which the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> was suspended for his refusal to silence Dr. <HI>Sharp,</HI> all the Bishops in <HI>England</HI> might not have been suspended one after another by that pretended Court, if they had refused to obey or execute any Letters or Orders from the King, tho' ne∣ver so illegal or unreasonable? since what command could be more illegal, than the King's positive order to the Bishop to suspend a Clergyman from his Diocess, without first hearing him, or giving him leave to answer for himself? So like∣wise for the case of <HI>Magdalen</HI> Colledge, by the same Law by which these Ecclesiastical Commissioners took upon them to turn out the President, and Fellows for disobeying the Kings <HI>Mandamus,</HI> by the same Law the King might put upon any other Colledge in either University, Popish Heads, and Po∣pish Fellows, till instead of Nurseries for the education of our youth in the Protestant Religion, they may become as absolute Popish Seminaries, as the Colledges of <HI>Doway,</HI> or St. <HI>Omers</HI>; and though I grant that the persons concern∣ed in these unjust Decrees, might have patiently submitted to them without any protestations against the jurisdiction of that pretended Court, since they might for some prudential reasons have thought fit to submit to them, without making any such protestation, and yet for all that not allow their Authority; but indeed the matter of fact was far otherwise, for when a part of these Com∣missioners sate at <HI>Magdalen</HI> Colledge to expel the said President and Fellows from their places contrary to Law, and the express Statutes of the Colledge, they did all severally protest against their whole proceedings, and appealed to the Kings Courts at <HI>Westminster.</HI> And it is a plain proof how willingly Dr. <HI>H.</HI> the President of this Colledge submitted to this Sentence, by his locking the
<PB N="677" REF="362"/>
Doors of his Lodgings, and leaving the Commissioners to break them open be∣fore they could get in, and put in his pretended Successour by force.</P>
<P>But as to what you say, that the King was told he might as supream Head of the Church, set up what new Court he pleased for the execution of his Eccle∣siastical Jurisdiction: it is certainly a great mistake, for I utterly deny, that the King has power to erect any new Courts either Ecclesiastical or Civil, unless by Authority of Parliament: the Kings power to make a Vicar general, being only confirmed by the Statute of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, as was also the Authority of the high Commission, by the Statute of the first of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and if either of those high spirited Princes had<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> believed themselves to have been invested with such an unbounded Prerogative, they would certainly have exercised it, without being beholding to the Parliament, but indeed it is but a subterfuge, to alledge that this Court was not of the same Nature with that of the high Commission, because it did not take upon it to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne, or commit Men to Prison, nor to administer the Oath, <HI>ex Officio,</HI> to those that were convened before them, since it is not the different name, or some small difference in the manner of the judicial proceedings, but the Causes or Matters that a Court pretends to take Cognizance of, that can make it a Court of a quite different nature; now it is notoriously known that this late Ecclesiastical Court took upon it to Judge of Matrimonial Causes, about Alimony, and concerning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmoniacal contracts, and all other misdemeanours both of Clergy and Layety, against Religion and good Manners, which were the same things the late high Commission Court took upon them to determine; and if they did not meddle with Popish, or Non-conformist Meetings, it was because their hands were so tied up by the Late Declaration of Indulgence, that they had no power to meddle either with Papists or Dissenters.</P>

<P>I shall make no farther reply appresent to what you now say, till I come to answer once for all, therefore I shall go on to the next things excepted against in the Princes Declaration, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the erecting of publick Chappels for Mass, the protecting of Priests, and the making a Jesuit a Privy Councellor, all which tho' I confess they are against the express Letter of divers Statutes, yet since all these things depend upon the Kings dispensing power, set forth in His Majesties late Declaration, which as I will not assert, so I will not positively deny; since the said Declaration of Indulgence, and all proceedings thereupon have issued out and executed under colour of Law, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Kings Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, without any force or violence upon the Conscience, Religion, or Properties of the Kings Protestant Subjects, whom the King in his said Declaration solemnly promises to protect in the free possession, and enjoyment of their Religion estab∣lisht by Law: and I cannot see how a liberty granted to Popish Priests to say Mass, or the putting in a Jesuite into the Privy Council; or making Popish Judges, or putting a Papist into the Ecclesiastical Commission, can be lookt upon as any Invasion of the Protestant Religion, the free, and publick profession of which we have (God be thanked) as quietly injoyed as we did in the Reign of this King; or in that of his Brother.</P>

<P>Since you cannot directly justifie the Kings setting up publick Mass Houses in <HI>London,</HI> and in most other parts of the Kingdom; and his so publick protecting and countenancing Papists and Jesuits, even to the making a Jesuit a Privy-Councellor,
<PB N="678" REF="363"/>
tho' they are all in judgment of Law alike publick Enemies and Traytors to the King and Kingdom, and that all these (as you cannot deny) are contrary to the express words and intent of all Statutes against Priests, and Popish Assemblies, so you endeavour to palliate it under the Kings dispensing power, which you suppose to have had a colour of Law (at least) to support it, but tho' the giving Liberty to Popish Assemblies, and the Conventicles of the Dissenters was no direct hindrance of the free exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ercise of the Protestant Religion establisht by Law, yet I must utterly deny that the King has any such prerogative, as to dispense with those Laws, and by his sole Authority to declare those that the Law calls Enemies and Traytors, to be good Subjects, and you may as well tell me, that the King has not only a prerogative power to pardon High-way-men; but may also protect them, and put them into his Guards, with a Commission to rob whom they pleased, as to give Papists Power to bear Arms, or to protect, and imploy declared Traytors, (as Popish Priests, and Jesuites are by Law,) as the King had done; not the like I may say for putting in Popish Judges and Justices of Peace, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it was all done by force of the Kings Personal Orders, without his Legal Autho∣rity, which is that alone we can take cognizance of, or render any Obedience to; and tho' 'tis true, I do not deny the King a Power of making whom he pleases Judges, yet this prerogative is still to be exercised according to Law, and therefore if the King should make an illiterate man a Judge, who could nei∣ther Write nor Read, the Writ or Patent would be void in its self; the same I may say of a Popish Judge, the Law making no difference (as I know of) be∣tween a natural and a legal disability: but however the turning out honest and able Judges, because they would not give up our Religion and Liberties to the Kings Arbitrary Will, is certainly a much greater breach of the Trust commit∣ted to him by his Coronation Oath, wherein he swore he would maintain the Laws of the Land, and mix Equity with Mercy in all his Judgements: now where is the Equity, or Justice of this, that whereas the Judges anciently held their places <HI>quam diu se bene gesserint</HI> they should now (by a notorious encroach∣ment of the prerogative) not only be made <HI>durante beneplacito:</HI> but that the King should stretch this prerogative so unreasonably, as to examine the Judges before hand, whether they would agree to the dispensing power, and to turn out those that refused to comply, meerly because they would not serve his Arbitrary de∣signs? and then to put in the meanest and most mercenary Lawyers at the Bar, (nay some who never come thither at all) into their places, for no other merit, or good qualities, but because they would serve a turn, is so notorious a breach of his Oath, that it could not fail in a little time to destroy all our Common, as well as our Statute Laws, since these were all lately lodged in their Breasts and resolved into their Arbitrary determinations, which yet (as all the World knows) were wholy managed by the influence and commands of the Court; and this I say again was as notorious an abuse of the Kings prerogative, as if he had put in High-way-men into his Guards with Commissions in their Pockets to rob whom they pleased, since these Gentlemen in Scarlet have taken the same Liberty under colour of Law, to raise Taxes upon the Subjects against the express letter of an act of Parliament, as may be seen in their late determination concerning Chim∣ney Money, making Cottages built for the use of the poor, and houses of persons

exempted from payment liable to Chymney Money, contrary to the express words of that Statute.</P>

<P>I cannot deny but the things you now mention have been great abuses of Prerogative, but whether so great as to require resistance I must still disagree with you, therefore I shall now proceed to the next particular complain'd of, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the examining of the Lords Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants, Sheriffs, and Justices of Peace, to know whether they would concur with the King in the repeal of the Test, and Penal Laws, and turning all such out of Commission as refused to comply with the Kings desires in this matter; now tho' I will not say it was well or prudently done, yet it was no more than (what I think) the King by his Prerogative might Justifie the doing of; since he may by Law give a <HI>quietus est</HI> to what Judges he pleases, and put in or out of Commissions, whether Civil, or Military, what persons he thinks fit, and as for the persons so examined they might have chosen whether they would have given any posi∣tive answers to the questions put to them, by the Lord Chancellor, and Lord Lieutenants, and if they had refused to answer positively to those questions pro∣posed to them, I know no other penalty they had been liable to, more than be∣ing put out of Commission, which sure is no punishment, but rather an ease; and tho' I do not defend those evil Ministers that put the King upon this Method of distrusting, and disobliging his best Protestant Subjects (I mean those of the Church of <HI>England</HI>) by putting them out, and putting in either Papists, or Fana∣ticks in their steads, yet all that own themselves of that Communion, ought to have been of more loyal Principles than to have taken up Arms as some of them have done, upon pretence of standing by the Prince of <HI>Oranges</HI> Declaration, against these abuses.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see though you cannot directly justifie the examining of the Lords Lieu∣tenants, and Deputy Lieutenants, and Justices of the Peace, about taking away the Penal Laws and Test, and turning those out of Commission that refus'd; yet you strive to mitigate it (as far as you can) by making it part of the Kings Pre∣rogative, to put in and out what Judges, Justices, and other Officers he pleases: well, granting this to be so, yet sure you cannot deny but that the clositing of Judges, and all other Officers you have now mention'd, and putting those out of Commission, that refus'd to comply with the Kings Will, (and that for no other reason) was sure a strange abuse of that Prerogative; and the excuse you make that the persons examin'd had a liberty to refuse whether they would give any positive answer, or not, is yet more trivial, since it is very well known, that as well those who gave doubtful answers, or refused to make any answer at all, were as much turned out, as they who positively denied to comply with the Kings demands; so that no answer was looked upon as satisfactory, but such as seemed to give up all freedom of Elections, and Votes in Parliament; none be∣ing to be chosen by the Kings directions but such as would engage before hand to repeal the Test, and Penal Laws: and I think you will not deny but that the King by thus examining all these Magistrates and Officers you now mention, and by turning those out that refused to comply, did all he could to hinder the free Election of Members to serve in Parliament, and the freedom of giving their Votes when they came thither, and the King might as well another time have
<PB N="680" REF="364"/>
declar'd that he would have no Members chosen but such as would agree to take away the Statute <HI>de Tallagio non concidendo,</HI> or any branch of <HI>Magna Chart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which he should think fit to have repeal'd; and as this strikes at the very fun∣damental constitution of the Government, (<HI>viz</HI>) the free Election of Parliament men, so it was inserted among the Articles against <HI>Richard</HI> the II. that he had caus'd the Sheriffs to return whom he pleas'd for Knights of Shires, as I have al∣ready shewed you.</P>
<P>But what say you to the Kings late calling in almost all the Charters of Cities, Towns, and Corporations in <HI>England,</HI> and putting in Popish or Fanatick Offi∣cers and Magistrates, into the rooms of those that were turn'd out, only to in∣fluence Elections, and to procure what persons he desired to be return'd for Parliament men; is not this a grand breach of the fundamental constitution of the Kingdom, thus to take away the legal Rights and Priviledges of these Cor∣porations, for no other cause than to procure the King such Parliament men as he had a mind to?</P>

<P>I beg your pardon, I forgot to mention this sooner, and though I will not take upon me absolutely to defend the Legality of it; much less the design for which it was done, since I grant that it was in order to destroy, or at least to humble the Church of <HI>England</HI>: yet since i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was done by colour of Law, and Judgment of the Court of Kings Bench, and no more than what has been for∣merly done in the Reign of King <HI>Charles,</HI> I cannot see how the Noblemen, and Gentlemen lately in Arms, could defend their rising upon that ground, unless they would also at the same time justifie the lawfulness of the Plot, and Rebel∣lion intended in the same Reign, and in which so many of the Whig Nobility, and Gentry, were deeply engaged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>To answer what you have said in vindication of this great violation of one of the fundamental Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom; I must in the first place tell you, that as I shall not now examine into the matter of Law, whether a Corporation can forfeit it's Charter for misdemeanours or not; much less shall I concern my self whether it were done by, or without colour of Law, or the Judgment of the Court of Kings Bench, since it is notoriously known that none of the Judges were permitted to sit there, nor any new ones put in, but such as would blindly agree to all the Court would have done, and therefore I value nor any thing they did, nor think it one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot the more legal for their Judgments: nor is it any excuse, that the same thing was done in King <HI>Charles</HI> Reign, and therefore might as well be done now without any rising against it; for though I must tell you I look upon the taking away of the Charters from the City of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and the other Cities and Corporations of the Kingdom, one of the most ar∣bitrary, and illegal acts of that Kings Reign, yet there were several reasons which made it unlawful for the Nation to rise then; yet it might not be so now, as in the first place, because most of those Charters, were either willingly sur∣render'd by the members of those Corporations, or else were declared forfeited by due trial and Judgment of Law, whereas it was much otherwise in this Kings Time, when notwithstanding that all the Cities and Towns Corporate in <HI>England,</HI> had but a few years before taken out new Charters to their great trouble, and expence, they were now summon'd anew to surrender these again, for no other
<PB N="681" REF="364"/>
reason but because it was the Kings pleasure it should be so, for who can ima∣gine that all the Corporations of <HI>England</HI> could have forfeited their Charters in so short a time as three or four years? and they were plainly told, that the King must and would have them, and that it was to no purpose to stand out, and therefore it was no wonder, if all the Cities and Corporations of <HI>England</HI> were forced to submit patiently to this violation, since they found by experience the Judges were ready to give Judgment against them, right or wrong.</P>
<P>And besides this I have already laid it down as a Maxime, that no resistance whatever is to be made, till matters become desperate, and all other means are be∣come absolutely ineffectual, which I think they were not, as long as King <HI>Charles</HI> lived, who besides the inconstancy of his humour, which seldome persisted long, either in well or evil doing, (especially if the ill consequences of it were well laid open to him▪) was too timorous then to have put in any Magistrates into Corporations, but such as were for the Protestant Religion, as it stands by Law establisht; and such however angry they might be with those they call'd Whigs in respect of their opposing the Dukes succession to the Crown, yet I believe most of them would never have given up the freedom of Elections of Parlia∣ment men, or have done any thing to bring in Popery among us; so that as long as things remained in this State, there were some hopes still lest of a redress of our grievances, whenever a Parliament had met, and that the Nation was grown more cool, and had come to it self again after those heats which had risen in the late Parliaments about the succession, and other things; whereas now the case was far otherwise in this Kings Reign; wherein we found not only our Religion, but the fundamental Rights and Priviledges of the Nation, struck at by the Kings dispensing power, and the Arbitrary proceedings of the Judges: and not only the freedom of Elections of Knights of Shires, but of Cittizens and Burgesses endeavour'd to be taken from us: either by threatning the Electors, or else by open force; as I shall prove by and by; when I shall have occasion to speak farther upon that head; so that unless a great part of the Nation had declared for the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> he had been repuls'd with shame and ruine and our Chains tyed faster upon us, than ever they were before.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall forbear replying further to what you have now said, till I come to conclude, but in the mean time I cannot omit another material grievance, set down in the Princes Declaration, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the turning out and disarming the Eng∣lish Protestant Magistrates, Officers, and Souldiers in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and putting of Irish Papists in their Rooms, as also the late Declaration of Indulgence in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>; but as I will not defend the Justice or Prudence of those Councils, so I think none of them could give any sufficient cause for the people of this King∣dom to rise in Arms, for sure it is enough (if not too much) for them to concern themselves with the grievances, and miscarriages of their own Country, without taking upon them to take up Arms to reform those of their Neighbours, since they are not only ignorant of the Laws and Constitutions of those Kingdoms, but may also mistake the true reasons and grounds on which those alterations were made.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you can as little defend what has been illegally acted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as in <HI>Ireland,</HI> only you would sain put me off by telling me that the people of this
<PB N="682" REF="365"/>
Nation have nothing to do to take notice of what is done in other Kingdoms; and you may as well tell me, that a man ought not to take any warning as to de∣fend himself against Thieves, though he see's another man robb'd by them before his Eyes, or that the Protestants of <HI>England</HI> should not take warning by the sad example of those in <HI>France,</HI> from ever suffering a Popish King from having the same power here as the French King has in <HI>France,</HI> for fear of the like fatal effects, <HI>since I never found Papists give Protestants the least forbearance, or shew them any mercy longer than whilst it was not in their Power to hurt them.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to the matter in hand, we cannot but concern our selves with what has been so lately done in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> for the introducing of Po∣pery and Arbitrary Government in those Kingdoms, since the latter is notoriously known to be govern'd by the same Laws as <HI>England,</HI> and it is as much against the Laws of that Kingdom, as it is of ours, for the Irish Papists to be put in Arms, and the Protestant Militia disarmed, and for Popish Judges, and Justi∣ces of Peace to be put in Commission, as hath been practised under the Govern∣ment of the Lord <HI>Tyrconnel</HI>; and if English Protestants in <HI>Ireland,</HI> cannot enjoy their Estates and Liberties, without being turned out of them by the Papists, how could we in <HI>England</HI> expect better treatment whenever they shall think themselves strong enough; and as for <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' it be not wholy governed by the same Laws as <HI>England,</HI> yet the fundamental constitution of the Govern∣ment is the same in both Kingdoms, and the King can no more make, abrogate, or dispense with Laws in <HI>Scotland</HI> without the Parliament, than he can here, and therefore for the King not only to issue out such a Declaration of Indulgence, and suspension of all the Penal Laws in <HI>Scotland</HI> against Papists, but also therein to declare that he expected an obedience to all his commands without reserve (whether legal or not) was so bold a stroke, that we could not but expect the like in <HI>England,</HI> tho' his Majesty thought it not fit at present to discover his Mind so plainly to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not any longer dispute these points with you, but own that the abuses you mention, were indeed of great concern both to the Protestant Reli∣gion and our Civil Liberties, yet however besides the Laws of the Land, (which I still suppose do expresly forbid all resistance of the King upon any account whatsoever) I think there ought to have been no such thing done by any Subject of this Nation, even upon your own principles, which seem not to allow of such resistance, but in case of an actual and violent assault upon mens Religion, Lives, and Properties, and that by open force of Armes; now I desire you to shew me, whom it is that the King has ever yet Dragoon'd, or persecuted till they would become of his Religion, or whose Life his Majesty hath taken away, even of the most notorious Traytors, but by due Trial, and course of Law, nay he has pardon'd divers, several after they were condemn'd, meerly because he was in∣form'd they were not really guilty of the Crimes whereof they stood Condemn'd; and as for mens civil properties, I defie you to shew me any persons Estate that has been taken from him without due course of Law, or any Taxes that have been Assessed upon the Nation, but what have been granted by Parliament: or else raised by the opinion of the Judges, by whom if his Majesty hath been misin∣form'd,
<PB N="683" REF="365"/>
they only ought to answer for it in the next Parliament, who are the only proper Judges of their Miscarriages without having any course to Force, which the Laws of this Kingdom so much abhor, and therefore make the worst of it you can, all these Greivances already mentioned were no more than some breaches upon the outward Splendour of our Church Religion or some of our civil liberties; whilst the main &amp; Essential parts of both continu'd untouch'd, since, God be thanked, we have hitherto enjoy'd the Free &amp; publick profession of our Religion, together with our lives, Liberties and Estates in perfect peace, and undisturb'd by any outward Force, or Violence from the King, or any Com∣mission'd by him; and as for those Grievances you mention, <HI>viz.</HI> The turning out the President and Fellows of <HI>Magdalen</HI> Colledge by the late Ecclesiastical Commission, as also the turning out of the Deputy Lieutenants, and Justices of Peace, and all other Magistrates out of Cities and Corporations, the King has sufficiently redress'd them by restoring the first to their places, and by putting all the rest into Commission again▪ and turning out those that came in their rooms, and all this before the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came over, and I doubt not but his Majesty would have been content to have given the Nation any other reason∣able satisfaction they could have desired in the next Parliament: Which ought to have been patiently waited for untill his Majesty thought sit to call it, with∣out going about to right our selves by Force.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have made not only the most plausible defence you can of the Kings late actions, but have also urg'd the utmost that can be said against those defensive Arms, that have been lately taken up by those Lords, Gentlemen, and others who have associated themselves to stand by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> till our grievances were redrest by a free Parliament; but if what you have said be strictly lookt into, I doubt it will prove but a mere Subtersuge to hide the naked∣ness of the Cause you have undertaken: In the first place therefore let me tell you, that though I confess the King has not yet Dragoon'd us to <HI>Mass,</HI> nor has made an actual War upon the Lives and Properties of the People of this Nation; yet that he has not only invaded our Liberties, but also endanger'd the Pro∣testant Religion of the Church of <HI>England</HI> establish'd by Law, you your self have not the confidence to deny; only you will not suppose it to have been done by any Armed Force, and therefore ought not to have been resisted by Force, but to have waited for their redress by Parliament; which is but an evasion, for in the first place it is plain, that the things complain'd against, in the Prince of <HI>Oranges</HI> Declaration do most of them strike at the Fundamental Constitution, both of the Church and State, as I have sufficiently prov'd, and shall do it more particularly hereafter when there is occasion: all therefore that remaines to be prov'd is this, that all these breaches, and violations of our Religion, and Civil Liberties, tho' done under colour of Law, yet were acted and maintain'd by Force; and Secondly, that all other hopes of remedy or redress, unless by joyn∣ing with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> was wholy taken from us; the first of these I prove thus: It is notoriously known that for the King to maintain a standing army in time of peace, has been always declar'd against in Parliament, as contrary to Law, and dangerous to the Religion, civil rights, and Liberties, of this Nation; now it is also as certain that the King has ever since the Duke of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣mouths</HI>
<PB N="684" REF="366"/>
coming over, set up, and maintain'd a standing Army in this Kingdom; in which he has also put in as many Popish Officers, and they as many Popish Souldiers (contrary to the Laws of the Land) as ever they could find, besides the many <HI>Irish</HI> Papists that have been of late sent over, for no other purpose than to be listed here, &amp; whilst Protestant souldiers were turn'd out of several re∣giments to make room for them, not to mention the listing of vast numbers of loose, and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ligate fellows, and some of them pardon'd Highway men, who provided they had their pay would not have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luck to Rob or Murder any body they had been ordered, as may be sufficiently prov'd, not only by their common taking of free quarter, but by their frequent taking it in the houses of Gentle∣men, and other private Persons in divers places of this Kingdom; and that with∣out any amends or redress as I know of, tho' frequently complain'd of at Court, all which being done by the Kings arbitrary Power, without the least colour of Law, and in contempt of the Militia, the only legal Forces of this Kingdom, what was this but plainly to declare that as the King had thought fit to Act so many arbitary things clean contrary to Law▪ so he was likewise resolv'd to maintain 'em by force, since it is plain that the King never dur'st undertake to do all these Illegal and arbitrary things we have now mention'd, untill such time as his standing Army was raised; and tho' it is true, mens Lives, Liberties, or Estates cannot be taken away unless by some Force or other, either Legal, or Military, yet as for those Civil rights, and Priviledges, which are the main Bulwarks and defences of the former, they can only be invaded or taken from us by Illegal Judgments, and Declarations, which if supported by a visible Force beyond what the Nation (in the Circumstances it was in) was able to re∣sist, this is as much a taking them by Force as if there had been resistance made about them. Thus if Souldiers come into my House, and say that the King hath given them Orders to quarter there upon free cost, I suppose you will not deny, but this is a forceable taking of my goods, nowithstanding I dare not, (because I cannot) resist them; the same I may say for a whole Nation, when once opprest in their Civil Liberties, and those oppressions are once back'd and defended by a standing Army contrary to Law: But that this Army was raised cheifly to this intent, I can give you a remarkeable instance from the mouth of the late cheif Justice <HI>Wright,</HI> who sent for Officers, and Soldiers to make the Scholars keep silence, because they Hum'd at what the President, and Fellows of <HI>Magdalen's</HI> had just before done against the authority of this pretended court; so that to con∣clude, from that very time that the King beagn to keep up an Army, and to list Popish Officers and Souldiers, (tho' utterly disabled by Law to take Commissions, or to bear Arms) by vertue of his Dispensing Power, and all this in Order to back and support his Arbitrary proceedings, I look upon this Nation under such a force, as that they might Lawfully remove it by Force, when ever they could. And that either by joyning with some Foreign Prince, or else by their own Domestick Arms. But to come to the second point to be prov'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That there was no other means but Force lest us to redress these mischiefs and to re∣trieve us out of that sad condition in which we lately were, as also to hinder us from falling into worse; I shall only suppose, (that which I think you will readily grant) that there could be no other means to cure these evils but either by some
<PB N="685" REF="366"/>
sudden change in the Kings inclinations, or else by a Free Parliament; the for∣mer you must acknowledge was not possible, as long as he continued of the Re∣ligion he is of, and suffer'd himself to be manag'd by the Counsels of the Jesuits, and <HI>French</HI> King; and as for a Free Parliament what hopes could there be of that, as long as the King had done all he could to hinder Free Elections, and due re∣turns of Parliament Men, by making either Popish, or Fanatical Sheriffs, and putting Mayors and other Officers of the like Principles into most of the Cities and Corporate Towns in <HI>England</HI>? nor can I tell but that force would also have been used, if they found they could not have compassed their designs without it, in those places where Souldiers were Quarter'd; since I am credibly inform'd that at the late intended Elections of Burgesses for <HI>Northampton,</HI> and <HI>Brackly,</HI> the Officers and Souldiers Quarter'd, at those places declar'd, that none of the Towns-men should be admitted to give Voices at the Election, unless they would promise to Vote for those that the Court would set up; and the like instances I beleive I might give you of other places had I time to enquire into it: and as for the house of Peers, pray consider how many of the Bishops and temporal Lords the King might have gain'd either by threats, or fair promises to the Kings party, or at least prevail'd upon to stand Neuters, and not to oppose his designs, and if these had fail'd, it had been but calling up some Popish, or high Tory or Fa∣natick Gentlemen to the House of Lords, and to have sate their as Barons, Peers, <HI>pro tempore,</HI> till this Jobb was done, and I doubt not but there would have been e∣nough found out, of each sort, for that purpose, and that I do not speak without Book, I have had it from persons of very good Intelligence, that such a design was lately on foot, and the Court party thought they had very good Authority for it; since <HI>Mr. Pryn,</HI> and Sr. <HI>Will. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dgdale</HI> pretended to show us several ex∣amples of this Kind, as low as the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th. and a great part of the design of your Dr. <HI>Bs.</HI> late Books seem to have been only to prove, that the King might not only have Summon'd to Parliament what of the Commmons he pleased, but what Lords too, and have omitted the rest, as I have already shown you at our two last meetings, and sure if the King had such a prerogative two or three hundred years ago, these Gentlemen would not have deny'd his Present Majesty the like Power; Since they have in all their Writings and addresses de∣clar'd him as absolute as any of his Predecessours.</P>
<P>But to make an end, as for what you say of the Kings Redressing the Griev∣ances of the Nation before the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came, it is very true, he did by the advice of some of the Bishops, endeavour to put things into the same state they were in at his first coming to the Crown; but I very much mistrust the sincerity of his Majesties intentions, since it is plain he never offer'd to do it till the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust upon coming, and that his Declaration had been spread about the Kingdom, and then he did it so unwillingly, that when the news came of part of the Princes Fleets being Shipwrack'd, and that his design was quite put off, the Bishop of <HI>Winchester</HI> who was then but newly gone down to restore the President and Fellows of <HI>Magdalen</HI> Colledge, was immediately call'd back, under pretence of being present as the Examination of the Birth of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and did not return again to finish that business, till such time as fresh News came that the Prince was certainly come, notwithstanding
<PB N="686" REF="367"/>
his late disaster. And which is also more remarkable, His Majesty in none of His Declarations ever disowned his Dispensing Power, or so much as put out <HI>Father Peters</HI> from the Council, or Disbanded one Popish Officer, or Souldier out of his Army, which is another great Argument of the Sincerity of his in∣tentions. So that I think this was sufficient to convince any reasonable Man that there was no other means left us but Resistance, and that by Force, and a hearty Joyning with the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> at his Landing.</P>
<P>Since this resistance was not made either in Opposition to the King, or the Laws, but for defence of both, against a Standing Army kept up contrary to Law, and headed by Officers, the greatest part of which, by not taking the Sacrament and Test, according to the Act made for that purpose, had render'd themselves wholy uncapable of holding those Commissions, and consequently whilst in Arms were to be look'd upon as common Enemies to the Nation.</P>
<P>But as for his Majesties Gracious and mercifull disposition; as I shall not make it my business personally to Reflect upon him, so I must needs tell you the Execution of Mr. <HI>Cornish,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Lisle,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Gaunt</HI> for Treasons falsly alledg'd; or else for such as Women could scarce be capable of knowing to be so, were no great Evidences of such highly Merciful Inclinations.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have taken a great deal of pains not only to set forth the Late Miscarriages of the Government, but also to prove that the Army which the King raised upon the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Rebellion, and which he hath since kept up to prevent either fresh Rebellions at home, or Invasions from abroad, has been meerly maintain'd to support all these Late breaches upon our Laws, and Civil Liberties, which you say were made upon them: now this is very uncharitably done for as His Majesty was Forc'd to raise that Army at first be∣cause the Late Rebellion in the <HI>West</HI> was too powerfull to be quell'd by the ordi∣nary Train'd Bands of the Kingdom whom he had too much reason to suspect, by the running over of several of them to the Rebels, not to be so Loyal as they ought to have been; and if His Majesty had not had a small body of an Army on Foot, the last Summer before the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came over, he must upon his Landing have Yielded to his terms, had they been never so unreasonable; and though I will not defend the Listing of Popish or Irish Souldiers, or the Granting Commissions to Popish Commanders, yet it is very hard to prove this to be a making War upon the Nation, unless you can suppose there may be War made without Fighting, and as for those Violations of the Laws which you suppose were made only upon the presumption of this standing Army, this is likewise very hard to affirm, since how can you tell that the Judges and Ministers would not have given the same Opinions and advices concerning the Dispensing Power, Chimney Money &amp; the Ecclesiastical Commission, had there been no Army at all rais'd, since they might for ought I know have presum'd that the People of this Nation, had been sufficiently convinc'd of the truth of the Doctrines of Passive Obedience and Non-resistance, as not to have needed a Standing Army to back what he had already done, tho' contrary to Law: but as for the latter part of
<PB N="687" REF="367"/>
your Dicourses, say the People ought to have waited till the King had call'd a Parliament, and then if they had betray'd their trust and given up our Reli∣gion and Liberties as you suppose they would have done, it had been then time enough and not till then for the Nation to have call'd in the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and His <HI>Dutc-hmen</HI> to their Deliverance; so that till this Par∣liament had been try'd, you could not say that matters were altogether desperate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you do all you can to prove that the Kings Raising an Army, wherein he had Listed so many Popish Officers and Souldiers, (and which were like to be daily increas'd upon us) was no making War upon the Nation, because they had not yet actually robb'd or murder'd People; and you may with as much reason tell me that a Thief upon the High-way do's not use any Vio∣lence upon the party he robbs, if he should only clap a cok'd Pistol to his breast without asking him to deliver his Money: Now I suppose you will not deny, but that the Passinger would quickly understand the meaning of that sign and wo'd soon deliver his Purse for fear of loosing his life; apply this to the Chimney Money that has been rais'd upon the poor part of the Nation, and the taking away the Charters from the Corporations, merely through the Terrour of this standing Army, and see if the Similitude do's not exactly fit, and for what you say concerning the presuming upon the Doctrine of Passive Obedience, and so might have done the same Arbitrary things whether he had raised an Army or not, tho' I am very glad you confess that those Doctrines encouraged the Kings Arbitrary proceedings, yet I must Beg your Pardon if I cannot beleive the rest whatever thoughts the King might have of the Major part of the Clergy, Nobility and Gentry: Yet certainly he had no such good Opinion of the Ordinary People who compos'd the Militia, (and indeed are the Hands of the Kingdom) since you confess the King did not look upon them as sufficiently Loyal, and therefore was forc'd to maintain a Standing Army for fear of them; So that it seems the Nation was not yet thorough pac'd in your Doctrines of Passive Obedience and Non-resistance as you would have had them, but that even this Standing Army when it was to Fight against the Religion and Liberties of their own Country, it was not to be trusted, the King himself was convinc'd of, when he so lately ran away from them at <HI>Salisbury</HI>; and because some of them deserted him he feared the rest wo'd not Fight, in so unjust a Quarrell.</P>
<P>But as for the rest of <HI>Tour</HI> Speech, that the People sho'd have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arried till matters had become altogether desperate, and that a Parliament had actually given us our Religion, Civil Liberties and Properties to the Kings Arbitrary will, that had been indeed intalling Slavery upon us by a Law, and would have made good the Proverb, of shu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing the Stable Door after the Horse is Stolen, and puts me in mind of a Story I have heard of a Gentleman whose House being beset by Thieves, who were actually breaking in at a Window, and that he was about to shoot at them, his over scrupulous Chaplain (who I suppose had nicely study'd your Doctrine of Nonresistance) desired his
<PB N="688" REF="368"/>
Patron to forbear, because the Thieves had not as yet sufficiently declar'd their wicked intentions by assaulting or robbing any Body in the House, But I suppose the Gentleman was not such a Fool as to take his Chaplains advice, and a great part of the Nation was too sensible of the dangers they saw hang over their Heads than to follow your Opinion.</P>

<P>I see you are very free in your Comparisons, in making the Kings Late Army little better then Thieves, and then what Opinion you have of the King himself who headed 'em, I leave it to your self to consider; but since Similitudes are no Arguments; I shall not trouble my self to argue this point any longer with you, since I see it is to little purpose; but yet let your right of Resistance be what it will in desperate cases, yet I am sure that diverse Lords and Gentlemen of your Opinion can no way justify their re∣nouncing all Allegiance to his Majesty, by adhering to a Foreign Prince, and by their Late advising the same Prince to call a Free Parliament, without taking any notice of the King: or making any more Addresses to him about it, than if he had never been their Anointed Soveraign; and indeed it was a burning shame, as well as a crying Sin, for the Nobility, Gentry, and People in and about this great and populous City to let their King be hurryed away Prisoner by a handful of <HI>Dutch-men,</HI> though his Majesty hath had since the good Fortune to escape out of their hands, when he saw there was no o∣ther means to fail him.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>In answer to what you have now said, I must freely tell you; that if the resistance that hath been made against the Army Commission'd by the King was Lawfull, so has all that has been done in pursuance of that resist∣ance been alike Lawfull and necessary; and therefore what if I tell you that the King by breaking the Fundamental Constitution of the Kingdom, and by twice going away without ever offering to repair those breaches, and give the Nation any sufficient satisfaction for the same, has not only put himself in a state of War against the People, but has also thereby ceas'd to be King; or if you will have it more plainly, has lost and forfeited his right to the Crown.</P>

<P>This is rare Commonwealth Doctrine, and of the same batch with that of <HI>Bradshaws,</HI> and <HI>Cooks</HI> Speeches against King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, but I thank God I have learn'd Loyaler Principles, and do firmly believe, that a King of <HI>England</HI> cannot for any Tyrrany or breach of Laws whatsoever forfeit his Crown or Royal Dignity, as you suppose. But since this is a new Doctrine I shall not be unwilling to hear what you have to say upon this Subject ano∣ther time, since it is now too late to pursue this Argument any further.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I make any reply to what you have now said, I desire not to be misunderstood as if I call all the Kings Late Army Thieves or himself the Captain of them, since in Similes it is sufficient if they agree in some common propertie without being the same things to which they are compar'd, tho
<PB N="689" REF="368"/>
this much I may safely say that those that take Free Quarter without con∣sent of the owners in time of Peace, and those who support 'em in it are no better than Thieves; but since you desire to hear my reasons for this opinion I have now given you, I desire that we may have another meeting to debate this weighty question: and then I will likewise hear whatever you have to say against it; but I must tell you by the way, that you are very much out in making my opinion of the same batch with that of the Regicides; for it ap∣pears plainly by the Printed Tryal of the King, that they acknowledged him for King of <HI>England</HI> at the same time, when they read his Indictment to him, whereas I affirm the contrary, and say that the King cannot be judged or deposed by the Parliament or People; and that he has without any effect of ours absolutly Abdicated the Government, and Deposed himself: but that I may not seem to speak out of any prejudice to this Kings Person or Government, I desire we may first debate it in General whether a King of <HI>England</HI> can ever fall from, or forfeit his Royal Dignity let him behave him∣self never so like a Tyrant: and when that is despatcht it will be then time to consider whether the King has so behaved himself or not.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> AM come to one of the last parts of my intended task, (which in pursuance of the last discourse of resistance,) is whether the Late King <HI>James</HI> by any breach of the Original Contract made between his Predecessors, and the People of this Nation, expressed by a Notorious violation of the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, hath forfeited his Crown, and Royal Dignity, and hath thereby dis∣charged the Nation from all Allegiance to him; in the discussing of which to let the World see I do not Write any thing out of particular spleen, or prejudice to the Late Kings Person, or Government, I have chose to handle this question in general, with∣out making any mention at all of him, and therefore have urged all that I think can be spoken on either side, in this question, without applying it to any King in particular; but because I find the cheif Argument (next that of a Divine Right) for the Absolute, and Unconditioned Power of the Late King, is a Right of Conquest over this Kingdom, and Nation from K <HI>William I.</HI> (commonly called the Conqueror) whereby he is suppo∣sed to have acquired an absolute indefeasible Right to the Crown of this Realm, both for himself and such lawful Heirs of his Body as shall succeed thereunto; I have also exami∣ned all things consider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble that have been or may be urged on either side on this question, as well from Ancient as Modern Authors: tho' I confess it is the more difficult to be resol∣ved, because not only our later Antiquaries, such as Sir <HI>H. Spelman,</HI> Sir <HI>Roger Twis∣den,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Selden,</HI> are p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>int blank against Sir <HI>William Dugdale</HI>'s and Dr. <HI>Brady</HI>'s Notion of King <HI>William</HI>'s Title by Conquest; but also the Ancient English and Nor∣man Historians do extremely differ in their Relations, for tho' they both agree to Found the best Title he had on the Testamentary Donation of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Con∣fessor (which they also call an Hereditary Right) yet do they very much differ about the manner of his Government. Some of the most Ancient of the Norman and English Historians, setting him forth as a Iust, and Pious Prince, and others of them, and especially <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> making <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Tyrant that observed neither Oaths nor Laws, farther than stood with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own convenience; I have not therefore omitted to my know∣ledge
<PB REF="371"/>
any considerable Authority or Argument, that hath been made use of; and not to seem partial, have added several new ones that have not been taken notice of be∣fore; and tho' this subject may seem antiquated, and trivial to divers nice Readers, yet I doubt not but it will prove sufficiently pleasant and instructive to those who are Studious in our English History and Laws.</P>
<P>But as for the Authorities I have given you on either side, I have confined my self wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in the space of <HI>200</HI> years, after the reputed Conquest; because the Authors that writ wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hin that time, may be supposed to speak either on their own Knowledge, or else from the then recent Tradition of their Grand-fathers, or great Grand-fathers at farthest; as for the Arguments; they are the best I could find among our pretended Authors, and where they fell short I have added the best I could think of, or have heard in those conversations I have frequented; and if these do not satisfie, I hope the Reader will not blame me, since it is not my fault they are no better: but if the reverend Dr. <HI>Hick</HI>'s or the learned Dr. <HI>Brady,</HI> (whom these questions may cheifly concern) shall vouchsafe to peruse this discourse, and will take the pains so far to con∣sider them, as to shew me my omissions, or wherein the person whom I have all along introduced to oppose their sentiments, has either argued falsely, or is mistaken in mat∣ter of Fact, I shall be so far from taking it ill, that I shall thank them for their pains, provided it be done with that civility and candour, which may be expected from per∣sons so eminent as they are for Knowledge and Civility; I have no more but to beg the Readers pardon, for the length of this Discourse, which I could yet have enlarged far∣ther, but that I leave him to satisfie his Appetite to the full upon this Subject of the Norman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onquest, whenever Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI> and Mr. <HI>Atwood</HI> shall think fit to publish their laborious and learned collections on this Subject: till when I hope the Reader will stay his Stomach with these remainders, tho' they have in great part been served up already in the learned Entertainments of those Authors mentioned immediately in the Title Page.</P>

<HEAD>THE Tenth Dialogue BETWEEN Mr. <HI>MEANWELL</HI> a Civilian, AND Mr. <HI>FREEMAN</HI> a Gentleman.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>OH! Are you come at last; I have looked for you these two Nights; and now began to fear you were not well, or else had distrusted your cause, and declined another Conference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your Pardon for disappointing you; which yet I had not done, had no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some Business hindred me; but however to let you see I do not decline a∣nother Conference with you upon this Subject, pray let us go on where we left off; and tell me freely your sense of my Notion of the Kings forfeiture, or Abdication of the Government by his violation of the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, and refusal to repair those Breaches, when he might have done it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In answer to your demand, I will deal freely with you, and must tell you, that I have perused all Writers, that have Writ any thing considerable con∣cerning the Laws of Government, or of Nations; and cannot find in any of them, any thing to countenance your Notion of forfeiture, or Abdication of an absolute Sovereign Prince, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I must still take ours to be, notwithstanding all you yet said to the contrary; unless what you have cited at our third meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. grot. de</HI> J. B. L. 1. cap. 4. §. 7.8. <HI>Pufendorf de Iure nat.</HI> L. 7. cap. 8. §. 6.7.</NOTE> out of <HI>Barclays</HI> third Book, <HI>contra Mo∣narches</HI>; where he allows the Subjects to resist their Prince, in case he go about to destroy the Body of the People or Com∣mon wealth, whereof he is the Head: To which I may also add a∣nother Case which you have omitted, <HI>viz.</HI> if the Prince make over his Kingdom to another, without the Consent of his People: And I confess that both <HI>Grotius,</HI> and <HI>Pufendorf,</HI> agree
<PB N="692" REF="372"/>
with <HI>Barclay</HI> in this Notion: Because they look upon both these Cases, as their plain downright Renunciations of their Civil Authority, over those whom they were obliged to Govern: But indeed, the first of these Cases is so improbable, nay, almost impossible to happen, that were it not for the over-great niceness of these Writers, it need not to have been so much as mentioned; since none but a Mad-man, can ever go about to destroy his whole People; and therefore as a Man out of his Wits, such a Prince may be Resisted; and lockt up, if ever it should so fall out (as you your self have confessed it hath very rarely) for a Nation to be so unhappy, as to have such a Prince; but as for the Second, <HI>viz.</HI> the making over their Supream Power to a Foreign Prince; that likewise so very rarely happens, That it is scarce worth the while, to make any dispute about it; But in all other Cases, they held the Supream Power of every Nation, to be absolutely Irresistible in any case whatsoever; and if irresistible, then certainly uncapable of forfeiting their Right to govern, by any pretended, or real Violation of the Liberties and Priviledges of the People. And <HI>Bodin</HI> in his first Book,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 8.</NOTE> <HI>de Republica</HI>; tho' he grant that ab∣solute Princes are obliged in Conscience, to keep and main∣tain all such Priviledges, which have been granted to the People by either them∣selves, or Predecessors, which are for the good of the Common-wealth; yet since the Prince is sole Judge, whether these Priviledges are consistent with his Su∣pream Right to Govern, and Protect his People, he may therefore have occasion sometimes, not only to Detract from them, or dispense with them in some Cases; but may wholy break and lay them aside, by turning Tyrant:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 11. <HI>cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> Yet nevertheless in all these Cases, People are still bound not to resist them: And that he looked upon the King of <HI>England,</HI> as such an Absolute Monarch, as well as others he there menti∣ons, pray read me the place I now Cited, where after he has allowed Resistance to be lawful against those Princes, who were not properly Monarchs, as enjoy∣ing but a share of the Supream Power, and among which, he reckons the <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Emperor, and the Kings of <HI>Denmark, Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Poland:</HI> But then, when he comes to speak of Real and Absolute Monarchies, his Sense is quite different, as you may see by these words. <HI>Quod si Monarchia quaedam est, summâ unius potestate constituta, qualis est Francorum, Hispanorum, Anglorum. Scotorum,</HI> &amp;c. (I shall slip all the rest, because not to our purpose) <HI>ubi Reges sine controversia jura omnia Majestatis habent per se; nec singulis civibus, nec universis fas est summi Princi∣pis vitam, famam, Fortunas in discrimen vocare, seu vi, feu Iudice constituto id fiat, etiamsi omnium scelerum, ac Flagitiorum quae in Tyrannis convenire antea diximus, tur∣pitudine infamis esset</HI>; where you may observe that Force or Resistance, by which such an absolute Princes Life or Regal Power (here called <HI>Fortunas</HI>) are as much forbid, as calling him in question, by appointing Judges to sit upon him. And he there gives us a very good reason for it, because all <HI>Subjects</HI> of what de∣gree soever, cannot <HI>pretend to any Coercive</HI> Power, over the Person <HI>of a Sovereign Prince.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have discoursed enough concerning the Resistance of Absolute Mo∣narchs, at our third and fourth meeting, and therefore I desire we may not fall into that Subject, which can produce nothing but needless Repetitions; and I
<PB N="693" REF="372"/>
have already proved, at our 5th Conversation, that the King is not an Absolute Despotick Monarch, but is limited and tied up by the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, from making of Laws, or raising Taxes without the consent of his People in Parliament; and that our Government is mixed, and made up of Mo∣narchy, with an allay of Aristocracy, and Democracy in the constitution; the former in the House of Lords, the latter in the House of Commons, as K. <HI>Charles</HI> the First himself confesses in his Answer to the Parliaments 19 Propositions; and I have farther inforced this from divers Authorities out of our An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient as well as Modern Lawyers; <HI>viz. Glanvill, Bracton, Fortescue,</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI>: So that since we have such clear proof for our Constitution from our own Histories and Authors, nay from the King himself, besides the whole purpor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and style of the very Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom; I do not value the Authority of <HI>Bodin</HI> a Foreigner, whose business it is to set up the Authority of the French King to the highest pitch he could; and therefore being sensible that antiently the Government of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> were much the same, he could not with any face make his own an Absolute Despotick Monarchy, unless he had made ours so too: But this is not the only Errour he has been guilty of in our History and Constitution, as I can shew you when there is occasion. But <HI>Arnisaeus,</HI> who, as well as <HI>Bodin,</HI> is so much for Absolute Monarchs, yet does in his Treatise of Government called his confess that a Tyrant in an Hereditary Monarchy, who violates all the Laws of Justice and Equity to the endangering the Ruine of the Common-wealth, doth <HI>ixcidere Iure haereditario,</HI> fall from, or forfeit his Hereditary Right. But pray make it out by some con∣vincing proofs either from History, or Law, that our Kings are such Absolute Monarchs as you would make them, that by the fundamental Constitution of the Government they cannot be resisted, nor can fall from their Regal Power, let them carry themselves never so Tyrannically; for I do not see you have been yet able to do it by any Arguments you have hitherto made use of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already at our 5th, as well as at our last Meeting, given you divers Arguments and Authorities whereby I proved the Kings of this Realm to be compleat, and absolute Monarchs; especially that place from <HI>Bracton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>Cap.</HI> 9.</NOTE> where he thus speaks of the King, that every one is un∣der him, and that himself is under none but God; that he has no Peer in his Kingdom, because so he would lose his Power, since an Equal has no command over an Equal; much more has he any Superiour, because then he would be inferiour to his Subjects, and Inferiours cannot be equal with their Superiours, which sufficiently destroys that Notion of yours, that Subjects can be in any case equal with their Princes, so as to judge and resist their actions; which is also farther inforced by another passage just aforegoing, <HI>de Chartis vero Regiis, &amp; factis Regum, non debent, nec possunt Iusticiarii, nec privatae personae dispu∣tare, nec etiam si in illis dubitatio ulla oriatur, possunt eam interpretari; &amp; in dubiis, &amp; obscuris, vel si aliqua dictio duos contin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at intellectus, Domini Regis erit expectanda Inter∣pretatio &amp; voluptas, cum ejus sit interpretari cujus est concedere</HI>; from which we may conclude, that the King's actions were above all censure and dispute, much more forcible opposition of his Subjects. And I defie you to shew me any passage in <HI>Bracton, Fleta,</HI> or even your beloved Author <HI>Fortescue,</HI> that in the least counte∣nances
<PB N="694" REF="373"/>
your Doctrine of Resistance, much less your Opinion of the King's for∣feiture of his Crown and Royal Dignity for Tyranny, or the highest Violation of Laws; but rather the contrary in all those passages that I have either observed my self, or found quoted out of them by others: For tho' I grant both <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Fleta</HI> call the King, if he prove a Tyrant, or one that governs contrary to Law, not God's, but the Devil's Minister; yet for all that, they no where main∣tain, that then he ought, or may be resisted by his Subjects, or that they are discharged of their Allegiance towards him: For <HI>Bracton</HI> tells us in the same place,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 7.</NOTE> that if the King do any man wrong or in∣jury, <HI>Locus erit supplicationi quod factum suum corrigat, &amp; emendet; quod quidem si non fecerit, satis sufficit ei ad paenam, quod Dominum expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tet ultorem; ne∣mo quidem de factis suis praesume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disputare, multo fortius contra factum suum venire:</HI> The same he says likewise word for word in another place of any other King or Prince, who has no superiour Lord, against whom there is no Remedy by Assize (or Legal Trial) as against an Equal, but only place left the injured Sub∣ject for Petition: And <HI>Bracton</HI> gives us a very good Reason for it in this <HI>maxime, omnis qúidem sub eo, &amp; ipse sub nullo nisi tantum sub Deo.</HI> So that tho' I grant this Moral Obligation, which the King hath to observe the Laws, is farther increased by his Coronation-Oath,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. I. P.</HI> 244, 245. <HI>cap.</HI> 9.</NOTE> as <HI>Bracton</HI> observes in his third Book <HI>de Actionibus</HI>: But then, as in the Oath of Alle∣giance, the People swear nothing to the King but what they are bound to observe unsworn; so the King in his Coronation-Oath promises no∣thing to the People, but what in Justice and Equity he is bound to perform whether he swear or not; for, <HI>ad hoc</HI> (saith the same Author, of the King) <HI>electus, &amp; creatus est ut Iudicium faciat universis, &amp;c.</HI> and <HI>separare debet Rex, cum sit Dei vicarius, Ius ab Injuria, &amp;c.</HI> But then if he will pervert this great end for which God made him King, if he will not act as it becomes God's Vicar, if he will ob∣struct or pervert the Laws, and govern never so Tyrannically; yet still there is left no Remedy to his Subjects by the Law, but Moral Perswasion; for the Laws Imperial of this Realm have declared him to be a free, unconditioned, and in∣dependent Sovereign exempted from all coaction, and outward force, much more from any forfeiture of this Crown, or Regal Authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I shall be able to return you a satisfactory Answer to the Authori∣ties you have now brought; for, as for Reasons, I see none in the first place; as to what you say concerning <HI>Barclays,</HI> and all other Writers agreeing, that in these two Cases you mention, the People may resist their Prince, because he does as good as renounce the Government of them, and abdicate the Crown he wore. Pray observe that they also allow the People to judge for themselves when the King thus goes about to destroy them, to make over his Crown to a Foreign Prince: Now I desire you to shew me, why the People in a limitted, or mixt Kingdom (as ours is) cannot as well judge when the King has broke the Fundamental Laws of the Government, whereby it is distinguished from an Absolute Despotick Monarchy; and hath either actually set up, or is going about to bring in Tyranny, or Arbitrary Power; since according to the Rules I have laid down at our last Meeting, the matters to be judged of may be as plain and evident, not only to a single person, but to a whole Nation: All that you have
<PB N="695" REF="373"/>
to say against this is, only an Hypothesis you have laid down without any just grounds, that the King is a Sovereign Prince, who holds his Crown without any Condition whatever, and therefore free from all forfeiture of his Crown, or Regal Authority, which is the Point to be prov'd: Now if I have already made out (as I suppose I have) that the King of <HI>England</HI> is not an Absolute Monarch, as not having the two main parts of it, <HI>viz.</HI> the power of raising Money, and making Laws, in his own disposal, without the consent of his People, and these so reserved by his own Concessions, or that of his Predecessors, from the very beginning of Kingly Government in this Island; and if I have also proved at our last Meeting, that if we have such Fundamental Rights, we have also some means left us to keep, and preserve them inviolable, and that this means is only a for∣cible defensive Resistance, in case they are forcibly invaded by any of the King's Officers, or Souldiers, nay, by his own Personal Power, in case he shall be so ill advised as to joyn himself with such Instruments of Tyranny; it will then also follow, that such a Resistance is really a suspension of their Allegiance to the King for the time it lasts; and till they can see whether there be any hopes lest of a Reconciliation with Him, and that he will amend his Errours, and Mis∣government; and if so, and that he will give his People any sufficient Testi∣mony of his amendment and sincerity, by giving up such evil Ministers to pu∣nishment, that put him upon such desperate courses; I do then readily grant, that the People ought to lay down their Arms, and be again reconciled to their King, and submit themselves to him as before, according to that Clause in King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s <HI>Magna Charta</HI> I have already cited, wherein there is a Power left for the Barons in case of any Breach of it, to take Arms, and constrain the King by taking of his Castles, Lands, and Possessions, to amend those transgressions; and when all was thus amended, the Charter says, <HI>Tunc cum fuerit emendatum</HI> (then, and not before) <HI>interdent nobis sicut prius fecerunt</HI>; they shall be subject to us as they were before; but what followed upon this, the King not only refused to observe this Charter, but procured the Pope's Dispensation to be absolved from the Oath he had taken to observe it, and also did all he could to bring in Foreigners into this Kingdom to support his Tyranny; and raised what Forces he could of his own Subjects to that end; whereupon the Barons at last were forced to renounce all Allegiance to him, and to declare he had forfeited all Right to the Crown by his Tyranny and Perjury towards his People, as <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> and other Authors shew us at large. Now what the Barons did in the case of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> may be also done by the People of this Kingdom in all succeeding Times; or otherwise the King will be in a better condition after he has done the worst he can by force of Arms against the People, than he was be∣fore; for if (as I have already proved) he may be resisted, till he give the King∣dom satisfaction that he will surcease from such Tyrannical courses; and that such Resistance is really a Suspension of Allegiance for the time it lasts; it will likewise follow, that if the King will still persist in these wicked courses, he must at last forfeit his Crown, and discharge his Subjects of all Allegiance to him; or else he would be in a better condition, by his wilful persisting in his Tyranny, than he could by quitting it, and reconciling himself to his People: For whereas by this Method the best he can expect is to return to the

exercise of the same Limited Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e before enjoyed: If he push things to the utmost extremity, he may perhaps get the better of his People, and then he may set up for an Absolute King by Conquest; or if he fail in that, and be beaten, or taken Prisoner by them, he can still lose nothing, since by your Principles he still continues an Absolute Sovereign Prince, as he was before, and must be immediately put in the same state and ability of destroying the Government, and enslaving the Nation; but your Civil, as well as our Common Law, has a very good Maxim, <HI>Nemo ex proprio Delicto beneficium c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>piat,</HI> no man may take advantage of his own wrong, and therefore such a Prince ought certainly to lose, and not to get by his own Illegal and Tyrannical Actions; and therefore I grant, that the King is not tyed to observe any new things that he was not, before he was Crowned, bound to do; only there is the higher obligation of an Oath added thereunto; so if the King be a Limited Prince, whose Authority depends upon the right exercise of it, and that he can claim no Allegiance of his Subjects but upon that condition; if such a Prince wilfully breaks all those conditions, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>solutely refuses to amend, he must at last forfeit his Crown, and lose all Allegiance from his Subjects, or else all their Resistance would signifie just nothing, and they would after all be in a much worse condi∣tion than they were before.</P>
<P>Now if this be so, all your Quotations out of <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Fleta</HI> will signifie nothing;
<Q>for as <HI>Pufendorf</HI> very well observes, a Supreme Power may reside in a Limited King in respect of all his particular Subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 7. <HI>c</HI> 7. § 7.10.</NOTE> yet they may have a right to disobey him in those things to which his Power does not extend; for, says he, it does not follow, that because I am not bound to obey him in all things, therefore I must be his Equal, or Superiour, or because I cannot in any wise command him, therefore he may enjoyn me what he pleases; for <HI>Supreme</HI> and <HI>Absolute</HI> are by no means one and the same, for the former denotes the absence of a Supe∣riour, or an Equal in the same order, but the latter a faculty of exercising all the Rights of Government according to his own Judgment and Will;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 7. <HI>cap.</HI> 8.</NOTE> and therefore this Author in the next Chapter says very rationally concerning resisting of Tyrants in extreme cases, that their scruple is nothing, who will not admit any Liberty of resisting the most cruel Tyranny of Rulers, because there cannot be supposed any lawful Call of Subjects taking Arms against the Supreme Power, since no Jurisdiction can belong to any Subject toward such a Power; as if (says he) that Self-defence were an Effect of Jurisdiction, or that there is required any peculiar Call or Precept for Men in case of extream necessity to defend themselves, and to repulse any unjust force from taking away their Lives or Estates, any more than there is for those who are like to starve, to allay their hunger by eating; tho' it may be the Meal they eat is not their own but another Man's; so far he; and if this be lawful even in Absolute Monarchies, in case of defence of Life; the same, I say, may be exercised in Limited Kingdoms, when the King goes about by force to take away the Religion, Lives, Estates, or Liberties of the People con∣trary to Law; since they both act upon the same Principle, that a King, by de∣stroying the Fundamental Laws and Conditions by which he is to Govern,
<PB N="697" REF="374"/>
renounces the Government, and indeed so far dissolves it, that he ceases to be King.</Q></P>
<P>And tho' I grant <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Fleta,</HI> and other old Lawyers have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in ex∣press words taught this Doctrine, yet they do it in effect, since the former tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 8.</NOTE> <HI>Non est Rex, ubi dominatur voluntas, &amp; non Lex</HI>; that is, he is not a King, when his own Will, and not the Law governs:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 9. <HI>c.</HI> 9.</NOTE> And in another place, <HI>Rex est dum bene Regit, Tyrannus dum Populum sibi creditum violentâ oppri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it domination<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>; and in the very same place, (as you have also observed) he tells us, <HI>exercere debet Rex po∣testatem Iuris, ut Vicarius &amp; Minister Dei, potestas autem injuriae Diaboli est non Dei; cum declinat ad injuriam Rex, Diaboli Minister est:</HI> Now, if what <HI>Bracton</HI> says be true, then the King, when he does injury, is the Devil's Minister, and not God's. I cannot see how he can then act as God's Lieutenant; or why it is not as lawful to resist the Devil's Minister as the Devil himself: And as to what you alledge out of the same Author, that there is no Remedy lest against the King in case he does wrong, or oppresses any man, but only petition, and after that, the only Remedy is <HI>expectet Deum ultorem,</HI> in case he refuse to do right; this is to be only understood of Remedy in ordinary Courts of Justice, and by ordina∣ry means, for otherwise this Author would contradict himself, whereas he tells us expresly, (as I have already noted out of <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Fleta</HI>) <HI>in Populo Regendo Rex habet Superiores, Legem per quam factus est Rex, &amp; Curiam suam, viz. comites &amp; Barones,</HI> that is the highest Court of Parliament, called by way of eminency, the <HI>Earls and Barons</HI>; who, he here says <HI>debent ei s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>num imponere,</HI> in case he transgress the Law; and therefore if he go on still wilfully to violate all the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, by the same Power by which they may put this Bridle upon him, by the same Power may they also declare (in case of manifest and down-right Tyranny,) that he has forfeited his Crown; and tho' they cannot de∣pose him as his Superiours, yet they may declare that he hath by violating the <HI>Original Contract</HI> between him and his People ceased to be King; and that both themselves and all his Subjects are discharged of all Allegiance to him.</P>
<P>And agreeable to this Opinion, the Old Mirrour of Justices tells us in the place I have formerly cited at our third Meeting, that tho' the King have no Peer in the Land, nevertheless if by his own wrong, he offends against any of his People, none of those that Judge for him (<HI>i. e.</HI> none of his Justices) can be both Judge, and Party; therefore it is agreeable to Right, that the King should have Peers, or Companions to hear and determine in Parliament all Writs, and Complaints, con∣cerning the wrongs of the King, Queen, and their Children, of which wrongs they could not otherwise have common Right: Now can any one imagine that any private person might have Right against the King, or his Queen, and Chil∣dren, and that there should be no Remedy left for the general Oppression, and Violation of the Laws and Rights of the whole Nation in general, and that whe∣ther the King would or not? for if it had lain in his power to have hindred it by dissolving the Parliament, this Law had been wholly in vain; so that this will serve to answer your other Quotation out of <HI>Bracton,</HI> concerning the King's Charters, or Grants, (for so I suppose <HI>factis</HI> is to be rendred in this place) that no private persons, no not the Kings Justices could in those days take upon them
<PB N="698" REF="375"/>
to dispute about, or interpret their meaning, but it was to be left to the King himself; but how! not to his private Interpretation in his Chamber or Privy Council, but to his Interpretation in his Great Council in Parliament; which as I proved in our fifth Meeting consisted of all the great Officers of the Crown, to∣gether with the Judges; who, the King being present, were in the nature of Counsellors or Assessors to him, and there all matters not determinable in ordi∣nary Courts were heard, and determined; and of this nature were the King's Charters, tho' now that Power since the dissolution of that great Court, is fallen partly to the Chancery, and partly to the King's Bench, who do both of them at this day judge of the King's Grants, whether they are according to Law, or not; and can declare them to be void if they are not.</P>

<P>This is right <HI>Rum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Parliament Doctrine,</HI> or rather worse (if worse can be;) for whereas <HI>Bradshaw</HI> and those Mock-Judges appointed by that pretended <HI>Iuncto</HI> plainly asserted an Inherent Right in the People of <HI>England,</HI> and the Par∣liament, as their Representatives, to call the King to an account, and to judge and condemn him as his Superiours; you, to evade that Doctrine, as being expresly condemned both by the first and second Parliaments of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, in the Statutes I have already cited, do fall into a much more dangerous Errour; for whereas those men supposed it was only in the Parliament (and in themselves as their Commoners) to judge and depose the King, and to put him to death for Tyranny; you take this Power out of their hands, and place it in every private person, which you call the <HI>diffusive Body</HI> of the People, which are not only more fallible, but more dangerous Judges, as being more apt to errours and mistakes; but if you would have better consider'd the words, and mean∣ing of that Act I have formerly cited of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 30.</NOTE> for attainting the Regicides, you would there find these words in the Preamble to that Act expresly against you;
<Q>Whereby it is by both Houses of Parliament declared, That by the undoubted, and Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, neither the Peers of this Realm, nor the Commons, nor both toge∣ther in Parliament, nor the People collectively, or representatively, nor any other persons whatsoever ever had, have, hath, or ought to have any Coercive Power over the Persons of the Kings of this Realm.</Q>
Where you see by this Act, that all Power of Judging or Deposing the King is expresly renounced, not only for the Two Houses of Parliament, but for the whole People, whether collective∣ly, or representatively, or for any other persons whatsoever: But as for what you say, that the King in case of a wilful, and constant Violation of the Funda∣mental Laws of the Kingdom, is not then deposed by the People, but deposes himself, and thereby renounces the Government over them; this is but a meer fallacy, and an evasion, which you, and those of your Party have now found out to make the King to have forfeited his Crown without any Judgment of the Par∣liament or People; for who can believe a King will ever depose himself, or do any Act, besides an evident destruction of the People, or a making over his Royal Power, or else an express resignation of the Crown, whereby he can ever be construed to have parted with it; and therefore your Notion is no better than the equivocation of the Jesuits, who if they are asked whether it be lawful or not for Subjects to murder their Kings, will tell you by no means; but it is still
<PB N="699" REF="375"/>
with this mental reservation, that Princes Excommunicated and Deposed by the Pope do thereby cease to be Kings; and therefore their Subjects being thereby discharged of all their Allegiance to them, they may not only be re∣sisted but murdered by them as Tyrants, and Usurpers. Put the People here instead of the Pope, and see if the Parallel does not hold exactly.</P>
<P>But as to your argument, from a necessity of resistance, to a necessity of laying the King aside, because he has forfeited all Rights to the Crown, upon his persisting in the violation of the Fundamental Laws, and refusing to make the People satisfaction, and this upon the account of I know not what original contract; for as to the Coronation Oath, I see you dare not insist upon it, so that I do not now wonder that the Gentlemen of your Principles are so vio∣lent for this right of Resistance, since it is only in order to introduce your Darling Doctrine of the Peoples Power of deposing or laying aside their Kings (as you term it) whenever they shall judge they turn Tyrants, and have there∣by forfeited their Crowns, which is a most dangerous Doctrine: and if it should take effect, the Princes of the World had need look about them, since the Peo∣ple may make up such a pretence (for ought I know) even against the very best of them, that are now Regnant in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But sure absolute Monarchs ought not to be outted of their Crowns by strain∣ed consequences or forced interpretations of Laws, therefore pray shew me this original Contract you so much insist upon, and those conditions on which you suppose our limited Monarchs hold their Crowns; I confess if you could shew me any clause in our Laws, or ancient forms of the Coronation of our Kings, as there was at the Coronation of the Kings of <HI>Arragon,</HI> wherein the chief Justice on the behalf of the People plainly told him that they made him King upon this Condition, that they would have more Power than himself: or that in the conferring of the Regal Power it was expresly reserved in what cases it should be lawful for them to resist the King; or to absolve his Subjects from their Allegiance; as <HI>Bodin</HI> tells us, it was expresly inserted in the Coronation Oath of <HI>Henry</HI> II. Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> (afterwards King of <HI>France,</HI>) when he was made King of <HI>Poland</HI>: that if he broke his Oath and violated the Laws, and Priviledges of the Clergy and Nobility of <HI>Poland,</HI> then the People of that Kingdom should not be obliged to render him any obedience: I grant then that the Liberties of such a People might be preserved, but the King that took upon him the Regal Power upon such conditions, would not be properly a Mo∣narch, but liable to the Judgment of his People, whenever he really did, or that they imagined he had thus violated their Laws, since the Supream Au∣thority would still reside in them.</P>
<P>But indeed the Case (God be thanked) is much otherwise with our Monarchs who are Kings by right of Inheritance, whether ever they take any Coronation Oath, or not: as K. <HI>Edward</HI> the first was, whilst he was in the Holy Land, almost two years before he could come over to be Crown'd; and K. <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth was not Crowned till the eighth year of his Reign, as well as of his Age. But that our Kings are so by Inheritance, and by the Laws of God, and Man pre∣vious to any Coronation Oath, or consent of the People, is expresly declared by the Act of recognition of K. <HI>Iames</HI> I. and that Treason could be commited against
<PB N="700" REF="376"/>
him before he was Crowned, Sir <HI>Edward Cooke</HI> tells us in <HI>Calvin</HI>'s Case,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Cooks</HI> 7<HI>th Rep.</HI></NOTE> was the opinion of all the Judges of <HI>England</HI> in the Plot wherein <HI>Watson</HI> and <HI>Clerk</HI> the Priests were Executed, and Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> condemned. So that what you have now urged from Reason, or Authority of our Antient Law∣yers, is either quite mistaken, or else does not reach the matter in hand; that it cannot be made out from reason, is plain; since your whole Argument is built upon this false foundation, that it is lawful in some cases to resist the King, in case of a notorious breach of the fundamental Laws, and therefore it is ne∣cessary also to declare him to have forfeited his Crown, if he persist in this vio∣lation; whereas I deny your Assumption, for I hold it utterly unlawful to resist, on any pretence, or for any cause whatsoever; and therefore it is impos∣sible for the King who (as I said but now) is an absolute unconditioned Monarch, to forfeit his Crown for any such violation of your Original Contracts, or Fun∣damental Laws of Government: so that let me tell you, that the citations you have brought out of History, as also <HI>Bracton,</HI> and <HI>Fleta,</HI> do not prove either the one or the other of these: for first as to the clause in King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter con∣cerning resistance, and the Barons having a Power thereby to constrain the King to amend his violations of it, by making War upon him, and that they should not return to their former Allegiance till all was redressed; make the most of it, it could be no more than a particular concession for himself alone, and was not intended to reach his Successours, who are not at all mentioned in this Clause; and that it was never intended to reach them, may further appear, because that this clause of resistance is omitted out of all the subsequent great Charters, that were granted by <HI>Henry</HI> the III. or his Son <HI>Edward</HI> the I. and instead of this, it was thought a sufficient security upon the last confirmation of these Charters in the 37 year of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. for the King, Bishops, Earls and Barons to agree, that the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and all the rest of the Bishops should declare all those, that wilfully transgressed or infringed the great Charters in any point, excommunicated <HI>ipso facto,</HI> not excepting the King himself, according to the form of it, which you will find in <HI>Mat. Paris</HI>; and other Writers of this Transaction. But for the places you have cited out of <HI>Bracton,</HI> there is none of them reach the point in question; for as to the first, <HI>non est Rex ubi dominatur voluntas &amp; non Rex</HI>▪ the meaning of it is not that he is no King, but that he does not act as a King, but a Tyrant, when he thus governs by his meer Will, and not by Law; and to the same effect is the next passage, <HI>Rex est, dum bene regit; Tyrannus, dum Populum fibi tradi um violenta opprimit dominatione</HI>; all which we readily grant; yet since he is still an absolute Mo∣narch, all Writers hold, that his governing without or against Law, cannot give the subjects a power to resist him, much less can it be construed as a renun∣ciation or forfeiture of his imperial Power; and therefore tho' it is true, that as <HI>Bracton,</HI> and <HI>Fleta</HI> tell us, whilst he thus acts, he does not act as God's Lieute∣nant but the Devils Minister; yet does it not follow that we may therefore resist him with carnal Weapons, or force, since we cannot so resist the Devil himself; and tho' he may in this matter of breach of the Laws, which he has sworn to observe, act as the Devils Minister, yet notwithstanding in all other
<PB N="701" REF="376"/>
points of Government, as in the Punishment of Robbers, and other notorious offenders, and in the due Administration of Justice between Man and Man, he still acts as Gods Lieutenant; and it is much better that we should have some civil Government tho' mixt with Tyranny, and oppression, than that we should fall into all the mischiefs and confusions of a Civil War; nay, that Anarchy too which has been often produced by it: and tho' I confess the last place you have made use of, to wit, <HI>Rex habet Superiorem, Legem, &amp; Curiam suam, viz. Co∣mites &amp; Barones, &amp;c.</HI> who ought, if he transgress the Law, to put a Bridle upon him, yet by this (as I have already proved) neither <HI>Bracton</HI> nor <HI>Fleta</HI> could mean any co-active <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orce, but only a Moral restraint upon the King by Petitions, Re∣monstrances, or denial of aids, till he would be Reform'd by fair means; but that it does not go farther, appears by the parrallel <HI>Bracton</HI> there makes be∣tween our Saviour Christ and the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> who being both free from the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> yet voluntarily chose to be obedient to it; which sufficiently proves, that those Authors never designed that the Parliament should oblige the King by force, or whether He would or no, to amend his faults; since that was as you your self must acknowledge against their very institution; since both their mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing, and their dissolution, wholly depend upon the Kings Will.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have made a long, and elaborate speech in answer to my no∣tion, that a King may forfeit his Crown, that is, by his own act, cease to be King; but I shall be able to give you a satisfactory answer to all this, if you please to take it; In the first place therefore, I cannot but observe, that all your Dis∣course depends upon two Principles, alike false; first, that no absolute Mo∣narch, can by his own act forfeit, or lose his right to the Government, without a formal resignation of the Crown; or, secondly, that the Kings of <HI>England</HI> have ever been such absolute Monarchs: which if they are both great mistakes, all that you have said on this head falls of it self. Now that a King, tho' an absolute Monarch, may do such an act as shall make a forfeiture of his Crown, without any solemn resignation of it, you your self are forced to allow, in the two cases you have put, <HI>viz.</HI> that of such a Monarchs becoming an Enemy to his People, and going about to destroy them; and that of his making over his King∣dom, to another without the Peoples consent: now if the diffusive body of the People in an absolute Government, can judge of these two cases whenever they happen, without appealing to any General Council, or Assembly of the whole Nation; I desire to know why it may not be as easie and lawful for the People to judge without a Parliament, when the fundamental Laws of the constitution are generally and wilfully broken and violated; and that violation persisted in by the King, for the introduction of Tyranny and an Arbitrary Government; since the Rules I have laid down to know it are but a few, and easie to be known and judged of by the most common capacities. Now that a Superiour or Go∣vernour may lose all that power and authority he once had, and that without any act of the party governed, may appear by those great and natural relations of a Husband, and a Master: in the former of which, if a Husband, in the state of nature, use his Wife so cruelly, that she can no longer live or co-habit with him, without danger of her Life, I doubt not but she may quit him; and may also when she is out of his Power, Marry her self again to another Man that
<PB N="702" REF="377"/>
will use her better: so in the other relation of a Master, if such a one, in the state of Nature have a Slave, and will not allow him sufficient Cloaths, Victu∣als, or will beat him, or use him so cruelly for no just cause, that he cannot en∣joy the ordinary comforts of Life; no man will deny, but that such a slave may lawfully run away from such a Master, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s at liberty either to live of him∣self, or to chuse another Master if he think good: and this instance is much more strong in an hired Servant; who is to serve his Master, for such and such Wages, or to do such and such Work, and no other; if in this case the Master refuse to pay him his Wages, or put him to do other work than what was agreed upon between them; or instead of an hired Servant will make him his abso∣lute Slave; in these cases no man can doubt, but by this unjust treatment of the Master, the Servant is discharged of his Service, and may go whether he pleases; and of these actions, I have already proved at our first meeting, the party injured, be they Wife, or Servant, must be the only Judges in the state of Nature, where there is no Civil Power over them; or else if the Husband or Master shall Judge for himself, the Wife or Servant is never like to get any Redress; apply this to the case of a limited, or conditional King, and his Sub∣jects, and see if it be not absolutely the same, upon the total breach of the Original constitution of the Government; and whether the Bond of Allegiance is not then as absolutely dissolved, by the sole act of the Prince, without any authoritative power in the Subjects, as it is in the case of such a Wife or Servant, by the sole Act of the Husband, or Master without any Superior Authority in such Wife or Ser∣vant, to quit them, and so to discharge themselves of their Wedlock, or Service.</P>
<P>Therefore as to your accusation, that my notion is worse than that of the Rump Parliament, that put the King to death, I deny it; for they supposed that there was no way of being rid of a Tyrannical King, but by making the People, (and consequently the Parliament as their Representatives) his Supe∣riours or Judges, to call him to an account, and Judge and Punish him for his Ty∣ranny; this I abhor, as much as your self, for I grant that a King cannot be pro∣perly the Supream, and at the same time own another Power above him, to Punish, or call him to an Account for his Miscarriages; but this Power that I insist on, is not (as I have all along told you) a power of punishment, but a right of resistance for self-defence, in the first place, and of Judging and De∣claring the King to have forfeited his Crown or Right to Govern, if he persist in his Tyranny, without any amendment, or satisfaction given to the People.</P>
<P>Nor is this Doctrine of the Peoples thus Judging for themselves, so dan∣gerous as that of the Rumpers (as you suppose,) who put this right of Judging, when the King had thus forfeited his Power in the Parliament, of which they thought themselves the only lawful, or necessary Members; but indeed it was not so, for they still supposed him to be their lawful King, and yet at the same pretended to Arraign him, as you may see by the Title of the Charge, or In∣dictment they drew up against him; all which I grant to be altogether unjust and illegal; but it is not more, but rather less dangerous to put this power of Judg∣ing, when the King has thus dissolved the Government, and forfeited his Crown, upon such notorious and wilful breaches of the Fundamental Laws, in the whole or diffusive body of the People, rather than in the Parliament, or great Council of the Nation; for as to your assertion, that the whole People are more
<PB N="703" REF="377"/>
fallible, and consequently more dangerous Judges in such a Case, than the great Council, I deny it, since all the matters of fact must be so evident and notorious to the senses and feeling of the greater part of the People, that there can be no doubt or denial of it, by any reasonable and indifferent Judges; and the great∣est part of the People are willing to live in Peace, without making any disturbance or alteration in the Government, if it may be avoided; whereas in any great Assembly or Council, there are, many and those of the most eloquent and leading Men, who commonly carry the rest which way they please, who are governed by faction, ambition, or self-interest; and upon all, or some of these, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be desirous to raise Civil Wars, or to declare the King to have done things that require resistance, or to have forfeited his Crown, when in∣deed he has not; and for this the very Long Parliament you mention is an evident example, since you cannot but grant, that if the differences between the King and that Parliament had been left to the Judgment of the whole People, there had never been any Civil War at all, nor had the King ever been beheaded; since it is notoriously known, that before the Parliament stirr'd up the People to War, by seizing of the Militia, they were not at all inclined to it. It being a restless, and factious, ambitious party of men on both sides, who brought on the last Ci∣vil War: Not but that I defer much to the Judgment of a free, and unbyast Par∣liament, who may confirm, and declare what the diffusive body of the People have already justly done, to be right, and lawful, which may be as great a sa∣tisfaction to private Mens Consciences in Civil Disputes, as a general Council is in Spiritual Controversies about matters of Religion; wherein tho' such a Council cannot make new Articles of Faith, yet we Protestants hold that it may declare what were anciently believed: but if the People have a right of Judging during the intervals of Parliament, when the King has notoriously broke the Fundamental Constitution, and so may make resistance accordingly (as I have already proved they have;) since otherwise the King may absolutely refuse ever to call any Parliament at all, or at least may not let them sit, till all grievances are redressed; so that I cannot see why they may not also Judge, when the King has so wholly broke his Original Contract, and so obstinately per∣sisted in it, as to create a forfeiture of his Crown, since the one is not harder to judge of, than the other; nor is your parallel between our opinion, and that of the Jesuites at all true, unless you could also prove, that I had put the same authority in the People to depose their Kings by a right conferred on them by God, as the Jesuites do in the Pope by such a pretended Power, as Superiour to that of all the Monarchs in the World, but there is nothing like it in my hy∣pothesis. Since I do neither allow the People to Judge, or Depose the King, much less to put him to Death, tho' a Tyrant, but only to Judge, and declare, when he has made such notorious breaches on the fundamental Constitution, as do necessarily imply a forfeiture, or rather an implicite Abdication of his Roy∣al Power, and whereby he deposes himself.</P>
<P>But to come to the second Point, to prove, that our Kings were never abso∣lute Monarchs, or had the sole and absolute authority over the People of this Kingdom, and if so, that there was somewhat still reserved by the People at the first institution of the Government; and which the King by the original contract, when he or his Ancestors took the Crown, must be still supposed as bound
<PB N="704" REF="378"/>
to maintain; now that there must have been such a thing as an Original Con∣tract (however light you are pleas'd to make of it) I thus make out; you may re∣member that at our fifth meeting, I proved, that at the first institution of Kingly Government in this Nation, it was not by right of Inheritance, but Election. 2. That this Election was made either by the whole body of the People in Per∣son, or by their lawful Representatives in the great Councils, or Mycel Synods of the English Saxons. 3. That this great Council did then reserve to them∣selves these material parts of Government. First, A right of Meeting or As∣sembling at stated times of the year; and that without any previous summons from the King. 2. A right of proposing or at least o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> assending to all Laws that should be made in all future times. 3. A right of granting general Aids, or Taxes for the People, and that without their consent no Taxes could be im∣posed. 4. And as subsequent to all these a right of agreeing to all Wars, and Treaties of Peace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be made with Foreign Nations: but the first and last of these tho' I could prove to have been constantly observed, during the Saxon Government, and long after, yet since the People have parted with their right to their Kings in these matters, I shall not now insist upon them, only that this People have still a right to Parliaments, once in three years at least, and oftner if necessity require.</P>
<P>These then being the Original Constitutions of the Kingdom, the King must have either entred into a compact with the People for the maintenance and observation of these fundamental rights, or else it must have been left to his discretion, whether he would suffer the People to enjoy them or not: if the lat∣ter had been true, then I grant they had made him an Absolute Monarch, and had left it wholly at his discretion, whether they should enjoy these fundamen∣tal Rights and Priviledges or not; but it appears plainly to the contrary that they did not, for I shall prove (if need be) that the Succession to the Crown was at first Elective, and not Hereditary; now in all Elective Kingdoms of the Go∣thick Model, it is very well known that their Kings were so far from being abso∣lute, that the Assembly of Estates, or great Councils of those Kingdoms reserv∣ed to themselves a power of Deposing their Kings for Tyranny and Mis govern∣ment; as I have already proved was frequently done, not only in <HI>England,</HI> but in all the neighbouring Kingdoms without any imputation of Rebellion: and I have also given you a quotation out of the ancient mirrour of Justices; which tells us, that upon the Election of the first King of this whole Island.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mirrour.</HI> p. 8.</NOTE>
<Q>The Princes that chose him then caused him to swear, that he would maintain the Holy Christian Faith with all his power, should Rule his People justly without regard to any person, and should be obedient to suffer Right, or Justice, as well as others, his Subjects.</Q></P>
<P>And now that upon a failure to perform these things, a forfeiture of the Crown would follow, and that thereupon he would cease to be King: Pray see those ancient Laws in <HI>Lambards</HI> Saxon Laws, and Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI>'s Councils which go under the name of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Con∣fessors:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Spel. Concil.

one. <HI>Rex autem qui est vi arius summi Regis ad hoc est constitutus ut Regnum terre∣num, &amp; populum Domini, &amp; super omnia sanctam veneretur Ecclesiam, &amp; ab injuriis defendat, &amp; m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leficos ab ea evellat, &amp; penitus dispendat, quod nisi fecerit nec nomen Regis in eo constabit,</HI> that is, not so much as the Title of King shall remain to him: and in the same sense <HI>Bracton</HI> is to be understood, as an explanation of this Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 24.</NOTE> in his second book; <HI>est enim Corona Re∣gis facere Iustitiam, &amp; Iudicium, &amp; pacem tenere, sine quibus confistere non potest, nec teneri</HI>; which may be thus rendered; that it is the Royal office or dignity, (for so I construe <HI>Corona Regis</HI>) to do Justice, and Judgment, and to maintain peace▪ without the observation of which, his Crown or Royal Dignity cannot hold▪ nor consist: so that this is but an explanation of my sense of that other passage I have already cited out of this Authour, <HI>non est Rex ubi dominatur voluntos, &amp; non Lex, i. e.</HI> He is not a King, (that is, ceases to be a King) when his Will, and not the Law Governs; and he gives the reason for it in another place, speaking of the King, when he was not then Hereditary, for, <HI>ad hoc electus est Rex, &amp; constitutus, ut faciat Iustitiam universis.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore if he thus totally deviate from the end of his Creation, his Autho∣rity ceases, and is at an end. So that nothing is plainer, than that our Ancient Laws have declared, the King to have lost the Title and Right of being King in case of notorious Tyranny, and breach of this Original Contract; and that the ancient Lawyers, <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Fleta,</HI> gave the same interpretation of this Law, is also as plain.</P>
<P>So that what you have said to evade or misinterpret the authority of these Authors, as to the points of Non-resistance and Forfeiture of the Regal Power, will signifie nothing; for as to what you say of that clause of resistance being left out in all subsequent Charters after this of K. <HI>Iohn</HI>'s, and therefore that it was no binding Law to his Successours, I do not deny the matter of fact, that it was so omitted; yet that does not prove, that the whole Nation ever renounced their right of resistance in the cases mention'd; since as they exercised it before that Charter was given; so also they continued to do it in the Reigns of his Successours, as I have shewn in the History I have given you of this Re∣sistance at our last meeting, and therefore constant practice is the best Inter∣preter of this Fundamental Law: as for our evasion of that place of <HI>Bracton, non est Rex, &amp;c.</HI> I have sufficiently confirmed my sense of it, by this Law of K. <HI>Edward,</HI> as also by other passages out of this Author: and I will leave it to any man to judge which is the most genuine Interpretation of this place; He is not a King, (that is ceases to be so) when his Will, and not the Law Rules; or that he does not act as a King, as you interpret it: but you grant such a King is really a Tyrant, yet may not be resisted, nor can lose his power; and why? because it is absolute and unconditional; this is to take that for granted which we deny, for he that hath not the full and sole power of making Laws, and imposing Taxes, is not absolute Monarch; but the King of <HI>England</HI> has neither of these, <HI>Ergo, &amp;c.</HI> and if this be so, see what <HI>Grotius</HI> says expresly of such a Prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> I. <HI>Cap.</HI> IV. § 13.</NOTE> (as high as he is for the non<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resistance of Absolute Monarchs,) <HI>Si Rex partem habeat summi Imperii, par∣tem alteram populus, aut senatus, Regi in partem non suam involanti

Why then, say you, all the remedy was, <HI>expectet Deum Vltorem</HI>; now if this was all, then every private subject had such a moral superiority; for <HI>Bracton</HI> says of them, <HI>locus erit supplicationi, ut factum corrigat, &amp; emendet, quod sinon fecerit, &amp;c.</HI> then he was to look for God to revenge it: but <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Fleta</HI> are more express in this point, and say, that this <HI>Curia Baronum,</HI> were not only <HI>Socli,</HI> but <HI>Magistri</HI>; for say they, <HI>qui habet Socium, habet Magistrum,</HI> so that surely this Bridle must have been somewhat more than bare Prayers, Remonstrances, or denial of Money; nor is your reason to the contrary cogent, since it is only drawn from a simile between Christ, the bles∣sed Virgin, and the Law of <HI>Moses</HI>: now you know very well, that similes are not arguments, nor can any argument be drawn from them, but indeed it plainly appears by what follows in <HI>Bracton,</HI> that he supposed this power to be somewhat more than meerly moral; for he there says, that if the People cry to God for want of Justice against the King, he will send for a Foreign Nation who shall come and destroy both them (<HI>viz.</HI> the Barons) and their King, which would have been a vain threat, if He might have chosen whether he would be reformed by them or not.</P>
<P>To conclude, if the first King of the Saxon Race took the Crown upon con∣dition to maintain the Fundamental Laws, and constitution of the Government, and that he was never invested with an absolute despotick power of making Laws, and raising Money at his pleasure, but the people reserved to themselves their share of both, at the first institution of the Monarchy; all those Princes that claim by Vertue of their Right, are tied by this first original contract, whether they ever took any Coronation Oath, or not; nor tho the Crown now become no more Elective, does it, at all alter the condition or the limitation of his Ance∣stors, as long as the present King holds by, and under the same Title, and by vertue of the same original contract; since, as it was by the Peoples will, that it was at first Elective, so it was also by their Will, that it became successive; since every entail of the Crown upon heirs, can only proceed from the Peoples agreement or consent to maintain it as a standing Law, or else every King might alter it at his pleasure.</P>
<P>As for your next reply, that if we resist the King, because when he turns Ty∣rant, he Acts not as Gods Lieutenant, but the Devils Minister; for, so that
<PB N="707" REF="379"/>
tho' it is lawful to resist the Devil, yet we cannot use carnal force against him, this assumption is false, since if we can suppose the Devil does ever use carnal force, we may also repel the same by force, or else those famous Stories of Witches, and Spirits being afraid of, and flying from naked Swords are all false: I beg your pardon for speaking so long; which I could not well contract into less compass without passing by your arguments and answers to my quota∣tions.</P>

<P>You have indeed out-done me in making long Speeches, but I have heard you patiently, because I cannot deny, but that you have argued fairly, had it been upon a right foundation; but since it is not, pray give me leave to set you right, and shew you, that notwithstanding all you have urged to the contrary, yet all our Kings since the Conquest were absolute Monarchs; and if so, not only irresistible upon any breach of their Coronation Oaths, but also have been invested with such an absolute unconditioned power, as can never be lost or forfeited upon account of the highest acts of Tyranny; but before I come to my proofs, give me leave to say somewhat to those last cita∣tions you have brought from King <HI>Edwards</HI> Laws, as also from <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Fleta.</HI> First, as to that Law you have cited, that passes under the Title of one of those confirmed by King <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour; give me leave to tell you, that I much question whether it be genuine, and not foisted in by some of the Monks that had the keeping of the Copies of those Laws in their Monasteries, after the Original it self was no more to be found; for in the first place I must observe, it does not savour of that absolute Power, that I take K. <HI>William</HI> to have acquit∣ed by his Sword, to own his Royal Dignity forfeitable, or that he could lose the name of King upon any account whatsoever, at this pretended Law seems to intimate, by these words, <HI>nec nomen Regis in to constabit</HI>; now that it strongly savours of the ignorance of the Monks, I shall shew you by the very Law it self, wherein the chief points, for which the King must lose his Royal Title, is not only if he does not defend his Earthly Kingdom, but also the People of God, that is, the Clergy, and also shall fail to reverence Holy Church, that is, the Bi∣shops and Clergy, of whom the Monks looked upon themselves as the chief, and most considerable part; as also if he fail to destroy evil doers, (that is Here∣ticks out of the Church) then (forsooth) not so much as the name of King must remain to him; now pray see the consequence of this, and whether you will own this to be a fundamental Law of the Kingdom, for then at this rate, <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. who suppressed Monasteries, and took away Abby-Lands, and let injurious persons spoil the Church by Sacriledge, and also all other Princes, who have not extirpated those, who, when this Law was supposed to have been made, would have passed for Hereticks (that is all Protestants) must have all forfeited their Royal Dignities, and consequently the Pope did <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> no wrong, if in pursuance of this Law, they Excommuni∣cated them, and declared they had forfeited their Crown, since this Law says, that Pope <HI>Iohn</HI> testified this truth <HI>quod nomen Regis perdet.</HI>.. But nothing makes out more evidently to me the forgery of this pretended Law, than the notorious faults there are in the Chronology, where the sentence of Pope <HI>Iohn</HI> against King <HI>Childerick</HI> is mentioned as an evidence to make it good, whereas indeed it
<PB N="708" REF="380"/>
was not Pope <HI>Iohn,</HI> but <HI>Zachary</HI> who gave this sentence; But in <HI>Hovedens</HI> Copy of this Law, there is yet a more gross errour; for it makes <HI>Pipin,</HI> and his Son <HI>Charles</HI> to have writ to <HI>William</HI> the Bastard, upon their hearing this definitive sentence, so wisely given by him concerning the Title of King; all which is so notorious a piece of folly, and ignorance, that it needs no other confuration; But granting that part, containing the Law it self, to be genuine, it does not at all set forth your Original Contract, or make it a forfeiture in the King to do any of those things which you supposed to be main parts of the Fundamental Consti∣tution; only says in general,
<Q>that unless he defend his Earthly Kingdom, and the People of God, and reverence Holy Church by defending it from injurious Persons, and removing Evil doers from it, name of the King will not be∣long to him; now all this the most absolute Monarch in Christendom, even the King of <HI>France</HI> himself will say he performs to a tittle; and therefore there is no fear of a forfeiture for any King, tho' never so Absolute and Tyrannical upon these Terms, unless he will do that which I think he is too wise ever to go about, to destroy his People wilfully, or to fall upon the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> and its Clergy.</Q></P>
<P>As for the rest of the places you have cited out of <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Fleta,</HI> to prove this Notion of a Forfeiture, I must freely tell you that they do not seem to me to come up to the point for which you bring them; for as to that place you have cited out of <HI>Bracton, non est Rex, &amp;c.</HI> you and I differ about the sense of it, and I see no reason why I may not still keep my own opinion: the other place I con∣fess seems more express, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That it is the Crown or Dignity of the King to do Justice or Judgment, without which it cannot hold or consist; this also does refer only to such Justice and Judgment as the King is to give and distri∣bute between Man and Man, without any relation to his own actions towards his Subjects; and if a Prince will not do this, either by Himself or Deputies, I grant his Crown, or Royal Dignity cannot long subsist to be maintained, since this will bring all things to utter confusion, so that strangers will soon be encou∣raged to Invade the Kingdom, nor will the People be at all concerned to assist such a King against them; since they can be in no worse a condition under a stranger than under him; But as for the ancient Superiority of the Law and Court of Barons, there mentioned, to be over the King, that still seems to me to be only a Moral, and not a Co-ercive Power; since the law alone is but a dead letter, and can force no man of it self, without the power of Men to support it; and there can be no Interpreters of this Law but the King, and his Judges out of Parliament; and the Parliament sitting, that alone, that is, not the House of Peers or Commons alone, or both together, but the King, Lords, and Com∣mons that can interpret Laws: but let the power of this Court of Barons have been anciently what it will, it seems to relate only to the Peers or Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> and not to the Commons at all, since none ever heard them called the Kings Companions; but suppose it so, it is now gone, and as for any co-ercive power in the two Houses over the King, I have already shewed you, that the two first Parliaments of King <HI>Charles</HI> the second, have expresly renounced it from themselves and the whole Nation; and therefore I must still stick to my first conclusion, that the King is not to be resisted upon any Terms whatsoever,
<PB N="709" REF="380"/>
neither can forfeit his Royal Dignity by certain general, antiquated Laws, or by the forced interpretations of some doubtful obscure passages in our ancient Lawyers: But I shall now proceed to prove,</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray give me leave to reply to what you have now said, before you go to any new Head, First, In answer to what you have now objected against the Genuineness of this Law of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessors, it is certain, that it is found in these very words, with very little alteration in all the Copies of King <HI>Edwards</HI> Laws; only in <HI>Hoveden,</HI> instead of <HI>Rex quia Vicarius summi Regis,</HI> it is, <HI>Rex atque Vicarius ejus,</HI> which is no great difference, and may relate to the Kings Lieutenant in his absence beyond the Seas, as there was often occasion for our Kings, after their Accession to the Crown of <HI>England</HI>; and therefore tho' I grant some Clergy-men (they having then all the learning of the Nation a∣mong them) might draw up this Law into the form it was made, and so render it as advantagious for the Church as they could, yet that this Clause was not the addition of any ignorant Monk (as you suppose) will appear from this, that it is Recorded by <HI>Hoveden,</HI> who lived and wrote about a hundred years after it was thus confirmed; and we cannot suppose all the copies of these Laws to be lost, and one single copy to be left and corrupted in so short a Time; and tho' it is true, this Law is not found among those set forth in the last Edition of <HI>Iugulph,</HI> yet does it not therefore follow, that there was no such Law ever made or confirmed by King <HI>William,</HI> since those Laws in <HI>Ingulph</HI> seem to be more like an Epitome of the criminal and feudal Laws confirmed, or added by that King, than an exact body of all the Laws of the Confessor, those having been writ in Latine, and confirmed by K. <HI>William</HI> in the fourth year of his Reign; whereas this Copy was published in French for the use of the Kings <HI>Norman</HI> and French Subjects, and that long after K. <HI>Williams</HI> coming to the Crown; for <HI>Ingulph</HI> tells us,
<Q>That after <HI>Domesday</HI> book was made, he brought those Laws down from <HI>London</HI> in the French Tongue (in which they were put forth, lest he or any of his Monks, should through Ignorance happen to offend his Royal Majesty by an unwary breach of them;)</Q>
But as for the faults in the Chrono∣logy in the Story of <HI>Charles</HI> and <HI>Pipin</HI> in all the best Copies of these Laws, this Letter is said to be written by them to the Pope, and not to K. <HI>William</HI> at all, and then it will be at most but a <HI>miss-nomer</HI> or errour of the Transcriber putting in Pope <HI>Iohn,</HI> for <HI>Zachary</HI>; but if you will have my opinion of this matter, I do freely grant that this passage in the Law concerning Princes writing to the Pope about the deposition of K. <HI>Childerick</HI> might be an Addition of those Monks who first Transcribed those Laws, and made short glosses upon them, and yet the law it self might be genuine notwithstanding; and if the Law it self be so, it must be understood in a larger sense than what you would put upon it, for sure by defend¦ing of his Kingdom must be meant, not only the bare defending it against foreign Enemies, but also against the wrongs and oppressions of his own Ministers, and Officers, which if he suffer by a wilful negligence, or on se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> purposes, he will as much offend against this Law, as if he had done it himself, and so will lye under the same penalty. Much less will these passages concerning defending the Clergy, and reverencing the Church, render this Law either void, or im∣practicable; for suppose, you take <HI>Populus Dei,</HI> in the strictest sense to signifie
<PB N="710" REF="381"/>
the same with <HI>Servu Dei,</HI> (which I grant always to signifie the Clergy in our ancient Saxon Laws and Charters) yet all this does not make this Law void and impracticable▪ since, sure maintaining the Worship of God is one part of the duty of a Christian King, nor can this be well performed without some Men set up for that purpose, and that these Men cannot attend their Sacred Function without being maintained in their just Rights and Liberties; neither is it any consequence that these Clergy must always consist of the very same Orders of Men, as when this Law was made, so that suppose the Monks were then held as a necessary part of this Clergy, it will not follow; that it was not lawful for the State to alter or take them away; for then no Religious Order that was then in being, could have been suppressed afterwards, which no Papist will say; so that the meaning of this clause in the Oath, is no more than that the King should from time to time defend all those Clergy, such which the Nation, that is, the Legislative Power should think useful, and necessary for Gods service, without being tyed to any certain Orders or Degrees of Men; provided those that are particularly ordained by Christ and his Apostles, for the service of his Church, be inviolably maintained and preserved; so likewise for the Church it self, granting (which may also be questioned) that at the time when this Law was made or confirmed, Popery was come to its height, and so was the establish∣ed Religion of the Nation: and consequently that by the Church here men∣tioned, was then to be understood the Romish Church or Religion, (as we now call it) yet does it not follow, that the King by this Law is to forfeit his Crown, if he ever alter; for the Law only says in general, that he shall reverence the Church of God; that is, that Profession of Christianity, or Way, which he, and the great Council of the Nation, shall upon the most mature Judgment and Deliberation think to be so; so that all that can be deduced from this clause is, that the King shall reverence the Church, that is, maintain the profession of Religion, which shall be established by Law, and shall make no alteration therein, without the general consent of the whole Nation in their great Coun∣cils or Synods, consisting as well of Ecclesiastical as Secular Members; and so likewise he shall defend it from all injurious Persons, that would invade the Rights of the Church and its Clergy, contrary to Law, and shall root out all evil doers; that is, all debaucht, and wicked Professors of Christianity; for so <HI>malesicos</HI> properly signifies, and not Hereticks; as you would render it (who are not Evil doers, but false Believers) or if it should be interpreted for Here∣ticks, it is not those that then might be looked upon as such, but what the pre∣sent Church shall so determine; or else we must own the former Church to have been infallible in all her determinations. So that I can see no reason upon the whole matter, why this Law should now become void; or unprofitable by reason of any alterations in Religion, or of those men that were then to exer∣cise the functions of it; as long as all the necessary and material parts of both are preserved, as they are to this day: for otherwise this Law would have ty∣ed up the King and Nation, from making any Reformation in Religion, tho' never so much for the better, or tho' the National Church had never so much required it, which I suppose no true Protestant will affirm.</P>
<P><PB N="711" REF="381"/>But as for those passages out of <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Fleta</HI> which I have brought to confirm and support our sense of this Law; and which you labour to avoid by putting too general and loose an interpretation upon them; whereby you would make them only to signifie that the King is to maintain right Judgment and Justice between Man and Man, without which his Royal Dignity cannot hold or subsist; but that he is not obliged upon any penalty to observe the same things in respect of himself, or his own Officers, or Ministers; this is all one, as if a Shepherd, who had a Flock of Sheep committed to his charge by the owner, having first fleeced, and then killed, and destroyed them, and con∣verted the Wooll and Carkasses to his own private use, should then tell the owner, that he was indeed to defend the Flock from Thieves, Wolves, and Foxes, but that it was no part of his bargain to keep them safe untoucht from himself, or his Servants: or so much as his own Dogs; but that the sense of <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta</HI> is quite otherwise, sufficiently appears by these places I have now cited, and if those will not do, pray consider these that I shall nere add; for <HI>Bracton</HI> also in the same chapter tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Cap.</HI> 9.</NOTE> <HI>ad hoc creatus est [Rex] &amp; electus, ut, Iustitiam faciat universis,</HI> and he also there recites the an∣cient Coronation Oath in these words. <HI>Debit enim [Rex] in Coronatione sua nomine Iesu Christi haec tria promittere Populo sibi subdito, Imprimis se esse praecipturum, &amp; pro virious opem impensurum ut omni Populo Christiano vera pax omni suo tempore observetur.</HI> 2. <HI>Vt rapacitates &amp; omnes iniquitates interdicat.</HI> 3. <HI>Vt in omnibus Iudiciis equitatem prae∣cipiat, &amp; misericordiam, ut indulgeat ei suam misericordiam Clemens Deus.</HI> Now how can a King observe this Oath, that spoils the people of their Goods, and raises Taxes contrary to Law, or how can he continue King, who violates all the ends of his Creation? from all which it appears, that by this Justice and Judgment must be meant, not only the Kings own observing Justice towards his People, not only by not commanding, but also hindering his inferiour Mi∣nisters and Officers, from spoiling and oppressing them, and that no preroga∣tive can justifie him in the doing otherwise, is as evident from another place in <HI>Bracton,</HI> where he tells us, that <HI>Regia potestas Iuris est, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Injuriae, &amp; nihil aliud potest Rex nisi quod jure potest.</HI> But <HI>Fleta</HI> is somewhat larger on this head, tho' to the same effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>Cap.</HI> 17.</NOTE> when speaking of the Kings Power or Pre∣rogative, he says thus; <HI>&amp; licet omnes potentia praecellat, cor tamen ipsius in manu Dei esse debet, &amp; ne potentia sua man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> infranata fraenum imponat temperantiae, &amp; lora moderantiae; ne trahetur ad injuriam, quia nihil aliud, hoc est<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in terra, nisi quod de Iure potest nec obstat quod dicitur, quod Principi placet Legis habet potestatim, quia sequitur cum lege Regia, quae de ejus Imperio lata est, non qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quid de voluntate Regis tanto pere praesumptum est, sed quod Magnatum suorum consilio Rege authoritatem praestante, &amp; habita super hoc de∣liberatione, &amp; tractatu recte fuerit de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>initum,</HI> which not only shews, that our an∣cient English Lawyers in this agreed with the Civil Law, and gave the same account of the original of the Royal Power as that Law does, <HI>viz.</HI> that it was conferred by the People of <HI>Rome,</HI> on the Roman Emperour, by the <HI>Lex Regia</HI> mentioned in the old Civilians I have formerly cited; and also shews that our ancient Lawyers supposed that by a like Law among us, the Royal Authority was originally derived from the consent of the People of <HI>England</HI>; without whose advice, and assent included in that of their Representatives, here called
<PB N="712" REF="382"/>
<HI>consitium Magnatum</HI> (<HI>consilium</HI> being taken for consent in this place, as I have proved it often signify'd) no Law can ever be made: now if the King will not be ruled by this bridle of moderation, this Author as well as <HI>Bracton</HI> tell us, that the King then hath his Superiours, the Law and his Court of Barons; who were as Masters to put this Bridle upon him. But admit he will run away with this Bridle between his Teeth, all this had signified nothing, if there be no other remedy left us, besides bare supplication, or remonstrances to the King of his duty; and he might have dissolved the Parliament before ever it could have any time to do either the one or the other.</P>
<P>To conclude, if the King was at first elected, and created for this end, that he may do Justice to all men; and that this Justice does not only concern his maintaining Justice between his Subjects one towards another, but also in respect of himself, his Children and Subordinate Officers and Ministers, that act by his Commission, appears by what follows in <HI>Bracton</HI> after the Kings Coronation Oath: <HI>Potestas (scil. Regis) ita{que} Iuris est non injuriae, &amp; cum ipse sit Author Iuris, non debet inde injuriarum nasci occasio, &amp; etiam qui ex officio suo alios prohibere necesse habet, id ipsum in propria persona committere non debet.</HI> So that it is as plain, that if he either command, or permit these willful injuries generally, or all over his Kingdom, he fails to defend it according to K. <HI>Edward</HI>'s Laws, and if he thus fail to defend it, he thereupon loses or forfeits his very Title or Office of a King, since he cannot keep or hold his Crown, or Royal Dignity, for with∣out Justice it cannot subsist, and this by the original contract; since upon what∣ever Terms the first King of this Race, took the Crown, upon the same Terms all his Posterity who succeed either by election or right of blood, by vertue of that first compact are to hold it under the like penalty of a forfeiture, in case of a wilful neglect, or violation of his duty.</P>

<P>I confess you have made a specious proof of this original contract you so much talk of, and more than ever I thought could have been said for it; but let it be what it will, it is certain in the first place, that whatever co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ercive Power the two Houses of Parliament might pretend to when <HI>Bracton</HI> wrote, they have solemnly renounced it in two successive Parliaments in the Reign of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the II. therefore I shall not insist any longer upon old antiquated Laws, or original contracts; which are not directly expressed, but consequen∣tially deduced at best: but I must now tell you, that let the first institution of this Government have been what it will in the Saxon times, and what original contract soever you may please to fancy between them and their Subjects, yet this was all gone, and out of doors, by that absolute Conquest which K. <HI>William</HI> I. made of this Kingdom for himself; and his heirs who do not at all claim under the Title of our English Kings. For since their Ancestor had no just Title to the Crown but by the Sword, and that he gain'd this Kingdom by the Conquest of K. <HI>Harold</HI>; and the People of <HI>England</HI> who had elected him, and fought for him; as also by the subsequent recognition of this right, by all the People of <HI>England,</HI> in their Oaths of Allegiance so often repeated to himself and his Suc∣cessors, have thereby acknowledged it to be as absolute a Monarchy by conquest, as ever was instituted by any Prince in the World; and tho' I grant that seve∣ral of the Conquerours have been graciously pleased to grant divers Priviledges
<PB N="713" REF="382"/>
to the People of this Nation, and some of them perhaps the same they enjoy∣ed in the Saxon time; yet can they not enjoy it by vertue of that Original Contract you suppose to have been made, between the first King of that Saxon Race, and the People of <HI>England</HI>; for as I said but now K. <HI>William</HI> had no right by any Title from K. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, but wholly by his Sword, as I shall prove by and by.</P>
<P>But however these concessions ought not at all to derogate from the absolute∣ness of the Power, or the indefensibleness of our Kings Title, for since these li∣mitations of absolute, or imperial Power did not proceed from any other Original, than the free &amp; voluntary concessions of our King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, &amp; not from any compacts with their People; they do not at all derogate from the uncontroulable and unancountable Soveraignty thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>It. I.</HI> p. 211.</NOTE> so that we may very well distinguish between the Being, and Essence of Imperial or Soveraign Power, and the exercise or emanation thereof; as to the Being and Essence of it, it is in as full perfection in the Limited, as in the Arbitrary Sovereign, tho' the Law confines and limits him in the exercise thereof; but to be confined in the exercise doth not destroy the Being, nor diminish the perfection of Sove∣reign Power, for then the Power of God himself could not be Sovereign, be∣cause there are certain immutable Rules of Truth, and Justice within which it is necessarily limited, and confined; but God is nevertheless a perfect Imperial Sovereign over the Universe, tho' the exercise of his Government over his Creatures, be limited by the eternal Laws of Truth and Equity; it is true, that this limitation of Almighty God is intriasical, and proceeds from the perfection of his Righteous and Holy Nature; but yet it shews, that the most perfect and absolute imperial Powe, may, without a contradiction, be confined within bounds, and limited in the actual exercise thereof, and that such limitation of Absolute Imperial Power (proceeding wholly from it self) doth only qualifie, and temper, but not destroy the essence of it; and therefore <HI>Cooke</HI> in <HI>Cawdrey</HI>'s Case, saith, that by the Ancient Laws of this Realm, <HI>England</HI> is an Absolute Empire and Monarchy, and that the King is furnisht with plenary, and entire Power, Prerogative and Jurisdiction, and is Supream Governour over all Per∣sons within this Realm.</P>
<P>Therefore whoever will consider the Original of this limitation of Sovereign Power, to have proceeded wholly <HI>ab intrinsico,</HI> from the voluntary Grants of our first Monarchs after the conquest; and will also distinguish the Essence from the exercise of Sovereign Power, will find, there is no contradiction between the fulness of Sovereign Power in the Root,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> or Essence of it, and a legal limitation of the use and exercise there∣of; and from hence it comes to pass, that the King of <HI>England,</HI> tho' he be thus limited in the use and exercise of his Power, yet he is still as much the Foun∣tain of all Power, and Jurisdiction within his Dominions, as if he were Arbi∣trary; he hath none to share with him in the Sovereignty, but all Power and Authority is derived from him, like light from the Sun, in him alone it is ra∣dically and originally placed, he hath no sharers or co-partners with him in the Sovereignty, none co-ordinate with him in the Government, no Equal,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 8.</NOTE> no Superiour, but only God to whom alone he is Subject. Hence saith <HI>Bracton, omnis quidem sub to, &amp; ipse sub nullo
<PB N="714" REF="383"/>
sed tantum sub Deo, non est inferior sibi subjectis, non parem habet in regno suo,</HI> and afterwards, <HI>ips<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> autem Rex non debet esse sub homine, sed sub Deo.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore I grant the King is obliged by his Coronation Oath, to keep to these limitations, which both he, and his Predecessors have sworn to; yet if he any ways fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l in the performance of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, this failure cannot give his People any man∣ner of right to take up Arms against him, and to resist him in any such case, much less can it cause a forfeiture of his Royal Power; since being at first the sole Sove∣reign Power, he did not by putting this limitation thereunto, intend to part with any share of it to the great Council of the Kingdom or Parliament, but only to take them into a part of the care and trouble of the Government, and to limit his Prerogative Power from passing any Laws, or raising any Money without their assent, unless in cases of great necessity; and then if he is still judge of this necessity, as certainly he is in the intervals of Parliament, it can never be suppo∣sed, that the first Prince, or his Successors, that first parted with these Privi∣ledges to the People, ever intended to be so straitly tied to them, as that in no case whatever, tho' never so pressing, they should not depart from them, much less that he should forfeit his Crown if he should wholly break them, nay should persist so to do, and resolve to turn this limited, into an absolute despotick Mo∣narchy; since the observation of these Laws, being but concessions of his own, or his Predecessors, can never be looked upon as conditions of his holding the Crown, nor of the Subjects Allegiance to it, there being as you your self confess no such clause exprest in either part, neither in the Kings Coronation Oath, nor yet in their Allegiance to him, as you your self cannot but acknowledge; and tho' it is true, the King swears at his Coronation, to keep and maintain the Laws; yet <HI>Grotius</HI> tells us, <HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 3. that an Empire does not cease to be Absolute, altho' he who is to rule, promise some things to God, or to his Sub∣jects, even such which may appertain to the manner of the Empire, and that not only concerning the observation of the natural or divine Law, but of cer∣tain Rules to which without a promise he were not obliged.
<Q>So that in all Pro∣mises of this kind the manner of the obligation is not reciprocal, or of the same sort on both sides; as for example, it is only moral in respect of the King, and it is lef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wholly to God to judge between the King and his Subjects, and to punish him when he breaks his part; but, to the King as God's Lieutenant on Earth, it belongs not only to judge of his Subjects breach of their Oath and Contract, but also to punish them for so doing, and compel them to the performance of it: and of this Judgment are all the Modern Civilians; as for <HI>Bodin</HI> I have given you his opinion in the chapter I last cited, concerning this matter: and he as well as <HI>Grotius</HI> is clearly of opinion, that Absolute Monarchs, such as he reckons the King of <HI>England</HI> to be, are not to be called in question or destroyed, let their breach of Laws and Tyranny be never so notorious, much less can they forfeit their Royal Dignity for such male-administration: and tho' <HI>Grotius</HI> is of opinion, that in cases of great and evident danger of Life, Subjects may have a right of resistance against absolute Princes, and those commissioned by them, what is this to the case in hand? <HI>viz.</HI> a resistance, against an Absolute Monarch for violation of those Priviledges, and Liberties, that were granted by himself, or his Ancestors, and without which Subjects may very well live, and subsist as we see
<PB N="715" REF="383"/>
they do, under the most Absolute, Despotick Monarchies, where they enjoy no such thing; tho' perhaps they do not live so well, and freely as we do;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> VII. <HI>cap.</HI> 8. §. 6.</NOTE>
nay <HI>Pufendorf,</HI> the Author you so much make use of, in his se∣venth Book, will not allow Subjects to take up Arms or resist Ab∣solute Princes, nor for too great cruelty in punishment, nor for imposing too immoderate Taxes, since the presumption of Justice, and ne∣cessity for the doing of these things is always on the Princes side; nay, if his Promises are not kept, or priviledges formerly granted are taken away, if the Prince be Absolute, and will pretend any fault, necessity, or remarkable benefit thereby to the common-wealth, he shall be deemed to have acted by a right, of which the faculty of judging is wholly wanting to the Subjects; since all Priviledges have this exception; unless the welfare, or necessity of the Common weal forbid them to be observed.</Q></P>

<P>Since your last Discourse consists of two parts; matter of Fact, and mat∣ter of right deducible from that fact, I shall speak to each of them in order: first as to the matter of Fact, it is a great mistake in you, and Dr. <HI>Brady</HI> to maintain that K. <HI>William</HI> I. was really a Conqueror, and by his Sword (without any other Title) obtain'd such an entire Victory over K. <HI>Harold,</HI> and the whole English Nation, as gave him an Hereditary Right for himself, and his Heirs to the Absolute Allegiance of the whole English Nation without any reserve, or conditions whatever; so that all our Ancient Liberties, and Priviledges, being thereby lost and forfeited, this Nation can claim nothing of that kind, but from the grants and concessions of that King or his Successors: every one of which Propositions contain so many notorious mistakes in matter of Fact; for in the first place, King <HI>William</HI> never claim'd the Crown by Conquest, but by the adoption, and Testament of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, and I desie you to shew me any Ancient Law or Charter, either of his own, or any of his im∣mediate descendants, wherein he is stiled Conqueror; 'tis true, in his Charter to the Abby of <HI>Westminster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Per Inspex.</HI> 1. <HI>E.</HI> IV. <HI>Part.</HI> 7. <HI>m.</HI> 26 <HI>vi. Selden</HI>'s <HI>Re∣view,</HI> p. 483.</NOTE> he says in one, that by the Edge of the Sword he obtain'd the Kingdom, by the Con∣quest of <HI>Harold,</HI> and his accomplices; yet does not found his Right in that Victory, alone, but on the donation of King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> his Cozen: the words are remarkable; in <HI>ore gladii adeptus sum Regnum Anglorum, devicto Haraldo Rege, cum suis com∣plicibus; qui mihi Regnum divinâ providentiâ destinatum &amp; beneficio concessionis Domi∣ni &amp; Cognati mei gloriosi Regis Edwardi concessum conati sunt auferre</HI> And this donation he calls an Hereditary Right in divers other Charters; as particularly in one also recorded by <HI>inspeximinus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Carta.</HI> 4. <HI>Ed.</HI> IV. <HI>m.</HI> 27. <HI>per Inspexi. Vi. Seldeni ad Eadmer: notae, &amp;c.</HI> Fol. 211.</NOTE> beginning thus, <HI>In nomine Patris &amp; Filii &amp; spiritus sancti. Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.

<P>And in vertue of this Donation; he was after his Victory against <HI>Harold,</HI> by publick and full consent of the whole Nation, or People of <HI>England,</HI> as also of
<PB N="716" REF="384"/>
the Normans he brought with him, Elected and Crowned King, and at his Coronation took the same Oath at the High-Altar at <HI>Westminster,</HI> which his Pre∣decessors the Saxon Kings, had taken before him; with this one Clause farther, which was very necessary to be done at that time, <HI>viz. quod aquo Iure Anglos, &amp; Francos, tracta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI>; so that let his Title by Conquest have been what it would, it was either by a just right of War, to recover his due, or by none at all; if the former, he could only succeed to such Rights as K. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor before exercised and enjoyed; since he came hither only to take the Crown that was so bequeathed to him, and to hold it under that Title; but if he had no Title at all, but his Sword, he then could obtain no just right to the Crown, of <HI>England,</HI> either for himself or his Successors; but if they will only insist up∣on their Title by the Sword without any preceeding or subsequent right, they may be as lawfully turned out again by the Sword; since it is own'd by all Writers on this Subject, that a Conqueror in an unjust War can obtain no right over a free People.</P>
<P>So much for the matter of Fact, I come in the next place to point of Right in Law; I grant indeed that a simple Oath, or Pact between an Absolute Mo∣narch and his Subjects, to do, or perform such or such a thing; or to let them enjoy such and such Priviledges, does not immediately give the People a Power to compel such a Monarch, and his Successors, by Force of Arms, to the strict observance of them, in case of a violation on his part; but our case is very different from this; for here a Foreign Prince recovers a former Right to the Kingdom, and that by Force; and is invested with the Crown in Vertue of that Right by which he claimed it, and is also sworn to maintain the Ancient Government and Laws; according to which the whole Legislative Power was not in the King alone, but jointly in the King, and the great Council of the Nation; without whose grant, or consent, he ought not to have laid any Taxe; upon the Nation, as I shall prove if there be occasion. Now all our Ancient Rights, being granted, and acknowledged by him, and a constant common Council of the Kingdom appointed to meet, to see them observed, as it did many times in this King's Reign, as also in those of his Successors; they were not bare Priviledges conferred of favour, and which might be observed, or broken at the Will of the Prince that granted them; but a Form or Rule of Govern∣ment by Laws to be made and agreed upon in a standing Council, appointed not only to make them, but also to see them observed; as appears by that pas∣sage so often cited, wherein the King is expresly said to have a Superiour, <HI>viz.</HI> the Law, and the Court of Barons, who were to put a Bridle upon the King; in case of his governing without Law: and this farther appears by the great Charters of <HI>Henry</HI> I. K. <HI>Stephen,</HI> and K. <HI>Iohn, &amp;c.</HI> In the first of which it is declar'd, that the Nation having been oppressed by unjust (<HI>i. e.</HI> illegal) exacti∣ons he therefore forbids all Common Money, or Taxes; not taken through all Cities or Counties, in the time of K. <HI>Edward</HI>; and also confirms the Laws of his Father, whereby his Barons, and Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> should be free from all Taillage or Taxes; and he also thereby restored to them the Laws of K. <HI>Ed∣ward,</HI> with those emendations which his Father had made by the Common Council of his Barons. Now the great Charter of K. <HI>Iohn</HI> was but an Addition,
<PB N="717" REF="384"/>
or rather Explanation of this Charter of K. <HI>Henry</HI> I. which was at first demanded by the Barons to be again confirmed by this King, at the instigation of <HI>Stephen Langton</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 240, 241▪</NOTE> as <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> shews us at large.</P>
<P>Now since neither K. <HI>William</HI> the I. nor his Successors, ever changed the fun∣damental constitution of the Government, as to the Legislative part of it, as (hath been already proved) and that those breaches that had been made upon it, by taking Taillage or Taxes, without the consent of the great Council, are all hereby expresly forbid: these are certainly more than such meer Priviledges, which the King himself is the only keeper of, and can dispense with at his Pleasure; but are indeed such Fundamentals, as concern the very cos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uent form or Rule of Govern∣ment; which, as I have also proved, was mixt not limited, in that very institution; and tho' the learned <HI>Pufendo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f</HI> agree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with you in the case of compacts between an Absolute Monarch and his Subjects; yet as to the point in hand, he is wholly of my mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 272.</NOTE> as you may see by this passage in his Academick Dissertations, in his Discourse <HI>de Interreguis</HI>; where arguing against Mr. <HI>Hobs</HI> who will not allow of any compacts between an Absolute Prince and his Subjects, he has this passage, which I shall here read to you in English.
<Q>That tho' in Pacts, in which submission is wanting, certain and defined performances may be set forth, to be observed on either side, from an intrinsick impulse of Conscience; when either of these refuse to perform them, nothing but War or the compulsion of a Superior Lord, common to both of them, remains;</Q>
yet in pacts, by which one Party is made subject to the other, it belongs to the latter to define, what ought to be performed by him; as also a power over the other compelling him, to the performance whether he will, or not; which power does not belong reciprocally to the other party against the former; hence the party commanding cannot be questioned for a breach of compact, unless he either wil∣fully abdica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e all care of the common wealth, or put on an hostile mind towards his Subjects; or manifestly, or deceitfully, (<HI>in latin, dolo malo</HI>) depart from the rule of governing; on whose observance as upon a condition, the subjects Allegi∣ance depends▪ which is easily to be avoided by any Ruler; if he will consider, that not the highest of Mortals are free from the Laws of humane chance: so that let the power of your Conqueror have bene never so great, or Absolute, it is plain he not only renounced it himself, but several of his Successors have done the same for themselves, and their heirs; therefore make the most of it, they must still claim by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the contract, to maintain the constitution, as they found it; or else resolve all their right into meer force; and then <HI>vim vi pellere licitum est.</HI></P>

<P>It is no wonder that you and I differ in our conclusions, since we also differ so much in the premises; and in the very matter of fact, concerning King <HI>William</HI> the Conquerors coming to the Crown; you saying, he came to it partly by the Sword, but founded on a donation of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor; and partly by the consent and election of the People of <HI>England,</HI> yet you your self cannot deny, but force or conquest had a great share in the business, and indeed was all the right he had; for as for that donation of K. <HI>Edward,</HI> it is either forged, or else K. <HI>Willi∣am</HI> could claim nothing by it; since <HI>England</HI> was then either an Hereditary Kingdom, or elective; and take it which way you will, this donation of the Confessors cou'd
<PB N="718" REF="385"/>
signifie nothing, either to the prejudice of the People that were to Elect, or the next Heirs who were to succeed after K. <HI>Edward</HI>'s decease; neither could he claim as Heir to him by blood, for the relation between him and K. <HI>Edward,</HI> was by his Mother <HI>Emma,</HI> Sister to <HI>Richard</HI> the second Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> this <HI>William</HI>'s Uncle; so that the Conqueror was no way descended from the Blood Royal of <HI>England</HI>; Therefore his true quarrel with <HI>Harold,</HI> (Let his pretence be what it will) was not, because he kept a Kingdom bequeathed to him, by K. <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>; since some Writers relate this King named not him, but <HI>Ha∣rold</HI> for his Successor;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Hoveden pars prima,</HI> p. 449. <HI>Will. Malms▪ Lib</HI> 2.</NOTE> tho' others say, that he recommended <HI>Edgar</HI> to the good will of the English Nobility. So that the only true and just cause D. <HI>William</HI> had of making War upon <HI>Harold,</HI> was his breaking the Promises and Oath he had not long before made him of securing the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> for him, upon the Death of K. <HI>Edward</HI>; instead of doing which, he had seized it for himself; and which is worse, refused to restore it, or so much as to hold it of Duke <HI>William</HI> as his Ho∣mager. So that tho' for the strengthning of his own Tide, he pretended to the Will or Donation of King <HI>Edward,</HI> and to avoid the envy of the name, might out of modesty or to put a better colour upon this matter, refuse to take the Title of Conqueror; and to insist upon the Donation of K. <HI>Edward:</HI> yet nothing is plainer than that he could claim by no other Title, but the Sword: and that he looked upon himself as no other than an Absolute Conqueror, may appear by these great and evident instances. 1. His change of the English Laws, and introducing the Norman Customs in their stead, and also changing the Tenures of Lands, not only of the Layety, but also of the Bishops and greater Abbeys. 2. By his de∣barring all those of the English Nation, from enjoying any Honour, Office or Pre∣ferment, either in Church or State; and also in taking away the Estates of all the Nobility and Gentry; not only from those of their Heirs, that had been slain in the Battle of <HI>Hastings,</HI> but also of the rest; so that they had left them, but what they could purchase of those Norman or French Noblemen, to whom King <HI>Wiiliam</HI> had given their Lands, as a reward of their good service; for the proof of both which Assertions, I have so very good authority on my side, and that of Writers of, or near those times in which these things were done, that I think no indifferent man can have any cause to doubt the matter of Fact to have been as I relate it; nor did he by any after act, ever renounce this right of Conquest, as you suppose, much less refer it to the Election of the English, or Normans; since the former were not in a condition to make any farther resistance against him, the Clergy and great men of the Kingdom having been forced to submit them∣selves to him without any other precedent conditions, or stipulations, than for the saving of their lives; and as for the Normans they were his Subjects, and they Conquered the Kingdom only for his use and benefit, as his Souldiers, and Vassal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and it is not likely he would owe the Kingdom which he had thus acquired by the Sword, to their Votes, or Election; neither does any Author that I know of mention any Election before his Coronation; when tho' it is true, he took such an Oath as you mention, yet it was in too general terms to bind him to any obser∣vation of the ancient English Laws, much less to preserve their Rights and Pri∣viledges, farther than he thought fit; and therefore could never take the Crown upon your Conditions of Resistance or Forfeiture, in case of any alteration in that which you call the Fundamental Constitution.</P>
<P><PB N="719" REF="385"/>This being the true matter of Fact without any disguise, it is easie to answer all that you have said against K. <HI>William</HI>'s requiring an Absolute, Hereditary Right to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> for himself, and all his descendants by the Sword; first then, as to the Justice of the War, and Conquest it self, I suppose you will not deny, but that Duke <HI>William</HI> had a good cause of War against <HI>Harold</HI> for the breach of his Oath; and if so, against all that took his part, at the Battle of <HI>Hastings</HI>; so that upon the Conquest of <HI>Harold,</HI> and those that were in that Fight, he also acquired a Right by Conquest to all that they enjoyed; and consequently had a right to <HI>Harold</HI>'s Crown, as well as his other Estate; as also to the Estates of all those that were either slain, or escaped alive from that Battle, and not only to these, but also to all the Lands of the whole Kingdom; since the War was made not only against <HI>Harolds</HI> Person, but against the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI>; the People of which, according to their Allegiance assisted him in that War, either with Men or Money:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.

Oath, did by force set the Crown upon his own Head, without any precedent Election of the Clergy, Nobility, and People, as was required at that time; since it was impossible for them to meet in so short a time; for King <HI>Edward</HI> dying on the Eve of <HI>Epiphany,</HI> was buried on <HI>Twelfth day,</HI> and on the same day <HI>Harold</HI> took upon himself the Crown, by the consent of some of the Bishops and Nobility of his Faction, then at <HI>London</HI>; so that he was certainly no better than an Usurper: and therefore by the Conquest of <HI>Harold</HI> and his party, your Conqueror could acquire no right upon the free People of <HI>England,</HI> since they never gave their consents to place <HI>Harold</HI> on the Throne; and conse∣quently K. <HI>William</HI> could have no just cause of making a conquest upon the whole Nation, since neither did he ever in all his Reign (as I can find) call a common Council of the Kingdom to recognize, or confirm his Title; and tho' it is true, <HI>Harold</HI> proving a Valiant and Popular Prince, got the good will of the common People, by divers Acts of Grace, (which he had lost by his violent taking the Crown while <HI>Edgar Atheling</HI> the only remaining Male Heir of the Saxon Race was in being;) and found very many who were willing to fight for him, not only against the King of <HI>Norway,</HI> who had a little before Invaded the Kingdom, but also against Duke <HI>William</HI>; yet all those in his Army could amount to nothing near the whole Kingdom, who never contributed to the War by any publick Vote, or Tax; and therefore did not countenance it by giving Money, or raising of Men as you suppose; so that D. <HI>William</HI> could not pretend a right of making War against any body, but only <HI>Harold</HI> and his Accomplices; but as for the Testamen∣tary Donation of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, tho' you make so light of it, yet <HI>Ingulph</HI> says expresly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 68. <HI>Edit. Oxon.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor some time before his Death, sent <HI>Robert</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> as his Am∣bassador to D. <HI>William</HI> to let him know
<Q>That he had designed him his Successor, not only by Right of Kindred, but by the merit of his Vertue;</Q>
and that after this <HI>Harold,</HI> coming into <HI>Normandy,</HI> promised upon Oath to assist him in it; and <HI>Will. Malmesbury</HI> says also, that <HI>Edward</HI> the Father of <HI>Edgar Atheling,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 93.</NOTE> dying almost as soon as he came into <HI>England,</HI> K. <HI>Edward</HI> his Cozen being dead, gave the Succession of this Kingdom to <HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy</HI>; with whom also agree, <HI>Florence</HI> of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Poi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tou,</HI> and all the rest of the Historians of that Age, as well English as Normans: nor do I know any of them except <HI>Simeon</HI> of <HI>Durham,</HI> and <HI>Roger Hoveden,</HI> who make <HI>Harold</HI> to have been appointed Successor by K. <HI>Edward,</HI> or to have been so much as solemnly Crowned by the Archbishop of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>But I confess your main objection is still to be answered, <HI>viz.</HI> what precedent Right Duke <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lliam</HI> could have to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> by this Testament of King <HI>Edward</HI>; since it was then either an Elective, or else an Hereditary Kingdom; and so this Donation could confer no right on this <HI>Duke</HI> in <HI>Prejudice</HI> of the Peoples right to Elect; or else of the next Heir to succeed? In answer to which I must tell you that which perhaps you may have never considered, that the Crown was then neither properly Elective nor Successive, but a mixture of both.</P>

<P>Why then I will tell you, the Crown of <HI>England</HI> in those times, was very like what the <HI>Crowns</HI> of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> were not long since, and as the Em∣pire
<PB N="721" REF="386"/>
is at this day; in which tho' the Estates or Diet might chuse whom they pleased for King or Emperor, yet they still kept to the same Family or Line, as long as there were any Males left of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, fit to succeed; which custom often gave the King in Being a power, which by degrees came to be looked upon as a kind of Right, either upon his Death Bed, or else at any time before, to nominate one of his Sons, or near Kinsmen to be his Successors, by his last Will or Testament: especially if he had no Sons of his own, as happen'd in the case of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor; now this nomination, tho' it did not alone confer a right to the Crown, yet it made the person so named the fairest candidate for it; and was such a recommendation to the Estate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or great Council of the Kingdom, as they never passed, by or denied, as I can ever find by the best inquiry I have made; and for proof of this, I shall appeal to the Testament of K. <HI>Alfred,</HI> as you will find it Printed from an Ancient Manuscript, in the second Appendix to his Life, in Latine, publisht at <HI>Oxford.</HI> Which begins thus.
<Q>Ego Alfredus Divino munere, labore, ac Studio Athelredi Archiepiscopi, nec non totius Westsaxoniae Nobilitatis consensu, pariter &amp; assensu, occidentalium Saxonum Rex; quos in Testimonium meae ultimae volunta∣tis complementi, ut sint advocati in disponendis pro salute animae meae regali electione, confir∣mo, tam de haereditate, quam Deus at Principes, cum senioribus Populi misericorditer ac benigne dederunt; quam de haereditate quam Pater meus Aethelwulfus Rex nobis tribus fra∣tribus delegavit, viz. Aethelbaldo, Aethelredo, &amp; mihi; ita, quod qui nostrum diutius foret superstes, ille totius Regni dominio congauderet, &amp;c.</Q>
From whence you may col∣lect first, that tho' this King in the very beginning of his Testament ascribes his obtaining the Crown, not to any Hereditary Right, but the consent, and assent of the Nobility of <HI>West-Saxony</HI>; yet he also here mentions the entail of the Crown by his Fathers Will, upon his two Elder Brothers, and himself successively, be∣fore any of his Elder Brother's Sons, who were living at the time of the making of this Testament of K. <HI>Alfred</HI>'s, as appears by the Will it self, in which they are expresly mentioned: now how could this be that he was King, as well by the consent or election of the <HI>West-Saxon</HI> Nobility, as by his Father's Will, un∣less both these had been required to make him so? Also <HI>Will.</HI> of <HI>Malme∣sbury</HI> tells us of K. <HI>Athelstan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> II <HI>cap.</HI> 6.</NOTE> the Grandson of K. <HI>Alfred,</HI> that, <HI>Iussu Patris in Testamento, Aethelstanus in Regem est acclamatus:</HI> but in the be∣ginning of this chapter, he also tells us, that <HI>Aethelstanus electus apud Regiam aulam quae vocatur Kingston Coronatus est, quamvis quidem Alfredus cum factiosis suis obviare ten∣tasset</HI>; upon that pretence that <HI>Athelstan</HI> was a <HI>Bastard:</HI> so that you may see, that his Fathers Testament was not sufficient without the election of the <HI>Wittema Gemot</HI>; who preferred him, tho' perhaps Illegitimate, before this <HI>Alfred</HI> who was set up against him. And I doubt not, if more of the Testaments of the English Saxon Kings were now extant, that I could give you more instances of this Nature. But that the person so nominated, and elected, tho' not the nearest always of blood, claimed <HI>jure haereditario,</HI> is also as certain, since <HI>Bracton</HI> expresly tells us,
<Q>That <HI>haereditamentum,</HI> or inheritance is not derived <HI>ab Haerede,</HI> but heir from the Inheri∣tance; and that inheritance is the Succession to all the right which the Prede∣cessor had; with whom also the Civil Law agrees, <HI>Haeredis significatione omnes sig∣nificare successores credendum est, etsi verbis non sint expressi.</HI></Q>
Nor did this custom of thus recommending a Successor prevail in <HI>England</HI> alone in those times, but also was in use among the French Kings of the Race of <HI>Charlemain,</HI> wherein the last
<PB N="722" REF="387"/>
will or Adoption of the King, in being confirmed by the Election or Recognition of the Estates of <HI>France,</HI> gave a sufficient Title to a Prince of the Blood Royal, tho' not Legitimate, nor the next heir by blood, to succeed; but the Will of the Prince was not alone sufficient; as Monsiour <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> has very well observed in his Chronological Abridgement of the History of <HI>France,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Clotair</HI> the second.</P>
<P>So that to conclude; if Duke <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Normandy</HI> was thus adopted; named by K. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor for his Successor, by his last Will and Testament; and this had been without any blows confirmed by the Council of the Kingdom, by a subsequent Election, and Coronation, and that he had received the Oaths and Recognitions of the English Subjects, which always followed that solemnity, I doubt not but he would have had as good a Title to the Crown, as any of the Kings of the English Saxon Line; I am sure a much better than <HI>Harold,</HI> who I am not satisfied came in either by the adoption of K, <HI>Edward,</HI> or by the Election of the People, and therefore Duke <HI>William</HI> had a good Title against him as an Usurper; and Conquering him, and those of his party in the Battle, and being thereupon Elected, and Recognized, and Crowned by the general consent both of the English, and Normans; I cannot see why his obtaining the Crown against <HI>Harold</HI> by force of Arms, should extinguish his former right, and create a new Title by Conquest, which he never claimed by; or suppose his renouncing the Confessors Will, which gave him a right to be Elected King, according to the custom of those times; and to demand the Crown from an Usurper, who had so∣lemnly sworn to assist him in this Right. But since you so positively affirm, that no Author whatever mentions D. <HI>William</HI>'s Election; I doubt not but to shew it you from more than one Author, and those of, or near those very times.</P>
<P>I shall in the first place give the account that a short History, Printed at the end of Mr. <HI>Taylor</HI>'s History of <HI>Gavel-kind,</HI> from an Ancient Msc. in the <HI>Bodlia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Library, gives us of this affair, and who seems to be an Author that lived very near those times. <HI>Londoniam Convenientibus Francis, &amp; Anglis (ad nativitatem Do∣mini) illisque omnibus concedentibus, coronam totius Angliae, &amp; Dominationem suscepit:</HI> and <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Poictou,</HI> this Kings Chaplain in his History relates it thus; <HI>Die ordina∣tioni decreto locutus ad Anglos condecenti sermone Eboraci Archiepiscopus sapiens, bonus, elo∣quens, an consentirent eum sibi Dominum Coronari inquisivit; protestati sunt hilarem con∣sensum universi minime haesitantes, ac si caelitus unâ mente datâ, unâqu; voci; Anglorum quam facillime Normanni consonuerunt sermocinato apud eos, ac sententiam praecunctatoriam Constantini Praesule, sic electum consecravit Archiepiscopus, imposuit ei diadema, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>So likewise <HI>Ordoricus Vitalis,</HI> a Norman Author, alive at the same time relates it thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> III. pa. 503.</NOTE> <HI>Die natalis Domini Angli Londoniae ad ordinandum Regem convenerunt, &amp; G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lielmum Ducem Normannorum in Regem Anglo∣rum consecravit Archiepiscopus, &amp;c.</HI> and goes on to relate the manner how, just as the nameless English Authour had done before; but then agrees with <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Poictou</HI> in all the rest. <HI>Dum Aldredus Praesul Alloqueretur Anglos, &amp; Go∣dofredus Constantiniensis Normannos, an concederent Gulielmum Regnare super se, &amp; Vni∣versi consensum hilarem protestarentur unâ voce non unius Linguae locutione</HI>; with whom also agrees <HI>Willielmus Gemmenicensis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 288.</NOTE> in the History of the Dukes of <HI>Normandy,</HI> who was also an Authour that lived in, or very near the times of this King: his words are; <HI>Anno incarnat.

<P>So that you see here are no less than four Ancient Authors, who all agree upon the solemn Election of King <HI>William</HI>; and yet your Dr. has the confidence to tell us, that Mr. <HI>Petye</HI> only endeavours to prove this El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction of King <HI>William</HI> out of some fragments of Authors, who lived at some distance of time from his coming over hither.</P>

<P>I confess you have shew'd me more for this mixt slight of K <HI>William</HI>'s by Testament, and Succession; than ever I knew before; But you had dealt more fairly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. A.</HI> p 206.</NOTE> if you had also added what Dr. <HI>B.</HI> takes no∣tice of our of <HI>Guli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> Pictaviensis</HI> concerning King <HI>William</HI>'s being advanced to the Crown; for immediately after the mention of him being Crowned, he conludes thus, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Liberi &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>poles justa <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Anglle terrae, quam haereditaria delegatione Sacramentes Anglorum firmata, &amp;</HI> Jure Belli <HI>ipse possedit.</HI> So that here you see he grounds a Title to Him, and his postae∣rity, not only on his Hereditary, but the Oaths of the English, and the Right of War; but as for the word <HI>Electus</HI> made use of by those Ancient Authors, <HI>Dei B.</HI> hath made it very plain in his History of the Succession of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> as also in his Glossary, that this word does not there signifie Elected, but Recog∣nized, and Acknowledged, that such a one is to be King. Yet I very much doubt whether this could be properly termed an Election or not, since the same Histo∣rians also tell us, that part of K. <HI>William</HI>'s Army kept Guard without the Church door, during his Coronation, by this good token, that when they heard so great a shout given upon the Peoples declaring their Assents: the Souldiers suspecting some Treason, set Fire to the Houses; so that I cannot see how that could be properly an Election, when the People durst not refuse: and I know that even at this day, the King is shewn to the People on all the four sides of the Scaffold on which he is Crowned, and their consent is formally asked, whether they will have this Man to be their King; yet no man will say that their Acclamations and crying, yea, yea, will make our Kings Elective, any more than it could do it in the Case of K. <HI>William,</HI> who had a Title by Conquest precedent to this pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tended Election; tho' I grant this custom may have been in use ever fined this Coronation of the Conqueror.</P>
<P>But that King <HI>William</HI> claimed indeed by Conquest, and by no other Title, let us not mind his specious colourable pretences, but his actions, which are the best Interpreters of the Thoughts of Princes; and we shall find that thorough all his Reign, he Governed this Kingdom as a Conqueror; and this I shall prove by making good the three Instances I have already given, of his great alterations of the Property, Laws, and Civil Liberties of the People of this Nation: to begin with the first of these.</P>
<P>For the proof of which, I shall make use of the Authority of <HI>Gervace</HI> of <HI>Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bury,</HI> a considerable Officer in the Exchequer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.</HI> p. 33.</NOTE> in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, and who received his information from <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and Grand-child to the Conq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣ror, who is most full to that purpose, which he thus delivers in the Manuscript Treatise, called the black book of the Exchequer; which I shall read to you ac∣cording to the Learned Dr. <HI>B</HI>'s Translation of it.
<Q>After the Conquest of the
<PB N="724" REF="388"/>
Kingdom, and the just subversion of the Rebels, when the King himself, and his great men, had viewed and surveyed their new acquests▪ there was a strict en∣quiry made who they were, which had fought against the King, and secured themselves by Flight;</Q>
from these and the Heirs of such as were slain in the Field, all hopes of possessing either Lands or Rents were cut off, for they counted it a great favour to have their Lives given them; But such as were called and sol∣licited to fight against King <HI>William,</HI> and did not, if by an humble submission they could gain the Favour of their Lords and Masters, they then had the liberty of possessing somewhat in their own persons, but without any right of leaving it to their Posterity, their Children enjoying it only at the Will of their Lords; to whom when they became unacceptable, they were every way outed of their Estates, neither would any restore what they had taken away.</P>
<P>And when the miserable Natives represented their Grievances publickly to the King, informing him how they were spoiled of their Fortunes, and that without redress, they must be forced to pass into other Countries. At length upon con∣sultation, it was ordered, that what they could obtain of their Lords by way of Desert or Lawful Bargain, they should hold by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unqestionable Right; but should not claim any thing from the time the Nation was Conquered, under the Title of Succession or Descent; upon what great consideration this was done, is manifest (says <HI>Gervac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>;) for they being obliged to compliance and obedience, to purchase their Lords <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour, therefore whoever of the Conquered Nation Possessed Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> obtained them not as if they were their Right by Succession or Inheritance, but as a reward of their service, or by some intervening agreement.</P>
<P>This alone were sufficient, coming from an Author of such Credit, and living so very near the time: but besides his, I shall give you the Authority of divers other Authors to the same purpose, and particularly <HI>Ordericus Vitalis</HI> (whom you but now cited) tells us how <HI>William</HI> the first circumvented the two great Earls of <HI>More<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI>; and that after <HI>Edwin</HI> was slain▪ and <HI>Morcar</HI> imprisoned, then King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> began to shew himself, and gave his Assistants the best, and most considerable Counties in <HI>England</HI> and made Rich Collonels and Captains of very mean <HI>Normans</HI>: and that he thus disposed of whole Counties to divers great men, appears by Domesday Book, wherein it is seen that the whole County of <HI>Chester</HI> was given by the Conqueror to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upus</HI> a Norman; so likewise the greatest part of <HI>Shropshire</HI> was given to <HI>Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gomery.</HI></P>
<P>And further he took away from the English their Estates, and gave them to his <HI>Normans</HI>; and this he did from his first coming in; for <HI>Fitz-Osbern</HI> was made Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> and <HI>Hereford,</HI> at his first coming in, and was Lord of <HI>Bettivil</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and established the Laws of that Town at <HI>Hereford; Alan</HI> Earl of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣tain,</HI> had all Earl <HI>Edwin</HI>'s Lands given to him at the Seige of <HI>York,</HI> about three years after his arrival; to these I may add the 795 Mannors <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ton</HI> in <HI>Normandy</HI> and <HI>Cornwal</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> had given to him by K. <HI>William</HI>; so like∣wise <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lan</HI> Earl of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Richmond</HI> 442 Mannors, and <HI>Ieffery</HI> Bishop of <HI>Con∣stance</HI> had 280 Mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs given him by the Conqueror, besides many other Lands of the <HI>Saxon,</HI> Earls, <HI>Thains, &amp;c.</HI> were all given to the <HI>Normans,</HI> who took their Title from King <HI>William</HI>'s Conquering Sword.</P>
<P>So that I think it is very evident that this King had distributed most of the Lands of the Nation to his <HI>Norman</HI>'s, long before the survey was begun, and by
<PB N="725" REF="388"/>
that infallible Record it is clear, that he gave near all the Lands of the Nation to his followers, and very little or none to the English, who held that they had hys new Title, and new services from the Conqueror or his great Lords, or became Tenants to, or Drudges upon their own Lands, as we heard before from <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Fleta.</HI> Here is enough to satisfie any unbyassed person, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Conqueror did not lay by his Sword after the Battle of <HI>Hastings.</HI></P>

<P>In answer to what you have now said, concerning your Conquerors taking away the Lands of a great many of the English Nobility and Gentry, it is so ap∣parent in matter of Fact, that it were a high piece of impudence to go about to deny it; yet will it not therefore follow, that what he thus disposed of were almost all the Lands of <HI>England,</HI> as I shall shew, you by and by; but in the mean time to let you see that I am a fair adversary, I will at present suppose, that K. <HI>William</HI> took away all the Lands from the former owners, and gave them to his followers, who helpt him in his Conquest; but these were not only the Normans his Subjects, but French, Flemmings, Anjovins, Britains, Poictovins, and People of other Natio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, who made up a great part of his Army, and came in with him under great and considerable men their Leaders, and whom your Dr. tells us came not out of sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k love and kindness,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.</HI> p. 35.</NOTE> without any considera∣tion of sharing with, and under him in the Conquest. Now I de∣sire to know by what Law or Act of theirs, they thus constituted K. <HI>William</HI> an Absolute Monarch, over them and their Descendants. For as for the Normans tho' they were (it's true) his subjects; yet they enjoyed divers conside∣rable Rights and Priviledges at home, and surely never intended to come over hither, to make themselves as great Slaves as the People, they had Conquered; much less can it be supposed of these of other Nations, who were not subjects to Duke <HI>William</HI> before he was made King; nor can I see how their taking of Lands from Him could make him become an Absolute and Irresistible Monarch over them, and their Descendants; so that if upon your supposition, all the owners of Lands in <HI>England,</HI> at this day, hold their Estates either by descent or purchase from those Antient Normans, or French Proprietors they must also succeed to the same Liberties and Priviledges, as those under whom they claim, did former∣ly enjoy. But before I conclude, I cannot but take notice of what you have said, against my proofs of the formal election of King <HI>William,</HI> for if the keeping of a guard about the place where the King is Elected and Crowned, should void the freedom of the Election; I doubt whether the election of any elective Kings, or Monarchs, no not of the German Emperor himself would hold goods as for the other reason, that they could not chuse but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lect him that is yet m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re trivial, for there being no more than one tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stood to be chosen, they could indeed chuse no other; but if not having a Liberty to refuse, must void the Right of Election, pray consider (as I told you before▪) whether there be any Canonical Election of Bishops in the Church of <HI>England</HI> at this day: therefore I doubt not but that King <HI>William</HI> I. was as lawfully and freely elected as K. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, his Predecessor, whom all Authors agree to have had no other Title; and <HI>Willi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmus Gemeticensis</HI> in the place I now cited, tells us, he was Elected King as well of the Norman, as English Nobles: and if the custom had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cen to El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the King before he was Crowned; it is not likely tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Conqueror would have in∣troduced a new custom to the prejudice of his pretended right by Conquest; but
<PB N="726" REF="389"/>
indeed there is not only more cogent argument to prove that the Crown was for∣merly elective, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he constant usage (as you your self confess) ever since your pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended Conquest to this day▪ of asking the People whether they are content to have such a one for their King▪ As for your Doctors quotation out of <HI>William</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oicto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> pray take notice that he places your Conquerors▪ Hereditary bequest together with the Oaths of the English as his best Title, and the right of War last, by which this Author did not understand a Conquest of the People of <HI>England,</HI> but his prevailing against <HI>Harold</HI>▪</P>

<P>I must beg your pardon if I cannot take what you have now said, for a sa∣tisfactory answer, since I doubt it will do you little service, whether you make use of it either in respect of the Normans, or other Foreigners; for as to the so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, it appears from the Antient Constitution of <HI>Normandy,</HI> that the Duke was no absolute Monarch there; but Feuda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary to the King of <HI>France</HI>; and farther could make no Laws, nor impose Taxes in <HI>Normandy,</HI> without the consent of the Estates of that Dutchy, as appears by the Title to the Latin Customs of <HI>Normandy,</HI> which are at the End of the Old French Edition of the <HI>Constumiers de Normandy</HI>; Printed at <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> 1515. The Title of which is thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Iura &amp; Consuetudines Ducatus No<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ma∣niae.</HI> The Prologue to which, begins thus. <HI>Quoniam Leges, &amp; Instituta quae Nor∣manorum Principes, non sint magna provisionis Industria Praelatorum, Comitum, &amp; Ba∣ronum, nec non &amp; Caeterorum virorum prudentum consilio, &amp; Assensu ad salutem humani foederis Statuerunt.</HI> Whereby it is apparent, that the Antient Laws of <HI>Normandy</HI> were made by the Advice and Consent of the Estates, for the Preservation of that humane Covenant they had formerly made with their first Duke, <HI>Rollo,</HI> when he had that Dutchy granted him by the King of <HI>France</HI>; and whoever will consult the antient Histories and Laws of that Dutchy will find the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Dukes of <HI>Normandy</HI> no more absolute Monarchs there, than the Kings of <HI>Norway,</HI> from whence they came; so that if their Duke should have gone about to take away their Estates, or inslave the Persons of the Norman Nobility, and People, he might justly have been resisted by them; and therefore their taking Lands from K. <HI>William</HI> after his pretended Conquest here, must either have conferred an Estate upon them according to the Laws of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Normandy</HI>; not according to the former; for you assert that Tenures in <HI>Capite,</HI> and Knight's service, were generally introduced by his coming; so that if they were by the Normans Law, (as you suppose) they were then no farther subjects to their Duke, by that Te∣nure, when made King of <HI>England,</HI> than they were whilst he was Duke of <HI>Norman∣dy, viz.</HI> only according to the Laws and Customs by which they held these E∣states: so that if their Duke was not irresistible by them in case of Tyranny in his own Country, so he was also here by the same reason; since whatever he did in respect of the English, he could acquire no new right over them.</P>
<P>And that an Oath of Homage alone, doth not make the Person to whom it is taken irresistible, if he makes an unjust War upon his Vassals, appears by the Dukes of <HI>Normandy</HI> themselves, who tho' they held that Dutchy by Homage to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and took the same Oath to him, upon every Kings Accession to the Crown, of being his Liegeman; and to be True and Faithful to his Lord the King of <HI>France,</HI> for the said Dutchy of <HI>Normandy</HI>: yet might the Dukes of <HI>Normandy</HI>
<PB N="728" REF="390"/>
without any Imputation of Rebellion have resisted the King of <HI>France,</HI> in case he made an unjust War upon them: nor were ever the Dukes of <HI>Normandy</HI> accused of Rebellion for so doing, in all the Wars that they had with the Kings of <HI>France</HI>; And therefore the holding of an Estate by Homage, doth not suppose that the Lord of whom it is held was irresistible, nor doth the word of Allegiance sig∣nifie any more than that duty which the Liegemen, by the Old Norman Law, owed to their Supream Lord of whom they held their Lands; and therefore when the King or Supream Lord of the Fee did not perform his part of the Contract, but went about to turn them out of their Estates, or to invade any of their just rights by force, it was usual for the Tenants to defie the Lords, and renounce their Homage to them;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Spelman</HI>'s Glossary <HI>verbo diffi∣dare.</HI> P. 388.</NOTE> for which they used the Bar∣barous Latin word <HI>diffidare,</HI> in French to defie, that is, to renounce that Faith and Allegiance, which before they owed them; and the supream Lords also oftentimes defied their Tenants, thus <HI>Mat. Pa∣ris</HI> tells in <HI>Anno</HI> 1233. that K. <HI>Henry</HI> the Third by the Counsel of the Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> defied <HI>Richard</HI> the Earl <HI>Mareschal</HI>: and the year following we find the Earl justifying himself in this man∣ner,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> P. 398.</NOTE> (being then in <HI>Ireland</HI>;) First I answer, that I never acted Trea∣sonably against the King; for he has unjustly spoil'd me of my Office of Mares∣chal, without the Judgment of my Peers, and has Proclaim'd me banisht tho∣rough all <HI>England,</HI> he has burnt my Houses, destroyed my Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he has more than once defied me, when I was always ready to stand to the Judgment of my Peers: from which time (said he) I ceased to be the Kings Liegeman, and was absolved from his Homage not by my self, but by him: and whereas you say, that tho' the King or Supream Lord cannot forfeit his Right, tho' he breaks his part of the Compact, because of the inequality, which there is between a King, and a Subject; then this Prerogative of Non-resistance doth not belong to the King, as he is Supream Lord of the Land, but as he is King, and giveth Law to the Sub∣jects; which may have some colour of Truth in Absolute Monarchies, but was of no Force, either in the Government of <HI>Normandy</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> where the Duke or King without the consent of his Estates, never could alone make Laws; but as I will not deny our Government to be a Monarchy, so it is as certain, that it is limited in the very constitution, either by the Saxons or Normans, begin where you please; and therefore my conclusion still holds good, that if the Eng∣lish have now succeeded to those very Lands and Priviledges, which the Normans anciently enjoyed, then whatsoever Right or Liberty the English Proprietors of Estates do at this day enjoy, they do not only hold them as the Successors and Descendants of those Normans and Frenchmen but are also restored to them <HI>Iure postliminii</HI> (as you Civilians Term it) since they never submitted themselves, or took an Oath of Allegiance to King <HI>William,</HI> and his heirs, but only to himself Per∣sonally, there being no such clause in any Oath of Allegiance, till it was so ordained many ages after in the Reign of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth; nor was this Oath ever taken by our English Ancestors to K. <HI>William</HI> as to a Conqueror, but the lawful Successor of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor; and K. <HI>Williams</HI> actual taking away the Estates of a great ma∣ny of the English Nobility and Gentry, contrary to his own Oath, and without any just o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use, could no more give him a right so to do, than if <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, or <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the seventh, both which came to the Crown by the assistance of a Foreign force,
<PB N="729" REF="390"/>
should upon a pretence of being Conquerors have govern'd by an Army, and so have taken away whose Estate they pleased, and given them to their followers that came over with them.</P>

<P>I shall not dispute this matter with you any further, therefore pray pro∣ceed to the other Point you took upon you to prove, that King <HI>William</HI> did not take away so great a share of the Lands of <HI>England,</HI> as the Dr. and those of our Opi∣nion affirm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall observe your commands, and therefore in the first place I desire you to take notice, that according to the Doctors own shewing your Con∣queror never took away the Lands of all the Bishops and Abbots of <HI>England,</HI> much less those that belonged to Deans, and Chapters, or to private Churches, and if his Nobles or Followers had unjustly dissie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed any Bishop or Abbot of their Estates, the King caused them to be restored again, as appears by many Presidents of this kind, which are to be found in <HI>Ingulphus</HI> and <HI>Eadmerus:</HI> this being premi∣sed, let us see in the next place what proportion the Lands belonging to the Church did in those days bear to the rest of the Lands in <HI>England</HI>; now we find in <HI>Sprot</HI>'s Chronicle, as also from the old Legierbook, cited by Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his Titles of Honour, and particularly from that <HI>Secretum Abbotis</HI> (formerly belonging to the Abby of <HI>Glassenbury,</HI> and now in the Library of the University of <HI>Oxon</HI>) that there were not long after your Conquest, 60215 Knights fees in <HI>England,</HI> of which the Bishops Abbots and other Church-men then enjoyed 28015. When it is supposed this account was taken, then it will follow that in the Reign of your Conqueror there were above 28000 Knights Fees▪ which belonged to the Church; and in these we do not any where find that K. <HI>William</HI> dispossessed their Tenants of their Estates, most of which were held in Fee under them, and those Tenants were great and powerful men in their Countries; and hence we read in the ancient Records and Legier Books of the Barons and Knights that held of divers Bishops and great Abbots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 84.</NOTE> several examples which you will find in Sir <HI>Henry Spellman.</HI> Title <HI>Baro</HI>: now it is certain that King <HI>William</HI> could not turn all these men out of their Estates, and give them to his followers with∣out committing sacriledge, and invading the Rights of the Church, which that King durst not commonly do; so that the utmost that you can suppose he could do, was to take the forfeitures of all such Tenants of the Church, who had taken part with King <HI>Harold,</HI> or had any ways committed Treason against himself, which were far from the whole number of them; so that here goes off at once almost a half of all the Lands held by Knights service, which the King did never dispossess the ancient owners of: to these may be also added all Tenants in ancient <HI>Demesne,</HI> all Tenants in <HI>Socage,</HI> as also all Tenants in <HI>Gavel kind,</HI> which in those days made at least two thirds of the Lands of <HI>Kent,</HI> which by the way was never conquer'd but surrender'd upon Terms, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are their ancient Customs and Tenures, as Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> himself acknowledges in his description of this County; besides what was held in other Counties by the same Tenure, as you will find in Mr. <HI>Taylor</HI>'s Histo∣ry of <HI>Gavel kind</HI>: all which being not Tenures in chief by Knights Service, are not Register'd in Domesday book; nor does it appear, that the owners were ever dis∣possessed of them; to which may also be added the Lands of those smaller Thanes; or Officers of King <HI>Edward,</HI> whose names are found in Domesday book, who held their Lands <HI>ratione officii.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="730" REF="391"/>To all these we may also add, all such Norman Noblemen and Gentlemen, who having come into <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessors time, and having Honours and Lands given them by him, had continued here ever since; and these were so numerous,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Leges Gu∣liel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i.</HI></NOTE> that it was thought worth while by King <HI>Wil∣liam,</HI> to make a particular Law concerning them, that they should partake of all the Customs, the Rights and Priviledges of Native Englishmen, and pay Scot and Lot as they did: of these was the Earl of <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton</HI>; besides many others whose names appear in Doomesday book; and not only these men, but also divers Cities and Towns held Lands of King <HI>William</HI> by the same Rents and Services, as they had formerly paid in the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, as <HI>Oxford</HI> for example. But to give an answer to some of your instances,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A. A. Vi.</HI> 92, 93.</NOTE> as when you say that King <HI>William</HI> gave away whole Counties, as all <HI>Cheshire</HI> to <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> and the greatest part of <HI>Shropshire</HI> to <HI>Roger de Montgomery, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It is a great error to suppose that these Earls had all the Lands mentioned in these Counties to dispose of at their Pleasure, and that they turned out all the Old Pro∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ietors, which it is certain they did not, as I could prove to you by several instan∣ces of Antient English Families who have held their Lands, and enjoyed the same seats they had in the Conquerors time; so that you see there is a great deal of diffe∣rence between a grant of all the Land of a County, and that of the whole County; what is meant by the former is plain, but as for the latter it generally implies not any thing more than the Government of that County. Thus whereas your Dr. would have it, that the greatest part of <HI>Shropshire</HI> was given to <HI>Roger de Montgomery, Doomesday</HI> says, only that he had the City of <HI>Shrewsbury, &amp; totum Comitatum,</HI> and the whole County; But that is soon explained by what follows, <HI>&amp; totum Dominum quod Rex ipse tenebat</HI>; where it is plain that by <HI>Dominium</HI> is meant no more than that power to govern it which King <HI>Edward</HI> had, for otherwise the Grant of <HI>totum Comitatum,</HI> had been sufficient.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess this is more than I ever heard, or considered before concerning this matter, but you do not give me any positive proof that at the time when <HI>Doomes day</HI> Book was made, there were any Englishmen who held Earldoms, or Baronies, or other great Estates of the King, or any of his great Men; so that what you have said hitherto, tho' it carry a great shew of probability, yet is no positive proof against the Doctors assertion.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not go about to deny what <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmesbury,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Hun∣tington</HI> so positively affirm, that for sometime before the end of King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, there was no Englishman, a Bishop, Abbot or Earl, in <HI>England</HI>; yet does it not therefore follow, that it was thus thorough his whole Reign; or if it were so, that it will therefore follows, that there were few Englishmen, who, when <HI>Domes∣day</HI> Book was made, possessed any Lands in <HI>England</HI>: but that in part of King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign there were many English Earls and Barons appears by above a dozen Char∣ters cited by Sir <HI>William Dugdale,</HI> in the Saxon and Latin Tongues, in his <HI>Monast. Anglic.</HI> which are either directed by K. <HI>William</HI> to all his Earls, and Thains, or else in Latin, <HI>Omnibus Baronibus, Francigenis &amp; Anglis,</HI> or else <HI>Omnibus Baronibus &amp; Fidelibus suis, Francis, &amp; Anglis salutem</HI>; the like Charters also appear of <HI>Henry</HI> J. and the Empress <HI>Maud</HI> his Daughter; so that if <HI>Francigena</HI> and <HI>Francus</HI> signifie a Frenchman, and <HI>Anglus</HI> and Englishman, and if <HI>Fidelis</HI> does (as your Dr. would
<PB N="731" REF="391"/>
have it signifie a Tenant in <HI>Capite,</HI> then I think nothing is plainer than that there were, for great part of King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, both Earls, Barons, and Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> of English Extraction.</P>
<P>But to come to particular persons, it will appear by the Saxon or English names in <HI>Doomesday</HI> book, as also by several recitals therein, that there were di∣vers English Noblemen or Gentlemen, who held Lands in divers Counties of <HI>England,</HI> at the time when that Survey was made; and for proof of this, since so short a conversation as ours will not permit me to run into a long Bed-role of names, I refer you to what the learned and ingenious Mr. <HI>Atwood</HI> in his <HI>Ius Anglorum ab antiqua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 8. <HI>&amp; dein∣de, ad</HI> P. 92.</NOTE> has observed out of <HI>Doomesday</HI> book upon this subject, where tho' he has not only gone thorough, but gone over Fifteen Counties of Thirty, that are surveyed in that book, yet it will thereby sufficiently appear that your Dr. is much mistaken, when he so positively affirms, that there were few or no Englishmen that held Lands in <HI>England</HI>: but to give you a taste of this I shall run through as many Counties as Mr. <HI>Atwood</HI> has given us the names of; To begin which survey, where besides the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI> above mentioned, (who tho' he was a Norman born, yet he was here before the entrance of the Norman Duke, and held <HI>Estre∣haw</HI> in Tenrige▪ Hundred in the time of King <HI>Edward</HI>) there was also <HI>Hugo de Port,</HI> an Englishman who was a very great Proprietor, as may be found under this Title in <HI>Doomesday</HI> book, <HI>Terra Hugonis de Port</HI>: many Mannors he had; and as thereby appears in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> he had at least two Mannors, <HI>Cerdeford</HI> and <HI>Es∣chetune,</HI> from his Ancestors before King <HI>William</HI>'s entrance; and besides this Gentle∣man, (and the Earl above mentioned,) there are no less than Ten or Eleven, who as it appears either by their English Names, or else by this note which so fre∣quently occurs, <HI>Idem tenu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t T. R. E. i. e. tempore Edwardi Regis</HI>; the like I may say for the other Counties there mentioned, as <HI>Hampshire</HI> in the next place, where besides <HI>Ralph de Mortimer</HI> who had several Lands, <HI>T. R. E.</HI> there are no less than above Thirty Free-holders more, who by their Saxon names and want of Sir-Names seem to be English, divers of whom held the same Thane Lands, which themselves or their Fathers did in the time of King <HI>Edwards</HI> and tho in <HI>Bucking∣hamshire</HI> and <HI>Barkshire,</HI> indeed there are but five or six, who held the same Lands which they or their Ancestors possessed in the time of their Conqueror; but yet in <HI>Wiltshire</HI> and <HI>Dorcetshire,</HI> there appears between Twenty and Thirty English Pro∣prietors, many of whom held whole Townships when this Survey was made, in <HI>Sommersetshire, Devonshire, Staffordshire, Yorkshire</HI> and <HI>Glostershire,</HI> their does appear in most of them a dozen or more English Saxon names, who held whole Mannors; 'tis true that in <HI>Nottinghamshire, Linco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shire</HI> and <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> their appear fewest English names, and yet the least of these have three a piece.</P>
<P>So much may suffice for <HI>Doomesday</HI> book; and I doubt not if any one will take the pains to look over the Titles of the rest of the Counties, he may find enough Instances of the like Nature, sufficient to prove that the English were not wholly dispossessed of their Estates, at the end of K. <HI>William</HI>'s Reign when this Survey was made. Not to mention <HI>Northumberland, Westmor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land,</HI> and the Bishoprick of <HI>Dur∣ham,</HI> all which are omitted.</P>
<P>But that the number of English, which held the Lands in the time of King <HI>Wil∣liam,</HI> the first and second, was very considerable, may appear by <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmes∣buries</HI>

<P>As for Mr. <HI>Atwood</HI>'s Catalogue of English names from <HI>Doomesday</HI> book, I have not yet examined them, and tho' I grant there are, may be divers who held the same Lands that they, or their Fathers did, yet they are but a few in respect of the rest; nor are we certain that all these were Native English, and not Nor∣mans who held Lands as well then, as before the Conquest; since the Normans, and the English names were often the same; and as for the want of Sir-names, that is no argument, that they must needs be English, since in those days very few even of the Normans, but persons of Quality and Estates, had any, as Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> shews us in his remains; but as for those expressions in the Charters of King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> and his Sons, wherein the English; as well as the French Earls and Barons, are mentioned; those Charters might be either made during the three, or four first years of King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, when I grant the English were not wholly dis∣possessed of their Estates, but that there were some of them that still held Earl∣doms, and Baronies in their own right; but when the same expres∣sions occur after that time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<P>As for what you have now said against the citations of the names out of <HI>Doomesday</HI> book is not material, since if English names were then common to the Normans and them, then the Norman names might be as well common to the English; and then many of those in <HI>England,</HI> whom by their names we suppose to have been Normans, might be Native Englishmen, and as for what you urge against the express words of the Charters I have now cited, I think it is a down∣right wresting of the words <HI>Francis</HI> and <HI>Anglis</HI> since no Author that I know of, but your Dr. and is of that opinion. For that the word <HI>Franci</HI> or <HI>Fran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igenae</HI> does sig∣nifie such Frenchmen who held Baronies in <HI>England,</HI> is granted on all hands, but how <HI>Angli</HI> must also signifie Frenchmen, seems a Paradox to me; for how could these Frenchmen or Normans, be termed Englishmen, only because they held Estates here and not in <HI>Normandy</HI>? for if the having such and such Estates in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> would have turned Frenchmen into Englishmen, there needed no such di∣stinction to have been made between French and English Barons in these Charters; since according to your Doctors Notion, the French Barons could be no other ways mentioned here, but as they had Estates here, and therefore could be only writ to in that capacity, since as meer Frenchmen they had nothing to do here; so that if this Epithete was so in respect of the Tenure of their Lands, they would have been stiled English Barons as well as the other; nor is your other evasion more to the purpose, that by the <HI>Angli</HI> might be meant in the Charters of <HI>Henry</HI> the I. such Norman or French Barons, who because they were born in <HI>England,</HI> might therefore be called English; for who can believe that in so small a time, as from the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> the I. to that of King <HI>Henry</HI> the I. which was but a little above 30 years, so many of the Norman Nobility were dead, as should make it necessary to use this distinction of French and English Barons; since by their Tenures they were both alike English? and thus to make <HI>Angli</HI> signifie Normans, is to confound and make all words tho' never so plain; uncertain and equivocal: but that a residue of the English. And as for what <HI>Ordericus</HI> says of the old Norman Barons, it would have signified if you could have proved he had called them Englishmen, as he does not; But if you carry it further to the time of the Empress <HI>Maud</HI> and King <HI>Stephen,</HI> when all the Old Race of Normans were certainly dead, then there was much less need of this distinction, when all that were born in <HI>England</HI> were English alike, and therefore the word French could only extend to those few Barons who being born in <HI>Normandy</HI> had Estates here.</P>
<P>But since you are forced to confess, that for the first four or five years of King <HI>William</HI> the I. Reign, there were both English Earls and Barons, till the King had by degrees rooted them out, there cannot be a better argument against your pre∣tended
<PB N="734" REF="393"/>
right of Conquest; since it is plain, King <HI>William</HI> could never pretend to take away their Honours and Estates as a Conqueror; since by his Coronation Oath he was sworn to restrain all Rapines, and unjust Judgments, and that he would behave himself modestly toward his Subjects, and Treat both the English and French with equal right; so that if he afterwards took away the estates of Eng∣lish Nobility or Gentry, it was either because they deserved it by Rebelling against him, &amp; then it was justly done, or else it was done without any cause at all, but only to oppress and root out the English Proprietors; and if so, such actions being contra∣ry to his own claim from <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, as also to his Coronation Oath, could no more give him any such right to Rob or Spoil Men of their Estates without any just cause, then it could give him a right to Rob the Churches and Monaste∣ries of all the Plate, Money and Jewels which he found in them, even to the very Chalaws and Shrines, as <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> and other Authors tell us he did in the fourth year of his Reign, when likewise (according as you your self set forth) he began to shew himself a Conqueror, or rather a Tyrant in the taking away the Estates of the English without any just cause.</P>
<P>But however the Authors of that time do not make so great a Tyrant of your Conqueror as the Doctor; for <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Poictou</HI> expresly tells us, who was Chaplain to this King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 208.</NOTE> concerning his taking away the Estates of the English, and giving them to the Normans, that <HI>nulli tamen Gallo datum est quod Anglo cuiquam injustè fuerit ablatum.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Ordoricus Vitalis</HI> speaking of his dealing with the English it the beginning of his Reign says expresly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> IV. p. 505, 506.</NOTE> <HI>neminem, nisi quèm non dam∣nare iniquum foret damnavit,</HI> and therefore Sir <HI>Henry Spelman</HI> shews us in his Glossary out of an Ancient Manuscript, belonging to the Family of <HI>Shurnborn</HI> in <HI>Norfolk</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Title <HI>Dreuges</HI> p. 184.</NOTE>
<Q>That <HI>Edwin</HI> of <HI>Sharborn,</HI> and seve∣ral others that were ejected out of their Estates and Possessions, went to the Conqueror and told him, that never either be∣fore, or in, or after the Conquest; they were against him the said King, either by their Advice, or any other aid; but kept themselves peaceably and quiet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. And this they were ready to make out, which way soever the King pleased to appoint, whereupon the said King ordered an Inquisition to be made through∣out all <HI>England,</HI> whether it were so or no; which was plainly proved; there∣fore he presently commanded, that all those who so kept themselves peaceably in manner aforesaid, as these had done, should be repossessed of all their Estates and Inheritances, as fully, amply, and quietly, as ever they had or held them before this Conquest.</Q>
This is so plain an Authority, that it needs no Com∣ment.</P>
<P>I shall now conclude with a reply to what you have said, to evade the Autho∣rities of those Ancient Authors I have brought to prove, that in the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> the Second, there were many English Gentlemen left of considerable Estates, which you and your Doctor would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain make to be no better than meer mercenaries, which is expresly contrary to the Authority of <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> whom your sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have cited in this point, as also other Authors who have writ of this matter, for <HI>Matthew</HI> has immediately before these words, <HI>Videns igi∣tur Rex Willielmus, omnes penè regni proceres unâ rabie conspiratos, Anglos fortitudine &amp; probitate insignes, faciles leges &amp; tributorum levamen, illis venationes Hibarasque pro∣mittendo

sibi primò devinxit,</HI> and almost make use of the very words that <HI>Malmesbury</HI> had done before; now I desire you or your Dr. would satisfie me, how men who were remarkable for their Valour and Honesty, and who were so considerable▪ as to be sent for by Letters writ on purpose, and when they came should be pro∣mised easier Laws, and free Huntings, and relaxation of Taxes, all which are priviledges which belong to men of Estates, could be mean Souldiers of Fortune? And to make it plain that they were not the Kings, but their own Woods they were to Hunt in, <HI>Roger Hoveden</HI> speaking of this very matter tells us, <HI>&amp; concessit omnibus sylvas suas, &amp; venationem.</HI>
<Q><HI>Sed quicquid promisit parvo tempore custodivit, Angli tum fideliter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um juvabant:</HI> but that he did not keep his promise as to hunting, as well as other things, appears by a passage in <HI>Eadmerus</HI> where he gives us as an ex∣ample of K. <HI>William Rufus</HI> harsh nature, that about fifty men of the ancient Eng∣lish Gentry, who seemed to please themselves in those days, with some remains of Riches, were taken and accused, that they had killed the Kings Deer; and having for this undergone the Trial of Fire and Water, he was in a great Rage about it, which is sufficient to shew you, that there were at this time many English Gentlemen left, of sufficient Estates to use Hunting, either in their own or the Kings Woods.</Q>
As for what you urge farther against Mr. A's instances out of Doomesday Book are not very considerable, since it is only an exception against the names of persons there mentioned, that they were not Native English, but Normans who either were born, or had Lands in <HI>England,</HI> or else had the same names with the English, both which are <HI>gratis dicta</HI>; for Doomesday book plainly proves, either that they or their Ancestors were here before your Conquest, or else their names being wholly English Saxon, it lies upon your side to prove that they were Frenchmen or Normans by Original, which I believe is more than you or your Dr. is able to do.</P>

<P>I shall not say any further about Doomesday book, until I have either exa∣mined it my self, or can procure it to be done by some I can trust; but in the mean time, as for what you say concerning <HI>Edwin</HI> of <HI>Sharborn</HI> the Learned Dr. hath so confuted this Story,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<Q>That are the time of the Conquest, there were Freemen that held their Possessions by free Services and free Customs, and when they were thrown out of them by powerful men, afterwards returning to them, received their own, and the very same Tene∣ments or Possessions to hold in Villenage by performing servile works, but such as were certain and nominated;</Q>
to this may be added, what <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> says,
<PB N="736" REF="394"/>
that King <HI>William</HI> gave liberally to such as were with him in the Battle of <HI>Hastings,</HI> when he Conquered <HI>England</HI>; and that little which was left, he put under the Yoak of perpetual Servitude; yet further as to this particular Report of <HI>Shara∣born,</HI> there could be no such thing, for his name is not to be found as any Pro∣prietor in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> in <HI>Sharnborn,</HI> in <HI>Doomesday-book</HI>; and the owners of <HI>Sharnborn,</HI> whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h are there only to be found, are <HI>William de Warrenna</HI> (from whom this Sto∣ry says it was restored to <HI>Edwin</HI>) <HI>Odo</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bajeux, Benerius Arbalistarius,</HI> and <HI>William de Pertenai,</HI> whence it is evident, that <HI>Warren</HI> and others were posses∣sed of these Lands in the 20 of the Conqueror, not long before he died, and no <HI>Edwin</HI> to be found as Proprietor of any of them, or other Lands; nor is the name of <HI>William de Albeni,</HI> or <HI>William Pincerna</HI> to be found as a Proprietor in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> or in <HI>Doomesday,</HI> though this Manuscript of the Family of <HI>Sharnborn</HI> says, he had that Village and several Towns thereabouts, given him by the Conqueror, by which it appears that this Report is groundless.</P>

<P>I cannot blame you if you do what you can to evade this testimony from <HI>Sharnborn</HI>'s Book, which gives so exact an account of the Original of those Tenants,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Glossary</HI> Title <HI>Drenches.</HI></NOTE> who held of the King, as Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI> tells us <HI>per servitium Dreugarii,</HI> and such Tennants were called Dreuches or Dreuges, as this Book of <HI>Sharnborn</HI> tells us; but tho' it is true, as this Book it self sets forth, <HI>Edwin</HI> of <HI>Sharnborn</HI> was never restored to all the Lands he held before the Conquest; yet it is plain that he had the Kings <HI>Mandate</HI> for his restitution, and if he could not obtain, it, by reason of the great power of the present possessors, yet that is no argument against his Right, or King <HI>William</HI>'s Intention to restore him, since <HI>Ingulph</HI> tells us, that <HI>Ivo Talboi</HI> seized the Cell of Spalding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. p. 71.72.95. Edit. <HI>Oxon.</HI></NOTE> and Diverse Lands belonging to the Monastery of <HI>Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yland,</HI> and kept them by force, notwithstand- a solemn hearing before the King and Council: and if a great man could do this with the Lands of the Church, It is no wonder that so powerful a person as Earl <HI>Warren,</HI> could by his power, or perhaps by the con∣nivance of K. <HI>William</HI> himself, keep another Mans Estate, and make him contented with such a share as he would allow him, when he found he could have no other remedy against those that thus unjustly detained it.</P>
<P>But tho' in the beginning of your Discourse, you seem to allow a part of the Story, as it is related in <HI>Sharnborn</HI>'s Manuscript, and produce the Testimony of <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Fleta,</HI> to prove that divers Antient English Proprietors, who being thrown<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out of their Estates, by powerful men, presently after the Conquest, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain to take them again upon performing of Villain-Services, tho' they themselves remained free men; but your Dr. from whom you borrow this, is very much out in his application of those passages he cites; for neither of those Authors do af∣firm this of all owners of Lands whatsoever, but only there to give us the Original of Soccage Tennants on the Kings Demeasnes, as appears by <HI>Bracton</HI>'s Title to that Chapter, from whence the Dr. cites this passage, which is, <HI>de diversis condi∣tionibus personarum tenentium in dominicis Domini Regis,</HI> and the first words of this chapter make it yet plainer, beginning thus, <HI>in Dominico Domini Regis plura sunt genera hominum, sunt enim ibi servi sive Nativi, ante Conquestum, in Conquestu, &amp; post Conquestum</HI>; and under these last ranges the persons you mentioned; but <HI>Fleta</HI> is more exact in his Chapter <HI>de Sokemannis,</HI> where he tells us, that these men were
<PB N="737" REF="394"/>
Tenants of the Kings Ancient Mannors in Demeasne; <HI>&amp; quia hujusmodi cultores Regis dignoscuntur, provisa fuit quies, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sectas facerent ad Comitatum, vel hundre∣dum tamen pro terra, quorum congregationem tune socam appellarunt hinc est quod Sokemanni hodie dicuntur esse</HI>; So that tho' King <HI>William</HI> might permit his Ancient Tenants to be thus outed of their Estates they held in his own Demeasnes, yet does it not therefore follow, that he took away the Estates of the Ancient Owners, all over <HI>England,</HI> of whatsoever Tenure they were, or of whomsoever held. But as for your quotation out of <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> it proves no more than what I readily grant, that King <HI>William</HI> after his return out of <HI>Normandy</HI> liberally rewarded his Followers with the Estates of the English, which might he only of such as fought against him at the Battle of <HI>Hastings</HI>; and as for that little which was left them, which he says, was put under the Yoak of a perpetual servitude, he means no more by this expression, than that new Tenure of Knights service which King <HI>William</HI> im∣posed upon them, as this Author in the very next leaf, speaking of the Lands of the Bishopricks and Abbies, which were held before free from all secular servitude, <HI>sub servitute statuit Militari,</HI> and therefore you seem to contradict your self when contrary to your own Author Sir <HI>William Dugdale,</HI> you deny the truth of any part of the Story, because that in <HI>Doomesday</HI> book the name of <HI>Edwin</HI> of <HI>Sharnborn</HI> is not to be found, and that <HI>William de Albeni</HI> is not named amongst the owners of that Mannor, which is not material, since this <HI>William</HI> might obtain a share therein after this Survey was made;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I. A. A.</HI> p. 103.</NOTE> and as for <HI>Sharnborn</HI> him∣self, his not being there mentioned is no argument that he had no Lands within that Mannor, or the other that is mentioned in that Narrative; since oftentimes the chief Lords of the Fee are only mentioned in <HI>Doomesday</HI> book, tho' all the Proprietors under them are not particularly named, but it is in vain to discourse any longer with you upon the Subject of your Con∣querors taking away the Lands of English owners; <HI>I</HI> have given you my opinion, and the reasons against it, and if you are not of my mind I cannot help it, there∣fore pray go on to your next head, and shew me by sufficient Authorities, that King <HI>William</HI> as a Conqueror altered all the Laws, and Customs of this King∣dom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not undertake to prove that he altered all the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and brought in quite new ones, yet that he did so in great part, and that by his sole Authority,
<Q>I think I can prove by sufficient Testimonies; and therefore I shall begin with that of <HI>Eadmer,</HI> a Monk of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> a companion of Archbishop <HI>Lanfranc</HI>'s who tells us in his History that <HI>William</HI> design∣ing to establish in <HI>England</HI> those Usages and Laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. <HI>Nov. Fol.</HI> 6. <HI>n.</HI> 10.20, 30. <HI>B.A.P.</HI> p. 32.</NOTE> which his Ance∣stors and he observed in <HI>Normandy,</HI> made such persons Bishops, Ab∣bots, and other Principal men, through the whole Nation, who could not be thought so unworthy, as to be guilty of any reluctancy, and disobedience to them; knowing by whom, and to what they were raised; all Di∣vine and Humane things he ordered at his pleasure.</Q>
And after the Historian hath recounted in what things he disallowed the Authority of the Pope, and Arch∣bishop, he concludes thus.
<Q>But what he did in secular matters I forbear to write, because it is not my purpose, and because also any one may from what hath been delivered, guess what he did in seculars.</Q>
From which I think nothing is plainer
<PB N="138" REF="395"/>
than that K. <HI>William</HI> did not only design to alter many things in the Laws and Customs, of <HI>England,</HI> but did also actually do it, since to that end he made the Bishops, Abbots, and other Principal men, who were to be Judges in all Courts, such as he could wholly confide in: now that K. <HI>William</HI> govern'd the Nation as Conqueror, and did so live and repute himself so to be, and as such brought in and imposed new Laws upon the People of this Nation, is as clear as I shall prove from these particulars; first, The Justiciaries, or cheif Justices, the Chancellors, the Law∣yers, the Ministerial Officers, and under Judges, Earls, Sheriffs, Bailiffs, Hun∣dre duties were all Normans, from his first coming until above a hundred years after, as I can make it out by particular instances, and undeniable Reasons were not the Catalogues too long to be here inserted. If therefore the Justiciaries, Chancellors, Earls, Sheriffs, Lords of Mannors, such as heard Causes, and gave Judgment, were Normans; if the Lawyers, and Pleaders were also Normans, the Pleadings, and Judgments in their several Courts musts of necessity have been in that Language, and the Law also, I mean the Norman Law; otherwise they had said, and done they knew not what, and Judged they knew not how; especially when the controversies, were to be determined by Military Men, as Earls, She∣riffs, Lords of Mannors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that understood not the English Tongue, or Law, or when the cheif Justiciary himself was a Military Man, as it often happen'd, and understood only the Norman Language, and 'tis hardly to be believed these Men would give themselves the trouble of learning and understanding the English Law and Language.</P>
<P>Secondly, Tho' we have many Laws and Customs from the Northern People, and North parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> from whence both Saxons and Normans came; yet after the Conquest, the Bulk and Main of our Laws were brought hither from <HI>Normandy</HI> by the Conqueror, from whence we received the Tenures, and the manner of holding our Estates in every respect; from whence also have we re∣ceived the Customs incident to those Estates: And likewise the Quality of them being most of them feudal; and enjoyed under several Military Conditions, and services, so that of necessary consequence from thence we must receive the Laws also, by which these Tenures, and the Customs incident to them were regulated, and by which every mans right in such Estates was secured; according to the Na∣ture of them; from <HI>Normandy</HI> (and brought in by the Conqueror) we received most, if not all our ancient Tenures, and manner of holding and enjoying our Lands and Estates, as will appear by comparing our Antient Tenures with theirs.</P>

<P>I shall not deny but that a great part of the matter of Fact is true, as you have now put it; yet tho' I grant that the Bishop, Abbots, Chancellors, Chief Justices, and other great Officers of the Crown, were all or the greatest part of them Normans, during the Reigns of the two first Kings of the Norman Race; it do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not therefore follow, that these Men must have made a change in the very substance of our Laws, tho' in matters of form of pleading or judicial proceedings they might have introduced great alterations; for as to the Civil or Municipal Laws of this Kingdom concerning the Descent and Conveyance of Estates,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

so likewise there were Estates, In tail, and Fee simple as now, and there were also the like Customs of the Courtesie of <HI>England,</HI> Burrough English, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as there are also at this day, as I can prove to you by several passages out of our Eng∣lish Saxon Laws; so likewise for Conveyance of Estates, those of the better sort of People called Bookland, were conveyed by Deeds, with Livery and Seisin, either with, or without warranty as they are now; but that which was called Fol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land held by the meaner sort, were only by Livery and Seisin without any Writing; And tho' I grant that the custom of sealing of Deeds is derived from the Normans, yet that is an alteration only in matter of forn; and as for Goods and Money they were bequeathable by a Man's last Will, as well after as before your Conquest; And if you can have the opportunity to peruse a Manuscript Treatise of Sir <HI>Roger Owen</HI>'s upon this Subject, you will find it there sufficiently proved: That Livery of Seisin, Licenses, or Fines for Alienation, Daughters to Inherit, Trials by Juries, Abjurations, Utlaries, Coroners, disposing of Lands by Will, Escheats, Gaols, Writs, Wrecks, Warranties, Felons Goods and ma∣ny other parts of our Law, were here in being, long before the time of King <HI>William:</HI> this being so as to the common Law, let us see what alterations there were in the Criminal, or Crown part of the Law; first, as to Treason and wilful Murther, they were punished with Death in the Saxon times, as well as after, as were also Robery, and Burglary in the night time; but as for lesser of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ences, such as Batteries, Maims, Robberies, and other breaches of the Peace, they were punished by Fine, as well before the Conquest as after; but as for the Law of <HI>Englisherie,</HI> which was, that if a Man were found Murthered, it should be pre∣sumed he was an Alien or Frenchman, and the Town thereupon where the Body was found was to be fined, unless <HI>Englisherie</HI> was proved, <HI>i. e.</HI> that the person was an Englishman; this Custom tho' it lasted to the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, when it was taken away by a Statute made on purpose, tho it may seem a badge of the Norman Conquest, yet was it indeed a Law introduced by King <HI>Knute</HI> in behalf of his Danes, who being often found killed, and none could tell by whom, he obtained this Law to be made to prevent it; as you will see at large in <HI>Bracton,</HI> and the Mirrour of Justices; But as for trial of all offences, it was either by Juries, Fire, or Water ordinal, by Dewel or Battle; or else by Witnesses, or Compurgators upon Oath, as well before as after King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>'s entrance; so that I can find nothing material as to the alterations of the Laws, either in matters Criminal or Civil, from what they were in the Saxons time; and this being so it is easily answered, how the Judges, and Officers might be Normans, and yet the Laws continue English still; for first it is certain that for four or five years, in the beginning of K. <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, he made no great alteration in the Judges, and other great Officers of the Kingdom, and by that time those whom he was afterwards pleased to imploy in the Rooms of such as either died or were turned out, might very well come to understand the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> as far as they distered from those of <HI>Normandy,</HI> which was not in many particulars; since, as your self very well observed, the Saxons and Normans being both Northern People, had many of the same Laws and Customs common to both, and the same persons might in three or four years time, have very well learned English enough to have under stood the Evidence that the Witnesses gave before them, without any Interpreter.</P>
<P>But, say you, all the Pleadings and Judgments were in French, and therefore
<PB N="740" REF="396"/>
the Lawyers and Pleaders must be Frenchmen, which is likewise a false conse∣quence; for Pray tell me, why might not the English Lawyers have learnt French enough to Plead in three or four years time, which must necessarily be required before so great an alteration could be made, or Lawyers enough he brought out of <HI>Normandy</HI> and sufficiently instructed in our Laws and Customs could be fitted for their employments: again supposing all Pleadings and other Proceedings to have been in French, it does not follow that this practice could have obtained in all the Courts of <HI>England</HI>; for tho' I grant that in the Kings Court at <HI>Westminster,</HI> where the Judges (as you say) were for the most part Frenchmen, or Normans;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Coke</HI> Pro∣em.</NOTE> yet this could only have some effect either in that great Court, or <HI>Curia Regis,</HI> where the King often sat in person together with his Chief Justiciary, and other Justices; or else in the Court of Common Pleas, which followed the Kings Court, till it was ordained otherwise by <HI>Magna Charta</HI>; or else the Court of Exchequer, where in those days only mat∣ters concerning the Kings Debts, Lands, and Revenues were chiefly heard and dispatched: but as for the Court of Chancery, it was not then used as a Court of Equity, nor long after till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the IV, V, and VI. when it arose by degrees, as you will find in Sir <HI>William Dugdale</HI>'s <HI>Origines Iuridiciales.</HI></P>
<P>So that granting all the proceedings in these Supream Courts to have been in French, because the King himself, who sat there with the chief Justice, and the rest of the Judges were either Normans or Frenchmen; yet was this of no great importance in comparison of the Suits, and Causes which were first begun, and try'd in the Inferiour Courts in the Country, before ever they could be brought up to <HI>London,</HI> by Writ, of Errour, or Appeal, which could only be in Causes of great Moment, or between the Kings Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI>; So that now to let you see that what say I say is true, we will Survey all the inferiour Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of that time, beginning with the lowest and going up to the highest of them. The first Court we find of this kind, was that of the free burrough or Tything,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Spelman</HI>'s <HI>Glos. Tit. Fribargus.</HI></NOTE> wherein by the Laws of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, the Tythingman or Head burrough was the Judge; who, as that Law tells us, determined all suits and differences arising among Neigh∣bours of the same Tything, concerning petty Trespasses on one anothers grounds, which if they could not be there determined, might then be brought before the Court Baron, which was incident to every Mannor, and wherein the Suitors, and not the Lord nor his Steward, were the Judges:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.</HI> IV. <HI>Inst. cap.</HI> 55, 56, 57.</NOTE> and this, as Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> tells us, was first instituted for the ease of the Tenants, and for the ending of Debts and Dama∣ges under Potty Shillings at home, as it were at their own doors; and let me tell you by the way, that sorty Shillings was theo near as much as forty pound is now;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Spel.</HI> Glossary <HI>Tit. Hundredus &amp; comita∣tus.</HI></NOTE> and if the business could not be ended here, or was of too high a nature, it was then brought into the Hundred Court, where the Hundreder together with the Suitors were Judges; and if they had not Justice there, they might then remove it into the Court of Trithing or Lathe, which was not the smaller Court of the Tithing mentioned, nor yet the Court Leet, but a particular Court consisting of three or four Hundreds; which tho' now quite lost, was in being at the time of the Statute of <HI>Merton,</HI> as I shall shew you by and
<PB N="741" REF="396"/>
by; and if the business could not be decided in the Trithing, it was then removed to the Shire, or County Court, as Mr. <HI>Lambert</HI> shews in the Laws of King <HI>Edward</HI>; which was then held, (as now) from Month to Month, and in which as well as in the Hundred Court the Suitors alone were Judges; and tho' it can now only hold Pleas (unless it be by Writ of Justices) of any Debt or Damage to the value of Forty Shillings, or above, yet we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind from ancient Authors, that this Court was so considerable. that we have diverse examples of Causes between the greatest Persons of <HI>England,</HI> and for Lands of great value, begun and determined in this Court: thus <HI>Eadmertes</HI> relates the great Trial at <HI>Pinnesden-heath,</HI> be∣tween <HI>Odo</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bayen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Hist.

<P>So that to conclude this head, if no suit could be begun in those days, but what was first commenced in the Hundred Court, no <HI>distringas</HI> could issue forth till three demands were made in the Hundred, and from thence to be re∣moved to the County Court, where regularly all civil causes were try'd by the Suitors as the only Judges, as well as in the Hundred Court, and Court Baron; then it will necessarily follow, that, unless you can prove, (which I think is impossible) that all the English were at that time Slaves and Villains, and had no Free-hold of any sort left them; that all Pleading and Proceedings in any of those Courts, being before meer Englishmen, must have been in English, and no other Language; so that after all this great cry, nor a twentieth part of the Suits in <HI>England,</HI> were brought to <HI>London</HI>; And as for Criminal Causes, unless in cases of Treason, all Murthers and other Felonies were Tryed and Judged in the Country, either within the particular Jurisdictions of Bishops, Abbots or great Lords, or else of such Cities and Towns who had the Priviledges of <HI>Infangthief</HI> and <HI>Outfangthief</HI> to∣gether with <HI>Fossa</HI> and <HI>Furca,</HI> that is, a Pit to drown, and a Gallows to hang Male∣factors; and if the offence was done in the body of the County, they were then tryed and condemned in the County Court; Justices <HI>Itinerant</HI> not being in use till <HI>Henry</HI> the seconds Reign.</P>

<P>I must confess you have given me a great deal of light in these matters more than I had before; but as I shall not dispute whether in the lowest Courts, such as the Tythings and Court Barons, the smaller English Free-holders might not Judge of Petty causes amongst themselves; yet that in those greater causes, were brought in the Hundred, and County Courts, which only the greater Fleemen of the Hundred,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.A.</HI> P. p. 38, 39. <HI>Glos.</HI></NOTE> or County were Judges: who these Freemen were, Dr. <HI>B.</HI> hath sufficiently taught us in his Com∣menes upon the Conquerors Laws, as also in his <HI>Glossary, (viz.)</HI> That they were Tenants in Military Service, who in those times were the only great
<PB N="742" REF="397"/>
Freemen of the Kingdom, and quite different from our ordinary Free-holders at this day; These were the Men the only legal Men, that named and chose Juries; and served on Juries themselves, both in the County and Hundred Court, and dis∣patched all Country business under the great Officers; I do not deny but that there might be other lesser Freemen in those times,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Glos.</HI> p. 29, 30.</NOTE> but what their quality was, farther than that their Persons and Blood was Free, that is, they were not <HI>Nativi,</HI> or Bondmen, it will give a knowing man trouble to discover it to us: we find in every leaf of <HI>Doomesday, Socmen, &amp; liberi homines,</HI> Possessors of small parcels of Land, but what there quality was, and of what interest in the Nation, <HI>Dicat Apollo,</HI> no Man yet hath made it out, nor can it be done by the account we have of ordinary Free-men, for a Century or two last past.</P>
<P>And for further proof of this; That none but Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> or Military Tenants at least could be Judges in the County Court, appears by the Laws of King <HI>Henry</HI> the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 1.</NOTE> wherein it is expresly said. <HI>Regis Iudices Barones Comitatus qui liberas in tis terras habent, per quos debent causae singulorum alterna prosecutione tractari, &amp;c.</HI> So that these Barons of the County being certainly Feudal Tenants, this service of being suitors to the County and Hundred Courts, was a service incident to their Tenures; and then it will also follow,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<P>If this be all you have to object against what I have now said, that all Plead∣ings in the Inferiour Courts in the Country, must in the time of your Conqueror have been in French, and not in English, I hope I shall give you very good satis∣faction to the contrary, and therefore I shall prove to you, that the very same persons who were the Suitors or Judges in the Hundred Court, were also Suitors in that of the County, tho' they were of never so small Estates of Free-hold; and those that were thus Judges in the Hundred Court, were also the same persons of which the lowest Court (<HI>Viz</HI>) that of the Headborough or Tythingman did consist, appears by the very definition of a Hundred, as you may see it in Sir. <HI>H. Spelman</HI>'s <HI>Glossary,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tit Hundredus.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Est autem Hundredus portio Comitatus, quâ
<PB N="743" REF="397"/>
Olim degebant Centum pacis regiae fideiussores, uti Decuria quâ decem, complexus est igitur Hundredus decem Decurias, ut centenarius numerus decies denarium:</HI> now that the County Court consisted of the same sort of persons, of that of the hundred, is also as certain, since all <HI>England</HI> was then and is now divided into Counties, Hundreds, and Tythings; so that as the Hundred Court consisted of a hundred Persons, who had all given Pledges to the King, so did the County Court consist of all the Free-holders or Free-men of the several Hundreds of the County, who all owed Suit and Service to the County Court, and as such were returnable upon Juries in all Trials in that Court, tho' they had never so small Estates of Free-hold; for there were no Laws that limited the estates of Free-holders returnable upon Juries, on Assizes or Trials, to the yearly value of Forty Shillings, until the Statute of <HI>West.</HI> II. But that these Suitors to the Hundred Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 38.</NOTE> must have been for the most English in all your Conquerors Reign, your Dr. has given us a sufficient testimony in his answer to Mr. <HI>A's Ianus Anglorum,</HI> p. 35. where he tells us, the Jurors were antiently called Tests, and often in <HI>Doomesday-book</HI> it is thus sound,
<Q><HI>Testatur Hundredus, Teste Hundredâ,</HI> the Hundred Witnesseth that such Lands is such a Man's, or by the Witness of the hundred such Land is a such Man's.</Q>
See the claims in <HI>Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and Suffolk,</HI> at the end of the Book. Now the use that I shall make of these words of the Drs. is this, that in many of these claims the Issue is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I. A. A.</HI> p. 95, 201.</NOTE> that such a one held the Land <HI>die quo Rex Edwardus suit vivus &amp; mortuus:</HI> now I desire you to tell me, if the free-holders of the Hundred, were all Strangers and Normans at this time, as your Dr. supposes, they all were that served on Jurles in the Hundred and County Court; how these men could testifie who held the Land at the time of K. <HI>Edward</HI>'s Death, and by what Services? and I desire you to be pleased to read and consider the Trial mentioned in <HI>Doomesday-book,</HI> between <HI>Will. de Chornet</HI> and <HI>Picot</HI> the Sheriff, where the proof was by the best and most antient Men of the whole County and Hundred, that this Land in question belonged to <HI>Chornet per haereditatem sui Antecessoris.</HI> So that then the best and antientest Free-holders of the County of <HI>Berks,</HI> were the same who were so in the time of K. <HI>Ed∣ward,</HI> or else how could they Witness this Land to have been held by <HI>Chornets</HI> An∣cestor.</P>
<P>But because you have two or three small objections against this truth, I shall en∣deavour to remove them. The first is, that those who try'd one anothers Causes in the County Court, are in the Law of K. <HI>Henry</HI> I. (which you now cited) called <HI>Barones Comitatus qui liberas Terras habent.</HI> Therefore you imagine that these <HI>Ba∣rones Comitatus</HI> must needs have been all Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> or by Knights Service at least, who by vertue of that Tenure owed Suit and Service to the County Court, which is a great mistake; since every Free-holder of whatsoever Tenure, who was resident within the County, owed Suit and Service to that Court, and it is only by vertue of the twentieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, which (as I have already shew∣ed you) limited that Service only to Free holders of Forty Shillings <HI>per annum,</HI> or above: now that every Free holder tho' of never so small Estate was anciently a Baron of the County, is also as certain in the ancient and larger acceptation of the word Baron, which did not originally signifie only a Tenant in <HI>Capite,</HI> or by Knight Service, but any other Free-holder, who could be returned upon a Jury concern∣ing Free-hold in the County Court; now that every Lord of a Mannor, and Free-holder,
<PB N="744" REF="398"/>
was anciently called a Thane before the Conquest, appears by this Law of K. <HI>Knutes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 52.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; habet omnis dominus familiam suam in plegio suo; &amp; si accusetur in aliquo, respondeat in Hundredo, ubi compellabitur sicut recta Lex, sit: Quod fi accusetur, &amp; fugiat, reddat Dominus ejus Regi Weraem, i e. pre∣cium nativitatis hominis illius; &amp; si Dominus accusetur, quod ejas consilio sugerit, adlegiet se cum quinque Thanis, (id est Nobilibus) &amp; idem sit sextus, si purgatio frangat ti, reddat ei (scil Regi) Weram suam, &amp; qui fugerit, extra legem habeatur.</HI> I shall nor trouble my self to translate this Law, since the Latin is plain enough; only take notice that by this word <HI>adlegiet,</HI> he shall wage Law, or make Oath together with five Thanes, that is Noblemen or Gentlemen, <HI>&amp; idem sit sextus,</HI> whereof he himself should be the sixth; where you may see that every Free-holder, being Master of a Family is here called a Thane, who was to give pledge or security, that all his Family should answer the Law in the Hundred Court for any offence they should commit; and these Thanes were such as Mr. <HI>Lambert</HI> expresses by <HI>Ascitus sibi ingenuis quinque</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I. A. A.</HI> p. p. 197. <HI>Lamb leges Ethelred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Cap.</HI> I.</NOTE> for what he calls <HI>ingenuus, Brompton</HI> calls <HI>liber homo,</HI> that is every Free-holder, so that you see Thane, <HI>ingenuus</HI> and <HI>liber homo</HI> signifie all the same thing, that is the lower sort of Thane, or Free-holders who owed Suit and Service to the Hundred and County Courts; and that these very men were such as after your Conquest were called <HI>Barones Comitatus,</HI> appears in this, that those who before the Conquest were called Thanes, are afterwards called Barons of Counties, in all our Ancient Laws and Charters; and for this I shall give you the Authority of Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI> in his Glossary, who tho' he does chiefly understand by this word all sort of feudal Barons dwelling in each County,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tit. Barones Comitatus.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Proceres nempe &amp; Maneriorum domini,</HI> yet nor only these, but <HI>necnon liberi qui∣que Tenentes, hoc est fundo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um proprietarii, Anglice</HI> Freeholders, <HI>ut superius dectum est.</HI> So that take it in which sense you will, this word cannot signifie only Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> or so much as Military Tenants, as you suppose, since a man might hold a Mannor by other Tenures than Knights Service, as by grand or petty Serjeanty, or in Soccage by a certain Rent, and so likewise might he hold any other lesser Estate of Free-hold by the like Tenures; which if it were so, your Drs. Fancy of Tenants in Military service being then the only Free-men of the Kingdom, and who were capable of serving upon Juries in the Hundred and County Court, is a meer <HI>Chimera,</HI> without any ground, as I have already proved at our third meeting; when I shewed you by the words <HI>liberi homines,</HI> so often mentioned in King <HI>William</HI>'s Laws, are to be understood not only Tenants by Knights Service, but any other Free-men or Free holders, who held Lands or other Possessions, which may be also proved farther by the Stat. of <HI>Merton Cap.</HI> 10. as appears by this clause, <HI>Provisum est insuper, quod quilibet liber <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omoq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sectam debet ad comitatum, trithingum, hundredum, &amp; Wapentagium, vel ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> domini sui, libere possit facere Attornatum suum, ad sectas illas pro eo faciendas.</HI> Whereby you may see, that every Freeman, who was a Master of a Family, and not under the power of another, was then obliged to pay Suit and Service to the County, Trithing, and Hundred Courts.</P>
<P>But, say you, these persons who were Jurors in this great Cause between Earl <HI>Odo,</HI> and Arch-bishop <HI>Lanfranc</HI> are there called <HI>Primores,</HI> and <HI>Probi viri,</HI> not only of the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> but other Counties where the Lands lay, and it is not
<PB N="745" REF="398"/>
probable, that the ordinary Free-men, which made the greatest number, and were all bound to their good behaviour, could be the <HI>Probi &amp; Legales homines,</HI> who served upon this Jury: well I grant it, that these Gentlemen you speak of, might be Lords of Mannors and considerable for Quality and Estate, and who alone were impannelled upon Juries in this, and other such great tryals of Novel Dissei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in; and yet for all that those lesser Free-men, or Free-holders you mention, were <HI>Legales homines,</HI> and as such were capable of trying all Causes, of what nature soever, since Sir <HI>H Spelman</HI> tells us in his Glossary, Title <HI>Legalis,</HI> that <HI>In Iure nostro de eo dicitur qui stat rectus in Curia, non exlex seu utlegatus, non excommunicatus, vel infamis, &amp;c. sed qui &amp; in lege postulat &amp; postul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tur. Hoc sensu vulgare illud in for∣mulis juridicis; probi &amp; legalis homines.</HI> So that he does not make (as you do) that a Man's legality must depend upon his Tenure, but upon his being <HI>rectus in Curia.</HI> So that it is no more an Argument, that because in some great Tryals in those times, none but the chief, and most considerable Men in the County, were im∣pannelled upon Juries in the County Court; therefore none but they could ever serve there upon Juries at all; then it would be now for a man to affirm, that because in great Tryals at the Assises, or at the Bar at <HI>Westminster,</HI> only Knights, and Gentlemen are Impannelled; therefore none but they, and not any Yeo∣men, or Countrymen can ever serve upon Juries at all.</P>
<P>But let these Gentlemen you mention have been all Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> or by Knights, Service, if you please, yet will it not make good your assertion, that they were only Normans or Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nchmen, who, as the only Proprietors of Estates, served upon this and other Juries at that time, for they must have certainly been such, who of their own knowledge, knew the Lauds in question, and to whom they did belong before K. <HI>William's</HI> entrance into <HI>England,</HI> and your Dr. him∣self in his answer to Mr. <HI>Atwood's Ianus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. I.</HI> p. 34.</NOTE> fully agrees to this truth, as appears by this passage, which I desire you would read;
<Q>In Tryals of Novel Diss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isin, and for the Possession of Lands, Customs, Services, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Juries at the time of the Conquest, and in several of the King's Reigns next succeeding were Impannelled out of the same Town and Neighbour∣hood, of such as did know the Land and things in question, and who had been possessed of it, and for what time; And to this purpose in an Assize, if none of the Jurors knew the right it self, or truth of the matter, and did testifie so much to the Court upon Oath, recourse was then had to others, until such were found who did know the truth; but if some did know the truth, and others not, those that knew it not were put by, and others called into the Court, until twelve at the least should be found to agree therein; and for this purpose it was that all Suitors to Hundred and Country Courts were bound to appear there under great penalties, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re might be a Jury of such as knew whose the Land was; and so far your Dr. is very much in the right; but then, that all the Gentlemen that served upon this Jury must be Englishmen, is as plain from the reason he hath now given us; and if he had not told us so, we have an undeniable authority for it, to wit the antient Mss. called <HI>Codex Roff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 197.</NOTE> quoted by Mr. <HI>Sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en</HI> in his notes upon <HI>Eadmerus,</HI> where speaking of this Tryal;</Q>

what <HI>Eadmerus</HI> says, so that nothing is more evident by your Doctors own shewing, as also by the Testimony of this ancient Author, that this great cause was Tryed either by Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> and other great Free-holders were all Englishmen, or such Frenchmen as were here before your Conquest; so that from this famous Tryal we may draw two of three confusions directly contrary to your assertions: First, That there were many great Proprietors not only in <HI>Kent</HI> but in other Counties, as appears by <HI>Eadmerus,</HI> who were a sufficient number to try Causes in the County Courts, a good while after your Conquerors coming over. Secondly, That the Pleadings and Verdict in this Cause being before Englishmen, and given by them, must have been all in English; and if it were so in this cause, it will follow for the same reason in all other Counties all over <HI>England.</HI> Lastly, That these Gentlemen were well skilled in the Antient Laws and Customs of <HI>England,</HI> which had been in vain if they had been altered as you suppose.</P>

<P>I will not deny but that in the beginning of the Conquerors Reign, many Englishmen might have Estates left them, which might not be taken away till some years after, and Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his Titles of honour places this Tryal between Earl <HI>Odo</HI> and Arch-bishop <HI>Lanfranc,</HI> about the first year of K. <HI>William,</HI> and I sup∣pose that it happened before the fifth year of his Reign;
<Q>when <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> tells us, that the Earls <HI>Eadwin, Morcar,</HI> and <HI>Siward</HI> together with <HI>Egelwin</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> as also many thousands of Clerks and Laicks not being able to bear the severity of K. <HI>William</HI> fled into Woody and Desart places, and from thence got into the Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> where they fortified themselves, and whither K. <HI>William</HI> followed them, and taking the Island made them submit to mercy; and then this Author tells us, that the K. put the Bishop of <HI>Durham</HI> in Prison; and as for the rest, some of them he killed, some he put to ransom, and others he commit∣ed to perpetual imprisonment; so that I reckon from this time, the King took away most of the Englishmens Estates, as not trusting them any more.</Q></P>

<P>If this had all happened as you have put it, yet would it not prove what you have maintained; for if those Englishmem who had not been engaged with <HI>Harold,</HI> or else had been pardoned for it still held their Estates; and as you say they forfeited them afterwards for Rebellion; then it is certain K. <HI>William</HI> did not proceed against the English as a Conqueror; since if he had, he would have taken away their Estates <HI>Iure belli</HI>; which since as you your self confess he did not, whatever Estates he took away afterwards, was either for Treason committed by the Eng∣lish, or else wrongfully; if the former, he did it as a lawful King; if wrongfully, then as a Tyrant, and as such could, obtain no just right against the English Nation, by his unjust proceedings.</P>
<P>But indeed after all, you are quite out in your account concerning this matter, for as to the great Tryal you now mentioned, it could not be in the first or second year of King <HI>William's</HI> Reign, nor could happen sooner than the sixth or seventh of his Reign, for Arch-bishop <HI>Stigand</HI> was not deposed till the year 1070. which was the Fourth year of K. <HI>William</HI>; and in the next year being 1071. the Annals of <HI>Mailros,</HI> as also the Chronicle of <HI>Thomas Wiks</HI> place Archbishop <HI>Lanfranc's</HI> Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣secration, and fetching of his Pall from <HI>Rome,</HI> so that it could not be until the year after this Rebellion at the soonest, when <HI>Lanfranc</HI> was setled in his Bishoprick, that this suit was commenced by him against Earl <HI>Odo,</HI> and therefore a great many of the English Nobility and Gentry, had still Estates let them after this Re∣bellion.</P>
<P><PB N="747" REF="399"/>And that they continued to have so some years after this time, appears by those Writs of K. <HI>William,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Atwood</HI> hath given us in his <HI>Ianus A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glorum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 42. <HI>B.

<P>I shall not insist upon this point any farther, yet this much you cannot deny, but that all the Pleadings and Proceedings at <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stminster,</HI> as also the old Law books were all in French, as appears by the Mirror of Justices, <HI>Britton,</HI> not to men∣tion

those of latter days, as <HI>Littleton</HI>'s Tenures, and others; and so were also the ancient year Books or Reports of cases, all written in Norman French, even in our own age; so that since this proceeded from that great alteration which the Conqueror made in our Laws, it is also a badge of that yoak which he imposed upon the Nation by his Conquest: and to make this yet more plain, that very Co∣py of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessors Laws is in old Norman French, which (together with K. <HI>William</HI>'s Additions to them) <HI>Ingulph</HI> tells us, he brought down with him to his Monastery, and which he has inserted into his History, as you may find them in the last Edition Printed at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and were before published by Mr. <HI>Sel∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> in his Notes upon <HI>Eadmerus.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny but that some part of the matter of fact to be as you have here laid down; yet it will not follow that this common use of the French Tongue in our Reports and Laws, did proceed from the Norman Conquest, or is any badge of Conquest; for first, the most Ancient Laws of K. <HI>William,</HI> which we find in <HI>Spelman</HI> and <HI>Lambert</HI>'s Collections are in Latine, as they were before the pretended Conquest; I grant indeed those you mention in <HI>Ingulph</HI> are in French, but they being most of them criminal or penal laws, or else concerning Tenures, it is no wonder that they were publisht in the Language of his Country, that the Normans and other Frenchmen he brought over with him might understand them; and tho' they were written in French, yet they were proclaimed in the English Tongue, that the English as well as Normans might take notice of them: but after these Laws, you will not find any ancient Charter or Statute in French, till the Statute of <HI>West.</HI> I. which was above 200 years after your pretended Conquest; for all the Charters of this K. <HI>William,</HI> are in Latine or Saxon, as that particularly granted by him to the City of <HI>London</HI>; so likewise were all the Ancient Charters and Laws of the other succeeding Kings, as those of K. <HI>William Rufus, Henry</HI> I. <HI>Henry</HI> II. King <HI>Stephen, Richard</HI> I. are all in Latine or Saxon, and none of them in French, as appears by several of them still to be seen in the Arch-bishops Library at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and in Sir <HI>Robert Cotton</HI>'s, and also <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and all other Statutes and Charters of K. <HI>Iohn</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the third till the Statute of <HI>West.</HI> I. above mentioned, and there∣fore it is not likely that this custom should have taken its original from <HI>Normandy,</HI> for if it had, it would have been begun immediately after your Conquest; and as for our Law Books, tho' I grant those you mentioned to be written in French, yet is it not the Norman French, since it differs very much from the Language in which K. <HI>Edward</HI>'s Laws are written, which are in <HI>Ingulph,</HI> the French of which is so ob∣solete and obscure, that he that understands our Law French very well, can scarce∣ly make any sense of them; but our first Writers concerning the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> writ in Latine and not in French, as you may see by <HI>Glanvil, Bracton</HI> and <HI>Flet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> who writ before <HI>Horn</HI>'s Mirrour of Justices, or <HI>Britton</HI>'s Treatise of the Laws of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>As for your Books and Reports, I grant they are in French; but that this custom was not derived from <HI>Normandy,</HI> is also as certain, since the first Reports we have begin with the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, except some few Memorandums of cases a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>judged in the Exchequer in the Reign of his Father, above 200 years af∣ter K <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lliam</HI>'s coming in (as I but now noted;) nor could they be writ in the Nor∣man dialect, since we had then nothing to do in that Dutchy, which had been Conquered by the French in the beginning of K. <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Reign, above eighty years
<PB N="749" REF="400"/>
before any Report, or Law book was writ in French at all; and therefore we must ascribe the original of this custom to some other cause than the meer will and pleasure of your Conqueror, and for this we must go as high as the Reign of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor;
<Q>who as <HI>Ingulph</HI> tells us, having lived long in <HI>Normandy</HI> and bringing over divers Normans with him, the whole Nation began under this K. to forsake the English customs, and to imitate the French manners in many things, so that all great men looked upon it as a piece of good breeding, to speak French in their Houses, and to make their Deeds and Charters after the French manner so that it was very easie for K. <HI>William</HI> after his coming in, who (as <HI>Ingulph</HI> also tells us) abhorred the English Tongue,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 71.</NOTE> to make the Laws of the Land to be pleaded in the French Tongue, and to make the Boys to learn at School the first rudiments of their Grammer in French, and also the Saxon or English hand to be altered, and the French hand to come in use in all Books, and Writings;</Q>
and tho' I confess most of the chief Justices and Judges, were Frenchmen or Normans, during the three or four first Kings of that Race; yet that alone could not have caused this Tongue to be so generally used, not only in the Kings Court, but also in all the Courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> after Englishmen began again to sit there, had it not been for the Tacite consent not only of the King, and People of Quality, but also of the Lawyers themselves; for the Law Terms being for the most part French, they did not only thereby make the Law the greater mystery to the Vulgar, but they also supposed that these Terms being French, could not be rendered into any other Language; but for all that, it had been impossible for this Tongue, which was spoke by so small a number of Persons in respect of the whole Nation, to have prevailed so long among the better sort of People, had not our Kings for many Ages enjoyed large Territories in <HI>France,</HI> which occasioning their frequent going over thither about affairs of War or Peace, as also the French Gentry and Nobilities frequent com∣ing over hither, it is no wonder if that Tongue being the Language of the Court, was generally understood and spoken by all Noblemen, Gentlemen and Lawyers; so that I have heard it from a very good hand, a person who is very well versed in An∣tiquity, that a Gentleman being returned on a J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> II. was excepted against, because he did not understand French; and hence it is, that not only the Terms of our Law, but also those of Heraldry, Hawking, and Hunting, are almost all French to this day; and tho' by the Statute of <HI>Edward</HI> the third which you but now mentioned, all Pleas should be in English, and not in French, yet I desire you to take notice, that this did no way extend to any matters of Process upon which suits are founded, but that the Writs, Declarations, and all other matters of Record were always entered and enrolled in Latine, from before the Conquest to this very day, so that there was never any alteration as to that point; these things being considered it is no wonder if the Judges and Clerks of Parliament, who were in those days entrusted with the drawing up all Acts of Parliament, being greater Masters of the French than Latin Tongues, chose ra∣ther to draw them up in the former, and thus it continued until the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, when our Statutes began first to be drawn up, and enrolled in English.</P>

<P>I confess you have given me a greater light in this matter than I had before, yet I suppose you cannot deny that the Tenure of Knights Service, with those
<PB N="750" REF="401"/>
clogs that belong to it of Wardship, Marriage, and Relief were all derived from the Normans as appears by the grand customer of <HI>Normandy,</HI> which I have already men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ioned; so that tho' it be true that all these are now taken away by a late Statute of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the second, yet since this Tenure, and those services are not found among the Saxon Laws, there cannot be a greater proof of the ancient power of the Conqueror, or of the servitude imposed upon the Nation by him; and therefore I look upon it as a very imprudent part of the late K. <HI>Charles,</HI> to part with so great a tye, which his Father and all his Predecessors had over the Persons and Estates of all the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not take upon me to decide whether it were Politickly done or not of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the second, to part with the Wardship, and Services of his Tenants by Knights Service; but this much is certain, that considering the abuses and corrup∣tions that had crept into that Tenure by degrees, since the first institution, both by the unfit Marriages of the Heirs, as also by the waste that was often times com∣mited on the Wards Estate during his Minority, it was certainly a very great grie∣vance and burthen to the subject, and considering how many of those Wardships were begged by hungry Courtiers, they were of no considerable profit to the Crown; and tho' I grant they were a very great tye, (or rather clog) upon the Estates of the Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom; yet it did not thereby pro∣duce any such love or obedience, as would retain the Tenents better in their duty before than since they were granted away for the forfeitures for Treason and Felony, and also Fines for Alienations, and are reserved to the Grown now as they were before; and as for any love or respect which was anciently paid by the Heir, how could there be any such thing? since the King granted away the custody of the Heir, and his Lands, to persons who for the most part made a meer prey of them; so that they were often Married against their consents, and their Estates were delivered to them wasted and spoiled; besides also what was exacted from them for reliefs, and <HI>Ouster lismaines</HI> we need not wonder if it were rather a cause of secret discontent and hatred of the Kings Prerogative than otherwise▪ and therefore I cannot think it was not so unpolitickly done by the King, to render himself gracious, and acceptable to his People upon his return to grant their re∣quest, and pass that Act for taking away Wards and Liveries, and to accept of a Revenue by excise of treble the value in stead of it.</P>
<P>But to come to the Original of Knights Service it self, I do not think it was de∣rived from the Normans, since we are certain there were Thane Lands in <HI>England</HI>; which were held of the King, and that by Knights Service, before King <HI>William</HI>'s coming over, and there were also middle Thanes who held of those Lords above them by the like Service▪ insomuch that in the Laws of K. <HI>Knut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> there is one concerning the Heriots,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap</HI> 69.</NOTE> which an Earl, the Kings Thane as well as inferior Thanes, were to pay not only to the King, but to other inferiour Lords, which are almost the same as were afterwards reserved by the Laws of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, confirmed by K. <HI>William,</HI> as you will find them in <HI>Ingulph</HI>; only there is no Gold reserved, but only Horses and Arms, whereas by the Law of K. <HI>Knute,</HI> each E. was to pay two hundred Manenses of Gold, each Kings Thane fifty, and each inferiour Thane two pounds; only note that he who is called E. in K. <HI>Knutes</HI> Laws, is called a Count in these, the Thane a Baron, and the inferior Thane a Vauasor: and that which is there called a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is here termed a Relief.</P>
<P><PB N="751" REF="401"/>And that this Tenure by Knights Service, which is now called <HI>Escuage</HI> or <HI>Servi∣tium Scuti,</HI> was of ancient time named <HI>expeditio hominum cum scutis,</HI> and was in use before the coming in of the Danes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 35. <HI>p.</HI> 192.</NOTE> is also as certain, for Sir <HI>E. Coke</HI> in his fourth Inst. tells us, that we may in the Char∣ter of K. <HI>Kenulph,</HI> who <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 821. granted to the Abbot of <HI>Abbindon</HI> many Mannors and Lands, and reserved, <HI>quod expeditionem duodecim viro∣rum cum tantis scutis exerceant, antiq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os pontes &amp; arces renovent,</HI> and also he mentions a like Charter of K. <HI>Ethelred</HI> to a Knight called <HI>Athel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Anno Domini</HI> 995, so that you see not only Spiritual Persons, and great Thanes or Barons, but also Knights held Lands by the service of so many men before your Conqueror, and your Dr. also himself allows it, for in his answer to Mr. <HI>P.</HI> in all ancient Charters in the Saxon times he translates the word <HI>fidel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> by Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> or Military Ser∣vice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not deny that Military Fees were in use before the Conquest, and also that the feudal Law did obtain here in many things, and therefore I am so far of the Doctors opinion, who in his <HI>Gossary Tit. Feudal</HI> Laws tells us,
<Q>The Feudal Law obtained to most Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> and in <HI>Normandy</HI> was in its full Vigor at the time of the coming over of the Conqueror,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 3.</NOTE> but afterwards grew more mild and qualified, as also the Tenure it self, a perfect description of which with all its incidents of Homage, Relief, Ward, Marriage, Escuage, Ayds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are to be found in the Grand Customer, <HI>Cap.</HI> 29.33, 34, 35. and although there were Military Fiefs, or Fees, here in the Saxon times, yet not in such manner as after the Conquest established here by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, and according to the usage in <HI>Normandy</HI>; when as it appears by Doomesday-book, in every County he divided most if not all the Land of <HI>England,</HI> amongst his Normans and Followers;</Q>
Now that this custom of Wardships is wholly derived from the Norman Conquest, you shall find in Sir <HI>E. Cookes</HI> fourth Institutes in the same Chapter you last cited,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 193.</NOTE> as you may here read,
<Q>You have heard before <HI>de regali servitio,</HI> before the Conquest; but that <HI>regal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> servicium,</HI> (which was, Knights service) drew unto it relief, but neither Wardship of the Body or of the Land, as hath been said; it is true that the Conqueror in respect of that Royal service, as a badge of the Conquest, took the Wardship of the Land, and the Marriage of the Heirs within age of such Tenants, but this extended not to the Tenures of the Subjects by Knights Service, as it appeareth by <HI>Bracton, Dicitur Regale se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vitium, quia spectat ad dominum Regem &amp; non alium, &amp; secundum quod in Conquestis fuit adin∣ventum, &amp;c.</HI></Q>
Whereupon Sir <HI>E. C.</HI> notes (in the Margent,) the Tenure (as be∣fore it appeareth) was not then invented, but the fruits of this Tenure of the K.

<P>I shall not dispute his matter since it is doubtful whether this custom of Wardship was Norman, or whether it was derived from the Saxons, who possi∣bly might have some respect to Orphans in such cases, to train them up for the publick Service in point of War; especially, being possessors of a known right of
<PB N="752" REF="402"/>
Relief, as well as <HI>Alfred</HI> the Saxon King did undertake the work for the training of some particular persons in learning, for the service of the publick in time of Peace, and Civil Government, and tho' Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI> is of opinion in his Title <HI>de Wardi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that Wardship of the Heir came in with the Conqueror, yet Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> his son, (who was also a learned Antiquary) in his Epilogue to his second book of K. <HI>Alfred</HI>'s Life, Printed at <HI>Oxford,</HI> speaking of Military Fees granted to the Kings Thanes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 117.</NOTE> has this passage. <HI>Haec etiam Fioda bae∣redibus sub Hereoti, si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e relevaminis cujus piam quod haeres in terrae re∣demptionem Regi solvere tenebatur conditione plerumque transibat; &amp; si haeres minor natu à Patre moriente relinquebatur, Regi educatio <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jus (utpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Regis Hominis) committebatur, in utilitatem etiam &amp; commodum ipsius Regis.</HI> But whether the Wardship of the Body of the Heir, was in use in K. <HI>William</HI>'s time or before, is uncertain; for the land is in the Charter of <HI>Henry</HI> the first in <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> granted either to the Widdow or next heir.</P>
<P>But let these customs be derived from whence you please, it is a plain case it could be no badge of Conquest upon the People of this Nation, and that by the Doctors own shewing; for were it a Norman custom never so much, if your Conqueror first of all imposed it upon those he brought over along with him, it could never be a badge of Slavery upon the English Nation, but rather upon the Normans, upon whom it was chiefly imposed; and if they afterwards granted Lands to the English upon the same terms they held them themselves, they were no more Slaves to whom they were granted, than they were under whom they held them; but indeed this was so far from being looked upon as my badge of servitude, that if the Dr. himself is to be believed,
<Q>these were the only Freemen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Glossary. <HI>Tit. liberi ho∣mines.</HI></NOTE> and their services, (<HI>Bracton</HI> says) were so noto∣riously free; that in Writs of Right it was never mentioned, be∣cause so well known <HI>Notandum in servitio Militari non dicitur per Li∣berum servitium, &amp; ideo quod Constat, Quia tale Servitium Liberum est.</HI></Q>
And hower Rigorous the Feudal Law might be at the beginning, it was when your Conqueror came in so far mitigated as to the rigour of it, that the Tenants by Knight Service were not only free by K. <HI>William</HI>'s Law, from all Arbitrary Taxes and Tallies. but also obtained a setled Inheritance to them and their Heirs, as appears by that clause in K. <HI>William</HI>'s Charter; and therefore in the Reign of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the Third, when <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Warren</HI> Earl of <HI>Surrey</HI> was questioned after the Sta∣tute of <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> by the Kings Justices, by what Warrant he held his Lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> An An∣cient Msc. in the <HI>Bod∣lian</HI> Library cited by Sir <HI>Will. Dug∣dale</HI> in his Baronage of <HI>England,</HI> Page 79.</NOTE> pulling out an old Sword, he answered to this Effect; behold my Lords here is my warranty, my Ancestors came into this Land with <HI>William</HI> the Bastard, and obtained those Lands by the Sword, and I am resolved with this Sword to defend them a∣gainst any whosoever shall go about to dispossess me, for the K. did not himself alone Conquer the Land, but our Progenitors were sharers with him and assistants therein.</P>
<P>As for what you say, That the Laws in the Customary of <HI>Normandy,</HI> are the same with the Laws of <HI>England</HI>; It is no more than what divers French Writers

have taken notice of, but do not attribute their agreement to their being borrowed from the Normans,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitlock</HI>'s Speech in Parliament, 1650. Prin∣ted in his Memorial, <HI>p.</HI> 461.</NOTE> but quite contrary; for in the first place most of the Learned Men say, That the first establishing of the Customary of <HI>Normandy,</HI> was in <HI>Henry</HI> the first's time, and af∣terwards again about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the seconds time, when <HI>Normandy</HI> was not under the King of <HI>England</HI>; and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>querius</HI> a French Author relates, that K. <HI>Henry</HI> I, established the English Laws in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and with him do also agree <HI>Gulielmus Brito, Rutilarius,</HI> and other French Writers, who mention also that the Laws in the Customary of <HI>Normandy</HI> are the same with the Laws collected by our English K. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, who was before the Conqueror; an additional Testimony hereof is out of <HI>William de Reville de Alenson,</HI> who in his Latin Comment upon the Customary,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Coke.</HI> Preface.</NOTE> proves and demonstrates that the Laws and Customs of <HI>Normandy</HI> came from the English Laws and Nation, either not long before or after <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor's time.</P>
<P>In the Customary, there is a Chapter of Nampes or Distresses, and it is there decreed; that one should not bring his action upon any seisure, but from the time of the Coronation of K. <HI>Richard,</HI> and this must be our K. <HI>Richard</HI> the first, because no K. of <HI>France</HI> was ever of that name; and the words <HI>Nampes,</HI> and <HI>Withernams,</HI> were Saxon words, taken out of the English Laws, signifying a Pawn or Distress, and in the same sense are used in the Customary. But if you have nothing more to object against what I have now said, pray proceed to your last head, and let me see how you will prove, that the English lost all their antient Liberties and Privi∣ledges which they enjoyed under the English Saxon Kings.</P>

<P>I never heard so much before concerning the Original use of the French Tongue in our Reports and Law Books, but yet this much I think you will not deny; first, that the Norman French was never used in our Courts of Justice, till after the Conquerors entrance, Secondly, That he did his endeavour totally to root out the English Tongue, by ordering of Children to learn the first rudiments of their Grammer in French: and as for what you have said concerning the Customary of <HI>Normandy</HI> being especially as to Tenures derived from the English Laws and Customs, I do not deny but that it may be the opinion of some French Writers that it was so, but I shall believe it, when they can prove that the Ward∣ships and Marriage of the Heir of the Tenants by Knights service, as also those aids they were to pay the King, or any other Lord they held of towards making his eldest Son a Knight, and Marrying his eldest Daughter, were in use in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> before the Conqueror came over.</P>
<P>But to observe your commands, I shall now proceed to shew that by the Con∣quest, the English for a time lost all their ancient Rights and Priviledges, till they again obtained them either by their mixing with the Normans, so that all distinction between them and the English were taken away, or else they were re∣stored by the Charters of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the first, K. <HI>Iohn,</HI> and K. <HI>Henry</HI> the third▪ I shall therefore divide the priviledges of Englishmen into these three heads; first, Either such as concerned their Offices or Dignities; Or, secondly, Such as con∣cerned their Estates; Or lastly, Such as concerned the Tryal for their lives: in every one of which, if I can prove the English Natives as well of the Clergy and
<PB N="754" REF="403"/>
Nobility suffered confideracie lesses and abridgments of their ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> liberties which they formerly enjoyed. I think I shall sufficiently prove the point in hand;
<Q>As to the first head <HI>Ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ph</HI> tel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s us, that the English were so hated by the Normans in his time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 70, 71. Edit. <HI>Oxon.</HI></NOTE> that how well soever they deserved, they were driven from their Dignities; and strangers, tho' much less fit, of any Nation under Heaven were taken in their places;</Q>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 93.</NOTE> and <HI>Malmesbury</HI> who lived and writ in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the first says,
<Q>that <HI>England</HI> was then become the habitation of foreigners, and the Rule and Government of strangers; and that there was at that day no Englishman an Earl, Bishop, or Abbot, but that strangers devoured the Riches, and gnawed the Bowels of <HI>England,</HI> neither is there any hope of ending this misery.</Q>
So that it is plain they were now totally deprived of all Offices and Dig∣nities in the Common Weal, and consequently could have then no place in the great Council, the Parliament of the Nation, both for the raising of Taxes, and the making of Laws: and tho' I grant Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI> and your self sup∣pose you found a clause in the Conquerors <HI>Magna Charta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. P.</HI> p. 36.</NOTE> whereby you would prove, that all the Freemen of this Kingdom, should hold their Lands and Possessions Well and in Peace, free from all unjust Exactions and Taillage, so as nothing be exacted or taken unless their Free-services, which of right they ought and are bound to perform to us; and as it was appointed to them, and given and granted to them by us as a perpetual right of Inheritance, by the Common Council of the whole Kingdom. This Common Council will not help you, for without doubt here were no Englishmen in it; for certainly they would not grant away their own Lands to strangers; These were the Saxon Lands which <HI>William</HI> had given in Fee to his Soldiers to hold them under such services as he had appointed them, and that by right of Succession or Inhe∣ritance.</P>
<P>We will now come to the second point, <HI>viz.</HI> the Priviledges the Englishmen lost as to their Estates, for whereas before the Conquest you affirm, the K. could nor make Laws, nor raise Taxes without the Common Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncil of the Kingdom; it is certain K. <HI>William,</HI> and his immediate Successors, did by their sole Authority exercise both these Prerogatives: as for his Legislative power, it appears from the words of his Coronation Oath, (as you your self have repeated it out of <HI>Florence</HI> of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and <HI>Roger Hoveden,</HI>) the conclusion of which Oath is, <HI>se velle re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>am legem statuere &amp; tenere, Rapinas Injustaque Iudicia penitus interdicire</HI>; Now the Legislative power was then lodged in him, why else did he swear to appoint right Laws?
<Q>For if the constitution had been setled as it is at present, the Parliament could have hindered him from making any other; and that he could do so appears by that yoak of servitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 7.</NOTE> which <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> (as well as other Authors) tells us, K. <HI>William</HI> by his own Authority imposed upon the Bishopricks and Abbies in <HI>England</HI> which held Baronies, which they had hitherto enjoyed free from all secular servitude, he now, says he, put under Military service sessing all those Bishopricks and Abbies, according to his pleasure, how many Knights or Souldiers each of them should find to the King and his Successors: and putting the Rolls of this Ecclesiastical Service in his Treasury, he caused to fly out of the Kingdom many Ecclesiasticks who opposed this wicked constitution: now if he could do this upon so powerful a Body, as
<PB N="755" REF="403"/>
the Bishops and Abbots were at this time, he might certainly as well raise what Taxes he pleased upon all the People of <HI>England,</HI> and therefore <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Huntington</HI> tells us, that K. <HI>William</HI> upon his return out of <HI>Normandy</HI> into <HI>England, Anglis im∣portabile tributum imposuit.</HI></Q>
<HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 278. And that his Son <HI>William Rufus</HI> imposed what Taxes he would upon the People, without consent of the Parliament appears, by that passage of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmesbury,</HI> which he relates in the Reign of this K. as also in his third book <HI>de Gestis, Pontific<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> concerning <HI>Ranul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> whom from a ve∣ry mean Clerk he made Bishop of <HI>Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ham,</HI> and Lord Treasurer; the rest I will give you in Latine, <HI>Isle, siquando edictum regium processisset ut nominatum tributum An∣glia penderet, duplum adjici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bat, subinde▪ idente Rege ac dicente solum esse hominem, qui sciret sic agitare ingenium, nec aliorum curares odium, dummodo complaceret dominum.</HI> So that you may here see that the Kings Edict or Proclamation, did not only impose the Tax at his pleasure, but his Treasurer could double it when he had a mind to it, without consent of the great Council or Parliament, as we now call it; and this Prerogative was exercised by divers of his Successors, till the Statute <HI>de Tallagi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> non concedendo</HI> was made.</P>
<P>But to come to the last head concerning the alteration of Tryals for mens Lives and Estates by the Conqueror, from what they were before; it is certain that whereas before the Conquest there were no other Tryals for mens lives but by Ju∣ries, or else by Fire or Water Ordeal, which was brought in by the Danes; the Con∣queror, tho' he did not take way these, yet also added the law then in use in <HI>Nor∣mandy,</HI> of Trying not only Criminal but Civil Causes by Duel or Combat; all the difference was, that in criminal cases where there was no other Proof, the accuser and accused fought with their Swords, and the party vanquished was to lose his Eyes and Stones; but in civil causes they only fought with Bas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oons headed with Horn, and Bucklers, and he or his Champion who was overcome lost the Land, that was contended for; from whence you may take notice also of a great altera∣tion in the Law, not only concerning Tryals, but capital Punishments; so that whereas before the Conquest, all crimes, even Man slaughter it self, were either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ineable according to the Quality of the Person, and the Rates set upon each mans pepzylo, or price of his head, as you will find them set by the Laws of K. <HI>Ath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lstan.</HI></P>
<P>I shall not insist much upon divers lesser things, which K. <HI>William</HI> as a Conque∣ror imposed upon the People of <HI>England,</HI> as disarming them of all offensive Wea∣pons, forbidding them to Hunt or Kill any Deer in his Chases or Forrests under the penalties of loss of Eyes and Members, as also keeping up and reinforcing the An∣cient Laws of Decenaries or Tythings, whereby every Ten Families were bound with their tenth man or tything man, body for body of each others good abear∣ance; as also that Law forbidding all sitting up late at Night, or Assemblies after eight of the clock, but that every one should go to Bed, and put out both Fire and Candle at the ringing of the Coverte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bell; these things I think are very suffi∣cient to prove that K. <HI>William</HI> as a Conqueror did very much abridge, and in some things wholly take away the Ancient Priviledges and Liberties of the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh No∣bility, Clergy and Commons, and did also make many and great alterations, not only in the forms of Pleadings, but also in the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of our Laws, both Criminal and Civil; and if he did not make more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>erations of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kind, it was wholly owing to his free Will and Pleasure, since, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dmerus</HI> tells us, he or∣dered all Divine and Secular things acccording to his pleasure.</P>

<P>That I may the better answer what you have said, I shall partly grant and partly deny the matters of Fact you have alledged, and also further prove, that if they had been all as you have laid them, yet would they not prove your conclusion, that K. <HI>William</HI> by his own Arbitrary and Tyrannical Actions, could create any Right by Conquest, either to him or to his Successors: And therefore to begin with your first head, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Priviledges of the English Nobility as to Offices and Dignities, tho' I grant it was true, as the Authors you have cited relate, that s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arce any Englishman was, when they Writ, either a Bishop, Earl or Abbot, yet this is to be understood only of the latter end, and not the beginning of his Reigns; for as to the Bishops and Abbots, I do not read of any more than <HI>Stigand</HI> Arch∣bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Egelric</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> who being deprived of their Bishopricks, had Successors put in their rooms in their life times; and yet in the place of this last, not any Norman, but one <HI>Walcher</HI> an English man was named by the K. to succeed: and as for the Earls, of all those who had been against him and opposed his coming in, there was not one but he received them into sa∣vour, and continued in his Dignity and Estate, as in particular the Earls <HI>Eadwin</HI> and <HI>Morchar</HI> Brothers, together with <HI>Waltheof</HI> and <HI>Siward,</HI> and <HI>Edgar A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eling,</HI> whom they had named K. of <HI>England,</HI> all who kept their Earldoms and Estates till terrified by the Kings severe and Tyrannical proceedings, the three first of these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led away as you have already shewn, tho' I confess Prince <HI>Edgar</HI> had for two or three years before this, fled into <HI>Scotland</HI>; but yet was afterwards restored to the Kings Favour and his Estate; nor do I find any considerable alteration in the Kings manner of disposing of his Honours or Preferments, either Ecclesiastical or Civil, till Earl <HI>Waltheo</HI> being convicted of being in the Plot, with <HI>Ralph de Waher</HI> Earl of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and other Lords, as well English as Normans, to expel K. <HI>William</HI>; and from that time (being the eighth year of his Reign) I grant he changed his whole course of Government, and put no more Englishmen into any places of honour or profit; tho' <HI>W. Malmesbury</HI> endeavours to excuse the Kings se∣verity in these words, <HI>Inde pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>positum regis fortassis meritò excusatur, si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aliquando durior in Anglos <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rit, quod pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nullum eorum fidelem invenerit</HI>; tho' with this Authors good leave, the K. had been the cause of this conspiracy, by his own Tyranny and breach of Oaths, as I shall shew you by and by.</P>
<P>So that either this K. was moved by just provocations thus to debar all English∣men from being preferred to Dignities or Offices, or he was not; if the former, and that he had just cause so to do, it was no more than what any other Foreign Prince who had no Hereditary Right to the Crown, would have done in the like case; But if the latter, it was not only contrary to Justice, but also to his own Co∣ronation Oath, one clause of which, as <HI>Malmesbury</HI> shews us in his <HI>de Gestis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 3. p. 271.</NOTE> <HI>Pontificum</HI> was, <HI>quod se modeste erga subditos ageret, &amp; aequo jure Anglos, &amp; Francos tractaret</HI>; so that this Kings Arbitrary and vio∣lent proceedings, after he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or some time governed as a lawful King, tho' they might prove him a Tyrant, yet they could by no means make him a Conqueror; And as for the latter part of your Argument, whereby you would prove that in his Reign there were no Englishmen in the great Councils of the Kingdom, that can only be understood (in the strictest sense) of the times after the great Con∣spiracy I have now mentioned; for before, it is very evident that there were ma∣ny Bishops, Earls and Barons still left, who must have been members of the great
<PB N="757" REF="404"/>
Council. Nor can you prove that the Law I have mentioned against the King's taking the Taillage or Taxes, without their consent, was made after that time; but let it be made when it will, you shall never p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsuade me it was enacted with∣out any Englishmen's being present, till y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u can prove to me that there were no English Tenants in <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pite</HI> towards the end of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reign, and that there were then no Knights, Citizens or Burgesses that represented the Commons in the great Council, and can give a better answer to those Arguments I have given you to prove they were there; especially that remarkable clause in the conclusion of this Kings Charter, to the Abby of <HI>Westminster,</HI> which mentions divers Principal Persons, both of the Clergy and Laity, to have been summoned to that famous Synod or great Council, when this Charter was granted.</P>
<P>I come now to your next head, whereby you would prove this King's Abridg∣ment of English Priviledges as to their Estates and Properties; to begin with that of the Legislative Power, which as you say, was then wholly in the King; admit it were so, it will not prove that for which you urge it, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is a sign of the Kings Absolute Conquest over the English; for if the great Council of the Kingdom had then lost its ancient right, it was only his Normans and Frenchmen, as well as the English, that he bereaved of their Ancient Priviledge, of giving their consent to Laws; since it is very certain that neither the K. of <HI>France,</HI> nor the D. of <HI>Nor∣mandy</HI> could at that time make any Laws without the consent of their Estates.</P>
<P>But the truth is, that your Conqueror could not do it neither; for if the Normans he brought over with him, had, as you suppose, the greatest share of all the Lands in <HI>England,</HI> they would have been too powerful a body of Men to be thus made Slaves at his pleasure, but indeed his own Laws shew the contrary, for in that very Law it appears otherwise,
<Q>Whereby all the Freemen of the King∣dom were to hold their Lands and Possessions free from all unjust Exactions and Taillage,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L. L. Guil.</HI> 55.</NOTE> and that nothing should be exacted of them, but their free service, which they were bound to do ac∣cording as it is appointed them by the K. and it is granted them by an Hereditary Right for ever, by the Common Council of the whole Kingdom; whereby you may see, that they had their Lands and Liberties granted them, for an Hereditary Right, not only by the K. but by the Common Council of the Kingdom, and that the K. could not alter K. <HI>Edward</HI>'s Laws without their consent; the Charter of K. <HI>Henry</HI> I. says expresly, <HI>Legem Regis Edwardi vobis reddo cum illis emendationibus quibus Pater eam emendavit Concilio Baronum suorum</HI>;</Q>
Therefore as for that Authority you have brought out of <HI>H. Huntington,</HI> that upon this Kings return from <HI>Normandy,</HI> he imposed a heavy Taxe upon the English, this is either to be understood of such a Tax as they gave him voluntarily, tho' perhaps they durst not do otherwise, as the States of <HI>Provence</HI> and <HI>Langu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>doc</HI> are fain to do to the K. of <HI>France</HI> at this day, when he requires it, and yet he does not claim those Countries by right of Conquest; or if K. <HI>William</HI> imposed this Tribute without their consents, it was not only contrary to the Law just now mentioned, but also to his own Coronation Oath; whereby he swore to prohibit all unjust Rapines, and that he should behave himself equitably to∣wards his Subjects, with which certainly his taking away their Money without their consents would by no means consist: but to answer that part of the Coronation Oath which you think makes most for you, that whereby he swore only to make Right Laws, which must have supposed the Power to have been in himself, because the Par∣liament
<PB N="758" REF="405"/>
might have hindered him from doing otherwise, this is but a cavil, for it is already proved that he was to make Laws and raise Taxes by the Common Council of the Kingdom, and therefore these words may very well bear another sense, and do only give the K. a Negative voice of passing such Laws as the great Council should offer to him, or else such as he might propose to them for their con∣sent; and I suppose you▪ will not deny but that it is very possible, that either the K. or the Parliament may propose such Laws as may not seem equitable, or Just, and then certainly both the one and the other have a negative vote, and ought not to give their consents to them.</P>
<P>But to answer your last instance whereby you would prove that this King as a Conqueror imposed what Taxes and Services he pleased, not only upon the Laity but the Clergy too, by making the Bishopricks, and greater Abbies liable to Knights Service, which you suppose to have been done by his own sole Authority, without any consent of the Common Council of the Kingdom, this is only <HI>gratis Dict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> and is indeed altogether improbable, for if the K had done this by his sole Power, he would have imposed this Service upon all the Abbies in <HI>England,</HI> whose Lands might have been as well reduced to Knights Fees, as those that were put under that service, and so might have been forced to find as many Soul∣diers as they had Fees, as well as the Bishopricks and greater Abbies; but indeed the Clergy were too powerful a body to be thus Arbitrarily imposed upon, and they would soon have complained to the Pope against the K. for this new servi∣tude he had imposed upon them; and therefore I think we may with much more safety conclude with Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his Titles of honour, that this imposition of Knights Service upon the Bishopricks and Abbies was done by the Common Coun∣cil of the Kingdom, It being too great a matter to be done without it, for it appears by <HI>Eadmerus</HI> that the K. held a Council this very year, tho' the Laws; and Pro∣ceedings of it are all lost; and this is the more likely to be so, because this imposi∣tion was not laid upon all the Abbies in <HI>England,</HI> but only upon the Bishopricks, and such Abbies as were of Royal Foundation, and held immediately of the King before your Conquest, and were only such as enjoyed whole Baronies, as <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> there tells us.</P>
<P>I shall now come to your last head, whereby you would prove that your Con∣queror by his sole power, altered the Course of Tryals, and introduced the custom of Duel or single Combat, in Civil as well as Criminal Causes; the chief argument you have for this, is, that there is no mention made of this tryal by Duel in our English Saxon Laws before the Conquest, which is but a negative argu∣ment at the best, and you can shew me no Ancient Author that says expresly that K. <HI>William</HI> introduced it, and tho' I grant it is first mentioned in his Laws, yet does it not therefore prove that it was not here before, since it was certainly in use among the <HI>Francs</HI> and <HI>Longobards,</HI> who were German Nations as well as the Saxons; but admit it were first introduced by the Conqueror, this was no badge of Con∣quest, for the Normans as well as the English, were subject to this Tryal, which was in use in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Normandy</HI> long before this King's coming in; so that ad∣mit he first establisht it here, it might not have been done by his sole Power, but by some Law made in the great Council of the Kingdom, tho' it be now lost; as we have very few of the Laws that were made by this K. now left us, besides those which are called the Laws of K. <HI>Edward</HI> with this Kings alteration of them, all
<PB N="759" REF="405"/>
which was certainly done in the Common Council: the like I may say concerning the alteration of Punishment for Deer stealing and other crimes, which were ei∣ther Punishable by Pecuniary Mulc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, or else by death, before the coming in of the Normans; since those alterations might be also made by the consent of the great Council▪ but that the same Forest Laws, were in use before the Conquest as af∣ter you may see in the Forest Laws of King <HI>Knute,</HI> as you will find in Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI>'s Glossary, Title <HI>Foresta,</HI> only the Punishments are there Pecuniary▪ or else loss of liberty, which after your Conquest was changed into the loss of Eyes and Members.</P>
<P>But as for other lesser matters, as his disarming the English and forbidding Night Meetings, if these things were done, (as I do not find any express Law for them, for there is no such thing mentioned in the Law <HI>de nocturnis Custodiis</HI>) they were either practised by this K. for his own security, after the English had by their frequent insurrections made him use all the means he could to prevent it for the future, so that at the most they were but temporary constitutions, and did not last long; nor could this Law of the Conver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bell be any badge of slavery on the English, since we find the same custom to have been used in <HI>Scotland,</HI> whom you will not say are a Conquered Nation; nor do I find the Normans after they came over, were any more exempted from this Law than the English Natives: but I much wonder you should reckon the Laws of Decenaries, or Tythings, among the badges of Norman slavery, since if you have read any thing in our Saxon Laws you will find,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid Ingulph</HI> History.</NOTE> as <HI>Ingulph</HI> tells us, that K. <HI>Alfred</HI> first appointed <HI>ut omnis indigena l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>galis, in aliqua centuria &amp; decima existe∣rit, &amp; si quis suspectus de aliquo latrocinio per suam centuriam, vel decariam condimnatus, paenam demeri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am incurreret</HI>?

<P>So that upon the whole matter, I can see nothing considerable imposed by your Conqueror upon the free born English Subjects, which they were not tyed to be∣fore the Conquest; or which did not reach all the Normans he brought over with him, as well as they.</P>

on the English Throne, especially if it be considered that K. <HI>William</HI> kept not all the promises which he made at all times; Now as your self allow, this grant was made in the fourth year of his Reign, but he had not then setled himself so well as he would, nor had he then made an entire Conquest of the Nation; that was not done until after the great appearance of the Natural English in Armes, and the great meeting which <HI>Frederick</HI> Abbot of St. <HI>Albans</HI> with others headed at <HI>Berkhamslead,</HI> which was not until above four or five years after this confirmation; so that your Testimony from the <HI>Litchfield</HI> Chronicle and <HI>Roger Hoveden,</HI> being be∣fore he setled himself as he could, and intended to do, signifies nothing: and that it was from sometime after this transaction, that <HI>Mat.

<P>I will not deny the matter of Fact in great part to be as you say: but whe∣ther the English were to blame to make these Insu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rections, or whether they were provoked to it by the Kings unreasonable severities, I have not now time to dispute; if it were their fault, he had no doubt very good cause to do as he did, and to punish such as were guilty; But it was altogether unjust and tyrannical, to punish the innocent with the guilty; Nor could he have any right to do it as a Conqueror, since by taking his Coronation Oath to deal mercifully with his Subjects, and to treat both English and French with equal right, he had renounced that Title; and that he looked upon himself as a Tyrant, if he had Governed without being Crowned or taking the same Oath as his Predecessors, I shall prove to you from Abbot <HI>Bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton</HI>'s Chronicle, the Author of which lived in the time of K <HI>Richard,</HI> I. who has (<HI>Col</HI> 962.) these words, <HI>Cumque Willelmus Dux Normannorum Conquestor Angliae Tyranni nomen exhorresce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et &amp; nomen Legitimi Principis induere vellet, a Sti∣gando Cant. Archiepiscopo in Reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia petiit consecrari, &amp;c.</HI> as</P>
<P>But your reply that he did not shew himself a perfect Conquerour till he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n throughly setled, is very pleasant; as if being solemnly Crowned, and taking a Oath to govern Justly and according to Law, and after four years quiet possession and a voluntary confirmation of the Laws of his Predecessors, were not sufficient signs of his peaceable settlement upon the Throne; unless you will have a King to be never setled until he has by the force of a standing Army, got sufficient power to do all he designs, that is, to take away his Subjects Liberties and Estates at his pleasure, contrary to his own Oath, and the Laws he has made; If those be signs of a thorough settlement, pray consider whether the King that is gone away, was ever thoroughly setled at this Rate tho' I confess he was in a very fair way to give us such a thorough settlement; But since you date this thorough settlement from that great transaction of Abbot <HI>Frederick,</HI> I am not afraid to appeal to <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Mat. Pa∣ris in vita Frederici Ab∣batu.</HI></NOTE> from whom you have borrowed this relation; where he tells us thus;
<Q>That after <HI>Lanfranc</HI> was made Archbishop, the K. being now strengthened with both Swords, began more severely and manifestly to oppress the English; who seeing it nearly con∣cerned their very lives, calling a great many together, they made <HI>Edgar Atheling</HI> their Leader, in whom the English placed all their hopes; but among all the English <HI>Frederick</HI> Abbot of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> was the chief promoter thereof, being a generous Man, and to be seared for his Riches and Power;
<PB N="762" REF="407"/>
Therefore the K. began to be vehemently afraid left he should lose the whole Kingdom which he had gained by so much effusion of Blood, and also hazard of his life; and therefore being luckily taught by the Archbishops Prudence, he be∣gan to act more mildly with the chief men of the Kingdom, humbly proposing Tearms of Peace, and with a pleasant countenance inviting them to a Treaty (tho' deceitful, as the end at last declared) therefore the said English met him at <HI>Berkhamstead</HI> thinking no harm, under the leading of Abbot <HI>Frederick,</HI> where after many disputes, Archbishop <HI>Lanfranc</HI> being present, the K. swore upon all the Relicks of the Church of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> as also upon the Holy Evangelists, Invio∣lably to observe the good ancient approved Laws of the Kingdom, which the Picus Kings of <HI>England</HI> his Predecessors, and chiefly K. <HI>Edward</HI> had Established and so being pacified they all returned home very well satisfied.</Q>
So that you see this was the third time, whereby he renounced all right of Conquest (if ever he had any) by swearing expresly to observed all the ancient Laws of the Kingdom, since they found his Coronation Oath would not bind him, besides his so solemn confir∣mation of K. <HI>Edwards</HI> Laws, in the great Council of the Kingdom not long before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray read a little farther, and see how he resented this force now put upon him, and whether at all he intended to keep what he had sworn, or to di∣vest himself of his Right of Conquest; and therefore give me now leave to read the rest out of this Author;
<Q>But the K. cunningly hiding his designs, within a few days after, studied how to overcome and supplant those dispersed and asun∣der, whom he could not, when joined and consederate together; which he perform∣ed by killing, disinheriting, and banishing many of them, and violating the above mentioned Laws; and the English being thus spoiled at pleasure, and im∣poverisht, without any legal Judgment, he therewith enriched his Normans, to the great provocation of his natural English subjects, who had of their own accord thus exalted him;</Q>
So that you see he never intended to keep his Oath that was thus forced upon him, for Conquerors do not love to be made Slaves to their words whether they will or no; and therefore I may give you an answer both as to his Coronation Oath,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. A. A.</HI> p. 289.</NOTE> as also to this now men∣tioned, from an old English Proverb, that there was never any Oath, but was either broken or kept; more Conquerors than one have used fair pretences, and made smooth promises, and dealt cunningly with the People to carry on their designs, and have at first taken plausible Oaths, and broken them afterwards, nay took them when they intended not to keep them, and knew th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y could not; and for Oath breaking <HI>Harold</HI> in his answer to Duke <HI>William,</HI> when he demanded the Kingdom of him, had given him a fair example, that <HI>Stu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tum Sacramentum est frangendum,</HI> many specious Oaths, Vows, and Cove∣nants were contrived, and taken by crafty and designing men in the late times, and imposed upon the People contrary to the Oath of Allegiance, they had before taken, for no other ends than to cheat them into Rebellion, and to make them Au∣thors of their own slavery which was discovered too late, when they were under the power of an Army, and could not help themselves; as I could prove at large would the time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I give you a positive answer to what you have said, tho' I do believe a great deal of the matter of Fact to be true, as <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> hath related it either from Tradition, or else from the Legier book of his own Abby, yet I very much
<PB N="763" REF="407"/>
doubt whether out of hatred to this Kings severe proceedings, they did not repre∣sent K. <HI>William</HI>'s cruelty and severity much greater than it was; for tho' I grant after this time, he turned a great many more of the English Nobility and Gentry out of their Estates, and put divers of them to death; yet whether he did this without any colour of Law or Legal Process, is very much to be doubted, since we find many forfeitures mentioned in Doomesday book, which had been needless if the King had seised all the English Estates without any Legal Tryal;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I. A. A.</HI> p. 100, 101.</NOTE> as for example, in <HI>Essex,</HI> in <HI>Barnstable</HI> hundred. <HI>In Burâ de istis Hidis est una de hominibus soris sactis erga Regem</HI>; and this was the way of expression in the Active Voice; we find in <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>folk,</HI> Earl <HI>Ralf</HI> held such Lands <HI>Quando se foris fecit</HI>; But more particularly in <HI>Cambridgeshire</HI> in <HI>Wardune, Hardwin</HI> holds of <HI>Richard</HI>'s Ancestors, but <HI>Ralf Waders</HI> held it, <HI>Die quo deliqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> contra Regem</HI>; all which would never have been inserted, could this King have taken away mens Lives and Estates without any colour of Law or Justice, and there∣fore you may find in all the Historians of his time, that after the great Plot where∣in so many Norman as well as English Lords were concerned, and for which <HI>Ro∣ger</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford,</HI> and <HI>Ralph</HI> Earl of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI> both Normans, had conspired with Earl <HI>Waltheof</HI> and other English Lords to call in the Danes, and dispossess the King; yet they were convicted by a legal Tryal of their Peers, and suffered death for it; So that in this he distributed equal Justice to the Normans as well as the English, who thereupon forfeited all their Estates; and yet notwith∣standing this, there were some Native Englishmen still lest, who tho' they had been in Arms against the King, at the beginning of his Reign, yet were neverthe∣less reconciled to him, and restored to their Estates; as for ex∣ample,
<Q><HI>Ederic</HI> Sirnamed the Forester,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F.</HI> 636.</NOTE> who, as <HI>Florence</HI> of <HI>Worcester</HI> tells us, was reconciled to King <HI>William,</HI> and accompanied him in∣to <HI>Scotland</HI> soon after; as also <HI>Herward</HI> the Son of <HI>Leofric</HI> Lord of <HI>Brunne,</HI> who hav∣ing lost his Estate, and being Out-lawed, (as <HI>Ingulph</HI> tells us)</Q>
<Q>Took Arms against the King <HI>William,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 67, 68.</NOTE> and joyned himself with those in the Isle of <HI>Ely</HI>; and yet after divers great Battels, as well against the King as his Commanders, yet at length having obtained his Inheritance by the Kings allowance, he finished his <UNCLEAR>days</UNCLEAR> in Peace: and now here were two considerable English Barons which still enjoyed their Estates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I A. A. 105.</NOTE> notwithstanding all King <HI>William</HI>'s severity; and yet I do believe it will puzzle your Dr. to shew me their names in Doomesday-book; so that that Book alone is not it seems a certain Rule to discover what Englishmen were then Barons or Tenants in <HI>Capite.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But admit all this to be true as you your self have represented it, can this Kings perjury to his Subjects, and breach of all Laws, after so many solemn Oaths; give him a right as a Conqueror over the Lives and Estates of his English Subjects▪ and that after he had solemnly renounced his Right of Conquest, by so many so∣lemn transactions with his Subjects, with whom you suppose he still made War, after he had for so many years laid down his arms, at this rate I cannot tell when subjects may be safe; for let Kings that come to a Crown by a mixt title, partly by force, and partly by right, take never so many Oaths, to maintain the ancient consti∣tution of the Government, together with the Rights and Priviledges of the People; 'tis but his saying afterwards, when he hath sufficient power, that they were forced
<PB N="764" REF="408"/>
upon him, and that he never designed to keep them, and his business is done, and he may then take away his Subjects Lives and Estates by this pretended right of Conquest whenever he pleases; nor does this only extend to himself alone, but to all his Heirs and Successors, who claim under that Title, let them take never so many Coronation Oaths, or make never so many Declarations to the contrary; since they all claim under the same divine Title of the Sword, that is, as you will have it, receive their Crowns immediately from God, and then can never forfeit them, let them tyrannise to the utmost degree imaginable; for you have provided them with two easie and pleasant excuses, that all promises are either broken or kept, and <HI>Stultám Sacramentum est Frangendum</HI>; and I cannot but smile to see what an excellent excuse you have found out, for all the breach of Oaths and Covenants, of those engaged in the late Civil Wars, since they might very well plead they had so many Royal Presidents for so doing, as sufficiently authorised it; unless you will have that to be Perjury in Subjects, which must be a Divine Prerogative in Kings.</P>
<P>And therefore let me tell you, I am very glad for your own sake, that there is no body here but you and I, since all the company would have cryed out, and said, that this way of arguing were to make open War, not only upon all the Laws and Priviledges of this Nation, but also to put the King and People in a state of War against each other; for if he once declares by such Overt Acts as these of King <HI>William</HI>'s, that he will not be tyed, neither by his Coronation Oath, nor by any Laws he has made, I doubt their Oaths of Allegiance will not long bind them neither, and they will be very ready to reply, that whatever power began, and is continued by force and violence, may also be cast off by the like means; and when a King and his People are brought once into this state, it is easie to foretell what will be the event; either he must turn out, or they must be all Slaves: and I wish it was not owing to such Jesuitical flattering Councils as this, that the King first lost the Affections of his People, and then his Crown: since Father <HI>Peters</HI> him∣self with the rest of the Jesuits, and Arbitrary Ministers of the Cabal, could never have instilled worse Principles than these; therefore I pray for the future either get better reasons or keep those to your self.</P>
<P>But God be thanked both King <HI>Iames</HI> and K. <HI>Charles</HI> the First, had much better thoughts of the Laws and Liberties of the Nation, since the former hath solemnly declared in a Preamble to the second Act of Parliament, in the first year of his Reign;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Iacobi. Cap.</HI> 2. <HI>Fol.</HI> 1157.</NOTE>
<Q>That not only the Royal Prerogative, but the Peoples security of their Lands, Livings and Priviledges, were secur∣ed and maintained by the antient fundamental Laws, Priviledges and Customs of this Realm; and that by the abolishing or altering of them, it was impossible, but that present confusion will fall upon the whole state and frame of this Kingdom.</Q>
And his Son was of the same opinion in his first declaration at the beginning of the late Wars.
<Q>The Law (says he) is the Inheritance of every Subject,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 28.</NOTE> and the only security he can have for his Life or Estate; and the which being neglected, or disesteemed (under what specious shew soever) a great measure of infelicity, if not irreparable confusion must without doubt fall upon them.</Q></P>

<P>If I had no love at all for the Government and Liberties of my Country, (as I thank God I have a great affection for both) yet should I not have the Im∣pudence
<PB N="765" REF="408"/>
to contradict the sense of two Kings, and a Parliament; neither have I so little value for those things which are the foundations of our happiness, as to desire they should be Sacrificed to an Arbitrary Power; nor on the other side have I so great a value for them, as to endeavour their preservation by Rebellion, and deposing the King, which since I look upon as altogether unlawful, we are then to follow the Apostles Rule, and not do Evil that Good may come of it: but as for what I have urged in excuse of the Conquerors Perjury, and breach of Laws, I confess I have said more than the matter will well bear, but I hope you will excuse it; since I confess the argument is none of mine, but the Doctors from whom I borrowed it, and I did not consider the bad consequences of it; yet this much I must still freely affirm that neither King <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, nor his present Majesty, who is his heir by an Hereditary Right of Succession, either could then, or can now at this day be lawfully resisted, much less can be deposed, or can forfeit their Royal Dignity for any Male administration or Tyranny what∣soever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray give me your reason for that, since I think you may be very well sa∣tisfied, that this Kings Title by Conquest from King <HI>William</HI> his Ancestors can sig∣nifie nothing, tho' I should grant the utmost you can demand: and therefore tho' I am as much against Rebellion and Deposing of Princes as you can be, and doing of evil that good may come of it; yet the question remains still to be deci∣ded between us, whether that resistance I maintain be Rebellion or not, and whe∣ther it be Treason to deny obedience to a Prince, who hath done his utmost to lose the very name of King▪ by not observing those conditions on the perfor∣mance of which he can only keep his Royal Dignity: now since I think I have fully proved the two Points I undertook, (<HI>viz.</HI>) both that of the Kings forfeiting the Crown in the cases I have put, as also that of the matter of Fact, whereby you would maintain that the King has an indeseasable Right to the Crown of this Realm, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as an Absolute Monarch by the Conquest: now since you decline argu∣ing this Point any farther, because you find it is not to be maintained, pray let me know what other reasons you have why you cannot come over to my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though I am not yet satisfied, but that a great deal more may be farther urged by those who are better versed in this controversie, to prove that his Majesty hath an unforfeitable Right to our Allegiance by the Conquest of King <HI>William</HI> and his Predecessors; yet I shall not now insist any longer upon that Title, which tho' our Kings have by so many gracious condescentions to the People of this Nation, seemed to wave, yet have they never renounced it as I know of; but since his Majesty was setled in the Throne as an Absolute and Lawful King, without any Competitor, by a long series of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Hereditary Succession of above six hundred years standing, and confirmed by the Oaths of Allegiance of the People of this Nation both to him and his Ancestors, he is not only our King by the Laws of Man, but God also; to whom, and not to the People, he owes his Crown; and can therefore neither forfeit it, nor be accountable to them for it; and when you can prove the contrary you may then convince me to be of your opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have already partly argued this Point at our third and fourth discourses, concerning the lawfulness of resistance, but since perhaps you may have still somewhat farther to urge upon so important a question, I desire to hear the ut∣most you can say, to prove that Kings owe their Crowns to none but God, and
<PB N="766" REF="409"/>
therefore ought never to be resisted, neither can forfeit their Crown upon any pretence whatsoever, and therefore pray appoint me some other time when I may wait on you again, and fully discuss this Point, since it is now very late.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry I cannot appoint you any certain time, for since I see so great a confusion reigns every where, and that there is like to be no Term, and conse∣quently no business for men of my Profession, I am resolved to retire for two or three months into the Country, till I see things a little better setled than they are at present, and I heartily wish that the Convention (which I hear is like to meet in some time) may endeavour the Peace and Settlement of the Nation, by sending for the King and the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> out of <HI>France</HI>; since I do not desire any more Conquests, nor the Government of a Foreign Prince, as long as we have a lawful King of our own, who will govern us again if he might, but as soon as I re∣turn to Town you shall be sure to know it; In the mean time I am your Servant.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>BEing almost arrived at the end of my intended design, I thought fit to let you know, that I hoped to have made this the last Discourse, that I should have troubled the World with upon these Subjects; but when I came to reduce my Notes into form, I found that these few sheets would not contain all that could well be said on either side upon the foregoing questions; and therefore am forced to refer what remains to be said concerning the Vacancy of the Throne, and Their Present Majesties Title thereunto till the next Dialogue, which I intend shall be the last; And which I should not have drawn to that length, had it not been for the benefit of those Gentlemen and others, who have not Time or Money to buy or peruse the vast quantity of Pamphlets that have been written upon these Subjects; as also that such as have perused them, may find together in this and the following Discourse, all that hath been urged on the one side or other upon these important Subjects.</P>
<P>And since the great number of Treatises of this kind, have ra∣ther served to confound than instruct ordinary Readers, I resolved to make use of the words of very few of them, only to take the chiefest and strongest Arguments on either side, and fairly to re∣present them at once to the Readers View, who I hope hath the discretion to judge which are best, since I declare I write for no
<PB REF="411"/>
Party but purely for Truth; and therefore I have now, and shall still endeavour to avoid all Personal Reflections in this as well as the ensuing Dialogue, not only on Their Present Majesties, but also on King <HI>James,</HI> since I remember he was a Crowned Head, and is still the Father of our Illustrious Queen, let his failings have been what they will.</P>
<P>But I hope the Reader will not be scandalized, if I have so far followed the opinions of the ablest Divines as well as Lawyers, of this and other Nations, in making one of the Parties in this Dia∣logue assert the consent of the People, us the only just and natural means of conferring a just right to Civil Power, since the learned Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> in his first book of Ecclesiastical Policy lays it down as a Principle,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. 70.</HI></NOTE> that in every Politick Society<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t is impossible that any should have compleat, lawful Pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y the consent of men, or the immediate appointment of God; and Chancellor <HI>Fortescue</HI> in his Discourse <HI>de Laudibus Legum Angliae,</HI> (<HI>12,</HI> and <HI>13.</HI> Chapters) supposes all Kingly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow∣er, as well what is Absolute, as that which is Politick or limited by Laws, to have proceeded at first from the <HI>Peoples consent,</HI> not that the Power it self is otherwise than from <HI>God,</HI> only he has made use of the <HI>People</HI> as an Instrument whereby to convey it; and I hope none of those who are still for King <HI>James</HI>'s Interest will be offend∣ed at this Doctrine, since those that have writ with the greatest Iudgment for his absolute indefeasible Title to the Crown, have pla∣ced it in his <HI>Legal Right</HI> to it, by the <HI>Laws</HI> of the Land, which all must own, could not have been made without the <HI>Peoples Consent.</HI></P>
<P>I have but one thing more to desire of you, which is your Patience and Attention, if some of the Speeches in this Dialogue are longer than ordinary, since they are upon subjects that would not well bear interruption; and to tell you farther, the Press staying for the Sheets, I had not time to make them shorter.</P>

<HEAD>THE Eleventh Dialogue BETWEEN Mr. <HI>MEANWELL</HI> a Civilian, AND Mr. <HI>FREEMAN</HI> a Gentleman.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>DEar Sir, you are welcome to Town, you have been absent a long time, and indeed I wonder how you could stay away so long, when such grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> things, as the King to have <HI>Abdicated,</HI> and pla∣cing his Son and Daughter in the Throne have been transacted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you kindly Sir, but yet I must tell you, that I have been so little satisfied with what your Convention has done in these matters, that the very hearing of it hath been a great affliction to me, and it would have certain∣ly been a much greater, had I been upon the place and seen such horrid things as the Deposition of a King, the disinheriting of his right Heir, and the setting up the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange,</HI> who certainly could have no right to the Crown as long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the King lives, nor yet after his death as long as the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> is in being.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess these are very high Charges if they would hold, but if you please to consider the Hypothesis I proposed at our last Meeting, That the King had by breach of the Original Contract made between his Ancestors and Predecessors, and the People of this Nation, to observe the Fundamental Laws and Constitu∣tions of the Kingdom, forfeited his Right to the Crown: All that hath been done in this great Affair, I suppose may be very well maintain'd and justified from the necessity of the thing, and of maintaining the Fundamental Constitu∣tion of the Government; and therefore pray give me leave to put you in mind how far I have proceeded in the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this Assertion: First, I have made out that the King of this Real<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is not the sole Supreme Power thereof, neither ever was so from the very Institution of Kingly Government in this Island.</P>
<P><PB N="772" REF="412"/>Secondly, I have also prov'd that the King, not having the sole Power, must hold that share thereof which he enjoys upon this imply'd or tacit condition, that if he usurp, what do's not belong to him, and the People do assert their Right by opposing his Unjust Violence and Usurpations, and that he still obstinately persists in this Violation, he certainly thereby loses, and forfeits not only that part of the Power which he so unjustly usurped, but also his own too; and for this I gave you the Authority of the Learned <HI>Grotius</HI> at our last Meeting.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I have also answered your main Argument of King <HI>William</HI> the Con∣querors obtaining by the Sword, and Conquest▪ of King <HI>Harold</HI> an Absolute Right, and uncondition'd Power fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself and his Successor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> descended from him, over the People of this Kingdom; for I think I have sufficiently made out, that King <HI>William</HI> had no other Right to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> than by the Te∣stament of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, and the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection and Recognition of the People; and this I have prov'd from the unexceptionable Authorities of the best Historians of that Time; so that if he afterwards acted otherwise, and contrary to his Coronation Oath, it was not as a Lawful King, but as a Tyrant and an Usurper on the Rights and Liberties of the People, and could not by his own Unjust Act acquire any Lawful Power so to Govern this Kingdom; and there∣fore whatever Title King <HI>William</HI> or his Successors can pretend to, it must be by vertue of the Election of the first King of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Line, from whom all the Kings of <HI>England</HI> since <HI>Henry Y.</HI> are descended, and consequently a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e oblig'd to hold the Crown under the same Conditions on which it was first conferr'd: And tho' I grant, that ever since the Reign of <HI>Edward I.</HI> the Crown has been no longer claim'd by Election, but by Succession of him that really was or else was presum'd to be the Right Heir; yet this different way of ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uiring the Crown do's not at all alter the condition or manner of holding it, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Kings have always after that time as before been, tyed to the same, or rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cter Ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in their Coronation Oaths, to observe and keep the Laws and Customs of this Realm; and also that the Power of the Great Council of the Kingdom or Parliament making Laws, raising Taxes, and redressing of Grievances arising <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Unjust Exercise, and Illegal Encroachments of the Kings Prerogative, hath been exerted ever since the Crown became Elective, as much as ever it was before.</P>
<P>Lastly; I think I have sufficiently made out that King <HI>Iames</HI> hath violated the Fundamental Constitution of the Kingdom, in those several Instances I have al∣ready given, and am also ready farther to make it out if you require it; so that this being the case, I can see no reason to the contrary, why the Crown or Le∣gal Authority should not become forfeited to the People who at first conferr'd this Power on the first King of the West <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess you have done your indeavour to prove those Assertions you have now laid down, but I am not yet satisfied that you truly have done it: But however, not to run into unneccessary disputes, and repetition of what has been already argued, and which I see you are too obstinate to recede from, I shall now only oppose what you last asserted concerning the Crown's being forfeited to the People upon the King's pretended Breach of the Original Con∣tract; for besides the absurdity of making the Crown forfeitable to the People, who are and ever were Subjects, and not Princes or Governours; whereas all
<PB N="773" REF="412"/>
forfeitures still supposed a Right in the persons who are to take it as superior to the party forfeiting; there is also a greater error and mistake in your sup∣posing all Civil and Legal Power to be deriv'd from the People, and by them conferr'd upon their Kings or Governours; whereas the Scriptures plainly af∣firm, and all Divines so interpret them, that all Civil Power and Authority is wholly from God, and not from the people, who even in Elective Kingdoms, though they may name and design the Person whom they will have to be their King, yet is the Power wholly from God, who alone hath right to Govern Mankind; and therefore as the people do not confer the Power, so neither can it be forfeitable to them from whom it was never derived; and so much I told you at the Conclusion of our last Meeting, though I had not then time fully to urge this Argument, as now I have; and this will press the more upon you, because you your self have already granted at several Meetings, that all Civil and Regal power is deriv'd from God, and not from the people; and therefore your notion of a Prince or Monarchs forfeiting to them, is wholly false and precarious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this be all that you have to object against our Assertion of the King's forfeiting his Royal Authority to the people, I think I can easily answer those Objections; for as to the first absurdity which you lay to our charge, how an Authority can be forfeited by a King or Superior to his Subjects or Vassals, the absurdity lies on your side; for I do not suppose this forfeiture to be made to the people as Subjects, but to them consider'd as a Community of Masters of Families, and Freemen, who as the Descendants and Representatives of those who made the first King upon a certain Contract, or Condition upon the non-performance of this Original Contract, do thereupon cease to be Subjects, as a Servant ceases to be so, and becomes again <HI>sui furis</HI> upon his Masters non-per∣formance of the bargain made between them; and so this Authority thus for∣feited, returns to the Community of Masters of Families and Freemen, who once conferr'd it upon the first King; nor needs this forfeiture any more sup∣pose a Superiority in the persons who are to take it over the Prince that com∣mits it, than when by the Law of <HI>England</HI> Tenant for Life aliens in Fee, He in reversion may immediately enter upon the Estate as forfeit∣ed to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Cook up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Litt.</HI> p. 251.</NOTE> though the person that held it was perhaps his own Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is not this then to recede from your former conces∣sion, whereby you grant that Civil Authority is deriv'd from God, and not from the people at all, whereas you now suppose them the only Original or Foun∣tain of Civil Authority, and from them to be deriv'd to all Princes and Mo∣narchs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>This difficulty wholly proceeds from your not rightly understanding the manner of God's conferring Civil Power or Authority upon those that ex∣ercise it: For the better clearing of which difficulty, pray let me ask you two or three Questions; First, pray tell me whether you are still of the Op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion that Monarchy is so much of Divine Institution, as that no Government but that may be lawfully Instituted by Men?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not now affirm, that Monarchy is of Divine Right; but this much I may safely over, by what we can find in Scripture, that God instituted
<PB N="774" REF="413"/>
no sort of Government but that; and he did not make <HI>Saul</HI> or <HI>David</HI> to be only like those Equivocal Kings, who might be deposable at the will of the Estates, but conferr'd part of his own Divine Power upon them without any conditions or limitations whatsoever; but as for those Governments call'd Common-wealths, though without doubt they are not of Divine Institution, yet certainly the power of Life and Death which they exercise, is wholly from God; since, as I have already said, a Man not having power over his own life, cannot confer that upon another which he had not in himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am glad we are so far agreed, that Common-wealths are en∣dued with real Authority or Majesty as well as Monarchs, and that from no less Author than from God himself; so that whatever you have said concerning God's Institution of no other Government than Monarchy, is either not true, or not to the matter in hand; for in the first place, I have already prov'd at our thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Meeting, that the first Government God Instituted among the Jews, was an Aristocra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, under <HI>Moses, Ioshua,</HI> and the Judges, reserving the Kingly Power over them to himself: And though it is likewise true, that God di∣vested himself of great part of this Kingly Power when he anointed <HI>Saul</HI> King, yet God's Institution of Monarchy among the Jews, do's not render it unlawful for other Nations to institute such other sorts of Government as may best suit with the Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius of the people, and the publick good and safety of the whole Community: But as for your Argument whereby you would prove the neces∣sity of all Civil Powers being deriv'd from God, because otherwise they could not be endu'd with the power of life, and death over their Subjects; I have suf∣ficiently taken off that difficulty at our second Meeting, and shewn you, that a Man in the state of Nature has not only power over another Man's life, but also over his own; not only to hazard it, but also to lay down or lose it for some greater publick benefit to Mankind, which is also acknowledged by the A∣postle <HI>Paul</HI> himself, <HI>For a good man some would even dare to die.</HI></P>
<P>But further, to shew you the absurdity of this Principle, let me put you this case; suppose that a Kingdom or Common-wealth were so instituted at the first, that no Subject, or Freeman should suffer death for any Crime how great soever, which that I do not suppose as a thing impossible it was, for divers Ages exercised in the <HI>Roman</HI> Common-wealth, wherein no Civil Magistrate could lay any greater punishment upon a <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Citizen,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Grot. An∣not. in Mat. cap. p.</HI> 125. <HI>Vid. LL. Will.</HI> 1.</NOTE> than banishment or deportation: And if that Copy we have of the Laws of King <HI>William</HI> the first, be authentick, it is by the 67th Law in his Charter ordain'd, That no English or French Subject should suffer death for any Crime whatsoever, but only be punisht either by pecuniary Fines, Imprisonment, or else by loss of Ryes Hands, Feet, or Members, which Law, though I do not say was ever observ'd; yet it shews it was then supposed to be both possible and lawful. Now if this could be so, there would be no necessity of supposing the Autho∣rity of the Common-wealth of <HI>Rome,</HI> or of King <HI>William I.</HI> to have been de∣riv'd from God, since they had renounced and refused the great Character thereof; <HI>viz.</HI> the inflicting capital punishments; but if for all that, they still con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inued to be Lawful Civil Governments, then it is evident that this power of life, and death, is not that which alone constitutes a Civil Power, and makes it owe its Original to God.</P>
<P><PB N="775" REF="413"/>But to return to what your notion concerning this power of life and death hath made me digress from, pray let me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sk you another Question; After the Expulsion of King <HI>Tarquin,</HI> and before the Common-wealth of <HI>Rome</HI> was form'd, where was the Supream Authority lodged?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why in the same Body it was afterwards the people of <HI>Rome,</HI> compre∣hended under the <HI>Patritions</HI> and <HI>Plebtians,</HI> that is, the Nobility and Commons, who yet retained the power of life and death over those of their own Chil∣dren and Slaves, though they communicated a great part of their power to the Senate and Consuls.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well; Was this Authority they so conferr'd on the Senate and Consuls the same which they themselves could have exercised? or was it any new Authority immediately deriv'd from God, and created for that purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not think it was any new created Authority, but only a part of their former power, which they so made over to the Senate and Consuls, since they reserv'd one great part of it, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Legislative Power wholly in themselves; but however, this power which the Fathers of Families, and Free∣men among the <HI>Romans</HI> had over the lives of their Children, and Slaves, as also over others who were declar'd publick Enemies, was deriv'd wholly from God; yet there arose likewise a new power which these Fathers of Families were not invested with before, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that of making Laws, as also of War and Peace; all which powers were deriv'd from God for the common good, and defence of the whole People or Community.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Herein I also agree with you, but then mark what follows; it then plainly appears, that the natural Subject of Civil Authority was the Fathers of Families, and Freemen of <HI>Rome</HI>; and that what share thereof was com∣mitted to the Senate and Consuls, it was wholly personal, and as their Repre∣sentatives; this being so, pray answer me another Question; when the Senate and People of <HI>Rome</HI> did afterwards confer their whole power upon the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors by that Law (mention'd in your Institutions) <HI>Lex Regi</HI> was there then created or produc'd any new Authority from God to the first Emperor? or was it the same Authority or Majesty which the Senate and People were endued with before▪ for either it must be the same, or else God must create a new parcel of this Royal Majesty or Authority wherewith to endue this first Emperor, which if you suppose, I can shew you a great many difficulties and absurdities that will follow from this Opinion; for then I might ask you, whether this Royal Majesty be like the Stoicks <HI>Anima mundi,</HI> whose parts are distributed among all the Kings in the World? or whether each King has his particular Majesty to himself? or whether the King dying, his Majesty also dies with him? or whether it exist without him, as the Soul do's when separated from the Body, and by a certain kind of Metempsychosis is transferr'd to the new Monarch?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not flick at present to affirm, that this Authority or Majesty of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors was originally deriv'd from God, though not immediately, but by the mediation of the people of <HI>Rome</HI> as his Instruments, especially or∣dain'd for the derivation of this Imperial power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I see you and I are at last agreed; for I suppose all Civil
<PB N="776" REF="414"/>
power to be so deriv'd from God to the people, and by them as an Instru∣mental Cause convey'd to the person whom they agree to make their King: But if this were so in the <HI>Roman</HI> Common-wealth, why are not all the rest of the Nations of the World indued with the like priviledge; so that no man may justly make himself King over them without their Election, or Recognition at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps in those Nations where the people have from the first Insti∣tution of the Government retain'd the whole Civil power in themselves, or else by the Extinction of the Royal Family they became possest of it; this power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y afterwards by them be transferr'd or made over to one single per∣son or more; but this can by no means hold in divers other cases, where God immediately bestows a Civil Power or Authority without the consent of the people, as it is in the case of Kingdoms acquired by a Conquest in a Just War, (for as to Unjust Wars, or Conquests, I freely own they confer no Right at all) but since you will not (I suppose) deny that such a Rightful Conquest con∣fers an Absolute power on the Conqueror over the Lives and Estates of the Conquered, as also an Obligation in them to submit to, and obey the Con∣queror, hence must arise a new Civil power without any consent of the people intervening; which Authority, since no man can confer it upon him∣self, must necessarily be immediately conferr'd by God; since, as I said before, the people are only passive, and have no hand at all in the conveying of it; and this is the more remarkable, because I suppose you will not deny, but that where one Kingdom or Empire has owed its beginning to the Election or Consent of the people, I could name ten that have begun from Conquest: So that it is evident, the people are very rarely the Efficient Causes of Civil power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though this Question concerning Conquest do's not immediately concern our Kings, who, as I have already proved, do not owe their Regal Au∣thority to Conquest, but to the consent of the People: Yet since the Title to a great part of our Kings Dominions begun at first from Conquest, I shall now say something of it: First, then you grant that only Conquest in a just War can confer a Right to the Peoples obedience. And therefore since the greatest part of the Governments have commenced from unjust Conquests; it will therefore follow that the Right of such Princes to those Kingdoms Terri∣tories so unjustly acquired, could not owe its Original to Conquest; but either to a long possession, the Extinction, or at least Dereliction of the right Heirs; together with the consent of the People to confirm their Titles. So that it is not only my Opinion, but that of the most Learned Writers in your own fa∣culty, such as <HI>Grotius</HI> and <HI>Pufendo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f</HI>; that Conquest alone, though in the justest War can confer no Right over a Free People without their recognition or con∣sent; I have added, <HI>of a Free People</HI> because I much doubt, upon the Con∣quest of a Kingdom or Territory (as for example) where the People do own themselves meer slaves to their Sultan: Whether their consents be at all necessary or not, since they fall to the Victor as the movable goods of the Prince Conque∣red; But then the Power he has over them is not properly a Civil Authority, but that of a Lord over his Slaves. And hence it is that in all Kingdoms and Territories obtained by Conquest among us in <HI>Europe,</HI> Princes do not think
<PB N="777" REF="414"/>
themselves to have any Title to their Subjects Allegiance before they have ac∣knowledged them for their Lawful Soveraign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by some publick Act either of the Estates or Representatives of the Kingdom; or else by the particular Oaths of all the chief Subjects or Inhabitants of those places.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not at present dispute this point any farther with you, but yet there remains one great difficulty behind concerning the manner of Gods con∣ferring this Supream Power upon Princes, and States: For you your self have already granted that the Power of Fathers and Masters of Families is not of the kind, but somewhat specifically different from Civil Power or Authority: And if so, since they had not this Civil Power in themselves, I cannot see how they could confer it upon another; since <HI>nemo dat quod non habet.</HI> And there∣fore there still seems a necessity of Gods conferring a new Power upon that Prince, or upon those Persons whom they shall pitch upon to Rule over them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I shall as easily remove this difficulty if you will please to con∣sider the manner how God confers this Civil Authority upon men, which is certainly by Natural Means, and is to be found out by Natural Reason with∣out any Divine Revelation; since Civil Government was instituted, and men were obliged to obey it long before the old Testament was written:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Pufendorf de Iure Gen∣tium. l.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 7.</NOTE> But the true Original of it is thus to be traced. First, It is without doubt that right Reason sufficiently taught Mankind when it began to multiply, and that they were sen∣sible from the great wickedness and corruptions of mens Na∣tures that their common peace and safety could not be well maintained unless Common-Wealths were instituted, which could not subsist without a Supream Authority placed in some one, or more persons. This being a dictate of the Law of Nature or Right Reason, and so highly conducing to the good of Mankind; it must needs owe its Original to God the Author of all Truth, and the Giver of every good and perfect Gift: From whence it follows, that not only the Institution of Common-Wealths themselves, but also the Supream Power with which they are indued, do's not proceed meerly from men, but from Gods command exprest by the Law of Nature or Right Reason. So that the same Legislator who first prescribed Civil Society, also prescribed the order of that Society; but a Supream Civil Authority either in one or more persons, is the Life and Soul thereof; without which it cannot Live or Subsist.</P>
<P>Now it is certain that those things are not only said to proceed from God, which he immediately Institutes without any human act intervening; but those also which men by the conduct of Right Reason, and according to their pre∣sent occasions and necessities have introduc'd to fulfil that Obligation that lay upon them to promote the common good and safety of Mankind; and since in a promiscuous ungoverned multitude, that great Law of Nature which pre∣scribes the publick Peace and Concord of Mankind cannot well be exercised, (the unruliness of mens passions considered) nor be well maintain'd without some Supream Civil Authority to keep men in order; it is plain, that God who enjoyn'd men this, do's also command that Civil Societies should not be only Instituted, but their Authority also obeyed, as derived from himself, and

as the necessary means of obtaining this great end of all the Laws of Nature, the common good and safety of Mankind; and hence it is that he hath not any where prescribed or instituted any particular Form of Government, but leaves the choice of it to the particular Genius and Temper of each Nation and People.</P>
<P>This being setled, your Objection is easily answered, how Civil power can be conferr'd without an immediate conferring of it from God, since the people in the state of Nature had it not before; which proceeds from your not consi∣dering, that this Supream Authority is not like the Soul of Man, an immate∣rial form, that gives knowledge and understanding to the Body, and may be separated from it; but is only a moral quality which may be produc'd by the mutual consent of those that institute it, as the productive cause thereof, tho' they had it not formally in themselves before, just as from many Voices sing∣ing in Consort, though in different Tones there arises a Harmony, which was not in any single Voloe alone: Therefore since Civil Authority proceeds from the non-resistance of the Subjects, and their Concession that the Supream Powers should freely dispose of their Bodies and Goods for the publick safet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it plainly appears, that in each particular Master of a Family and Freeman there lay (though hidden and disperst) the seeds or rudiments of Supream Power, which by mutual Compacts did afterwards grow into a perfect Civil Authority; And thus not only many Masters of Families and Freemen may combine together for their mutual safety to er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct a Common-wealth by ap∣pointing one or many men to rule over them for their mutual safety; but it is not impossible, but that from the Government of a Master of a Family, having many Villages and Slaves under his power, there may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perfect King∣dom; for though Paternal power do's chiefly respect the Education of Chil∣dren, and that of a Master, the Government of Servan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, for his own advan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; yet is there not so great a distance between the power of a Master of a Family and Civil Authority, that there can be no passing from one to the other, without a new Authority immediately created by God for that purpose; for suppose a Master of a Family, having a numerous train of Children and Ser∣vants, should permit both of them by way of emancipation, or manumission, to enjoy such a portion of Lands, or other Goods to their own use, as also to Govern their own private Families and Affairs as they shall think fit, pro∣vided they will still obey him, and contribute the utmost assistance of their Lives and Fortunes for the publick safety, I cannot see any thing that would be wanting to the making such a Master of a Family a lawful and absolute Prince, provided he was endued with such power as to be able to protect them; yet all this while, without supposing any new Divine Authority to be infused by God upon his accession to this Dignity.</P>

<P>Here I do freely own, that where the People have parted with their whole Pow∣er either to a Monarch or else to a Supream Council or Senate, from thenceforth they have nothing at all to do to call such Governours to an Account, or to punish them for the highest Tyranny or Oppression they can commit: The utmost I have allowed as lawful to be done in this case in all the Conversations we have had, is no more than this▪ That the People, in case they see them∣selves like to be destroy'd and ruin'd both in their Perso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Consciences and Estates, may even under the most Absolute Governments stand upon their own defence, and prevent their being thus totally ruined; and may also cast off all Allegiance to such Powers, in case they refuse to treat them with greater justice and moderation for the future<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But as for such limitted or mixt Governments as ours are, where the People have still retain'd a share in the Legislature, and also in the raising of publick Taxes, yet since the King is by Law exempted from punishment or rendring any account of his Actions either to the People or their Representatives; the utmost that I contend for, is, that since the King receives only a Limited Power of ruling according to such and such Laws, and will Usurp that share of the Government that do's not belong to him; In such cases if he refuse to amend, then they may re∣sist his Officers and Ministers, nay himself in Person in the executions of such Violent and Illegal Actions: And if he still prsist, and rce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use to amend; that then at last they may proceed to Declare that he hath forfeited his Crown or Regal Right of Ruling over them: And then in such Case, I hold that it again devolves to the People from whom it first proceed∣ed; and that this is no new Doctrine; I have the Authority of <HI>Fortescut</HI> on my side;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> who in his Treatise <HI>De Laudibus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Legum Angliae,</HI> Where after having shewn that all Poli∣tical or Limited Governments proceeded at first from the consent of the People, proceeds thus; Addressing himself to Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> Son of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VI.

<P>I do now very well understand your Hypothesis, but I think Princes are not thereby in a better condition by being thus unaccountable to, and unpunishable by the people? But that they are father in a much worse; since you say they may resist, nay kill them when they are once entered into a state of War against them: For whereas where Princes are accountable to their People or Senate, they may then be admitted to be heard to make their defence in case of any Oppression or Misgovernment laid to their charge: As the King of <HI>Poland</HI> may at this day, to the great Assembly of Estates or Dye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Nation. Whereas in the case of the King, as you have put it, though he is not accountable to the Parliament, yet he is still lyable to that which is more dangerous, (<HI>viz.</HI>) To be Judged, Censured and Declared forfeit by every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsiderable fellow of the Rabble, on pretence of violating this Original Contract, and having broken the fundamental constitution of the Government; and so shall be condemned unheard, and perhaps without any just cause.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>The men of your Principles I see are not to be pleased, unless Princes may do whatever they have a mind to without controul; or any mans judg∣ing or opposing the Illegality of their Actions. For if a Parliament takes upon its self to judge of the Kings Actions, this is calling their Princes to an Account, and a thing against the Laws of the Land▪ as also that of Nations. If the whole Body of the People take upon them to judge when he has violated the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, and broken the Original Contract, and thereupon resist him: This is making the King liable to be Judged and Censured by every mean fellow of the Rabble. But to let you see that both Judging and Disobeying the Kings commands, if contrary to Law, is not a thing of such dangerous consequence as you would make it, appears by the late Petition of the Seven Bishops, wherein they take upon them to Judge that the Kings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Declaration of Liberty of Conscience being against several Acts of Parliament, they cannot with a safe Conscience Publish it, or agree to the Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in the Churches. Now I desire to know whether this be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a making the Kings Actions liable to be Judged and Censured by every one of the Rabble, since these Bishops acted thus, neither as Privy Councel∣lors, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as Peers in Parliament<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for by the same right by which they took upon them to make this Declaration, by the same right not only every Curate of a Parish, but also every Layman in <HI>England</HI> was free to Judge of the Kings breach of this Law, and consequently of denying obedience thereunto; which disobedience, if it once prove general, will quickly make the Kings per∣sonal commands wholly insignificant. So that it seems it is not the People<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judging of the Illegality of the King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Actions and Commands which is the thing you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fault with since when these Bishops acted thus, all the high men of the Church of <HI>England</HI> praised it to the Skie. So that it seems it is now the bare Censuring and Disobedience that makes it a crime, but it is the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sisting such Violent and Illegal orders and commands, and at last Declaring that Power void and forfeited by which they were made. That sticks in
<PB N="781" REF="416"/>
your stomach, which is as much as to say, that this Judging and Disobedi∣ence in its self is no Crime; but the pushing it home, and doing it in such a way as that it may be mended for the future; though this is never lawful to be done, but when things come to that extremity that all milder remedies are become ineffectual.</P>
<P>But to answer your Objections a little more closely, the consequences of my Opinion are not so dangerous as you suppose them, if you will please to consider what I have already laid down at our last Meeting; As first, That this Resistance is never to be made but when this violent breach of the Laws becomes evident and undeniable not to the Rabble alone, but to the whole Nation, that is, all sorts and degrees or men; and as long as there is any question about it, I acknowledge it is by no means to be used: And lastly; As to declare the Regal Power forfeited, this likewise is never to be done, but when the King becomes so obstinately resolved to pursue those evil and illegal co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, as that he is utterly irreclaimable, and refuses all propo∣sitions and terms of amending or redressing them: And as to what you say, that the King is hereby depriv'd of all means of justifying himself, or vindi∣cating his Actions; that is not so, since if a War be once begun, he may do this either by Declaration or Treaties, as King <HI>Charles</HI> the First did in his War with the Parliament, by which means he gain'd a great many both of the Nobility, Gentry and Commonalty to his Party, who were before abso∣lutely set against him: But if you will needs have a Parliament to Judge and examine the reality of this forfeiture, I so far joyn with you, that though every private man may first judge thereof, yet is it not become ab∣solute, and an Act of the whole People, till the Estates of the Kingdom have by some solemn Vote or Declaration made it so.</P>

<P>Well, I see you do all you can to make the best of a bad Cause; but though I think nothing of what you have said can give Subject<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any right to resist much less to cast off all Allegiance to their Natural Prince, yet I shall not now dispute this point any longer with you, but will proceed to the merits of the Cause, and shall l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you see, that even upon your own principles, the King has not been dealt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in all this whole transaction, either like an Ally by the States General of the United Provinces, or like a near Relation or a Son in-law by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> or like a King by his own Subjects. To begin with the Estates in the first place, it is apparent that they have acted treacherously with the King, and contrary to the last Treaty of Peace and Alliance, in furnishing the Prince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their Captain General and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-holder both with Ships, Men and Money, and make this late Expedition against <HI>England,</HI> without so much as ever declaring the cause of their Quarrel, or demanding any satisfaction, if any occasion of difference had been given.</P>
<P>But the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> his dealing with the King his Father-in law, has been much less justifiable; for in the first place, he is not only guilty of the same fault with his Masters the <HI>Dutch,</HI> in beginning a War without ever de∣claring the causes of it, or demanding any satisfaction, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eparation if he had been injur'd, till it was too late to go back, and that his Fleet was rea∣dy, and the Army shipt for the Expedition; but which was more unkind from a Nephew, and a Son-in-law who had reason to expect all the satis∣faction
<PB N="782" REF="417"/>
which a King, an Uncle and a Father-in-law could give; though indeed to speak the truth, the whole War was, in my Opinion, altogether unjust on the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nces side, since his chief pretences were▪ to redress Grievances, and to re-establish the Bishops and Church of <HI>England</HI> with the Colledges in their just Rights, and also restore the whole Nation to the just Execution of the Laws by a Free Parliament and Priviledges: Now I desire to know what the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>▪ had to do either as a Neighbour, or a Son-in-law▪ to concern himself with the Mis-government of the Affairs of <HI>England,</HI> much less to countenance and take the part of those many Male contents and Traitours, who have ever since the Duke of <HI>Manmouth</HI>'s Rebellion gone over into <HI>Holland</HI>▪ So that upon the whole matter I can find but one thing which he had, so much as a pretence of making War about, if it had been real, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the pretended suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Birth of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>; and yet even for this, he ought not to have made War till such time as all reasonable satis∣faction in this matter had been demanded and denied him; and that the next Parliament, which the King had before declared should meet in <HI>No∣vember</HI> last, had been either hindered from medling in it, or that they had fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d to make a due enquiry into it.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray Sir, before you come to consider what has been done here, give me leave to iustifie the late proceedings of the States General, and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> in this matter; First, as to the Estates; it is a very great mistake; for you affirm that they made this War upon the King in their own names, or furnish'd the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> with Ships or Men as their S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adt-holder or General, but, only as a free Independent Prince, whom they looked upon to have a good Cause of making War against the King, of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> as one they had great cause to believe was so far engag'd in the <HI>France</HI> interes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as instead of standing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in this War with the Empire, which they every day expected when he would joyn with <HI>France</HI>▪ and declare War against them, as they had reason to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear by several angry Memorials which the <HI>French</HI> King's E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>voy in <HI>Holland</HI> had not long before given them; so that indeed it was but according to the Rules of Self-preservation to begin first, especially when it might be done without their appearing in it at all<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but granting this War had been made in their own names, it had been but a just Return for what had been done to them before by the Late King who made actual War upon them without ever giving them the least notice, or demand∣ing satisfaction for any wrongs or damages receiv'd; and this was the more justifiable, because his present Majesty▪ when Duke of <HI>York,</HI> was looked upon to have a very great hand in those Councils, which begun that unhappy War, in which he himself serv'd as Admiral: But as to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> there is much more to be said in his justification; for in the first place, tho' in some respects he was a Subject, by living under, and enjoying divers Lands and Territories, and Commands within the Dominions of the United Pro∣vinces; yet as he is Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> he is a free independent Prince, and, as such, has a right of making War and Peace; and if so, all that is to be further enquired into, is, whether the Prince had any just cause of making War upon the King or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot; therefore to answer your first Objection against the Prince's making War upon an Uncle and a Father-in-law, without first demand∣ing
<PB N="783" REF="417"/>
satisfaction, and then denouncing War if he could not obtain it, I confess this were a good Objection, if you could once prove to me, that the Prince could have been sure to have had granted him whatever he could in reason de∣mand, both in respect of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> the security of the Protestant Religion, the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> and his own par∣ticular concerns in respect of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>; but whoever will impartially consider the Terms that the Prince and King were upon just before his coming over, will find that he was not obliged to give the King notice of his intentions, by first demanding satisfaction, and then denouncing War if it had been denyed, since the King might then have joyned his own with the French Fleet, and sent for French Forces into <HI>England</HI>; and then all that the Prince could have done in behalf of himself and the Nation, had been alto∣gether in vain. And then though I grant that such satisfaction ought to be demanded in most cases, yet will it not hold in this; where if the Prince had sooner discovered his designs, the King might have easily prevented them. And how near this was to have been put in Execution may appear by this, That Succours were actually offered by the French King; and if they were refused by ours, it was partly, because it was too late for the French Fleet to be then put out, and partly out of a Politick consideration, that besides the losing of the Hearts of his English Subjects, it might give the French such a footing here, that they would not be easily gotten out again. But indeed it seems as if the old formal way of making War was quite out of fashion; since <HI>Charles</HI> the Second made War against the <HI>Dutch</HI>; and the King of <HI>France</HI> so lately a∣gainst <HI>Spain,</HI> the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> and the Emperor without any Observation of those formalities.</P>
<P>But if we consider the Grounds and Causes of this War as they are set forth in the Princes late Declaration; they may be reduced to these three Heads.</P>
<P>First, The Restoration of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> with the Bishops and Col∣ledges to their just Priviledges.</P>
<P>Secondly, The securing of the Rights and Liberties of the Subject from the Dispensing Power, and those other Incroachments that had been made upon them by the partial Judgments of Popish, Ignorant, or Corrupt Judges.</P>
<P>And Lastly, The Enquiry into the Birth of the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> In all which the Prince was so reasonable, as to refer the decision of these diffe∣rences to the Judgment of a Free Parliament.</P>
<P>Now as for the first of these. That the Prince as a Neighbour, and of the same Religion with us, might justly secure the interest of the Protestant Religion here, and also redeem the Clergy from the persecution they lay under, is very evident: Since it has always been held lawful for Princes to take the part and espouse the interest of those of the same Religion with themselves, though Subjects to another Prince: Thus <HI>Eusibius</HI> makes it a good cause of War by the Emperor <HI>Constantine</HI> against <HI>Licinius,</HI> because he persecuted the Christians living under his Dominions: So likewise of later Ages Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> assisted the <HI>Dutch</HI> Protestants of the united Provinces, and those of <HI>France</HI> against the Persecutions and Oppressions they suffered from their own
<PB N="784" REF="418"/>
Princes: As to the <HI>French</HI> Protestants, King <HI>Charles</HI> the I. sent a Fleet and an Army to their Assistance in 1627.</P>
<P>But as to the next Head, the Oppressions we lay under in respect of our Civil Liberties, the Prince had as great, or rather greater right to vindicate these than the former. For <HI>Bodin</HI> and <HI>Barclay,</HI> though they suppose it unlaw∣ful for Subjects to take up Arms against their Prince, though never so highly Opprest; yet they count it not only lawful, but Generous and Heroick for a Neighbouring Prince to rescue injur'd and opprest Subjects from the Tyranny of their Kings. So that if the King had by his Dispensing Power, his Levy∣ing of Taxes without Law, and taking away the freedom of Elections for Parliament men, almost totally dissolved the Government, and brought it to the condition of an absolute Monarchy, it was high time for the Prince to put a stop to those Encroachments both in respect of his own particular interest, and also of the States whose General and Stad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>holder he is. Of the former, since if this Kingdom should once become of the Popish Religion by the means of a standing Army, and those other methods that have been taken to make it so (granting the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> to be truly born of the Queen) yet should he happen to die, the Popish faction here in <HI>England</HI> would in all likelihood debar the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> from their lawful Succession to the Crown; or at least would never admit them but upon conditions of esta∣blishing of Popery and Arbitrary Government in <HI>England</HI>; the former of which is as contrary to their consciences, as the latter is to their principles and inclinations.</P>
<P>So on the other side, if the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> be not the Queens true Son, he had certainly a much greater interest as the presumptive Heir of the Crown to demand satisfaction in that great point, which so nearly concerned their right of Succession: For then certainly they might justly demand satisfaction, especially when they desired no more but to have this business left to the inspection of the Estates of the Kingdom, as the only proper Judges of the same. For as to the Privy Council, who by the Kings command (though without any president) had taken upon them to hear and determine this mat∣ter; their Highnesses certainly had no reason to be satisfied with it, since, be∣sides the incompetency of the Judges, the King himself appeared too partial and interested in the affair for them, to set down by their Judgments. And as for what you say, that the Prince ought first to have tryed whether the King and Parliament would give him that satisfaction he demanded: This was ve∣ry dangerous for him to hazard; for supppose the King would never have permitted this affair to have been impartially inquired into by them, or that the Parliament had been (as it was very likely to be) packt and made up of Papists, Fanaticks, and Time-servers, who either would not, or else durst not have examined this matter as they ought: His Highness had been then to play an after-game the next year▪ and what might have happened in the mean time God knows. And therefore he had all the reason in the World whilst the <HI>French</HI> Kings Arms were imployed in <HI>Germany</HI> to demand satisfacti∣on with the Sword in his hand. This is what I have to say in justification of His Highnesses Arms, which if they are just on his side, I think I can as easi∣ly
<PB N="785" REF="418"/>
prove what has been done for his Assistance by the Nobility, Gentry and Commons of this Nation to have been so too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not any longer dispute, whether the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> may not make some fair pretences for what they have done; since ma∣king War for security, by way of Prevention, is no new thing in the World; though I confess what you say in respect of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> had been a sufficient cause of War, had there been any true grounds for that suspition; but since there was no just cause given why his Highness should suspect his Birth not to be Genuine; and that even in the present Convention it self, there could be no proof made to the contrary: I think it is now evident, that it was a wicked and unjust Calumny upon his Majesty and the Queen, since he him∣self in the last Paper he left behind him at his going away, <HI>Appeals to all that know him, nay, even to the Prince of</HI> Orange <HI>himself, that in their Consciences, neither he nor they can believe him in the least capable of so unnatural a Villany, nor of so little common Sence, to be impos'd on in a thing of such a nature as that.</HI></P>
<P>But as for those noble Men and Gentlemen, who have declar'd for the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> since his expedition, I think that they are no way to be justified, since granting them to have been satisfied, that the Princes demands were law∣ful and reasonable, yet sure they ought not to have taken up Arms on behalf of a Forreign Prince, against their Natural Sovereign; but if in their Consci∣ences they had believed his quarrel to have been just, the utmost they could have done, had been to have stood Neuters, without concerning themselves either with the one or the other party; and then if the Prince had gain'd his point either by Arms or Treaty, they might have enjoy'd the good ef∣fects of it, without breaking in upon the Church of <HI>Englands</HI> Principles of Passive Obedience and Non-resistance, and so many Acts of Parliament made; but as for those Officers and Souldiers, who so basely and perfidiously Deserted the King at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and ran over to the Princes Army with their Commissions in their pockets, they cannot possibly be justified either by the Law of the Land, or that of Nations, since certainly they acted contrary to both.</P>

<P>Before I speak any thing concerning the business of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> give me leave to say something in Justification of those Noblemen and Gen∣tlemen you so highly accuse; and though we Discoursed something of this matter at our last meeting, yet since you have again renewed the charge against them, I cannot but again vindicate them in what they have done; in the first place pray call to mind, that it has sufficiently appear'd by the small Forces his Highness brought over with him, that he never intended to Conquer this Kingdom, or impose any thing upon it, contrary to the known Laws and Cu∣stoms thereof; and therefore as appears by his Declaration, his chief hopes of Success against so Numerous an Army, made up of the flower of three Na∣tions, depended on that assurance he had of some Considerable Assistance from the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Eng.</HI> and perhaps from some of the Officers of the Kings own Army, and that this was lawful in both of them, I thus prove, you may remember I made out at our last meeting but one▪ that when the Nation lay un∣der any great intollerable Oppression, by reason of the violation of their Just Rights and Liberties, the Clergy Nobility, and Gentry thereof, did always look upon it as their Right and Duty, to vindicate the same by a vigorous Re∣sistance,
<PB N="786" REF="419"/>
when no gentler means could suffice: Secondly, I have proved that it neither was, nor could be the intent of those Oaths and Declarations made in the two first Parliamen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, to deliver up their Lives, Liberties and Estates wholly to the Kings Mercy, let him use them as he plea∣sed; and if they did not, it must necessarily follow, that upon the Kings Vi∣olation of their Religion, Liberties and Properties, they had still a Right left them to defend themselves from such Oppression and Tyranny: Lastly, I have also proved (as the Convention also lately declared) that the King by his exerci∣sing his Dispensing Power, by Committing and Prosecuting the Six Bishops, by setting up an Ecclesiastical Commission contrary to Law, by Levying Mony by his Prerogative, without, or contrary to express Acts of Parliament, and by Rai∣sing and keeping up a standing Army in time of Peace, Commanded by Offi∣cers, who had never taken the Test appointed by the Statutes for that purpose, and consisting of so many Popish Souldiers, who having never taken the Oath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Supremacy and Allegiance, were altogether uncapable of serving in his Majesties Army, and by doing divers other things contrary to the known Laws, Statutes, and Freedom of this Realm, too long now to particularize, had broken the Fundamental Constitution of the Kingdom. This being the Case, I desire to know of you, how it was possible for the Nation to have a firm and setled Redress of these Grievances, without a Free Parliament? Or how it was possible to obtain this Parliament (the late taking away of Charters and Regu∣lation of Corporations considered) unless those Obstacles had been first re∣moved? And how could they be removed, without some force proportionable to what the King had raised to hinder it I cannot tell? And therefore it is a very vain Project of yours, to suppose that those Noblemen and Gentlemen, should have stood Neuters, and not have declar'd themselves some way or other in this quarrel, which is all one, as to say, they ought to sit still, and see a Ge∣nerous Prince ruin'd, who had come in for their Redemption, and to have then expected a remedy for all these illegal Violations and Oppressions, when the King had kill'd or destroy'd the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and his Army, or that the King would then have yielded to all the same Conditions that the Prince, had demanded. This would have been not to have been parralel'd any where but in a Romance.</P>
<P>But as for those Officers and Souldiers who you say Deserted the King, and went over to the Prince from <HI>Salisbury</HI>; though I grant they make a great noise, yet were they not a Thousand Men, Soldiers, Officers, and all, (as I am Credi∣bly inform'd) which was but a small number, in comparison with the Kings whole Army; and yet these may very well be defended upon the same principles with the former; for if the Violations of our Liberties were so great and dangerous, as I have now set forth, those Gentlemen were certainly oblig'd to prefer the common Good, and Preservation of their Religion and Liberties, before any private interests or Obligations, whatsoever, though it were to the King himself; therefore it was more his than their fault, if they Diserted him; and as for their going away whilst they were his Souldiers, and with their Commis∣sions in their pockets; I suppose you cannot expect that the King should have ever given them leave to have quitted his Service, or have accepted of their Commissions, if they would have surrender'd them, unless at the same time he
<PB N="787" REF="419"/>
had clapt them up in prison for offering of it, and if then they were perswa∣ded that it was thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Duty so to do, it is but a Punctilio of Honour, whether they went away with their Commissions in their pockets, or had left them be∣hind them, since their going off, was a Surrender of their Commissions, and a sufficient Declaration, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at they could not with a safe Conscience, serve the King any longer in this quarrel; and you see that the going off of these few, had such a fatal effect, that it cast such a panick Terrour upon the King, and the whole Popish Faction about him, as to make him run away to <HI>London,</HI> with∣out striking a stroke: But that the Prince of <HI>D.</HI> with the Dukes of <HI>Grafton</HI> and <HI>Ormond,</HI> Lord <HI>Churchill</HI> were convinced of the danger this Kingdom was in, both in respect of their Religion and Liberties, appears by their leaving the King, and going over to the Prince, where they could never expect to be put into higher places of Honour or Trust, than what they enjoyed already under the King; and therefore that expression of the Lord <HI>Churchill</HI>'s, in his Letter to the King is very remarkable:
<Q>That he could no longer joyn with self-interested men, who had framed designs against His Majesties true Interest and the Protestant Religion, to give a pretence to Conquest to bring them to Effect.</Q>
And one would be very much inclin'd to believe so, considering the great number of <HI>Irish,</HI> Papists which have been brought over and listed here; though with the tur∣ning out and disbanding of a great many <HI>English</HI> Officers and Souldiers out of several Companies,</P>
<P>But to come to the business of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> which you say was a meer calumny, and an unjust suspition on the Princess side; though I will not affirm any thing positively in so nice a matter, since the Convention has not thought fit to meddle with it. I shall only say this much, that if there have been any jealousies and suspitions raised about it, the King may thank those of his own Religion, who were intrusted with the management of the Queens Lying-Inn: For in the first place it looked very suspicious to us Protestants, who do not put much faith in the Miracles of the Romish Church; that im∣mediately after the presenting of the Golden Angel to the Lady of <HI>Loretto,</HI> and the Kings Pilgrimage to St. <HI>Winifreds</HI> Well, the Queen after several years intermission, should again be with Child; and when she was so, should have two different Reckonings; Which though it may be forgiven Young Women of their first Children, yet those who have born so many Children as Her Majesty, are commonly more experienced in these matters.</P>

<P>What is all this to the purpose? Was it not proved by many credi∣ble Witnesses, and those of the Protestant Religion before the Privy-Coun∣cil, that they were not only present in the Room when the Queen was Deli∣vered; but that they had seen Milk upon Her Linnen before Her Delivery; and that they had also felt Her Belly immediately before it, and found that Her Majesty was Big with Child, and ready to be Delivered: And the Mid∣wife Swears that she actually Delivered Her. So that since every person is to be presum'd to be the true Son of those Parents that own him for theirs; So nothing but a direct proof to the contray, and that by undenyable Evi∣vidence ought to make any Man believe otherwise; much more in the concern of the Heir apparent to the Crown, and therefore I know not what
<PB N="788" REF="420"/>
you would have to been done, which has not been observed, in this nice matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>And Sir, let me tell you, because it was so nice a matter, and con∣cerned no less than the Succession of Three Kingdoms: therefore the whole Nation as well as the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> were to be fully satisfied of the reality of the Princes Birth; since they were all suffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iently sensible that there wanted nothing but a Male Heir to entail Popery on us and our Posterity: And therefore there ought to have been present such Persons as had no dependance upon the Court, and who ought to have been deligated by the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange,</HI> since the Princess of <HI>Denmark</HI> could not be there in Person, but instead of this, the only two Ladies (who as I am informed) were trusted by the Princess to be present at the Queens La∣bour, were never sent for till she was brought to Bed and the Child Drest: And as for the rest of the Witnesses they were either Lords, or other Persons who only Swear they stood in the Room at a distance, and heard the Queen cry out; and immmediately after the Child cry, sometime before they saw it. And as for the Ladies, the greatest part of them Swore no further than the Lords: So that notwithstanding all that they have Sworn in this matter, there might have been a trick put upon them and they never the wiser:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Siderfin's</HI> Re∣ports. <HI>Temp. Car.</HI> 2. <HI>Fol.</HI> 377, 378. The King a∣gainst <HI>Buck∣worth, Tuckee, Gill,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> Since you may Read in <HI>Siderfin's</HI> Reports, of a Woman who pretended to have been delivered of a Child by a Mid-wife within the Bed; and yet many years after, this was proved to be a suposititious Birth by the Deposition of the Mid-wife and the poor Woman who was the real Mother of the Child, and others that had been of the Conspiracy. And what has been done once, may be done again. 'Tis true, the King himself with one or two Ladies Deposed something fur∣ther as to Milk, and the feeling of the Child immediately be∣fore the Birth; but his Majesty, if it be an Imposture, is too deeply concerned in it, to be admitted as a competent Witness: And as for the rest of the Ladies, they are likewise, being as the Queens Servants, and having an imme∣diate dependance upon her to be excepted against, and under too much awe, to speak the whole Truth: But it is very strange to me, that none of them de∣posed any thing concerning their seeing any Milk come from Her Majesties Breasts after she was Delivered. And perhaps there was good reason for it, for I have had it from good hands, that she had none afterwards whatever she had before; the reason of which deserves to be enquired into, since it is very rare. But as for the Mid-Wife, her deposition is equivocal; <HI>That she took a Child from the Body of the Queen</HI>; She is also a Papist, and consequent∣ly a suspected witness in this cause: Whereas all this might have been pre∣vented, had the Queen (were she really with Child) been perswaded to be Delivered not within the Bed, but upon a Pallate; where all the persons whose business and concern it was to be present, might have seen the Child actually born; nor needed there to have any men been by, though I have heard that the late Queen of <HI>France</HI> was Delivered of the present King, the Dake of <HI>Orleans</HI> not being only present in the Room, but an Eye-witness of the Birth: And so, sure if somewhat of this nature had been done, it might
<PB N="789" REF="420"/>
have saved a great deal of dispute and bloodshed which has already, or may hereafter happen about it. And therefore I do not at all wonder that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> should not take this partial Evidence that has been given for sufficient satisfaction; so that whether this Birth of the Queens was real or not, I shall not now farther dispute. It is sufficient that if His Highness and His Princess had just and reasonable suspitions of an Imposture, whilst they remain under them; they had also a just cause of procuring a Free Parliament to examine this great affair, and also to obtain it by force, since it was to be got no other way.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I need not further dispute this business of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> with you, since I durst appeal to your own Conscience, whether you are not satis∣fied, notwithstanding these supposed indiscretions in the management of the Queens Delivery; that he is really Son to the Queen: and I think it would puzzle you or I to prove the Legitimacy of our own Children by better evi∣dence than this has been; and I think all those of your party may very well despair of producing any thing against it; since the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> himself has thought it best to let it alone, as knowing very well there was nothing ma∣terial could be brought in evidence against him. But I shall defer speaking further to this Head, till I come to consider of the Conventions setling the Crown upon the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange.</HI> But before I come to this, I have many things further to observe upon the Princes harsh and unjust pro∣ceedings with his Majesty, and refusing all terms of Accommodation with him, upon his last return to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>In the first place therefore, I must appeal to your self, whether It were done like a Nephew and a Son-in-Law, after the King was voluntarily returned to <HI>White Hall,</HI> at the perswasion of those Lords who went down to attend him at <HI>Feversham,</HI> when he had had scarce time to rest him after his journey, and the many hardships he had indured since his being seized in that Port; and when he had but newly sent my Lord <HI>Feversham</HI> with a kind Mes∣sage and Complement to the Prince; inviting him to St. <HI>Iames's,</HI> together with some overtures of Reconciliation, as I am informed, the Prince should make no better a return to all this kindness, than to clap up the Messenger con∣trary to the Law of Nations; as his Majesty observes in his Late Paper I now mentioned. And should without any notice given to the King of it, order his men to march, and displacing his Majesties Guards to seize upon all the Posts about <HI>White-Hall</HI>; whereby his Majesties Person became wholly in his Power: And not content with this, he likewise dispatcht three Lords (whose names I need not mention) to carry the King a very Rude and Undu∣tiful Message, desiring him no less than to depart the next Morning from his Pallace to a private House in the Countrey, altogether unfit for the reception of his Majesty, and those Guards and attendance that were necessary for his security: Nor would these Lords stay till the Morning, but disturbing his rest delivered their Message at Twelve a Clock at Night; nor did they give him any longer time than till the next Morning to prepare himself to be gone; and then the King was carried away to <HI>Rochester</HI> under the conduct, not of his own, but of the Princes <HI>Dutch</HI> Guards; in whose custody his Majesty continued for those few days he thought fit to stay there, till his de∣parture
<PB N="790" REF="421"/>
from thence in order to his passage into <HI>France,</HI> by which means the Prince hath render'd the breach irreconcileable between his Majesty and him∣self; for whereas if he had come to St. <HI>Iames</HI>'s in pursuance of the Kings In∣vitation, and had renewed the Treaty, which was unhappily broke off by the Kings first going away, there might have been in great probability, a happy and lasting reconciliation made between them, upon such terms as might have been a sufficient security for the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as also for the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, which you so earnestly contend for; whereas by the Conventions declaring the Throne vacant, and placing the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> therein, they have entail'd a lasting War, not only upon us, but our Posterity, as long as his Majesty lives, and the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and his Issue (if he live to have any) are in Being.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have made a very Tragical relation of this affair, and any one that did not understand the grounds of it, would believe that King <HI>Iames</HI> be∣ing quietly setled in his Throne, and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> refusing all terms of reconciliation, had seiz'd upon his Pallace, and carried him away Captive into a Prison; whereas indeed there was nothing transacted in all this affair, which may not be justified by the strictest Rules of Honour, and the Law of Nations: for the doing of which, it is necessary to look back, and consider the state of affairs immediately after the Kings leaving <HI>Salisbury</HI> and coming to <HI>White-hall,</HI> where one of the first things he did after he was arrived, was to issue out a Pro∣clamation for the calling a new Parliament, which was so received with great satisfaction by the whole Nation; and immediately upon this, the King sent the Lords <HI>Hallifax, Nottingham,</HI> and <HI>Godolphin,</HI> to treat with his Highness upon those Proposals of Peace which he then sent by them, and to which the Prince return'd his answer, the heads of which are very reasonable without demand∣ing any other security for himself, and his Army, than the putting of the Tow∣er and Forts about <HI>London</HI> into the Custody of that City: now pray observe the issue of all those fair hopes, before ever the terms propos'd by the Prince could be brought to Town, the King following the ill advice of the Popish Faction, instead of suffering the Elections for Parliament-Men to proceed, as he had promised, and as was hoped for by us, all on a sudden he order'd the rest of the Writs for Elections that were not sent down, to be burnt, and a Ca∣veat to be entred against the making use of those that were sent already into the Country; and at the same time he sent Order to the Earl of <HI>Feversham,</HI> to disband the Army, and dismiss all the Souldiers with their Arms. But I had for∣got to put you in mind, that just before this, the King had sent away the Queen with the Prince into <HI>France,</HI> and that she carried the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> along with her; whereby it was plain the King intended to put it wholly out of his power, to Issue out any Writs, or Pass any publick Act wherein the Great Seal should be used; and that this Seal was carried away appears by its being not long since drawn up out of the <HI>Thames</HI> by a Fisherman's Net near <HI>Lam∣beth</HI> Bridge, where it's supposed to have been thrown in by the Queen, or some of Her Attendance, in Her passage over the Water; and farther, that the King was resolved wholly to quit the Government of this Kingdom, (at least for the present) appears by his so speedy following of the Queen, within three days after, stealing from his Pallace by Night in a Boat to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and from
<PB N="791" REF="421"/>
thence in a small Vessel to <HI>Feversham,</HI> where how he was seis'd by the Mob of that Town, and afterwards return'd to <HI>London,</HI> as you have set forth, I need take no further notice.</P>
<P>Now this being a true and fair Narrative of the whole Matter, I shall only offer two or three questions to your consideration, and desire you would give me a fair and satisfactory answer to them. First, pray tell me whether it was not the Kings fault that it was rendered impossible for Parliament-Men to be elected, by burning of the Writs, and sending away the Great Seal? Secondly, whether the King by first stealing away, did not plainly confess himself con∣quer'd by the Prince, and did thereby Abdicate the Government? also by his obstinate refusal to redress the Grievances of the Nation, hath forfeited his Crown and all Allegiance from his Subjects, and was not after this to be own'd as King of <HI>England,</HI> either by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> or any body else; and there∣fore whatever treatment he after this received from the Prince, it was not to be looked upon as done to a Lawful King, but a Conquered Prince; and his Highness might not only justly refuse to treat with him any more as a Crowned Head, but might also have justified not only the taking him Prisoner, but sending him into <HI>Holland,</HI> if he had pleas'd; but instead of this, the Prince only desir'd his removal out of Town from that conflux of Papists that flocked to him, and by securing his Person to put it out of their power to play an after-Game, and rally the late disbanded Army, of whom there was at least twenty thousand of the Scotch, Irish, and English, who would have stood by the King till the last; and therefore the English as well as the Dutch Counsel about the Prince, did not think it safe for him to come to Town as long as the King had his Guards about him at <HI>White-hall,</HI> since they might have been increased to an Army whenever he pleased.</P>
<P>And though I grant good breeding and manners, especially to Kings, as also respect from a Son-in-law to a Father, are duties incumbent upon Princes, as well as private Men, yet when these lesser things stand in competition with their own welfare and safety, as also of the whole Nation, for which the Prince was now engaged; if he might for these ends justly require the removing and se∣curing the Kings Person, it was no great matter what time of night he had notice to remove, though this was not done neither with any design to affront or surprise him, but happen'd indeed through pure accident; for when it was resolved that the Princes Guards should March to <HI>London</HI> and secure <HI>White-hall,</HI> it was also resolved that the King should have notice to remove▪ and since it was not thought fit to let him know it till the Posts were all secur'd; the ways being very deep and dirty between <HI>Windsor</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> the Dutch Guards command∣ed by Count <HI>Solms</HI> could not reach the Town till past ten at night, and after that it was near twelve before the English Guards about <HI>White-hall</HI> could be drawn off without fighting, and till that was done it was not thought at all proper, or safe to deliver to the King the Princes message for his departure: so that indeed it was not of any design that either the Prince and his Counsel who or∣dered it, or of these Lords (who very well understand good breeding) thus to deliver their message to him at that time of Night.</P>
<P>But tho he was in Bed, yet that he was not a sleep is very probable, since he had not been above half an hour in Bed, and it is not very likely he should be a
<PB N="792" REF="422"/>
sleep, when he very well knew before of the arrival of the Princes Troops about <HI>White-hall,</HI> and therefore could not be without too much concern about it, presently to compose himself to sleep.</P>
<P>But as for his removal from <HI>London,</HI> it is plain that his Highness was so far from owning, or receiving the King in the same capacity he was in before his departure, that as soon as ever he heard he was at the Earl of <HI>Winchelsea</HI>'s, and about to return to <HI>London,</HI> he sent away Monsieur <HI>Zulestein</HI> with a Letter to let him know, that he desired him not as yet to come to <HI>London,</HI> but to stay at <HI>Rochester</HI> till he himself should come to Town; but Monsieur <HI>Zulestein</HI> missing of the King by the way, he came to <HI>White-hall:</HI> yet could not but know that his being there was not with the Princes consent, since the same Gentleman followed him thither, and there delivered him the Princes Letters; so that this second Message by these Lords could be no new thing, or surprise to him; yet that his Highness never intended, or acted the least violence towards the Kings Person, may appear by this, that he left it to the Kings choice what place he would go to, as also what Guards or other Attendance he would take with him, and the King re∣fused to take his English Guards with him, though they were offer'd him: and indeed these Dutch Guards that attended him, might in his Majesties judg∣ment be very well trusted, they being (as well as their Officers) for the most part Papists; but that the Prince did not intend either to detain his Majesties Person as a Prisoner, may appear in this, that whilst he remain'd at <HI>Rochester,</HI> none that would were debarr'd from access to him, and that the Officers and Souldiers of the Guards were order'd to be under his command, and every Night to take the Word from him; and had it not been for the Kings com∣manding a Centry to be drawn off from his usual Post, he could never have gone away without being discovered; and if he would have gone away at Noon Day, I know not who unless the Rabble would have hinder'd him; so that I think it is evident that this was the civilest, and mildest usage that a vanquisht Prince could expect from him that had so much the better of him, and in whose power he now was; and I doubt more than the King would have allowed the Prince, had it been his Fortune to have got him as much in his power; nay the King was so far from being confin'd, that it is plain he had the liberty given him to go whither he pleased; nor were these Guards plac'd so much about him for his confinement as to secure him from the insults of the Rabble, who otherwise there, as well as they did at <HI>Feversham,</HI> might have expressed too violent a resentment against his Person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny but you have given a very-fair, and as far as I know, a true account of this transaction, and have told me some things which I never heard before; but however, I cannot depart from my first opinion, that it was neither, honestly nor wisely done of those who took upon them to advise the Prince to push things to extremities in this conjuncture, and therefore I impute it chiefly to those English, who supposing they had by taking Arms and joyning themselves to the Princes party, provoked the King beyond all possibi∣lity of Pardon, were resolved to do their utmost to put it out of the Kings Power ever to call him to an account for it: and tho' perhaps his first send∣ing away the Queen and Prince, and then going away himself, in the middle of a Treaty with the Prince, and thereby leaving his Affairs in such confusion,
<PB N="793" REF="422"/>
may seem to deserve blame, yet certainly his Majesty is to be excused in a great measure for what he then did; for as he tells the Earl of <HI>Feversham</HI> in his Letter to him to Disband the Army;<NOTE PLACE="marg">H.D. <HI>p.</HI> 92.</NOTE>
<Q><HI>That things being come to that extremity, that he was forced to send away the Queen, and the Prince his Son, that they might not fall into the Enemies hands,</HI> and was also con∣strained to do the same thing himself, and follow them, since the Troops of his Army were not to be relyed on, that it was not adviseable for him to Fight the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> in the Head of them; for it was but reasonable that Princes as well as other men, should provide for their own security, as well as they can.</Q></P>
<P>But yet I can never believe that his Majesty's first going away was any Abdi∣cation of the Government, much less a forfeiture of his Crown or Royal Dignity any more than the second; for in the first place it could be no forfeiture accord∣ing to your own Principles, because he had already Dissolved the Ecclesiastical Court, and restor'd the Cities and Corporations to their former Charters and Freedom in Elections of Parliament-Men, and putting again in Commission, all Lords, Lieutenants, and Justices of the Peace, who had been before turned out; and if he could not give an intire redress to all our grievances by a free Par∣liament, it was only because he durst not stay to hold it, since he thought he could have no security for his Person, the whole Nation being in a manner poi∣soned and prepossessed against him by those malicious Artifices of a French League,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I. D. D.</HI></NOTE> and a suppositious Prince, and that his Ma∣jesty had so many unfortunate disappointments, and so surprizing and unparallell'd accidents; part of his Army deserting him, and the rest too apparently unserviceable, when there were such terrible disorders in the King∣dom, and all places were either flaming, or about to take fire.</P>
<P>So likewise could it not be properly any wilful desertion or Abdication of the Government, since he was forced to quit it, like the master of a Ship, who when the Vessel is like to sink is forced to leave her, and escape in a Cock-boat; and that his Majesty did not act thus without an intention to return, and again to vindicate his right, when opportunity served, appears likewise in that pas∣sage in the above mentioned Letter, wherein he desires both the Officers and Souldiers of his Army then to be disbanded,
<Q><HI>To continue their Fidelity to him, and to keep themselves from Associations, and such pernicious things</HI>; from whence it plainly appears, he went not away without a prospect of returning to his Throne when Time should serve: and if he left no orders at all for the Govern∣ment of the Kingdom in his absence, nor named any Commissioners or Lieute∣nants to represent him, it was because he thought it to no purpose; since besides that, he could find no body, who durst undertake so difficult an employment; so they that had taken it would have found no body who would obey them, the generality of the People, and also of the Kings Army, being more incli∣nable to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> than to himself.</Q></P>
<P>Yet however you see upon his return to Town, the King was so well persuaded of the Prince of <HI>Oranges</HI> kind intentions towards himself and the Na∣tion, that I verily believe that his Majesty would have yielded to any thing that could in reason have been desired of him; and upon this ground I suppose he writ so kindly to the Prince, and invited him to come to St. <HI>Iames</HI>'s with what
<PB N="794" REF="423"/>
Troops he should think fit for his security; therefore I must needs tell you again, I think it was a great oversight of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> thus to let slip this opportunity, by refusing all terms of accommodation with the King his Father, and by clapping up my Lord <HI>Feversham,</HI> then seizing the Kings Person, and sending him out of Town, to let all the World see he was resolved to treat no more with him: and this being the true state of the case, it is not your saying that he had forfeited his Crown by going away, and consulting his own safety, that will convince any unprejudiced man: for as to your notion of a for∣feiture, that they were not then entred into the Thoughts of the Peers, and others of the Privy Council, appears by the Order they made for sending the Lords <HI>Feversham, Alesbury, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>armouth,</HI> and <HI>Middleton,</HI> most humbly to intreat the King to return to <HI>White-hall,</HI> so that he was received very joyfully and with great Acclamations of the Common People as he passed through the City; and when he came to <HI>White-hall</HI> he called a Council, where he made an Order to stop the demolishing and plundering of Houses by the Rabble: so that he was not only receiv'd, but also acted as a King after his return to Town. This being the true state of the case, I shall not dispute the point whether his Majesty and the Prince were in a state of War or Peace, after his return to Town, or what the Prince might have done as an Enemy and a stranger to the Kings Person, but what might be expected from him as a generous Prince, a Nephew, and a Son-in-law, and one who was bound in Conscience and Honour, to con∣sult the lasting Peace and Happiness of the Nation, more than his own private interest, or the ambition of wearing a Crown.</P>

<P>You have made the utmost defence that I suppose can be brought for the King's first going away; yet if it be better consider'd, I doubt it will not serve the turn: I see you are forc'd to lay the whole fault of the Kings depar∣ture in the midst of the Treaty with the Prince, and his refusing to call a Par∣liament according to his own Promise and Proclamation, upon his want of se∣curity for himself, the Queen, and Prince, if he had stay'd, by reason of the want of fidelity in his Army, the general prejudice of the Nation against him, and the great firmness and resolution there was in the Princes Army to adhere to him. Now I shall shew you that every one of these were but pretences, and that the real cause of his departure was, because he fear'd to leave the inquiry into the Birth of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the free examination and redress of our grievances, and those violations he had committed upon the fundamental con∣stitution of the Government, to the impartial judgment of a free Parliament.
<Q>For in the first place, as to want of fidelity in his Army, that can be no just excuse for his deserting, and disbanding them as he did, without any pay; since he himself in his said Letter to the Earl of <HI>Feversham,</HI> expresly owns, that there were a great many brave men, both Officers and Souldiers among them;</Q>
and therefore if he was satisfied of this, he ought to have first sent for all his Officers, both Collonels and Captains, and have examin'd them how far they would stand by him, in the Defence of his Person and Cause, against the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>; and he might have also order'd those Officers to have ex∣amin'd every Regiment, Troop and Company in his whole Army, how far they would engage in his defence; and if he had proceeded thus at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> before he fled away in that confusion to <HI>London,</HI> I have been credibly inform'd
<PB N="795" REF="423"/>
by divers Officers of that Army, that the King might have found above▪ Twenty Thousand men, that would have stood by him to the last man, in his Quarrel a∣gainst the Prince, and therefore I impute his going away as he did from <HI>Salisbury,</HI> to some strange pannick fear that God had cast upon him, and all the Popish Faction about him, since he has been known not to want sufficient courage upon other occasions; but though he had omitted it there, yet he certainly ought to have tryed this last experiment after he came to <HI>London,</HI> rather than have quitted the Kingdom so dishonourably as he then did, and thereby giving the P. of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Friends an opportunity of seizing or getting delivered into their power, all the Garisons and strong places in <HI>England,</HI> besides <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> in those three or four days time, that he was not heard of, besides great part of the Army that was not disbanded, had in that time gone in to the Prince, in hopes of their pay, and future preferment: now that the King might with safety have resided with his Army somewhere about <HI>London,</HI> he himself grants,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. D.</HI> p. 90.</NOTE> in his Proposals to the Prince, to this effect,
<Q>That in the mean time, till all matters were adjusted concerning the freedom of Elections, and a security of their sitting; the respective Armies may be retained within such Limits, and at such distance from <HI>London,</HI> as may prevent all apprehensions that the Parliament may be in any kind distur∣bed; which Proposals being made not long after the Kings arrival at <HI>London,</HI> we may reasonably suppose that he was then well enough satisfied with the fide∣lity of the greatest part, at least of his own Army, to him; and if he were not, he might have been better satisfied if he pleased: but as for the next difficulty, the Nations being poisoned and prepossessed against him; admit it were so, as long as he had a sufficient Army about him (as I suppose he might have had) he need not have feared any thing the People could do; but indeed this was a needless fear; for before the Parliament could sit, it was not the Peoples In∣terest to hinder it, or to fall upon the King or his Army when matters were in a fair way of accommodation; so after the Parliament sate, there would have been less cause of fear, since the reverence of that Court would have kept them in awe; but as to the firmness and resolution of the Princes Army, the fear of that was also as needless, as long as the Kings Army continued as firm to him, and if the Princes Army had been the first Agressors, I doubt not but the People would have taken part with the King against them: but after all it was certainly (and you must grant it so) much more safe and honourable for the King to have treated with the Prince, and held a Parliament with an Army about him, than to have yielded the same things (as you suppose him willing to have done) after his return to Town, when his Army was disbanded, and <HI>London</HI> had received the Prince, and had joined with him and when almost all the strong places of <HI>England</HI> were in the Princes power; so that upon the whole matter it evidently appears that the King chose to trust his own Person together with that of the Queen and Prince, to a Foreign Monarch rather than he would relye upon the justice or fidelity of his own Nation.</Q></P>
<P>You say in the next place, that nothing the King has done in all these ex∣orbitances he committed that can in any wise amount to a Forfeiture, or Ab∣dication of the Government; not to the former because the King redress'd all our Grievances before he went away; 'tis true, I grant he redressed some of
<PB N="796" REF="424"/>
them, by putting divers things in the same State they were before; yet for all this, the greatest still remained unredressed, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Raising of Mony contrary to Law, and the Dispensing Power, both which (as I have already shewed you) at our last meeting he never Disclaimed, neither took any suffici∣ent course, by Calling a Parliament to prevent its being exercised for the future; besides his going away, without giving the Prince and Nation any further Satisfa∣ction about the Birth of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> all which not being done, I must still affirm, that this wrought a forfeiture of the Crown, or an Abdication of it, at least by his refusal to Hold and Govern it according to the Fundamental Laws thereof; for he that destroys the Law or Conditions by which he holds an Estate, does Tacitly Renounce his Title to it: As I shewed you in the Case of Tenant for Life, altering in Fee: So that this being considered, as also that the City of <HI>London</HI> and the whole Nation, had Surrendred themselves to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. D. p.</HI> 92.94.</NOTE> and that even the Arch-Bishops of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> together with the Bishops of <HI>Winchester</HI> and <HI>Ely,</HI> with divers other Earls, Bishops and Lords then in Town, had sent an Address to the Prince, immediately upon the Kings departure, and sent three Lords and one Bishop with it, desiring his Highness to come speedily to <HI>London,</HI> and to take the Government upon him; and having before declar'd, that they would with their utmost endeavours, Assist his Highness for the obtaining of a Free Parliament; so that the Prince had no reason upon the Kings return, to Surrender that Power which the Nation as far as it was able to do without a Parliament, had put into his Hands; and that to a King, whom he had very little reason to believe, would use it any better than he had done before.</P>
<P>But I see you wilfully decline entring into the Merits of the Cause, and ar∣guing the main point in the Controversy, (<HI>viz.</HI>) whether the King was in a State of War or Peace with the Prince upon his return; for if he were still in a State of War, the Prince might certainly very well justifie his clapping up the Earl of <HI>Feversham</HI> (his Late Majesties General) for offering to come within the Limits of the Princes Quarters, without his leave; especially, since he was still answerable for doing his endeavour to Disband an Army (a great part of which, consisted of Papists and Forreigners, with their Arms in their hands) whereby they might have robb'd and spoyl'd the Countries, or at least have kept those Arms, to renew the War again with the first Opportuni∣ty; so that certainly it could not be so slight a thing, as a bare Invitation to St. <HI>Iames</HI>'s, whither the Prince could have gone without his leave, (being now Master of the City) which could so far ef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace all the Princes just Resentments, and make him so far confide in the Kings Word, as to come to <HI>London,</HI> whilst he remained there with his Guards, and all those Papists and Tories in and about <HI>London,</HI> ready to take his part, and Rallie again into a new Army, upon the first Signal.</P>
<P>But as for any Proposals of Peace or Accommodation, which you say the Lord <HI>Feversham</HI> brought with him, I neither know, nor have heard of any such thing: 'tis true, the King says in the said Paper he left behind him, that he had writ to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> by the Lord <HI>Feversham,</HI> and also mentions some Instructions he had given him; but what they were, he does not tell us;
<PB N="797" REF="424"/>
but sure they were not Propositions of Peace, since it is to be supposed, that the King would not have sent any thing of that Consequence, without first ac∣quainting the Privy Council with it, before it was sent: But since we hear of nothing concerning them, we may very well suppose there was no such thing, or if there were, his Highness was the fittest judge, whether they were rea∣sonable or not; and if the King had any desire to propose any Just or Reaso∣nable Terms, whereupon he might have hoped to have been restored again to his Royal Dignity, he had a very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air Opportunity for it, when a great Coun∣cil of the Nobility were met at St. <HI>Iames</HI>'s, in Order to Sign an Association to stand by the Prince in the Calling of a Free Parliament, for the King might then▪ if he had pleased, have made his Proposals by such of the Lords and Bishops, as he could most confide in, and have Conjured all the Peers there Assembled, to have interceeded with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> to renew their Treaty with the King, which had been before unhappily broken off; and then if either the Peers had refused to do this, or the Prince had refused to hear them, the King might then (I grant) have had sufficient reason to declare to all the World, that he was not fairly dealt with; but for him again to go away only upon pretence, that his Person was under restraint, when really it was not, plainly shew'd, that he had no real design, of making an amicable end of those differences, or really desir'd to be restored to his Throne, by the general con∣sent of the Nation; but either hoped for it from those Civil Dissentions he ex∣pected we should fall into upon his departure, or else to the Arms of <HI>France</HI>; and this being the Case, I think nothing is plainer, than that the King both by his first and second departure, hath obstinately refused all those means, where∣by the Nation might have been setled with a due consideration of his Person, and Authority whilst he lived, and of the Prince, when his Legitimacy shall be sufficiently proved, and made out before a Free Parliament. So that since I have already proved that the King had before the Princes Arrival, commit∣ted so many Violations upon the whole Constitution of the Government, and that these Violations, if wilfully and obstinately persisted in, do at last pro∣duce an absolute loss and forfeiture of the Crown it self; I think the late King has done all that could be required to make it so.</P>
<P>But I have forgot to answer one Objection you made, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the Peers and Bishops, when they invited the King to return to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> had no No∣tion of this forfeiture, nor the people of <HI>London,</HI> who you say, received him with great Joy and Acclamations, and that therefore it is wholly a new in∣vention. To this I Answer; that if the Lords you mention, did send this message to the King, it might be, because they were surprised with his unex∣pected return, and had not well considered all the Circumstances of the Case, and thereby did more then they could well justifie, having before declaed, they would stand by his Highness, in procuring a Free Parliament, which must certainly be without the King, since he was then gone away; and they had also invited him to come to <HI>London,</HI> as well as the City; and how that could consist with their inviting the King thither, without the Princes consent, <HI>I</HI> do not well understand; but it seems they quickly, altered their Sentiments as ap∣pears by their presently after Subscribing a paper in the nature of an Associa∣tion, to stand by the Prince, without taking any notice at all of the King, and
<PB N="798" REF="425"/>
the very day of the Kings departure, they met to consider upon the Princes Speech, he had a day or two before made to them, desiring them to advise on the best means, how to pursue the ends of his Declaration, in Calling a Free Parliament; and within two days after, they presented the Prince with their Advice, to call a Convention on the 22th. of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> which was also the next day agreed to, by one hundred and sixty Persons, who had served as Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, in any of the last Parliaments, in the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, without taking any notice at all of the King; for though it is true, he was then gone away, when the Commons and City, two or three days after, made their Addresses to the Prince: Yet, when the Peers met both the first and second time, on the 21st. and 22d. of <HI>December,</HI> he was still here; for the King did not leave <HI>Rochester,</HI> until the 23d. in the morning; so it is plain, it was not their design to own, or take notice of him any more as King, and that which makes it more remarkable, is, that several of the Bi∣shops (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Arch-Bishop of <HI>York,</HI> together with the Bishop of St. <HI>Asaph,</HI> and others joyned with the rest of the Peers in these Addresses, which was a plain sign, they all looked upon the Kings Power to be now at an end: But as for the Acclamations of the people, or any great joy the City expressed upon the Kings return to Town, I doubt you have had a false account of that matter, for I cannot hear that any of the Citizens went out to meet him, or set any Lights in their Windows, though he came into <HI>London</HI> after it was dark, or that any of the better sort, bid him God Speed: I grant indeed, there was a great many of what you call the Mob; but more Boys than Men, who followed his Coach, making Huzza's, whilst the rest of the people silently looked on.</P>

<P>I cannot deny, but you may have given a true account of these matters, since you may have observ'd them better than I; yet as you your self have Related them, sure the King had sufficient cause to Consult his own Safety, and make his escape as soon as he could; for what could he expect, when once the Prince had secured his Person under a Guard, and had refused to Treat with him as King; and that also the Peers, and divers of the Bishops had made an Association to stand by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and had made a fresh Address to him, without taking the least notice of him, as if there had been no such thing as a King in being? I say, what could his Majesty now expect, but ei∣ther a more close Confinement, or else, being taken off privately by poyson, or some other ways, since he could not be forgetful of the King his Fathers say∣ing, that there is no great distance between the Prisons and the Graves of Prin∣ces; or admit he had lived till this Convention Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, what could he have ex∣pected more, than the retaining the bare Title of King, whilst the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> or some others appointed by Him, had wholly managed the Go∣vernment at their pleasure? or else they might according to your Doctrine, have either declared the Crown forfeited, or else, that he had Abdicated it by his going away; or who can tell, but they might have again renewed the Vil∣lany of 48. and have made him undergone the same Fate with his Father?</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you have urged the utmost that can be, to justifie the Kings second Departure; and as I would not deny, but that he was the best Judge of his own Danger, so were the Prince, Peers and Common, together with the City, the best and only Judges, we could then have of the true means of
<PB N="799" REF="425"/>
our settlement and safety, since after so many breaches that the King had made upon his first Declaration, and Coronation Oath, as also his going from his late Promise of calling a Free Parliament; I cannot see what farther security he could have given us, that he would not repeat the same things over again;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H.D.</HI> p. 110.</NOTE> or admit the Prince had suffered him to continue at <HI>White-hall,</HI> and to call a third Parliament, what assurance could he have given, that in the end of another forty days, we should not have the same trick play'd us? and then in <HI>March</HI> or <HI>April,</HI> have been left in the same state of Confusion we were in, in <HI>December,</HI> to the certain ruine of these three Kingdoms, and <HI>Holland</HI> into the bargain? And then by that time, the French King might have got ready an Army and a Fleet, and under a pretence of re∣deeming his Majesty from the constraint he lay under, and of restoring him to the free exercise of his Regal Power, have Invaded this Kingdom; and I suppose you cannot deny but the King would then have sound Papists and High Tories enough, to have joined with him in this pious design; for certain∣ly the scruples of the high Church-men would have been the same they are now, the obligations of the Oath of Allegiance the same, and the supposed Sin of deposing a Lawful K. the same, though he had utterly refused to give the Prince and Nation any satisfaction: so that then if we had been forced to take Arms, and to declare he had forfeited his Right to the Crown, all these things would have given as great,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 111.</NOTE> or rather greater scandal, than for the Nation to take him at his first offer; and since he had thus rashly deserted the Throne by a needless departure, to resolve he should Ascend it no more.</P>
<P>But suppose (what might also as well have happened) that the Prince and his Party had been killed, or expelled the Kingdom by the King, do you think he would have granted us then, what he would not grant us now? Would he not think you, have disbanded his Protestant Army, and have kept only Irish, Scotch, and French Forces in pay, and have every day encreased them? What respect can we hope he would ever after this have shewn to our Laws, Religi∣on, or Liberties, when he had now no longer any thing to fear? The memory of what happened after the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s defeat, (though effected only by those of the Church of <HI>England</HI>) will certainly never be forgotten by others, whatever you Bigots of Loyalty may pretend, or say.</P>
<P>So that for my part I stand amazed to see you, and so many others scruple the submitting to the present King; for if ever man had a just cause of War, he had, and that creates a right to the thing gained by it, the King by with∣drawing and disbanding his Army, yielded him the Throne; and is he had without any more Ceremony ascended it, he had done no more than several Prin∣ces formerly have done on the like occasions; for the Prince was no longer then bound to consider him as one that was, but as one that had been King of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> yet in that capacity he treated him with great respect and civility, how much soever the King complained of it, who did not enough consider what he had done to draw upon himself that usage: but as for your insinuation, that if he had stayed he might have run the same fate with his Father; I think it is fuller of Passion than Truth; for besides that, the Lords and Commons
<PB N="800" REF="426"/>
would never had the Impudence to have committed such a Villany; and the Prince himself as a Nephew, and a Son-in-Law would never have suffered it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, God only knows the event of things, and we ought to judge charitably, and still to hope, that if the King might have been restored upon terms, that he would have been the better for his Affliction, and have amend∣ed all those errours he committed, since he had seen that neither the Nation, nor yet his Neighbours the Dutch would permit him to make himself an Ab∣solute Monarch; I believe he would have been too much afraid of the King of <HI>France,</HI> ever to have made use of his Forces, to have setled Popery and Arbitrary Government; and without his assistance, I suppose you will grant it never could have been done, since he plainly found that a Protestant Army would never have joined with him to act in such pernitious designs; but how∣ever, let the worst have happened that could be, I think it had been much bet∣ter for the Nation to have endured it with Patience, than to have done that which was Evil, though for the procuring of the greatest seeming Good, tho' for the advantage of our Religion, and civil Liberties: and therefore it had been better for us in this extremity, to have trusted God than Men, since he always promises to protect those that relye upon him, and strictly perform his Will; and admit the worst that could have happened, God would either have removed those afflictions from us in due time, or have given us Patience to have born them; since I suppose you will not deny, that God oftentimes brings Persecutions and Afflictions upon a Sinful Church and Nation, either for a pu∣nishment for their Sins, or else to give an occasion for those that are truly Pious and Sincere, to shew their Courage and Constancy in Suffering for the Truth, and by withstanding, not by force, but Passive Obedience, all the Kings Illegal and Arbitrary Commands, if he should after his re-establishment in the Throne, have again renewed his former courses; these are the only remedies which we of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as obedient Subjects to the King and his Laws, must think could have been Lawfully taken in this case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not deny, but what you say is in the main very pious and honest, were the case as you have put it; but the greatest part of your discourse depends wholly upon those old principles and prejudices, of the unlawfulness of all resistance of the Supream Powers, and that the King is the only Supream Power in this Kingdom; both which propositions I have sufficiently confuted at our third, fourth, and fifth meetings, and also at our last save one, in which I gave you a true account of the Legal sense of those Oaths and Statutes of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. concerning Resistance; as was also given by the best Lawyers, and most considering Men of the then House of Lords and Commons; so that if the means we have used are lawful, both by the Laws of God and Man, I think we are not bound to bring Afflictions upon our selves, but to avoid them all we can, especially when they come evidently attended with the utter loss and ruine of what ought to be most dear to us, our Religion, Civil Liberties, and Properties, and that not only for our selves, but our Posterity; who per∣haps would never have regained them when they were once lost; of which the French Nation is an evident example before our Eyes, who by not opposing the Arbitrary Power of their Kings in due time, have fallen into a Govern∣ment
<PB N="801" REF="426"/>
almost as Despotick as that of <HI>Turky</HI>; for when once the common good of the Subjects ceases to be the main end of the Governours, the Government then ceasing to be Gods Ordinance, degenerates into Tyranny: which I think may be always Lawfully opposed by a free-born People, who at first agreed to be Governed, not as Slaves but Subjects.</P>
<P>But as for the first part of your Speech, it needs not any long answer; it first supposes the King might have been again restored upon terms; now since it is plain, these Terms must have been imposed upon him against his Will, and as necessary Conditions of his Restoration, I would be glad to know who it was should undertake to impose them upon him, and to see them kept, when they had been made, whether the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> or the Parliament? if the for∣mer, I grant indeed he might have made such Conditions with the King, that the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as well as the whole Nation, should for the future en∣joy their Just Rights and Liberties; but then the Prince must either have trusted wholy to the Kings Honour, or else he must have had some strong places put into his Hands for a Security, that the King would not again make the same Violations upon our Laws, Religion and Liberties, as he had done before; if the former, I suppose you will not deny, but that the King might, if he had pleased, have broken them all again, as soon as ever the Princes back had been turned, and that he had been once engaged in a War with <HI>France,</HI> which could not have been long avoided, considering the necessity there is at this juncture of time for the States of <HI>Holland</HI> (and Consequently the Prince as their Gene∣ral) to engage with the Emperor and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to drive the <HI>French</HI> out of the Empire, and to hinder him from making himself Universal Monarch of <HI>Europe</HI>; which it is plain, is the thing he now drives at.</P>
<P>But if the Prince should have kept any strong places here as cautionary Towns, for the Kings performance of the Terms agreed upon, this must have been done either by <HI>English</HI> or Forreign Forces; if by the former, this would have been looked upon as inconsistent with their Duty, and Allegiance to the King, if he should have commanded them to be delivered up into his Hands; since you tell us, the King has the sole Command of the Militia, and conse∣quently of all Garrisons man'd by his Subjects, within his Dominions: But if the Forces that should have held these places, had been <HI>Dutch-men,</HI> or other Forreigners, it would never have been endured, either by the King or the Na∣tion, that Forreigners should possess the strong Holds and Keys of the King∣dom, and the King might soon have wrought (by some jealousies and suspitions, which he would not have failed to have raised) that the Nation it self, should have joyned with him to drive them out; and then the King might have done what he pleased without Controul; but if you will place this pow∣er into the whole People or Nation, or else their Representatives the Parlia∣ment, of holding the King to these Terms agreed upon, this could not have been done without their constant Siting, and a power of Resisting him, in case he infring'd them; and then either they must have given up all their Liber∣ties to the Kings Will, or else farewell to the Darling Doctrines of Passive O∣bedience, and Non-resistance; so that take it which way you will, all impo∣sing of Terms upon the King, either by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> or the Nation, would in a short time have become either Unpracticable or Insignificant. Nor is
<PB N="802" REF="427"/>
your other Supposition any whit truer, that the King would never have made use of the Forces of <HI>France,</HI> to subdue and keep under the people of <HI>England,</HI> for fear he should not be able to get the <HI>French</HI> out again. Ti's true, this would be a very good Argument to a Prince, who were no Bigot, and was not resol∣ved to introduce his Religion, by all the ways and means he could; but how near the <HI>French</HI> Forces were to be brought over into this Kingdom the last Sum∣mer, is very well known to those who were then in <HI>France,</HI> and saw them up∣on the Sea Coast, ready to Imbark; nor was their coming over put off by any other motives, than that two of the Cabinet-Council represented to the King, that it would be the only means to make the whole Nation rise up against him, and joyn with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> as soon as he Landed; which I suppose was the only reason that hindred it; for that the <HI>French</HI> King offered to send them, is very certain. Yet it does not follow for all that, but the King might take an opportunity of doing it another time, and bringing them over in their own Ships, if ours would not do the business.</P>
<P>And though I will not affirm, that there is any private League with <HI>France,</HI> for the Extirpation of the Protestant Religion; yet this much I think may be sufficiently made out, that long ago, the King was wholly in the power and interest of <HI>France,</HI> as appears by <HI>Coleman</HI>'s Letters (whilst he was his Secreta∣ry) when Duke of <HI>York.</HI> The first passage, is to Sir <HI>William Throgmorton</HI> Feb. 1. 1673/4. <HI>You well know, that when the Duke comes to be Master of our Affairs, the King of</HI> France <HI>will have reason to promise himself all things that he can desire.</HI> The next is to Father <HI>La Chaise,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Kings Confessor, in these words; <HI>That his Royal Highness was Convinced, that his interest and the King of</HI> France's, <HI>were the same</HI>; and whether the Duke by his Accession to the Crown, has shewed any alteration in his Inclinations to <HI>France,</HI> either in respect of Religion or Inte∣rest, I appeal to the World.</P>
<P>Nor is your next Supposition less out of the way, that the King could have made use of no Forces but <HI>French,</HI> to settle Popery and Arbitrary Go∣vernment here, as if He had not <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Papists enough in his Domini∣ons for this occasion; and as for Arbitrary Government, we have found to our grief, that there are too many Mercenary Souldiers in the Kings Army, who fought only for pay, and would have Assisted the King to have Raised Money without the Parliament, nay, to pull the very Parliament out of Doors, if he had bid them; and if some of them were Discontented, when the Prince came over, I do not so much impute it to their Honest Principles, as fear, lest they themselves should be Cashierd, and <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>Irish,</HI> to be listed in their rooms; so that upon the whole matter, considering the temper the King was in ever since his last coming to Town, and that as soon as he Arrived, the Priests and Jesuits flocked about him as thick as ever, that they and the <HI>French</HI> Envoy were his chief (if not his only Cabinet Councellors) I cannot see (unless he had taken new measures) how we could have been secure, or could have relied on any thing he could have farther promised; nay, swore to perform; since no Oath could be more Sacred than that at his Coronation, when he Swore to main∣tain the Church (that is, the Doctrine of the Church) of <HI>England,</HI> and the Laws of the Kingdom, if that be a true account of the form of it, which we have in print.</P>

<P>At this rate of Arguing, I know not what to say to you, since this Ar∣gument amounts to no more than this; that the King could upon no account be trusted, and therefore was not any more to be Treated with; if this were so, to what purpose did the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> declare, that he came not to Conquer the Kingdom; but only to procure a Free and Legal Parliament, which could not be called, without the Kings Consent, and owning his Authority? neither could they have done the least Act for the Amendment of our Grievances, without his Majesties Consent; or to what purpose did the Prince enter into a Treaty with the Kings Commissioners at <HI>Hungerford,</HI> if his Royal Word and Promises, were not to be believed? But if his Majesty could ever be trusted, I see no reason why he could not have been so, as well since his last coming to Town, as before, since he came voluntarily? and as I have great reason to believe with Real Intentions, to grant and perform what ever the Nation could reasonably expect for the Redress of their Grievances, and would have given any reasonable Security of his performance for the future, without De∣vesting himself of his Royal Power of making Laws, and Protecting his Subjects?</P>
<P>But as for the former part of your Speech, whereby you would prove it law∣ful to Resist the King, because you say it conduced to the Common good and In∣terest of the Nation, both as to the Protestant Religion, and Civil Liberties, this is no more than the Old Common-wealths Maxim in other words, which I grant is so far true, as when the safety and preservation of the King or other Su∣pream Powers of a Common-Wealth (who according to your own principles, are the Representatives of the people, and consequently part of it) are like∣wise comprehended and maintained (as they ought to be) in their due power and authority: for Bishop <HI>Sanderson</HI> in his Learned Lectures, hath very well proved, that those cannot be separated from each other, without destroy∣ing the Civil Government, which is all the Security we have for our Civil Pro∣perties and Liberties; and we see in those few days in which his Majesties Per∣son was withdrawn, when that there was no Civil Government exercised, that there was greater infringment of them, both by plundering and destroying of Houses, and spoiling of Parks and Forests in three or four days time, by the violence and fury of the Mob, than have been committed by the most Arbitrary Kings, from the Conquest to this day.</P>

<P>You very much mistake me, if you think I maintain, that there was never any time after the Princes Landing, that the King might not have been Treated withal; and likewise trusted with the Administration of the Govern∣ment; but then it must have been upon such Terms, as should have secured us for the future, from his Acting the like, or worse things over again; as in the first place, he should have renounced his Dispensing Power, and that of Levying Chim∣ny mony upon small Cottages and Ovens, directly contrary to Law. Next he should have Disbanded his standing Army, and kept up no Forces in time of Peace, besides the necessary Guard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his Person, the Number of which, should have been agreed upon by Parliament; which should also have S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te once every year, or two years at least; and lastly, that in respect of the Church, as long as he or his Successors continued of the Roman Catholick Religion, the Nomination of all Bishops, Arch-Bishops, Deans, with other
<PB N="804" REF="428"/>
Ecclesiastical preferments, which are not in the immediate Disposal of the Lord Chancellor, should have been in the Arch-Bishops, and Bishops of each Province, they choosing two, out of which his Majesty should have chosen one, for to supply each Bishoprick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as they became vacant.</P>
<P>And therefore for my own part, I was so far from believing all agreements with the King to be unpracticable, that there was no body rejoyced more than I, when upon his Majesty's first return to <HI>London,</HI> he so far Complied with the Desires of the whole Nation, as to issue out his Proclamation for a Free Parliament, and that he sent down his Commissioners to Treat with the Prince, and I had then great hopes of an Accommodation; but when instead of this, the King had burnt the Writs for the Election of Parliament Men, and had sent away the Queen and Prince, together with the Great Seal, that no more Writs might be issued, and that before ever the Commissioners could return to <HI>London,</HI> or before any Answer to the Princes Proposals was given by the King, he had withdrawn himself, and done all he could to get away into a Foreign Kingdom; it was then, and not till then, that I saw all hopes of Agree∣ment absolutely desperate: and though you put a great stress upon the Kings last return to Town, which you suppose, was with a Design to agree with the Prince in every thing, that could be in Reason demanded: I can see no cause for your drawing such a Consequence from it; for if he did not look upon himself as safe here before his Army was Disbanded, he could not think him∣self more so, when it was either wholly Dissolved, or else was gone over to the Prince; and therefore I have much greater reason to believe, that his re∣turn again to Town, was only to comply with the present necessity, and to wait for a fitter opportunity to get away, there being never a Vessel then rea∣dy to Transport him; especially if that be true which I have heard, that the King declared to a Person of Credit: <HI>That the Queen had obtained from him a Solemn Oath on the Sacrament, on the Sunday, that if she went for</HI> France <HI>on Monday, he would not fail to follow her on Tuesday</HI>; and if this were so, though he was dis∣appointed in his intended passage; yet still was he under the same obligation to the Queen; nor do I see any Transaction of his with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> or with these of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that can perswade me to believe other∣wise; sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e his long Consultation with the <HI>French</HI> Envoy, and the Priests and Jesuits could only tend to the taking new measures for his Departure, or else how he might Imbroil us further while he stayed, by some faint hopes of new Treaties and Agreements.</P>
<P>But as for the other part of your Answer, whereby you would confute my Notion, of the lawfulness of Resistance for the defence and preservation of our Religion Established by Law, as also of our Liberties and Properties; I hope I shall let you see, that it is not I, but your self, who are mistaken in this matter:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Sand. de oblig. con∣scien. pralect.</HI> V. §. 11. <HI>pra∣lect.</HI> VII. §. 4.</NOTE> For 1st. All Writers on this Subject, and even Dr. <HI>Sanderson</HI> himself, in his Lectures of the Obligati∣on of Conscience, do acknowledge that all Civil Government is principally ordained for the good and preservation of the Peo∣ple; and that the good of the Governours, is only to be con∣sidered, secondarily; and in order to that; which if so; I pray tell me whether the good and preservation of the people, ought not to
<PB N="805" REF="428"/>
be considered in the first place; since the end for which a thing is ordain'd, is always more worthy than the means, by which it is procured; and therefore I shall freely grant, that as long as the safety, and interest of the Supream Power, and that of the People are all one, and can any ways consist together; and that they make the happiness and preservation of the People to be the main end of their Government; I so far agree with you, that the good, or preservation of the Prince or Supream Powers, cannot, (nay ought not) to be separated from that of the People; but when they once set up a separate in∣terest quite different from that of the People; (as all Princes do, who turning Tyrants go about to inslave them) they then cease to be the true heads of that Political Body the Common Wealth, and thereupon the Community or Peo∣ple become free, and at liberty, either to oppose or remove these Artificial heads, and to set up new ones in their rooms; so that since similies are not Ar∣guments, your comparison between a Natural and Political Body, hath only served to impose upon your Judgment in this matter; and therefore I affirm that a Natural and Political Body do wholly differ in this matter; for in a Na∣tural Body, the real good of the head cannot be separated from that of the Body, nor the good of the Body from that of the Head, nor yet can the Body alone Judge of the proper means of it's own preservation, nor when it is hurt or assaulted, but by the head, which is the principle of sense and motion; but in a Political Body it is quite otherwise; for first, the Supream Powers of a Common-wealth, which you suppose to be Head of this Political Body, do often pursue and set up an interest quite different from, (nay contrary to) that of the Body or People, and that not only to their prejudice, but also some∣times to their destruction; and that when they do this, the Politcal Body, or the People will in evident and apparent cases Judge for themselves, let this Political Head say or declare what it will against it, and will when they are thus destroyed, opprest, and inslav'd, by those that they have submitted to as their Political Heads, and in such cases of extremity, endeavour to free them∣selves from the severity of their Yoke.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding what you have now said, I am not yet convinced, that the King had no real design to redress our grievances, and to make a final agree∣ment with the Prince; for though I do not deny but his Majesty did converse with some Priests, and others of his own persuasion, as also with the French Envoy after his coming to Town, yet might this be for no ill intent, and he did also converse with divers reverend Bishops and Lords of our own Religion, to whom he still expressed a great desire of making an end of all differences between himself, the Prince, and the whole Nation; and this I suppose is the true reason why the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> though it is true he signed the first and second Addresses to the Prince, upon his Majesty's first wth-drawing himself, yet has been ever since so sensible of that mistake he then committed, that he has never appeared or acted in any meeting of the Peers, nor yet in the Convention; and that his Majesty, even at <HI>Rochester,</HI> did not lay aside all thoughts of Agreement, and making up all breaches between himself and his People; I could give you another demonstration, which is not commonly known, and which I had from a particular Friend, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the King during his confinement there, sent a Lady I could name, on a message to two reve∣rend
<PB N="806" REF="429"/>
Prelates of our Church, (together with an Emrauld Ring from his Fin∣ger, as a Testimony of the Truth of her Commission) to this effect, That his Majesty being sensible of the sad condition the Church of <HI>England</HI> as well as he himself was in, and that there was no way so likely for him to get out of it, as by granting his Subjects, and particularly the Church of <HI>England,</HI> such se∣curities for the enjoyment of their just Rights and Liberties, as they could in reason demand; therefore he wholly left it to the discretion of those Bishops, to make to the Peers and Bishops that were then to meet suddenly, what∣ever proposals they should think reasonable on his behalf, for the satisfaction of the Church, and safety of the Nation, and that he would be ready to grant and ratifie them whensoever he should be required.</P>

<P>This is indeed more than ever I heard before, and can scarce believe; but did the Lady go and deliver her message? And pray what answer did those Bishop give to this fair proposal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the Lady did deliver her message, and these Bishops answer'd both to the same effect, that they had a real duty and affection for his Majesty, and a great desire to serve him; but that considering the great Power of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and his present aversion to any agreement with his Majesty, they very much feared that the Peers would not venture to give the Prince any such advice, or to interpose with him on his Majesties behalf, which in my opinion was very meanly, and cowardly done of them; who considering their duty to him as King, and also those particular obligations they owed him as their Bene∣factor, and who had been the greatest means of their being raised to those digni∣ties in his Brothers Reign; now I desire to know if this message had received its intended effect, what greater demonstration his Majesty could have given to satisfie the World that he really intended to set all things right again, had he been permitted to do it.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not farther question the Truth of this Relation, though perhaps I might have sufficient reason for it, since you say you had it from a person of good credit, and who was privy to this transaction; nor yet will I be so in∣quisitive as to know the names either of the Bishops, or of the Lady, since you make it a secret; but yet notwithstanding, I do still very much question, whether the King did ever really design to do what he then offer'd, and did not intend to put a sham upon their Lordships, to serve his present occasion, and to see if he could divide the Bishops and Peers of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> from the Prince of <HI>Oranges</HI> Interest: and so by making them offer such Proposals as the Prince should not think fit to agree to, might make them declare against his proceedings, which would have created great divisions, and heart-burnings between those of the high Church of <HI>England</HI> party, and the Prince: and thereby have involved us again in fresh disturbances, of which no doubt the King and the Popish Faction were like to receive the greatest advantage; for you know the old saying, <HI>divide, &amp; impera.</HI></P>
<P>But to let you see that I do not speak without just grounds for my opinion, let us examine every circumstance of this matter; first, if the King had meant really, is it likely that he would have trusted a business of that high moment to a Woman? When he had then the Lords of <HI>Alesbury</HI> and <HI>Arron,</HI> besides other Protestant Gentlemen then waiting on him, and they were much fitter
<PB N="807" REF="429"/>
to be trusted than this Lady, let her be whom she will? Or can any one believe if the King had meant really, that he would not have sent his Proposals in Writing, since he very well knew from the Princes Declaration, as well as the Bishops Petition and Addresses to him, what the whole Nation, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> in particular required, at his hands: But that he must send a loose and uncertain Message, which it was in his power to disown whenever he pleased, by saying, the foolish Woman mistook his meaning; and she also might be so much his Creature, as to take the fault wholly upon her self, when∣ever it should serve the Kings turn so to do; and therefore I think it was very wisely and honestly done of those reverend Prelets to refuse medling in such a ticklish affair, since it is plain by his not making any such proposals to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> himself, or the Lords about him, that he was not to be made privy to it, but rather it should be carried on, whether he would or no, and without giving him any satisfaction in his particular concern as to the Prince of <HI>Wales:</HI> and lastly, I desire you farther to consider, whether the King might not hereafter, when ever he had power, have made void whatever agree∣ments or concessions he should have then granted either to the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> or to the Nation, by pleading afterwards, that they were obtained by decrees whilst he was not <HI>sui juris,</HI> but under the Power of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>?</P>
<P>I have but one thing more to add, which I before omitted, which is to make some reply to what you said concerning the mischief that the Mob has done upon Houses, Forests, and Praks, since his Majesty's first departure; and therefore granting the matter of Fact, that much mischief and spoil has been committed; yet I deny that it is more than has been done by the most Arbitrary Kings, since the Conquest to this day, as you are pleased to affirm; for I believe you forget the Thirty Parish Churches, and Towns, which our Historian tell us, your <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, and his Son <HI>Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> destroyed, when they inlarged new Forrests, and therein acted contrary to their Oaths, like true despotick Tyrants; you likewise forget the miserable spoil and waste which King <HI>Iohn</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the III. made upon the Houses, Castles and Estates of the Barons, and Gentry of <HI>England,</HI> who opposed them in their unjust and illegal violations of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> besides other Tyrannical actions of the same kind committed by King <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the II. too long here to relate; but if these mischiefs were done you speak of, who have we to thank for it, but the King, who stealing away on the sudden, without leaving any orders for the Government of the Kingdom; all persons in Commission either Civil or Military, doubted whether their Commissions were no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at an end by the Kings deserting the Government as he did? besides, you very well know that the Common People were so enraged against the Popish Faction, for so many in∣solent actions they had committed in King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Reign, and so many appa∣rent breaches, and contempts of all the Laws made against them, that you cannot wonder if when they were rid of the fear of the Irish, and of King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Army, they kept their Arms in their hands, and took that opportuni∣ty of revenging themselves upon those, that they looked upon as the Authors of all this confusion; so that except the rifling of the House and Chappel of the Spanish Ambassador, which I grant was contrary to the Law of Nations, there
<PB N="808" REF="430"/>
were very few Popish Houses plunder'd or spoiled; but such as had before ren∣dered themselves some ways or other obnoxious to the Laws, by their Apostacy and accepting of Commissions, which they were utterly disabled by Law, to take; and though to my knowledge the Deputy Lieutenants, and Justices of the Peace, did their utmost in most Counties of <HI>England,</HI> to quell those Riots and Disorders, yet the Mobbile were too much enraged, and too numerous to be commanded, when like a vicious Horse, whose Rider is cast off, they run away with the Bridle in their Teeth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have made the best Apology for the Mob that the matter will bear; and I cannot deny in comparison of what has been done in other Nations on the like occasions; it was a very civil Mob, but yet this may serve to let us see the danger of your doctrine of Resistance, since by the same Law by, which they then pulled down, and plunder'd the Popish Chappels, and Roman Catholick Houses, by the like right they might have done the same violences upon any other Noblemans or Gentlemans House in <HI>England,</HI> whether a Papist or Pro∣testant, that they had a spleen to, since it was but their crying out, that he was a Papist, or at least a favourer of them, and then it had been enough to make them suffer, as if they really had been so; as I could tell you of my own know∣ledge, of a very honest Gentleman of my acquaintance, who because he was a true Son of the Church, and had been always a Loyal Subject to his Majesty, and a great Enemy to the Whig Faction in the Countrey, and had also put the Laws severely in execution against the Dissenters, was like to have had his House plunder'd by the Phanatick Mob of a certain Town, from which this Gentlemans House was not far distant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you please to consider it, this is a very unjust inference from our Doctrine; for these actions were not any resistance of the Supream Powers of the Nation, but certain violent actions or revenges, which the Rabble thought they might take upon those whom they looked upon as publick Enemies, when there was no civil or military Power in being, that was of sufficient strength to keep them in order; but if you please to call to mind my positions; I do by no means allow the Rabble or Mob of any Nation to take Arms against a Civil Government, but only the whole Community of the People of all De∣grees and Orders, commanded by the Nobility and Gentry thereof: and though I grant the People may be sometimes mistaken in the exercise of this Right (as what is there, though never so lawful, that may not be abused,) yet I think you will grant that the bare abuse of a lawful thing, is no sufficient ground for the taking away the liberty of exercising it; and I think I have sufficiently proved, that the total denial of this Liberty, would be of far worse consequence to whole Nations and Kingdoms, nay to all mankind, than the allowing of it, (as those of my opinion do) only in cases of Extream necessity, and when no other remedy will serve.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not renew this old dispute again, about Resistance, we sufficiently know one anothers minds about it, and are not, as I can see, like to bring over either of us to the others opinion; but since I know you have studied the Common Laws, and Histories of this Kingdom better than I, I cannot forbear making divers just reflections upon the late proceedings of the Convention; for tho' indeed they had no Legal Authority to assemble upon the circular Letters of a
<PB N="809" REF="430"/>
Foreign Prince, yet since this was the greatest (if not the only liberty we had left us) I will not quarrel or dispute the legality of their meeting, but then they must use it only for lawful ends, and such as in their private capacities they were obliged to pursue if they were able; therefore when they assem∣bled, if they would have maintain'd the due Rights of Monarchy and Suc∣cession in this Kingdom, sure they ought in the first place, to have inquired what was become of the King, where he was, and who forced him to go away? and when they had known that, they ought then to have joyn'd in Addressing to the Prince, that since he had declared that he came not to Conquer this Nation, but only to free it from Arbitrary Government, and restore it to its just Laws, that there could be no sure enjoyment of these without the King, therefore he would join with them in sending to him, to desire him to return to the Government of these Kingdoms, and to Govern them according to Law; but instead of this they not only neglected taking any notice of the King, as if he were not at all in Being, but have also refused to receive those gracious Letters he sent them, in which he promised <HI>To amend all former Errours,</HI> and to Govern according to Law; which certainly deserved to be taken notice of, since coming from their Lawful Prince, they ought at least to have proposed some terms to him, before they had proceeded to that rash and unparallell'd Vote, which I desire I may read to you, word for word, be∣cause I intend to examine every clause of it. Resolved,</P>
<P><HI>That King</HI> James <HI>the</HI> II. <HI>having endeavoured to Subvere the Constitution of this Kingdom, by breaking the Original Contract, between King and People; and by the Advice of Iesuits and other wicked persons, having violated the Fundamental Laws, and having withdrawn himself out of this Kingdom, hath Abdicated the Government, and that the Throne is thereby vacant.</HI> I shall make bold to consider each of these Clauses, one alter another; and therefore first pray take notice, that this Vote of the two Houses, cost above a weeks Debate in the House of Lords, which past in the House of Commons in two or three days; because divers of the Lords, as well Temporal, as Spiritual, did with great Honour, Reason and Re∣solution, oppose and protested against it to the last; and it was carried at last by a very small Majority: but that we may examine each Clause in this Vote; first, it is here only said, <HI>That King</HI> James II. <HI>endeavoured to Subvert the Constitu∣tion of this Kingdom,</HI> not that he really did it, which is as much lower, than you are pleas'd to put it as endeavouring, a thing falls short of actually doing it; and therefore it is very hard to Declare a Prince to have forfeited, or Abdicated his Kingdom, for bare Designing and Indeavouring, since those things that you bring to prove it, may bear a much more favourable Interpretation, especially with Subjects, who are no fit Judges of the private Designs of Princes, which may oftentimes tend to quite other purposes, than what we suppose.</P>
<P>As for the next Clause, <HI>by breaking the Original Contract</HI>; I have heard that divers of the Lords and Bishops, who were for the King against this new In∣vention of an Abdication, put the other side very hard to it, to make out this Original Contract, and desired them to shew in what part, either of our Com∣mon or Statute Law it was to be found; for they knew no such Maxim in the Common Law, nor no such Clause in any Statute, Aucient or Mo∣dern.</P>
<P><PB N="810" REF="431"/>And though I confess, you have undertaken to prove to me, that there is such a thing; yet it has been only by Far-fetch't Consequences, and from the Old Form of Government among the <HI>Saxons,</HI> of above 600 years standing; which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there were any such thing, it is now become so Antiquated, and out of Date, that neither the King himself, nor yet our Lords, Bishops or Judges, except some few Lawyers of your Kidney, ever before now, thought of any such thing. I pass by the next Clause, by the Advice of Jesuits, <HI>&amp;c</HI> because I cannot say, by whose Advice those things which you call Breaches of the Fundamental Laws were acted; but as for the next, wherein the Violation of these Fundamental Laws is lay'd to his Charge, I confess you have given me a prety large Catalogue of these Fundamentals, at our 9th meeting, which yet you cannot say, are to be found together in any one Law; but are to be picked up here and there, out of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and divers other old Statutes; but since the King and Parliament have declar'd in the first year of King <HI>Iames</HI> I▪ that there are such things as Fundamental Laws and Priviledges; I will not deny there are none; yet certainly any Breach of them by the King, was never intended to Create a Forfeiture of the Crown; for if it had, I think there would have been but few Kings or Queens of <HI>England,</HI> which would not have forfeited, who for some one or more of these Breaches committed in their Reigns, by the Advice of their Judges and Councellors, as these were lately by the King; For I suppose, you cannot expect that Princes should see any otherwise in matters of Government, than by other Mens Eyes, nor hear, but by other Peoples Ears: And therefore if the wilful Breach of these Fundamentals, must cause a Forfeiture or Abdication of Government (call it which you please) methinks it had been reasonable for the Parliament to have given a list of these Fundamentals in some one Law, that the King might have been sure to have avoided the Transgressing of them; and fear of losing both his Roy∣al Dignity, and his penalty ought also to have been declared.</P>
<P>But the next Clause deserves more particular consideration, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>and having withdrawn himself out of the Kingdom, hath Abdicated the Government</HI>; now I must confess, it is the first time that ever the Kings going away, for fear of losing both his Royal Dignity, and his Life, and that with a declar'd design and intention, to return again to the exercise of the Government, when ever he might do it with safety,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D.D. p.</HI> 147.</NOTE> should be judged a wil∣ful Dessertion or Abdication. I am sure, there is nothing in our Common or Statute Laws, that can at all warrant this Notion; for Common Law, is nothing but Ancient usage, and immemorial Custom. Now Cu∣stom supposes presidents, and parallel Cases: But it's granted of all Hands, that the Crown of <HI>England</HI> was never judged to be Abdicated, by the with∣drawing of the Prince, before now: And therefore it follows, by undeniable consequence, that this Opinion can have no Foundation in the Common Law; because there is not so much as one ruled Case to prove it by.</P>
<P>But if we come to those presidents we have in our English History, I shall give you such of them as I can remember: we read in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2d. that when he fled from the Forces of his Wife and Son, who had sei∣zed the Kingdom by Force, the King being deserted by his Souldiers and Followers, indeavoured to get into the Isle of <HI>Lundy</HI> for safety; but not being
<PB N="811" REF="431"/>
able to make it, was driven back, and taken in Disguise at the Abby of <HI>Neath</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI>; (as the King was lately at <HI>Feversham</HI>) now it is certain, that King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> went away, without appointing any Governour of the Realm in his ab∣sence, and if this Notion of an Abdication, had been then taken for Law, the Parliament needed not to have been put their to Shifts, to find out so many other matters for which to depose him. The next is the like case, of King <HI>Edward</HI> the 4th. who when the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> had Raised a great Army against him on a suddain, and forced him to fly, with a few followers to the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> his Brother in Law, though <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th. was again put into the Throne; yet was it not objected against King <HI>Edward,</HI> that he had lost his Title to it, or that it was become vacant, by his Deserting it; and if these two are not parallel Cases, and do not reach the matter in hand, I desire you to shew me, wherein they differ from the present Case of the King.</P>
<P>But I am come now to the last clause of all, <HI>that the Throne is thereby become vacant,</HI> which seeming only to refer to the clause of Abdication: I think I have said enough already against that Notion: Therefore we will admit at pre∣sent, for Discourse sake, that the King had really Abdicated the Government, by Deserting the Kingdom, and thereby wholly lost his Regal Power. Now according to the Fundamental Laws and Customs of this Realm, which is (you know) an Hereditary Monarchy, the eldest Son, or other next Heir, either Male or Female, immediately Succeeds the King his Father, or other Predecessor, and that without any <HI>inter-regnum</HI> at all, so that the Reign of the Successor, immediate∣ly begins from the very moment the Last King or Queen Deceases; this being the setled Law, I cannot see any one step the Convention has made in their whole proceeding that can be justified by the Fundamental Laws of the Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. D.</HI> 149.</NOTE> or the Laws of Equity and Justice; for Equity has no quirks in it, nor ever lies at a catch. Reason is always just and generous, it never makes mens misfortunes an accusation, nor judges in favour of violence; for indeed what can be more unrighteous (though in the Case of a private person) than that any one should suffer, yet worse for being injured, and be barred his rights for the injuries of others? If a man should for∣feit his House to those who set it on Fire, only because he quitted it without giving some formal directions to the Servants; or be obliged to lose his Estate for endeavouring to preserve his life; I believe it would be thought a strange piece of Justice in any Law whatever; and if this be proved illegal, the Title of your Present King and Queen being wholly founded upon the validity of this Vote, will prove so likewise.</P>

<P>Well, you have made a pretty long discourse in Defence of King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Actions, as well as his late Desertion, and <HI>I</HI> have heard you patiently, because I grant you have collected together a great deal of matter in few words; and I think all that can be justly urged in your Kings defence; I shall therefore begin with the first false step that you say the Convention made, in not in∣quiring after the Causes of the Kings departure, whither he was gone, and their not voting of an Address to the Prince, to desire his return; as for the first of these, they were not at all obliged to do it, since a great many of the Peers and Bishops, who were then in Town, very well knew the Causes of the Kings Departure, and that he either went a way voluntarily, or at least

without any other necessity than what he had brought upon himself, by his own evil Government, or the ill Council of others, which may be easily proved by several Circumstances; for it is very well known, that above a formight before the King went away, the Lord D—and Mr. <HI>Brent</HI> did not stick to declare that it was necessary that the King should withdraw him∣self; so that it is plain the Popish Faction knew of it long before it was done, and that it proceeded wholly from their advice appears further, by a Letter to the King, when he was at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> which can be yet produced; he was there told that it was the unanimous advice of all the Catholicks at <HI>London,</HI> that he should come back from thence, and withdraw himself out of the Kingdom, and leave us in <HI>confusion,</HI> assuring him, that within two years or less, we should be in such confusions, that he might return <HI>and have his ends of us.</HI> Now if the King was pleased to take such a desperate Counsellors Advice, and thereupon to do all he could to quit the Kingdom, the cause of his going is too evident, as well as his design of returning, to have his ends of us (as they phrase it) that is in plain English, to have both our Religion, Liberties, and Properties wholly at his disposal; nor in the next place needed they inquire where he was, for every one knew he was gone into <HI>France,</HI> to the greatest Enemy of our Religion and Nation, as well as the Princes; and therefore it had been altogether unsafe and indiscreet for them to have joined in any Address to the Prince for his return; for whilst he was in such hands, what hopes could we have of his returning to us with better (but rather worse) affections towards the Church of <HI>England</HI> and this Nation, than what he carried with him?</P>
<P>But you say they refus'd to receive his Letters▪ for my part I do not know that he ever sent any, at least to the House of Commons. I heard indeed, that one of the Kings Ordinary Servants, was at the Door of the House with such a Letter, but that he was so inconsiderable, that no body would receive the Letter, or make any mention of it in the House: and it was very strange, that the King should have never a Friend there, who had so much courage and kindness for him, as would take the Letter and move for the reading of it, though he had run the risque of being committed for his pains; so that the House of Commons is not to be blamed for not receiving a Letter which was never offer'd them; but as for the House of Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I have been told it was moved to be read there, but it was carried in the Negative, because it was not brought by a person of sufficient quality and credit; and therefore it was the Kings fault if he would imploy such mean persons in a matter of that great moment, and indeed if we may give credit to those Copies of these Letters which I have seen, they retain'd rather a Justification of his past actions, than an acknowledgement of those violations he had committed upon our Laws, for as to his promising to Govern by Law, there is nothing in that, for he ne∣ver yet own'd that he Govern'd otherwise; 'tis true, there is in one of those Letters, an expression of his amending past Errours; but those are general words, and may mean such Errours, as he had committed in the ill manage∣ment of his Designs, which he would have mended, when ever he was to do the like things again; this may very well be the true Sence of a Letter, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very likely written, with the Equivocation of the Jesuits and French advice of a Cabal.</P>
<P><PB N="813" REF="432"/>But you would have him sent for to return upon certain Terms; I won∣der you should be so undutiful, as to urge it, since if he is an absolute King, without any Conditions what ever, he ought certainly to be restored, as King <HI>Charles,</HI> the Second was, without any Terms or Conditions at all; and rather so, than with them, since he cannot give us greater assurances for his keeping them, than he has already broke, unless you can suppose, he would give us the Guarranty of the Pope and the King of <HI>France</HI> for their performance; the for∣mer of whom believes, that there is no Faith to be kept with Hereticks; and for the latter, supposing the King and him to pass his word, for the performance of these Conditions, pray consider whether the bond of two Bankrupts, can ever pass for a good Security; and so much for the Letters and Address.</P>
<P>I come now in the next place, to consider your exceptions against that Fun∣damental Vote of the House of Commons, concerning King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Abdication of the Government, and thereupon declaring the Throne Vacant: To begin with your first exception, I think it is a very small one, that because this Vote declares the King to have endeavour'd to Subvert the Constitution of this King∣dom; that it was very unjust, to declare him to have Abdicated the Govern∣ment for a bare endeavour, because we are ignorant of the true ends of the Actions of Princes; to which I answer, that in this Case, a bare endeavour ought to be sufficient; if it be so evident, that there can be no dispute about it; for if he had once actually subverted it, the two Houses could never have met to have made this Vote; and if in the case of Kings, the very bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> design or endeavour to destroy them be sufficient, though it be never reduced into act; I cannot see why by the same rule the endeavours of Kings to destroy the fun∣damental constitution of a mixt or limited Kingdom should not have the like construction in respect of them; since according to the maxime you but now cited, (and which I have sufficiently justified) that in all such Govern∣ments, the safety and preservation of the People (that is, of the Government they have established) is to be preferr'd before that of the King alone, when acting in a direct opposition thereunto, or otherwise, it would be in the Kings Power to destroy the constitution whenever he pleas'd, since according to your doctrine, the bare endeavouring it would be nothing; and after he had once brought it to pass, it would be then too late to retrieve it.</P>
<P>But that the King did really endeavour thus to subvert the fundamental con∣stitution, appears not only by his closeting and threatning Members to turn them out of their places, if they would not submit to his Will in taking off the Penal Laws about Religion, whereby all freedom of Voting would have been quite taken away; But when the King saw this would not do, he then fell a new modelling of Corporations, and by bringing <HI>Quo Warranto</HI>'s against their Charters, to get it into his own power to nominate, or approve of all Mayors, Aldermen, and Common Council men, who in those Corporations having the sole Elections of Parliament men, he would thereby have had the naming of them also in his power: your next exception is against their declaring him to have broke the Original Contract between the King and the People, for that you are not yet persuaded there was any such thing, because we cannot shew it you in any Common Law or Statute Book, written in express words, as for the Statute Law, I grant that there is no such express Contract to be found in
<PB N="814" REF="433"/>
any Statute; yet doth it not therefore follow, that there is no such Contract by the Antient Common Law of the Kingdom. Now that our Fundamental Laws are not all to be found in writing is no wonder; since it is a maxime of our Common Law, that it was not a Law, because it was Written, but it was Written because it was a Law, for it was a Law when it was only in the Breast and Heads of the King and People of this Nation, without any writing at all; and you your self must grant, that if the Hereditary Succession to the Crown, be a Fundamental Constitution, it is notwithstanding no where to be found in Writings as I know of, but the contrary asserted by divers Acts of Par∣liament; but that there is such a thing as an Original Contract, I shall prove from such a necessary consequence as I think cannot be denied; for as that Statute of King <HI>Iames.</HI> I. sets forth (which I have now cited) and your self have already acknowledged, there are such things as Fundamental Laws, (that is, Laws that are as antient as the constitution of the Government) there must have been also an implicit Fundamental Covenant or Contract on the Kings part, that he would maintain them, without any violation, and this is that we mean by an Original Contract; and if it were not so, it had been the most foolish and unreasonable thing in the World to require every King to swear before he was Crown'd, that he would maintain the Rights of the Church, and the Antient Laws and Customs of the Kingdom; and that this was Antiently looked upon as a renewal of this Original Contract appears by all our antient Historians, who till the Reign of King <HI>Ed.</HI> I. never give the next Heir the Title of King, but of Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> till he was actually Crown'd, and had taken his Coronation Oath: and for this <HI>I</HI> desire you would consult all our antient Histo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians since your Conquest, beginning with <HI>Ingu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> and <HI>Eadmerus,</HI> ending with <HI>Thom. Walsingham.</HI></P>
<P>But as for your exception against his violating of the Fundamental Laws is yet more trivial, for you cannot deny that there are such things, and if so, surely a King may violate them, if he pleases; and therefore your excuse for the Kings breach of them, because they are not to be found together in any one place, but are to be pick'd up here and there from <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and other Statutes, makes nothing against the validity or the possibility of his knowing them; for as before they were reduced to Writing by those Statutes (which only declare and confirm the Antient Common Laws, and Liberties of <HI>England</HI>) they existed (as I said but now) in the Heads and Hearts of the King and Peo∣ple: so when divers Kings of <HI>England</HI> by their Tyrannical and Illegal practices had made divers violations of these Fundamental Rights and Priviledges there then grew a necessity of new granting and confirming those Liberties, and con∣sequently of reducing them into Writing, which there was not before, and that is the true reason why <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and other Statutes, made in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the III. <HI>Ed.</HI> the I. and divers others of their Successors were made, either for their explanation, or ratification, according as occasion requir'd; and as several Princes, had more or less violated these fundamental Laws of the Government, for before they had so done, there was no need of the Par∣liaments making, or declaring any law about it. But if the King would have but read and considered the Articles exhibited in Parliament against <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the II. he might easily have seen the Laws altogether, that will
<PB N="815" REF="433"/>
make a Prince to be declared by his Subjects to have forfeited his Crown.</P>
<P>But that King <HI>Iames</HI> had before his desertion endeavour'd to extirpate the Protestant Religion, the Laws, and Liberties of the Nation, appears by those several Articles, the Convention has given us in their late Declaration, which they presented to King <HI>William</HI> upon their declaring him and his Princess, K. and Queen of <HI>England,</HI> to which I shall refer you, since it is commonly to be had; you know it consists in the recital of divers things, the violation of which has been always counted in all Kings Reigns a breach of the Original Contract.</P>
<P>I come now to the last Clause save one you except against, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That hav∣ing withdrawn himself out of the Kingdom, hath Abdicated the Government.</Q>
Now your main argument against it is, that the Kings desertion of the Govern∣ment being only for fear of his life, or of being depos'd from his Royal Dignity, could not by his going away be said to Abdicate, or renounce the Crown, since he went away with an intention to return, and repossess it as soon as with safety he might; to which before I make any answer, I must freely own, that were this the case as you have put it, I think there would be no great dispute in it; since I grant that a King who is thus forc'd to fly for fear of his life ought not to have any such injustice put upon him; but if you please better to con∣sider it, the case was quite otherwise; for I have already proved that when King <HI>Iames</HI> I. went away, he had then an Army about him, was free, and in his own Pallace, and was at that time in actual Treaty with the Prince; nor had <HI>London,</HI> nor any considerable strong place in <HI>England</HI> then surrender'd it self to the Prince; so that if there was any necessity for his departure, but what he had brought upon himself by his refusing to call a Parliament, burning the Writs, and sending away the Queen and Child, together with the main instrument of Government, the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI>; this must certainly be looked upon as a wilful Forfeiture or Abdication of the Government; and it is from this first going away, that I suppose that the Convention dates his Abdication, since though it is true, after his return to <HI>London</HI> he took upon him to make an Or∣der in Council to stop the further pulling down and plundering Popish Chappels, and Papists Houses; yet was it sign'd by very few of the Council, and almost only by those who had been in some Office or Place of Trust; so that though he was then own'd by them; yet since that Order did only serve to shew his Zeal for the Popish Party, and was never obey'd or taken notice of by those to whom it was directed; and that neither the Prince nor the City of <HI>London</HI> owned him afterwards; since it had already delivered it self up to the Prince, and had as well as the Peers invited him to repair to that City; I cannot see that so slight an act as this Order of Council, should be counted a return to, or a re-establishment in the Throne; since the King had not only lost the Crown by his wilful departure, without calling a Parliament, or giving the P. any satisfaction in the great business of the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> or the Nation by repairing up those desperate breaches he had made upon our Funda∣mental Laws, but had also lost his Title to the Crown, by being Conquer'd by the Prince in open War, as I shall prove more at large another time; so that if you please better to consider this Vote of the Convention, you will find, that these words <HI>had Abdicated the Government,</HI> do not only refer to the last clause of his having withdrawn himself out of the Kingdom, but to every∣one

of the foregoing Clauses, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<Q>His having endeavour'd to subvert the Constitution of this Kingdom; his breaking the Original Contract, and his having violated the Fundamental Laws;</Q>
so that it is plain their notion of Ab∣dication was not fixt only in the Kings Desertion, or bare withdrawing him∣self out of the Kingdom, but from his renouncing the Legal Title, by which he held the Crown; and setting himself up as a Despotick Soveraign, and ruling by a mercenary Army; and therefore all that you have said about the Kings <UNCLEAR>quitting</UNCLEAR> the Government with a design to return to it again, as soon as with safety he might, is altogether vain; for as he went away, because he would not Govern any longer as a King by Law; so hath he yet given us no satisfaction that he would not return again to Govern otherwise, or rather worse than he did before, had he an opportunity so to do, that is (as the Letter I cited but now, phrases i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) <HI>to return, and have his ends of us</HI>; so that this being indeed the case, I think I can very well justifie the last clause in this Vote, that the Throne was thereby vacant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you have spoke a considerable time, and I doubt more than I can distinctly remember to answer as I should; therefore before you proceed to this last Clause of the Vacancy of the Throne, the dispute about which I foresee may hold longer than upon any of the former; pray give me leave to reply to what you have already said in Justification of all the other parts of this Vote; in the first place I will not deny, but that if the King had once got the power of making what Mayors, Aldermen, and other Officers in Corpo∣rations at his pleasure, it would have gone a great way towards the making the Majority of the Parliament-men; nay, I likewise grant that by his dispen∣sing Power, he might have made what Papists or other person he pleased She∣riffs in any County, who would have made such return of Knights of Shires as he should have thought fit: yet I suppose this would not have been to the subversion of the Constitution of the Kingdom, which I think I have proved to consist ori∣ginally in the K. alone, before any great Councils or Parliaments were instituted.</P>
<P>And as for those violations of the Fundamental Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, the Declaration instances in; I think several of them may very well be justified by antient Presidents, and ad judged cases in Law; and there∣fore were so far from being violations, that they are no more than the Kings exercising of his due Prerogative; and though at our ninth meeting, I had not time so well to consider these matters, as also because I was not then prepared to defend the Kings Proceedings; I shall therefore make bold to examine the most considerable of those Articles, which the Late Declaration supposes did so highly tend to subvert the Protestant Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom. I shall begin with the first, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<Q>His assuming and exer∣cising a power of Dispensing with, and Suspending of Laws, and the Execu∣tion of Laws, without consent of Parliament;</Q>
which Power, let me tell you by the way, was not asserted to Dispence with all Laws or Statutes whatsoever, but only such as the Subject has no particular cause of action in; and where the damage that may arise by it doth not concerns, the publick safety of which the K. is sole Judge, and not any particular mans interest. I suppose you cannot but have read, that learned and short account of the Authorities in Law, upon which Judgment was given in Sir <HI>Edw. Hales</HI> his Case written by Sir <HI>Edward
<PB N="817" REF="440"/>
Herbert,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, in vindication of himself, wherein I think he proves beyond any possibility of a just answer, that the dispensation granted to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> to receive a commission,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 6, 7.</NOTE> and act as a Collonel of Foot was good, notwithstand∣ing his not having received the Sacrament, and taken the Oaths and Test,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 2.</NOTE> appointed by the Act of the Statute of the 25 of <HI>Charles</HI> II. where he first proves from my L. <HI>Cock</HI>'s Authority, that it belongs to the Kings Prerogative to Dispence with all Positive, or Penal Laws; the penalty thereof is only popular and given to the King; and to shew you that my Lord <HI>Cook</HI> (who was never counted any great friend to the Kings Prerogative) was not single in this opinion;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 11, 12.</NOTE> he gives you also the authority of the year Book of <HI>Henry</HI> the VII. where it was own'd by all the Judges,
<Q>That the King can Dispence with all things which are only <HI>Mala Prohibita,</HI> and not <HI>Mala</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>se,</HI> though expresly forbid by Act of Parliament, for though (says the Year Book) before the Statute, Coin∣ing of Money was Lawful, but now it is not so, yet the King can Dispence with it; so that, say I, if he can dispence with that which is now made Trea∣son by <HI>Eà.</HI> the III. he may certainly dispence with all other Penal Statutes of a less nature.</Q></P>
<P>But because I grant there is some difference between Common Penal Laws, which barely prohibit the doing of some things, under a penalty; and this Act, in which there is also an express Clause of <HI>Non-obstante,</HI> that all Licences or Dispensations contrary to this Act, are declared absolutely void, yet the said Lord Chief Justice likewise proves, that this Clause of <HI>Non-obstante</HI> is void, and he makes this out not only from constant practice in other Statutes of like nature, but also from the opinions of <HI>Plowden,</HI> and the said Lord <HI>Cook</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 8.</NOTE> first as to the Statutes,
<Q>there is a Statute of the 23. of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI. that no man shall be Sheriff for above a year. 2. That all Letters Patents, made for Years or Lives shall be void, 3. That no <HI>Non-obstante</HI> shall make them good, (which shews that the Par∣liament thought the King could otherwise have dispenc'd with this act by a <HI>Non obstante</HI>) there is likewise in this Act a Penalty of 200 <HI>l.</HI> and the party is also disabled from bearing the Office of Sheriff in any County of <HI>England</HI>; and also every Pardon for such Offence shall be void;</Q>
so that in all respects this Statute answers that of King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. now in dispute, only in this the Penalty to the Prosecutor is higher, <HI>viz.</HI> 500 <HI>l.</HI> and the disability is not only from holding that Office, but any other whatsoever for the future.</P>
<P>And yet it was resolved by all the Judges of <HI>England</HI> in the se∣cond of <HI>Henry</HI> the VII. in the Exchequer Chamber,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>VI.</HI> The Year Book. 2. <HI>H.</HI> 7. <HI>T. M.</HI></NOTE> upon the Kings Power of Dispensing with this Statute of the 23. of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI. that the Kings Dispensation with that Statute was good: and so it hath been held ever since, for it is very well known that the King hath not only exercised this Prerogative of Dispensing with this Statute, for divers Sheriffs holding more than a year, but hath also granted this Office for Life, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> appears by the same case cited by <HI>Plowden</HI> (in his Commentaries) between <HI>Grendon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 502.</NOTE> and the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> where he expresly says,
<Q>That notwithstanding this Statute of
<PB N="818" REF="441"/>
<HI>Henry</HI> the VI. the Kings Grant to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> to be Sheriff during Life, ought to have a Clause of <HI>Non-obstante,</HI> because of the precise words of the Statute before mentioned: and with such a Clause of <HI>Non-ob∣stante</HI> the Patent to the Earl was good.</Q></P>
<P>But yet my Lord <HI>Cook</HI> is more express in his opinion con∣cerning these Dispensations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 18.</NOTE> for in his twelfth Report he has these words;
<Q>No act can bind the King from any Prerogative, which is sole and inseparable to his Person, but that he may Dispence with it by a <HI>Non-obstante,</HI> as a Sovereign Power to command any of his Subjects to serve him for the publick Weal; and this solely and inseparably is annext to his person; and this Royal Power cannot be restrained by any Act of Parliament, neither in <HI>Thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> nor in <HI>Hypothesi,</HI> but that the King by his Royal Prerogative may Dispence with it; for upon the commandment of the King, and obedience of the Subject do's his Government consist; and therefore for this reason he allows this Judgment of all the Justices in <HI>England,</HI> in the second of <HI>Henry</HI> the VII. to have been according to Law, that Judg'd the Kings Dispensation with this Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI. to be good; and he also instances in another Statute,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 31.</NOTE> in the fourth of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. in which it is ordain'd,</Q>
<Q>That no Welshman should be Justice, Chamberlain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor any other Officer whatsoever, in any part of <HI>Walts,</HI> notwithstanding any Patent made to the contrary, with Clause of <HI>Non-obstante licet sit Wallicus natus,</HI> and yet without question the King may grant those now Offices to Welshmen with a <HI>Non obstante,</HI> and the said Lord <HI>Cook</HI> in <HI>Calvin</HI>'s case tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rep.</HI> 7. <HI>P.</HI> 14.</NOTE></Q>
<Q>That the same was resolved by all the Judges of <HI>England,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> in 2. of <HI>Hen.</HI> VII.) that every Subject is by his natural Allegiance bound to serve and obey his sovereign, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and he then proceeds to recite the Statute of the 23. of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI. and the opinion of the Judges above mentioned, and gives us this reason for it, for that the act could not barr the King of the service of his Subject which the Law of Na∣ture did give unto him;</Q>
This is there reported as the sense of all the Judges of <HI>England</HI> in King <HI>Iames</HI> his time; and therefore since this has been ever the opinion of the Judges, and a constant Prerogative exercis'd by the King ever since; I desire you would shew me any difference why the Kings Dispensation to a Sheriff should be good for the holding of his Office for above a year, norwith∣standing the Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI. and yet a Dispensation for the taking or holding any Office or Command Civil or Military, without taking the Oaths and Tests, appointed by the 25. of <HI>Charles</HI> the II. should be declar'd a breach of our Fundamental Laws; for I can see no manner of difference between them; since their preambles set forth the designs of the Law, much to the same pur∣pose, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<Q>That of making the Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI. is the insupportable damage of the King and his People, Perjury, Man-slaughter, and great Oppression; and in the Statute of King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. the mischiefs recited are of a much less nature, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</Q>
<Q>for preventing dangers which may happen from Popish Recusants, and quieting the minds of his Majesties good Sub∣jects. So that the Subject of neither of these Acts being <HI>Mala in se,</HI> but only <HI>Mala prohibita,</HI> if the King might Dispence with the one, he may certainly do as much with the other for the same reasons.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="819" REF="441"/>Therefore if this be so, I need not say much against the second Article in the Declaration of the Convention against the Kings proceedings, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<Q>His committing and prosecuting divers worthy Prelates, for humbly Petitioning to be excused from concurring to the said assumed Power; for if by the opi∣nion of all or most part of the then Judges, the Kings Power of Dispensing with this Statute of King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. was good, it was certainly much more lawful in Dispensing with all other Statutes against Papists and Non-confor∣mists, since they are no more than bire Penal Statutes, without any Clauses of <HI>Non-obstante</HI>; and though I grant that King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Declaration giving a To∣leration to Papists and Dissenters, by Dispensing with all the Acts against Masses and Conventicles were declared Illegal by the House of Commons, in the year 1672. and that the King, to get a good lump of Money, did recal that Declaration, yet was it never declared by him to be Illegal; only that it should not be drawn into consequence for the future; and you know an Address or Declaration of the House of Commons alone, was never looked upon as a De∣claration of Parliament; and the opinion of the Judges hath ever been, that no Statute or Judgment of Parliament can bar the King of his Lawful Prero∣gatives, (of which this of Dispensing with such Penal Laws is one) so that it was certainly very undutifully done of the Bishops not only to deny distributing his Majesties Late Declaration for Liberty of Conscience in their several Dio∣cesses, but also to have the confidence to give him a Petition, wherein they desir'd him not to insist upon the distribution and reading of it, because it was against Law; tho' admit it were, being no way contrary to the Law of God, they ought to have obeyed it, since their bare distributing of it had not ren∣dered it the more Lawful; so that it being a great misdemeanour in these Bi∣shops to deliver this Petition; their Commitment and Prosecution at Law for the same was also Legal, and what the Privy Council told his Majesty he might well justifie; so that if the King was too severe in this matter, they were to bear the blame, and not he.</Q></P>

<P>I cannot deny but you have given a just account of the main Arguments made use of by the late Lord Chief Justice <HI>Merbert</HI> in defence of the Kings dis∣pensing Power, and of giving his own opinion for it; but I think notwith∣standing all that Gentleman has Written in defence of it, that the Kings De∣claration of Indulgence, and his Dispensation grounded thereupon, to be both of them void and contrary to Law; and for proof of this I shall first give you the opinion both of those Divines and Civilians,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I.E.C.</HI> p. 33. <HI>L.</HI> 6. <HI>C.</HI> 14.</NOTE> concerning this matter, as first <HI>Sware<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in his learned Book <HI>de Legibus,</HI> saith,

Grotiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> saith expresly, <HI>Dispensare, hoc est, lege solvere, le solus potest qui serendae abrogand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>que legis potestatem habet.</HI></Q>
<HI>Pusen∣dors</HI> affirms,
<Q>That none can Dispence with a Law, but such as have the Power of making it; and the very reason of the thing
<PB N="820" REF="442"/>
sufficiently shews it, for to dispense is to take away the Obligation of the Law in respect of them to whom it is granted, and whoever takes it away, must have the power of laying it on; and there is no difference between the dispen∣sation of a Law, and the Abrogation of it; but that a dispensation is an abroga∣tion of it to particular persons, while others are under the force of it; and an abrogation is a general dispensation, that being no more than a relaxation of the whole Law to those persons who were bound by it before; therefore if the King have not the whole legislative power of this Kingdom (as I think I have already proved he has not) he neither can have the sole power of dispen∣sing with Laws.</Q></P>
<P>But to answer your main argument, that the constant practice hath been otherwise for the space of above 200 years, and that confirm'd by the Judg∣ment and Opinions of all the Judges and most considerable Lawyers in <HI>England</HI> ever since that time; to answer this I say, it is necessary, that I give you a short History of this Dispensing Power, and the Original of Dispensations, with <HI>Non obstantes,</HI> which are so far from being as old as your Conquest, that the first news we hear of them, is from <HI>Mat. Paris,</HI> who expresly tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>O. E. I. p.</HI> 66. <HI>&amp; dein. Vi. Mat. Par. P.</HI> 810, 811. <HI>Ibid. P.</HI> 817, 818. <HI>P.</HI> 854. <HI>P.</HI> 875.</NOTE> they were first introduced by the Pope, and were af∣terwards inserted into the Kings Patents and Protections, in imitation of them by King <HI>Henry</HI> III. so they were never made use of by any of our Kings to ellude Acts of Parliament, till after the Statute of <HI>Mortmain,</HI> which was made in the seventh of <HI>Edward</HI> I. which first attempt, must needs be Illegal, because contrary to <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> ch. 36. which is the first Law which prohibits Alienations in <HI>Mortmain,</HI> and was not only sworn to when enacted, but is also confirmed by many after Acts of Parliament, and ordered to be observed in all points, insomuch that when the Clergy petitioned King <HI>Edward</HI> I. for a relaxation of this Statute of <HI>Mortmain,</HI> his answer was, that he could not do it, because it was Enacted, <HI>Communi Consi∣lio Magnatum suorum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hen. Knigh∣ton,</HI> p. 2502. <HI>In Dec. Scrip.</HI></NOTE> <HI>&amp; sine eorum consilio non erat revocandum</HI>; and I grant that such was the misguided devotion of those times, that such <HI>Non-obstantes</HI> were often obtained, as appears by the Patent and Charter Rolls in the Tower, from the eighth of <HI>Edward</HI> the I. down∣wards, abounding with special Licenses to purchase and hold Lands, <HI>&amp;c. Sta∣tuto de terris &amp; tenementis in manum mortuum non ponendis non Obstante.</HI> And yet were not these Licenses accounted Legal, or the Clergy safe in purchasing such Lands, Rents, Advowsons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by vertue of them, till it was enacted and Ordained in Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 3.</NOTE> in the eighth of <HI>Ed.</HI> III. to this effect,
<Q>That if Prelats or other Religious People have purcha∣sed Lands, and the same have put to <HI>Mortmain,</HI> and be Impeached upon the same before our Justices, and they shew our Charter of License, and Process thereupon, by an Inquest of <HI>ad quod damnum,</HI> or of our Grace, or by Fine, they shall be freely lest in peace, without being further Impeached for the same purchase, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
But <HI>Non-obstantes</HI> with the Statute of <HI>Mortmain</HI> having been introduced, as afore-said, tho' undeniably Illegal at first, and gaining afterwards a countenance from this Act of Parliament, have I suppose given occasion to the dispensing with other Acts of Parliament also, tho' at first they
<PB N="821" REF="442"/>
were very rare, and seldom occur in the old Books, but are more frequent in the new; and that our Judges and Courts of Justice have invented little di∣stinctions betwixt <HI>malum in se,</HI> and <HI>malum prohibitum,</HI> betwixt Laws made <HI>pro bono publico,</HI> and Laws of more private regard; betwixt Laws in which the King's Profit and Interest is concerned only, and Laws in which the Subjects have an interest, and are intituled to an action, as the party grieved; yet the cases that have hitherto come before them judicially, have been questions upon Dispensations granted to particular persons, to exempt them <HI>pro hic &amp; nunc,</HI> from incurring the penalty of such and such a Law; but a Dispensation and Suspension of so many Laws at a lump (as the late Declaration of Indulgence did take upon it to do) has been so far from receiving any countenance from Courts of Justice hitherto, that it has always been a fatal Objection against any particular Dispensation of it; it was such as consequently eluded and frustrated the whole Law, for that such a Dispensation is in effect a repeal of the Law it self. And therefore in that great Case of <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Sorrel,</HI> in the Lord <HI>Vaughan</HI>'s Reports, where Dispensations with Penal Statutes are in some Cases allowed: yet it was then agreed by all the Judges, that the King had no power to Sus∣pend a Law.</P>
<P>But to let you see how jealous the Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons have ever been of trusting the King with an unlimited power of Dispensing with Penal Statutes, with <HI>Non-obstantes</HI> appears also by several other Laws of great moment, and in particular from the Statutes of <HI>Provisors</HI> and <HI>Praemunire</HI>; and I could shew you from divers Records of Parliament, in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> II. <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and <HI>Henry</HI> V. that they never intru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the Crown with an absolute power of Dispensing with those Statutes but only for a time, as till the next Parliament or longer, as they thought fit. But since I have not now so much time to give you so many Presidents at length, I shall only tell you, that as to the main instance you relye upon, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Kings Dispensing with the Statute of Sheriffs, that at first it was not taken for Law appears by several Acts of Parliament, as in 28. of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI. whereby those Sheriffs that had held their Offices for more than a year are pardon'd; likewise in the Act of <HI>Edw.</HI> IV. there is a like Statute pardoning those Sheriffs,
<Q>Who by reason of the late troubles in the Realm, had held for above a year, yet nevertheless confirms all former acts concerning Sheriffs for the time to come; and this held as far as the sixth of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. which is long after the Judg∣ment you mention in the Exchequer. Chamber, of all the Justices in <HI>England</HI> to the contrary; for there was then an Act made,</Q>
<Q>which reciting all the for∣mer Statutes about Sheriffs as then in full force; it Enacts that the Sheriffs, and under Sheriffs of the City of <HI>Bristol</HI> may continue to occupy their Offices; in like manner as the under Sheriffs and other Sheriffs Officers in <HI>London</HI> do, without any Penalty or Forfeiture for the same, the said Acts or any other Acts to the contrary notwithstanding.</Q>
From all which Statutes I think it suf∣ficiently appears, that neither the Sheriffs of those times, nor the City of <HI>Bri∣stol,</HI> nor the whole Parliament when that Act was made, did believe the King had Power to Dispense with the Act of the 25▪ of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI. concerning Sheriffs, for if they had, certainly it had been much easier and cheaper for them to have obtain'd the Kings Dispensation, than to have got an Act of Par∣liament for it.</P>

<PB N="822" REF="443"/>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you may have cited these Statutes right enough, but yet I think they are not sufficient proof against so solemn an Opinion, as that of all the Judges in the Exchequer Chamber 2<HI>d</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th.</HI> and whatever the Par∣liament might have declared in the Case of this, or that Particular Statute, I confess carries some Authority with it, yet ought it not to be counterval'd by so solemn a Judgment as that of all the Judges and Lawyers of <HI>England,</HI> toge∣ther with the King's constant Exercise of this Prerogative, not only since, but before that time, and that without any question or dispute with the Parlia∣ment about it, as in the Case I have already put of the Statute that forbids any <HI>Welchman,</HI> being an Officer in <HI>Wales</HI>; to which I may add divers other Cases of like nature; such as the Statute against a Judges going the Circuit in his own Country; as also those Statutes that prohibit the King from granting Par∣dons to Persons convict, nay, condemned for Murther, with several other Pe∣nal Statutes I could name, were, though the King's hands are tied up by parti∣cular Clauses of <HI>Non-obstante,</HI> yet has His Majesty, and his Predecessors at all times exercised their Prerogative of dispensing in all those Cases, notwith∣standing those Acts of Parliament, with <HI>Non-obstantes</HI> to the contrary: And though I grant you have given me several Presidents of the Parliaments some∣times restraining the King in this Exercise of the Dispensing Power, yet they are all, or the greatest part of them, before the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th</HI>'s Reign, when I grant the Law first began to be setled in this matter; and since the Judgment of all the Judges in the Exchequer Chamber, is the only Rule of Law we can have in the Intervals of Parliament; and that this case of Dispen∣sations being by them adjudged, and ever since setled and own'd for Law, without the least dispute, I can see no reason we have to question it now.</P>
<P>But as for the Statute of the 6<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII., which you urge as a President to the contrary, since the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the VII. I think it will not reach the Point in question; for the Act you now cited, seems to me no more than a private Act for the Sheriffs of <HI>Brestol</HI> alone, who being it seems afraid to rely upon the King's Dispensations, because they thought them too chargea∣ble to be taken out as often as they should have need of them, did think it a great deal less charge and trouble to pass an Act of Parliament to indemnify themselves; which I grant, put that matter beyond all dispute: But since this Act of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. I find no contest between the Parliament and the King about his Power of dispensing with Penal Laws, till the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. when I grant the House of Commons did address to His Majesty, That Penal Statutes in matters Ecclesiastical, cannot be suspended but by Act of Parliament; as also the last Address of the House of Commons in 1685. against the King's dispensing with the Officers of the Army, their holding Employ∣ments without taking the Oaths and Test according to the Act, whereby they were appointed: But these being only against the King's Power of dispensing with Laws Ecclesiastical, as concerning Liberty of Conscience, can no ways be extended to their excepting against the King's Power of dispensing with divers other Penal Laws (I will not say all) which have <HI>Non obstantes</HI> in them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since I see not only your Opinion, but also that of most of the Judges and Lawyers of <HI>England,</HI> concerning this matter of the King's Dispensations
<PB N="823" REF="443"/>
with Penal Laws has been chiefly (if not only) founded upon that Opinion of all the Judges in King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. ime, give me leave to examine the validity of that Judgment; for if that can be proved not to have been according to Law, or el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e never given at all, I suppose you must grant that my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> and all others who have founded their Opinions upon this adjudged Cause of <HI>Hen.</HI> the VII. were mistaken.</P>
<P>Now pray give me leave to argue a little with you in point of Reason;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I. E. C. p.</HI> 43.</NOTE> If a <HI>Non obstante</HI> from the King, be good, when by Act of Parliament, a <HI>Non-obstante</HI> is declar'd void, what doth an Act of Parliament signifie in such a case? must we say it is a void Clause? But then to what purpose was it put in? Did the Lords and Com∣mons, who drew this Act of the 23<HI>d</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI. as also those Acts con∣cerning Sheriffs understand this Clause of <HI>Non-obstante</HI> to be void when they put it in? If it were so, and contrary to the King's Prerogative, why did the King pass this Act without any refusal or protestation against it? certainly it was then thought otherwise; and if so, we have the Authority of the two Houses of Parliament against the Opinion of the Judges. But if it were not a void Clause then, how came it to be so afterwards? pray say what alterati∣on has been made in the Laws of <HI>England</HI> by Act of Parliament, as to this point, since the time that these Acts have been made; for if not, how comes a clause that had force in 23 <HI>Henry</HI> VI. to have none in a <HI>Henry</HI> VII. could the Twelve Judges in the Exchequer Chamber, by giving their Opinions, destroy the force of an Act of Parliament?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not say they can, only I affirm with my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> and all the Judges,
<Q>That no Act can bind the King from any Prerogative which is inse∣parable from his Royal Person; but he may dispense with it by a new <HI>Obstan∣te,</HI> as a Sovereign power to command any of his Subjects to serve him for the publick-weal.</Q>
Nor can this Royal Power be restrain'd by any Act of Parlia∣ment: And upon this ground it is, that my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> in the 12th Report (from whence I have taken this Conclusion) maintains that such Dispensations made by Sheriffs, are good; and upon the same ground, the Dispensation lately granted by the King to Sir <HI>Edward Hales,</HI> and all other Popish Officers and Ministers, as well Civil as Military must be also good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>But admit I shew you that there was never any such Judgment in the Exchequer Chamber, in the 2 of <HI>Henry</HI> the VII. as my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> and late Lord Chief-Justice <HI>Herbert</HI> supposes, will it not then follow, that all their Ar∣guments that are wholly founded upon this Statute will fall to the ground?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed that will be something; but how will you prove that? can you believe so many learned Judges should be mistaken in this matter, and those of your opinion only should make this discovery?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not desire you should believe me, but your own eyes; and therefore look upon the Year Book it self; here you see that it is indeed so far true,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.</HI> 2 <HI>H.</HI> VII. <HI>Ter. M. Case</HI> 20. <HI>fol.</HI> 66.</NOTE> that all the Justices were of opinion, that the Grant of the Sheriffdom of the County of <HI>Northumberland</HI> to the E. of that County for Life was good, but do not tell us all the reasons whereon their judgment was grounded, tho it seems to have been because the She∣riffdom of that County had been commonly granted for life, before this Sta∣tute
<PB N="824" REF="444"/>
of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI. was made; as appears by these Words in the Year Book <HI>Iudgment; for it is such a thing as may be well granted for Term of Life, or Inheritance, as divers Counties have Sheriffs by Inheritance, which began by the King's Grant; then was shewn a Resumption, (I suppose it meant an Act of Resumption of the Sheriffal∣ty,)</HI> as appears by the following Words; and then was shewn a <HI>Proviso</HI> for it: <HI>Count. de N.</HI> and if so, the King had a right to grant it only for Life again: but none save <HI>Radcliff</HI> (one of the Barons of the Exchequer) cites the Statutes of the 28<HI>th.</HI> and 42<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>Edw.</HI> the III. against Sheriffs holding for above a year, but doth not cite this Statute of the 23<HI>d</HI> of <HI>Hen.</HI> the VI. at all; nor doth he, or any other of the Judges, nor the Court ground their Opinion upon any <HI>Non-obstantes</HI> express'd in the said Acts; for if you please to consult them, you will find there is no Clause of <HI>Non obstante</HI> in any of them, before the 23<HI>d</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI. which is not at all mention'd here; therefore I wonder how <HI>Fitz Her∣bert</HI> in his Abridgment comes to vary so far from the Year Book, from whence he must have took it, as to make the Judgment to have been grounded upon the <HI>Non obstante</HI> in that Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. for none but <HI>Radcliff</HI> speaks any thing of the Patents being good with a <HI>Non-obstante</HI> to those Statutes; and the Court in all the rest of the Case, agree the Patent to be good, by reason of the said <HI>Proviso</HI> in an Act of Resumption, and then fall into debates concerning the other point, how this Patent was to be understood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess if this be so as it seems to be, <HI>prima facie,</HI> I wonder my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> and other Learned Lawyers have laid so great a stress upon, and drawn so many Arguments from this Judgment of the Judges; tho I must needs also tell you, that tho only <HI>Radcliff</HI> insists upon the <HI>Non-obstante</HI>; yet since the rest of the Judges did not contradict him, it seems to me that they all concurr'd with him; since according to the Proverb; <HI>Silence often gives consent.</HI></P>
<P>But this much I suppose you cannot deny, but that ever since <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. time at least, Sheriffs have been frequently continued for above a year, and the Judges have been also dispenced with to go the Circuit in their own County; and <HI>Welchmen</HI> have been commonly made Judges and other Officers in <HI>Wales,</HI> by vertue of the King's Dispensations, notwithstanding the particular Clauses of <HI>Non-obstante,</HI> in the Statutes of <HI>Richard</HI> the II. <HI>Henry</HI> the IV. and <HI>Hen.</HI> the VI. by which they are expresly prohibited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not deny what you have now said, as to matter of Fact; only let me tell you I conceive, that the Reason why the King has taken upon him to di∣spence with those Statutes you mention; was because that the Causes for which they were first made, have long since ceased: For when those Statutes against Judges going the Circuit in their own Counties, and Sheriffs holding for above a year were made, both the Judges and Sheriffs were found (the one by going their Circuits in their own Counties, where they had great Interest and Acquain∣tance) to have too much awed the Common-juries; and the other, (by their great Estates and Commands in the Country) to have made partial returns of Jurys, and also by their long continuance in their Office, to have learnt a trade of oppressing the people; so when by the stop that was put to those Abuses, by these Statutes (you have mentioned) there was no need of a strict observa∣tion of these Laws; and also when after the Civil Wars between <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lan∣caster,</HI> and all things became setled under King <HI>Henry</HI> the VII. (who was of a
<PB N="825" REF="444"/>
<HI>Welc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Family, there was then no more need of observing the Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the IV. against <HI>Welchmens</HI> beating Offices, especially after the Stat. of the 27th of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. when <HI>Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> became incorporated with <HI>England,</HI> and had by that Statute a right conferr'd upon it, of sending Members to Parlia∣ment, tho the Parliament might not think fit, or at least forgot to repeal them; and yet finding that the Kingdom received no prejudice, but rather benefit by such Dispensations; and not caring to quarrel with their Kings, for sometimes using a Prerogative by which they were rather benefited, than grieved; those Dispensations have ever since passed, without any complaint in Parlia∣ment, which would certainly have been before this time, had they sound the same Grievances and Reasons to have still continued for the strict observance of those Laws, as there were at first for the making of them; tho if they will have my private Opinion, I think it had been much better for avoiding all Di∣sputes between the King and Parliament; as also for preventing the evil use that has been made of those Presidents, to advance the King's Prerogative to what height he pleased, rather to have repeal'd all those obsolete Statutes, than to have suffered them still to continue.</P>
<P>But to let you see that the distinction of <HI>mala in se,</HI> and <HI>mala prohibita</HI> often fails, I think I can prove it to you by divers undeniable Instances; for there are divers things which are neither <HI>mala in se</HI>; that is, neither Natural, nor Moral Evils, either by Common or Statute Law, and yet being declar'd Com∣mon Nusances, are only <HI>mala Politica &amp; introducta,</HI> and are no ways <HI>mala in se,</HI> which the King cannot dispense with at all, only because they are prohibited: Thus the King cannot dispense with the least Nusance to the High-ways, as by laying Dung in them, or the like; tho men may very well pass through them: So likewise by the Statute of the 18<HI>th</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. the bringing over of <HI>Irish</HI> Cattel, is declared a publick Nusance, and therefore the King cannot dispense with it; yet no man will say it was so before that Statute was made; and therefore it is very well observ'd by the late Chief-Justice <HI>Vaughan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vaughan's Rep. f.</HI> 358.</NOTE> in that Case of <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Surrel</HI> I now mention'd, that publick Nusances, are not <HI>mala in se,</HI> but <HI>mala Poli∣tica &amp; introducta</HI>; and when a thing is said to be prohibi∣ted by the Common Law, the meaning is no more, but that the Ancient Record of such a Prohibition is not to be found.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant indeed the Author you have now cited in that Case, very well re∣strains the Kings Prerogative, as to things that concern the Right or Property of others, and therefore the King cannot pardon the damage done to particular persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F.</HI> 333. <HI>F.</HI> 334.</NOTE> where the Suit is only the King's; but for the benefit and safety of a third person, the King cannot dispence with the Suit, but by consent and agreement of the party con∣cerned. And again, Penal Laws, the breach whereof are to any man's par∣ticular damage, cannot be dispensed with; and the Chief-Ju∣stice <HI>Herbert</HI> himself owns,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F.</HI> 29.</NOTE> that the King cannot dispense with Laws which vest the least right of property in any of his Subjects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well then, we see the Prerogative is bounded where the interest of particular persons is concerned; But doth the Law take more care of them, than of the publick Interest, and the concernment of the whole Nation? and
<PB N="826" REF="445"/>
this Act against <HI>Papists</HI> holding of Employments was certainly made <HI>pro bono pub∣lico,</HI> to prevent the danger that may happen from <HI>Popish Recusants,</HI> who were before prohibited by divers Statutes, to hold any Offices or Employments, be∣fore they had taken the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance: Therefore I can∣not see how such a Dispensation can be good, the breach whereof must tend so much to the danger of the Common-wealth; and if according to the Rule you have laid down but now, That no Law can be dispensed withal, that is for the benefit and safety of a third person, or where the breach thereof are to o∣ther mens particular damage. Now whatsoever is prejudicial to the publick safety of the Common wealth. must be also prejudicial to the safety of every private person, and the breach thereof does tend to each man's particular damage in the Nation, if they are once generally dispensed with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant this is the most natural Objection you have made, against the King's power of dispensing in this Case; but my Lord Chief-Ju∣stice <HI>Vaughan</HI> in the Case already cited,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 341, 342.</NOTE> answers this Objection very well; No offence, says he, against a Penal Law could be dispensed with, if the reason of not dispensing were because the Offence is <HI>con∣tra bonum publicum</HI>; for all Offences against Penal Laws, are such; and tho such Laws are <HI>pro bono publico,</HI> they are not Laws <HI>pro bono Singulorum populi</HI> (which are the Laws which the King cannot dispence with) but <HI>pro bono populi complicati,</HI> as the King in his discretion shall think fit to order them for the good of the whole. In this Nation the Estate of every <HI>Pater-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amilius</HI> may be said to be <HI>pro bono Communi</HI> of his <HI>Family,</HI> which yet is but at his discretion and management of it, and they have no interest in it, tho they have benefit by it. And there∣fore it is but reasonable, that as to the <HI>bonum publicum singulorum</HI> the King should not dispence, because every man hath a particular interest in, and they are Judges of it themselves: whereas in those Acts that are <HI>pro bono populi complicati,</HI> as these <HI>Acts</HI> of Sheriffs, and for taking the Oaths and Tell are, the King is the sole Judge in what cases they concern the publick good of the Common-wealth, and where they do not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess this is a subtle piece of learning; but pray let us take it a little out of these Latin terms,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I.E.C. p.</HI> 41.</NOTE> and then the meaning of it is no more than this, that the King can do nothing to the pre∣judice of the People in their private Capacities, but he can do what he will with the publick. I thought indeed a Prince had been, in the first place bound to regard the good of the publick, and to take care of the <HI>sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us populi complicati,</HI> (as you call it) that is, (as they are imbodied together) above the private good or interest of particular men, which you call <HI>bonum singulorum populi,</HI> which can never be preserved but where the Laws and Statutes ordain'd for the publick benefit and security of the Common Wealth, have been generally broken and violated by common and easie Dispensations, and have been abused to that degree, that we lately saw every Popish Lawyer that was thought any thing fit to be a Judge, might sit upon the Bench, upon the Lives and Estates of Pro∣testants; every Deputy Lieutenant, Justice of Peace, or other Officers, either Civil or Military, might be sure of being preferr'd, if he either was a Papist or Fanatick; every Minister or Parson of a Parish, who would renounce the Orders of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> might hold his Living without doing any
<PB N="827" REF="445"/>
of the Spiritual Functions, and all this by vertue of these dispensations, grounded upon the distinction of the publick good of the whole People taken together, as different from that of the publick good of each particular person.</P>
<P>But it seems strange to me that our Ancestors should take such care of the Laws concerning the measures of Bread,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I.E.C.</HI> p. 42.</NOTE> Drink, and Flesh, as that the King cannot dispence with them, because they respect the common good of the whole People, and of every particular person; but yet as to the Laws which concern the publick good of the whole Nation in general, they were content to leave them to the sole will and pleasure of their Prince. No one that reads the History of our Ancestors, and the contest they had with their Kings to obtain these publick liberties, could ever entertain such a thought concerning them; but to let you see, that the Law concerning the Oaths and Tests, are not only for the publick good of the Common Wealth; and that the King is not the sole Judge when they may be dispenced with, ap∣pears plainly by this, that the Law for taking of the Oaths and Test, has given every particular person a right to prosecute any one that hath acted contrary to it, and the penalty of 500 <HI>l.</HI> is given wholly to the Prosecutor, which shews plainly, that the intent of the Law, was to make it every mans particular care as well as benefit to see it observed.</P>

<P>Since it grows late, I shall not further dispute this point with you, of the Kings dispensing power, though I had a great deal more to urge in defence of it; for notwithstanding all you have said against it, it is now counted so inherent a Prerogative, and in many cases so necessary for the benefit of the Subject, that the Convention it self, after a great deal of dispute about it, though they had condemn'd the King for assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with, and suspending of Laws without consent of Parliament: yet in this very De∣claration, when they assert their Antient Rights and Liberties, they only de∣clare,
<Q>That the pretended power of dispensing with Laws, or the execution of Laws, by Regal authority, as it hath been assumed and exercised of late is Illegal; which shews that they do not go so high as you, who seem to be ab∣solutely against any such thing.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>You very much mistake me if you say so; for though I maintain that an∣tiently, till about the middle of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the III. there were no dispensations at all, either because they were not thought necessary, or else that Penal Laws were not then multiplied to that degree they have been since; yet since they have been now so long in use, and do (I grant) often tend not only for the benefit of the King, but also of the Subject, I do no way's condemn them, provided they are restrain'd within those due limits prescribed by the lite Chief Justice <HI>Vaughan</HI> in the case above mentioned; and when they do not tend to the common mischief and ruine of the Protestant Religion estab∣lish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by Law, and the Rights and Liberties of the Subject; nay, I grant in times of necessity, as in the coming over of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> (for example) the King might Justifie the granting Commissions to Popish Officers, and therefore the Parliament did very well to offer the King to prepare an Act to indemnifie them from the penalties they had incurr'd by acting without taking the Test; so that when the King utterly refused this reasonable proposition, and chose to dissolve the Parliament rather than he would permit them in the least to questi∣on
<PB N="828" REF="446"/>
on this usurpt power, what could be farther expected, than that He was re∣solved to execute it whether the Parliament would or not, as we afterwards sound he did.</P>
<P>But admitting he really had been indued with this Prerogative, yet was it still under a trust, not to abuse it, so notoriously as he did, by granting it to every Apostate Person, Officer, or Judge that required it; and I doubt not but if he had govern'd a little longer, but we might have found it granted to Bishops, likewise, as soon as he had thought fit to make them of his own Re∣ligion; for tho' the King (for example) has an undoubted prerogative of pardon∣ing Robbers, and Highway-men, yet if he should so far abuse his Prerogative as to pardon every Robber that was taken, I leave it to you to consider, whether such a Government could long subsist; I shall not apply this case to these dispensa∣tions, because they say comparisons are odious.</P>
<P>These things being apparent, I think it would be very easie to vindicate that clause in the Declaration concerning the Bishops; for if the Kings Declaration was unlawful (as certainly it was) not only by reason of the Dispensing Power, (we have been now disputing about) but also for one main clause in it, which I have yet but lightly touched, which is this;
<Q>We do likewise declare, it is our Royal Will and Pleasure, that from henceforth the execution of all and all manner of Penal Laws in matters Ecclesiastical, for not coming to Church, or not Receiving the Sacrament, or for any other Non-conformity to the Religion establisht, or for, or by reason of the Exercise of Religion, in any manner whatsoever, be immediately suspended, and the farther execution of the said Penal Laws, and every of them is hereby suspended.</Q>
So that by this Clause in the Declaration, not only the Laws of our Reformation, but all the Laws for the preservation of the Christian Religion in general were suspen∣ded, and become of no force, since every man might not only chuse whe∣ther he would come to Church or not, but also all Priests and Ministers were hereby indemnified from either Praying or Preaching in the Churches, as well as their Parishioners freed from Hearing them; so that not only all the Laws of our Reformation were at once suspended, but those of Christianity it self by these words (or for, or by reason of the exercise of Religion in any manner whatsoever) nor is it confined to the Christian Religion, but all other Religions (even Mahometanism it self) were thereby permitted.</P>
<P>But perhaps it may be urged, that the execution of the Law is only hereby suspended, and not the Law it self, which is a meer evasion; for what is the ex∣ternal obligation of any Law but it's execution in order to obedience? which if it be once taken off there can only then remain the naked internal obligation in <HI>foro conscientiae,</HI> and with how sew this is of any weight you understand so well, I need not tell you.</P>
<P>So that by this Declaration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he King took upon him to suspend above forty Statutes at once concerning our Religion; and if he could do so, I desire to know whether he might not the next week have suspended forty more, even concerning our Civil Properties likewise; and so might have pro∣ceeded till he had suspended all the Laws in the Statute Book; nor are those Laws suspended for any limited time, but during the Kihgs Pleasure; and this not only a bare suspension for a time, but in effect a down
<PB N="829" REF="446"/>
right abrogation of them; for what is an abrogation of a Law, but the taking away the force of these Statutes, without any time limited? And if this be not to usurp the Sole Legislative Power, I know not what is; and if this were once commonly put in practise, Parliaments would signifie no∣thing, and the Legislature would be wholly in the King;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Justice <HI>Powil.</HI></NOTE> this was so evident, that it was granted by one of the Judges at the trial of these Bishops.</P>
<P>If therefore this were the truth of the case, I cannot see wherein the Bishops that presented this Petition to His Majesty acted at all undutifully towards him, as you suppose: For being by the King's Order in Council, commanded to di∣stribute this Declaration to their inferior Clergy, which they knew in it self to be unlawful, their distribution of it would not only have been looked upon as the owning of an unlawful thing, but would also have drawn the Inferior Cler∣gy into the same Snare; who if it were unlawful, ought not to have published to their Parishioners a Licence to act directly contrary to Law; and therefore the Bishops were not only under an Obligation of that dreadful Charge and Im∣precation express'd in the Statute of Uniformity, in the first of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 2.</NOTE> if they did not endeavour the utmost execution there∣of, through all their Diocesses and Charges; but being also pres∣sed upon to distribute it contrary to their Consciences, what could they do less in order to excuse themselves from this unlawful Command, than privately to tell the K. the reason of their disobedience? and also humbly to petition him not farther to insist upon it, either in respect of themselves, or their Inferior Clergy? and you know that it was allow'd by your Civil-Law, for any Judge, or <HI>Prator, rescribere Principi,</HI> if he were by him commanded to act contrary to any former Law or Edict of the Emperor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not deny that, but yet methinks the Bishops in this case would have acted more respectively and discreetly, if they had forbore petitioning; and though they had refused to obey the Kings Declaration, yet needed they not to have declar'd against it till the Parliament met; when I grant they might have freely and safely done it: or else if they would have petitioned at all, it should have been in more dutiful and respectful terms, than by telling the King, that his Declaration was Illegal, and that they could not in Prudence, Honour or Con∣science, so far make themselves parties to it, as to distribute it; and it was this alone which was looked upon as seditious, and for which his Majesty thought fit to have them Indicted in the Kings Bench, as a matter of high Misde∣meanour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have said in short the sum of what was urged against them by the Kings Council at their trial, but all this was very well answered by one of the Judges themselves; first, That it would have been too late to have stayed for a Parliament, because the Declaration was to have been distributed by such a time, neither could they have acquies<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d under it and submitted, for that would have been to run into contempt of the Kings Command, unless they had also shewn the reasons why they could not obey him; and since this could be done no other way than by Address or Petition, what other reasons could they give, but that they thought it had been more than once declar'd Illegal in Parliament; and therefore that they could not in Prudence, Honour,
<PB N="830" REF="447"/>
and Conscience obey it; not in prudence, because they were liable to answer it in Parliament, if they did; not in Honour, because it is unworthy the Chara∣cter of Bishops and Peers to act any thing that may make them look like flat∣terers, or time servers; not in conscience, because of the Imprecation they lay under by the Act of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; as also because no man can with a safe conscience give his approbation to that which is contrary to Law.</P>
<P>And therefore I must needs tell you, that it was very severely and unjustly done in the King to give up this Petition (which was deliver'd him with all the privacy imaginable) to the Privy Council, in order to have the Bishops prosecuted for it; but which made a great deal more noise and heart-burning against his Government, to commit them Prisoners to the Tower, and then to bring them to their Tryal, and prosecute them with the utmost rigour; where tho they escaped punishment, yet was it no thanks to the Prosecutors, but to the Directions of the Judges, two of whom (for their Honour) differ'd from the late Lord Chief-Justice, and his Popish Companion, as also to the honesty of the Jury, who found them not guilty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny but you have given a pretty fair Account of this mat∣ter, and I cannot but own, that it was one of the worst advis'd things that hap∣pen'd under the King's Government; but I cannot impute this to His Majesty's innate disposition, which was wont to act with greater temper and moderation towards those who differ'd from him in Judgment, and therefore must impute it wholly to the wicked Instigations of Father <HI>Peters,</HI> and the other <HI>Popish</HI> Mini∣sters.</P>
<P>But as for divers other Articles mention'd in the Conventions Declaration;
<Q>Such as the issuing out, and causing to be executed a Commission under the Great Seal, for erecting a Court called, <HI>The Court of Commission</HI> for Ecclesiasti∣cal Affairs, and levying Money for, and to the use of the Crown by pretence of Prerogative, for other time; and in other manner than the same was granted by Parliament, with all the rest of the Articles in that Declaration, relating to civil Affairs;</Q>
Since they are to be looked upon as the sole Acts of the Judges, and not of the King, they, and not he ought to suffer for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> illegality of them; since as you your self have own'd, the King in his judicial capacity can do no wrong, that power being wholly committed to his Judges; and therefore it was very hardly, nay unjustly done, to lay this to his charge, which he is not to answer for; so that if any thing have been done amiss in this kind, they and not he are to answer for it, and not to run such things up to a Forfeiture or an Abdication, as you and your Covention have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I need not say much more to this Objection, because I have in great part answer'd it already, and prov'd that most of the things found fault withal, were the King's own Acts, as well as those of his Ministers and Judges; for as to the Commission for Ecclesiastical Affairs, which is directly contrary to the Statute of King <HI>Charles</HI> the I.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 11.</NOTE> which took away
<PB N="831" REF="447"/>
the Court of High Commission, as also to a clause inserted in the Act of the 13<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> the II.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 12.</NOTE>
<Q>Wherein the <HI>Act</HI> for tak∣ing away that Court, is not only confirm'd, but also the erect∣ing any other like Court by commission, is expresly forbid;</Q>
This being the case, the fault of the issuing out of this Commission cannot be laid upon the Judges; who though some of them acted in it, yet was it never formal∣ly brought before them to determine whether it was illegal, or not; and no man can imagine, that unless the King had a passionate desire for this power, that he might thereby be able to suspend, deprive, and turn out whom he pleas'd of the Bishops, and inferior <HI>Clergy,</HI> with the Heads and Fellows of <HI>Colledges,</HI> whom he should find irreconcil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able Enemies to his Religion, or obstinate in refusing to obey his illegal commands, as too plainly appear'd by the suspension of the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> the turning out of the President and Fellows of <HI>Magdalen Colledge,</HI> and that Prosecution that was lately order'd a∣gainst all those <HI>Bishops,</HI> and inferior <HI>Clergy,</HI> who had refused to distribute, or read the King's Declaration; though I confess there was a stop put to this, upon re-calling this <HI>Commission</HI>: Immediately before the Princes Ar∣rival.</P>
<P>So likewise for the other <HI>Article</HI> of levying Money contrary to Law, that was also without any opinion of the Judges at all dema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded about it, for the ille∣gal collection of Chimny Money, by making Cottages and Ovens pay, that were exempted by the Acts concerning it; and also the illegal levying of Excise, by making Small-Beer pay the Duties of Strong, were all of them acted and done by particular directions from the Treasury, or by the private abuse of the Farmers of the Excise, without any opinion of the Judges; and of these Or∣ders his Majesty could not chuse but be the Author, or approver at least; since 'tis very well known he constantly sat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there when any great Business was to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> transacted, and the Lord Treasurer, or Commissioners of the Treasury, would certainly never have presum'd to have issued out their Orders in a Case of so great moment, if they had not been very well satisfied that it was his Majesty's express Will and Pleasure to have i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so.</P>
<P>And I my self have now by me a Copy of the then Lord Treasurers Directi∣ons to the Officers appointed for the levying of Chimney-money; command∣ing them to levy it upon all Cottages and Ovens whatsoever, which was done accordingly with the utmost rigour; which though it was a very great oppressi∣on, yet since it chiefly concern'd the poor and ordinary sort of people, who had not purses to go to law with the King; or else such Gentlemen and others, who though they were forced to pay for their poor Tenants, yet did they not think it worth their while to bring i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before the Barons of the Exche∣quer, where, as things then went, they could not expect to find much Justice.</P>
<P>I shall not insist upon the King's taking the additional Customs contrary to the Act of Parliament, by which they were granted to the late King <HI>Charles</HI> on∣ly for life; and though in his last Sickness there was a Contract for the new
<PB N="832" REF="448"/>
farming of them, by vertue of which, I grant the King might have justified the taking of them till the end of the Farm; yet since that Contract never passed the Seals during the King's life-time, it was certainly against Law for the King to take them before they were re-granted by Act of Parliament; <HI>I</HI> say, I shall not insist upon this; since the Parliament were so easy as to pass it by without declaring it to have been illegal; only it sufficiently shows, that from the very beginning of the King's Reign, he was resolv'd to govern arbi∣trarily, and to levy Money upon the Subject, whether the Law gave him any Authority to do it or not.</P>
<P>But as to what you say concerning the Judges being wholly in fault, for all the unjust and illegal Proceedings exercis'd in their Courts, and that the King was wholly faultless, I should be of your mind, had I not seen, that all those Judges who would not agree to the dispensing power (, and other illegal Judg∣ments I could name,) were turn'd out, and others, either <HI>Papists,</HI> or of less consciences than <HI>Papists,</HI> were put in their places, which were not conferr'd for any longer time, than <HI>durante bene placito,</HI> and therefore no wonder if such men were absolute slaves to the King's will and pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had much more to say in defence of the King's raising and keeping up a standing Army, and his disarming <HI>Protestants,</HI> in, and after the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth</HI>'s Rebellion, which are laid to his charge as endeavours to destroy the Rights and Liberties of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>But since it grows late, I shall only now take notice of something which I forgot to insist upon, concerning your Notion, of the King's obdicating the <HI>Crown</HI> by a wilful breach of the Laws, which is quite different from the sense in which this Word is taken in <HI>Roman</HI> Authors; as also in our <HI>Civil-Laws</HI>; For when <HI>Cicero</HI> uses the Expression, <HI>Itaque tutela me abdicare togito. Brison</HI> tells us his meaning was <HI>se nolle esse tutorem</HI>: But <HI>Pompenius</HI> in his Book <HI>De orig. Iuris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> §. 13.</NOTE> gives us the true sense of this Phrase; <HI>Abdicare se Magi∣stratu, est ante tempu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Magistratum deponere</HI>: which plainly shows the <HI>Romans</HI> had no notion of a <HI>Tacit,</HI> or imply'd abdication of a charge or Maje∣stracy, without a man's express consent; and therefore if the Kings bare de∣sertion of the Kingdom was not an Abdication of the Throne (as you your self are forced to grant) I cannot imagine how the King's violation of the Laws, or endeavouring to subvert the Government (both which you lay to his charge) can properly be call'd an Abdication of it; so that indeed the King hath not abdicated the Government, but your <HI>Convention</HI> hath abdicated him; And tho we often read in our <HI>Civil-law,</HI> That a Father might <HI>abdicare filium</HI>; yet I ne∣ver read, or can you show me any Example, that a Son might abdicate a Fa∣ther, or Subjects their Prince.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>You discourse upon a wrong ground; for I never affirmed, That Subjects had any authority to abdicate or depose their Prince; nor hath the <HI>Convention</HI> assum'd any such power to themselves; what they have done in this affair, hath not been authoritative, or as taking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon them to call the King to an account
<PB N="833" REF="448"/>
for his actions, or to depose him for his misgovernment, but only declarative, to pronounce and declare as the Representatives of the whole Nation, that by endeavouring to extirpate the Protestant, Religion, and to subvert the Funda∣mental Laws, and Liberties of the Kingdom, he had wilfully (I do not say willingly) Abdicated the Government, that is, renounced to Govern this Kingdom any longer as a lawful King, which I take to be a tacit, or imply'd Abdication of it, as I have already proved; and to shew you farther that even <HI>Tully</HI> himself allows in our sense of an imply'd Abdication, in his third <HI>Philip∣picks,</HI> when he says thus concerning <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI> that for his offering a Crown to <HI>Caesar, Eo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>die-non modo▪ Consulatu, sed etiam libertate se ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itavit,</HI> &amp;c. where you see <HI>Mark Anthony</HI> is said to have Abdioned the Consulsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p without any ex∣press Renunciation of it; for <HI>Caesar</HI> might have continued him in it after he had been declar'd Emperor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant your Authority to be good, yet even in this sense this Abdication of the Consulship could only take its effect from <HI>Anthony</HI>'s ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Will, for offer∣ing a Crown to <HI>Caesar,</HI> if he did not expresly, yet he effectually renounced his Consulship; for had <HI>Caesar</HI> accepted in he could no longer have been the Consul of a Popular State, but must thenceforth have acted by authority from <HI>Caesar,</HI> or not at all: but then this would not have agreed with your No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of a Forfeiture, which always supposes a crime, and a depriving the party offend∣ing from his Office, or Dignity, whether he will or not; so that if the Convention have adjudged the King to have Abdicated, they must suppose it to have been by his own consent, or not at all; but if they suppos'd him to have forfeited, why did they not down right declare so, as well as the Scotch Convention had done, and then I could have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old better what to have said to them, and have proved that only Subjects and not Kings are liable to forfeitu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not deny but that the word Forfeited had been more proper than Abdicated in this Vote of the Convention; but yet I think I have sufficiently proved, that there is no great difference between a mans Abdicating an Estate by a wilful disposing of it otherwise than the Law requires, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forfeiture of it, as I shewed you, that Tenant for life aliening in Fee, doth not only forfeit his Estate to him in reversion, but is also an Abdication of it, though perhaps he had reserved to himself a lease of the Estate for years, and this is call'd a Forfeiture of the Estate, though he committed no other crime, than the wrong done to him in reversion, and therefore (as I said before) this Forfeiture doth not always suppose any crime for which the party may be punished, otherwise than by the loss of the Estate; nor yet doth it suppose any Superiour Power in the party that takes it.</P>
<P>But your exception against my authority from <HI>Tully</HI> or <HI>Mark Anthony</HI>'s im∣ply'd Abdication of the Consulship without any express renunciation of it, is very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rivolous; for you your self own, that <HI>Anthony</HI> did not expresly, but only effectually renounce the Consulship, when he offered <HI>Caesar</HI> the Crown; and
<PB N="834" REF="449"/>
if he did not do it expressly, then it seems <HI>Anthony</HI> could renounce the Consul∣ship without ever intending it, by doing an act that in effect abrogated his own power; and why King <HI>Iames</HI> might not do so too with his Crown, I desire you would shew me any sufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: But that the Convention did also look upon this Abdicati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of King <HI>Iames</HI> as a Forfeiture, appears plainly by their declaring the Throne Vacant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without troubling themselves to find out who was the next Heir to be placed therein.</P>
<P>But to conclude, there might be a very good reason why the Convention did not think fit to make use of the word <HI>Forfeiture,</HI> as the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> have done in the like case; for some of the most wary and prudent Members of the House of Common<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, considering that this word <HI>Forfeiture</HI> might prove of very hard digestion to a great part of the House, and also might give great offence to divers of the Bishops and Lords in the House of Peers, they found out this word, <HI>Abdicated</HI> is an expedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to solve that difficulty, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d which might not only express the Kings wilful desertion of the Government by his first departure, but also his renunciaton of it, upon those legal conditions he was to hold it; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I have already observed the word <HI>Abdicated</HI> in their Vote refer, not only to his having withdrawn himself out of the Kingdom, but to all the rest of the clauses foregoing, or else they would signifie nothing in that place, both the Abdication, and the Vacancy of the Throne being grounded upon all of them alike, I should now proceed to your last exception against this Vote of the Conventions, (<HI>viz</HI>) <HI>That the Throne is thereby Vacant.</HI> But I see it is now very late, and therefore it is best to defer the farther discussing of that matter till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>other opportunity, which I desire I may have as soon as you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea, and then we will also confides▪ that part of the Conventions Decla∣ration, whereby they resolve that the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> be declar'd K. and Queen of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. which if you can prove to me to be according to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> I will then acknowledge them to be lawful King and Queen of <HI>England</HI>; but till I am convinced of it, I must beg their pardons.</P>

<P>THE ensuing Discourse being upon so Weighty a Subject as their present Majesties Title to the Crown, it is requisite that I give you some Account of the Method I have pursued, and what Authors I have made use of for the proving of it. As to the former, since the Main Questions in this great Affair are, Whether the <HI>Convention</HI> can be Iustified in declaring the Throne Vacant, and then placing their present Majesties thereon as the next Heirs, it was necessary to shew from an exact History of the Succession of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> that the late Parliament whilst it was a <HI>Convention,</HI> have done no more in this great Affair, than what former Parliaments or Great Councils have done ever since the time of King <HI>William</HI> I. on the like Occasions; when they have not only declared the Throne Vacant, but have also judged which of the Royal Family were fittest to fill it, and the Persons so placed therein have been still taken for Lawful Kings, and as such have had true Allegiance paid them by all the Subjects during the time they continued possest of the Royal Power and Dignity.</P>
<P>As for the Authors cited in this Disquisition, I have made use of the Antientest, and those who lived nearest the times in which the Matters we treat of were transacted; and therefore I have studiously forborn quoting any Authors in Latin or English who lived in more Modern Times, unless when there are no other to be had that treat of those Affairs.</P>
<P>But not to be partial to one Opinion, I have faithfully recited all those Authorities and Arguments made use of by the Author of the Treatise, Intituled, <HI>The Hereditary Succession discuss'd</HI>; as also by the Learned Dr. <HI>Brady,</HI> in his exact History of the Succession of the Crown; wherein those Authors endeavour to prove, that the Crown of <HI>England</HI> is, and hath always been Hereditary from the very beginning of our Monarchy, notwithstanding the many and various Breaches that have been made upon it: which Authorities and Arguments, whether they prove the Matter in debate, I shall leave to your better Iudgment; but hope those Gentlemen will not take it ill, if I cannot let all they write pass for clear Demonstration; and therefore have taken upon me to cite all those Arguments and Authorities that either have been, or (as far as I know of) may be made use of by those of the contrary Opinion; in the performance of which, if I have not dealt candidly with both Parties in fairly representing the utmost that they had to say; I shall be obliged, if any Friend to Truth will shew me my failings. But tho it is true, I have not gone higher in this History than the coming in of K. <HI>William</HI> I. yet I hope I may be excused looking farther back, for these Reasons:
<PB REF="451"/>
First, because an Examination of the Succession before that time, would not only be tedious, (by swelling this Discourse to an unreasonable Bulk) but would also be superfluous; since the Gentleman whom I suppose <HI>Free∣man</HI> here Argues against, makes K. <HI>William</HI> I. to have been an abso∣lute Conqueror, and to have altered all the former Laws in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Times; and if so, sure then those concerning the Succession of the Crown. And I desire them to shew me any Reason, if he and his Descendants held the Kingdom as Absolute Monarchs by Conquest, why they might not be∣queath or make it over (as is justifiable in Patrimonial Kingdoms) to which of their Sons, Kindred, or Relations they should think fit? and if so, what will then become of this Fundamental Right of a Lineal Here∣ditary Succession? And besides all this, it is needless upon another Ac∣count, since I have already proved in the Tenth Dialogue, from no less Authority than K. <HI>Alfred</HI>'s Will, that before the Conquest, the Crown was partly Testamentary, and partly Elective, sometimes wholly Elective, as in K. <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Confessor</HI>; and whoever doubts of this, I shall only desire them to read impartially Dr. <HI>Brady</HI>'s above-mentioned History of the Succession, and then I shall leave it to them to consider, whether he does not grant in effect what he takes upon him to Confute; <HI>viz.</HI> That there was no Lineal Descent of the Crown known or setled in those Times, but what was Alterable by the Testament of those Kings.</P>
<P>But since the rest of this Discourse (besides the enquiry into bare Matter of Fact) is chiefly the applying those Precedents I have here made use of to the Case of their present Majesties, I hope neither they nor any that wish well to their Government, will resent it, if I have not gone in the common Road of former Writers, in supposing the Titular Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> to be an Im∣postor, without any other proof than those bare Suspitions that have been publish'd in the Prin∣ted Pamphlets; yet since however they may incline a Man to doubt, they cannot make a Child Illegi∣timate whom his Father and Mother have hitherto bred up, and owned for theirs: and therefore I have rather chosen to suppose him at present to be the Lawful Son of King <HI>James</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; and yet that what the late <HI>Convention</HI> have done in passing him by without taking any notice of his Title, was all that they could or were obliged to do, his present Circum∣stances considered.</P>
<P>But, if it be here made out that King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> are Lawful and Rightful King and Queen of this Realm, no Man can doubt whether Allegiance may be sworn too them or not; and perhaps there was no need of writing any thing farther; yet since I find a great many of the Clergy as well as Laity of this Nation, could not go higher than their swear∣ing Allegiance to them as King and Queen <HI>de facto,</HI> and that even this has been violently opposed by the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iff Asserters of K. <HI>James</HI>'s Right, I have thought fit to add in the next Discourse (which I promise shall be the last on this Subject) all that hath been said <HI>Pro</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon that Question, and to make it of the same Bulk with the rest, I have, for the sa∣tisfaction of those of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as well as Royal Interest, endeavour'd to shew the great difference between this late Revolution, and that fatal Civil War, that ended with the Deposition and Murder of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First. These two Questions, together with an <HI>Index</HI> to all the Dialogues, being dispatch'd, (as I hope they will be shortly) shall be the last I shall trouble the World with upon these Subjects; since I know nothing more that can be well ad∣ded to what I shall there set down.</P>

<HEAD>THE Twelfth Dialogue BETWEEN Mr. <HI>MEANWELL</HI> a Civilian, AND Mr. <HI>FREEMAN</HI> a Gentleman.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Am glad, Sir, you are come, for I was wishing for you; pray sit down, and let us begin where we left off; you may remember you promised me when we last parted, that the next time I saw you, you would make out to me from undeniable proofs and precedents from our Antient Histories and Laws, that the present Convention had done nothing in Voting the Throne vacant, and then placing the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> therein, but what may be justified by the Fundamental Laws and Constitutions of the Kingdom; for I must still believe (till I am better instructed) that there can be no <HI>Inter Regnum</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> but that it hath been from the first Institution of the Government an Heredi∣tary Monarchy, where the next Heir by Right of Blood (unless in some manifest Usurpations) has always succeeded to the last Predecessor; as also our best Lawyers with one consent maintain in their Books of Reports, and the Learned <HI>Finch</HI> in his description of the Common Law lays it down as an undoubted Maxim, <HI>That the King never dies,</HI> and therefore it seems altogether new and unheard of before; for the Convention thus to declare the Throne vacant; for admitting that King <HI>Iames</HI> had (never so) justly Forfeited or Abdicated the Kingdom (term it which you please) yet certainly there could be no Vacancy of the Throne, since the next Heir by Blood ought immediately to have been declared King, or Queen, and so placed therein; whereas we heard in the Countrey, that there was almost ten days time before the Lords and Commons could agree whether the Crown should be declar'd vacant, or not; and when it was so declar'd, it took up almost a weeks time more, before they could agree who should be placed therein; whereas it was a difficulty only of their own making; for sure the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> (though
<PB N="840" REF="452"/>
it is true he is carried out of <HI>England</HI>) ought to have been immediately declar'd King, as was done in the Case of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3<HI>d.</HI> who was so declar'd upon the Deposition or Resignation of King <HI>Edward</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though I grant ever since the Crown has been claim'd by Descent, the Law has gone as you have cited it; and that <HI>Finches</HI> Law lays it down for a Maxim, I shall not deny; but that from the beginning or original of Kingly Government, whether (we look before or after you Conquest) it will appear, that the Throne was often vacant, till such time as the Common Council of the Kingdom had agreed who should fill it; and to shew you I do not speak without good Authority, pray tell me (if this Maxim had then obtain'd,) why after the Death of <HI>William</HI> the First, his Eldest Son <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> did not immediately take up∣on him the Title of King of <HI>England,</HI> or at least had done it after the Death of <HI>William Rufus?</HI> who, you know, was placed on the Throne, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>not by Right of Inheritance, but by his Fathers Testament confirm'd, and approv'd of (according to the An∣tient English-Saxon Custom of Succession) by the common Consent of the great Council of the whole Kingdom; and yet notwithstanding after the Death of this <HI>William, Henry</HI> his younger Brother succeeded him by the free Election and Consent of the same Common Council, and yet that Duke <HI>Robert</HI> should never in all his Life-time take upon him the Title of King? Pray tell me likewise (if this Maxim had been then known) why <HI>Maud</HI> the Empress, immediately upon the Death of her Father King <HI>Henry</HI> the First, did not take, (nor yet her Husband the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> in her Right) the Title of King and Queen of <HI>England,</HI> though she had had Homage paid her, and Fealty sworn to her in the Life-time of her Father, as the immediate Successor to the Crown, and yet not∣withstanding the utmost Title she could assume was that of <HI>Domina Anglorum,</HI> Lady or Mistress (not Queen) of the English; whilst <HI>Stephen,</HI> who had no other Title, but the Election of the great Council of the Nation held both the Crown and Title of King as long as he lived? As also why <HI>Arthur</HI> Duke of <HI>Britain,</HI> who according to the now received Rules of Succession, was the next Heir to the Crown upon the Death of King <HI>Richard</HI> the First, never took upon him the Title of King, un∣less it were, that he very well knew that his Uncle King <HI>Iohn</HI> had been placed in the Throne by the Common Consent and Election of the great Council of the Kingdom? So likewise after the Death of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> why <HI>Henry</HI> his Son was not immediately proclaim'd King, till such time as the great Council of the Clergy, Nobility and People had met and agreed to send back Prince <HI>Lewis,</HI> whom they had chosen for their King, (though not being Crowned, he never took upon himself that Title) and so chose <HI>Henry</HI> the Third (then an Infant) for their King? Lastly, Why all these Princes, <HI>viz. Henry</HI> the Second, <HI>Richard</HI> the First, and <HI>Henry</HI> the Third; who according to your notions were undoubted Heirs of the Crown, never took upon them the Title of Kings of <HI>England,</HI> nor are so stiled by any of our Historians, till after their Elections and Coronations, if it had not been then received for Law, that it was the Election of the People and Coronation subsequent thereunto, that made them Kings, and till this was performed (though they might look upon themselves as never so lawful Successors) the Throne was not∣withstanding esteem'd in Law vacant?</P>
<P>Therefore as for your I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stance of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third's immediately suc∣ceeding upon the Resignation of his Father (if you please better to consider of it)
<PB N="841" REF="452"/>
that makes against you; for it is plain from <HI>Th. Walsingham,</HI> and <HI>H. de Knyghton,</HI> that Prince <HI>Edward</HI> succeeded not to the Crown by Succession, but the Election of the great▪ Council, or Parliament; the words are express, <HI>Huic Electioni uni∣versus Populus consensit</HI>; and this was also owned by <HI>Edward</HI> the Second himself, who when the Commissioners of all the Estates of Parliament came in all their Names to renounce their Homage to him; yet in the midst of all his sorrow he gave them thanks, <HI>quod Filium suum Edwardum post se Regnaturum eligissent</HI>; which plainly shews, that the Parliament had then such a Notion of a Forfeiture pro∣ceeding from his Deposition, for violating the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, that the Eldest Son and Successor could pretend no other Right to it (even in the Judgment of the late King himself) but what proceeded from their Election.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny but what you have now urged from matter of fact, may ap∣pear very plausible to your self, and those of your Notions, yet if it be looked closer into, I doubt not but the known Laws then receiv'd, and the Notions the people had then of a Lineal Succession by Right Inheri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance, will prove directly contrary to the matter of fact: For you know very well <HI>à facto ad Ius non valte consequentia</HI>; but that all the Princes you mention'd, except the three last, were really Usurpers, and not Lawful Kings; I shall let you see by evident Authorities from the Historians of those Times: For in the first place, though I grant <HI>William Rufus</HI> succeeded to the Crown by his Fathers last Will, which was certainly un∣lawful (as being contrary to the receiv'd Laws of Succession in <HI>Normandy</HI> as well as <HI>England</HI>) yet was it not by Election of the people as you suppose, but by the kindness of Arch-Bishop <HI>Lanfranc</HI> his God-father, and the favour of the greater part of the <HI>Norman</HI> Barons, who came over with his Father, as well as out of hatred to Duke <HI>Robert</HI> his Elder Brother, that he was thus made King; so that <HI>William Rufus</HI> claimed as a Testamentary Heir,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.H.S. p.</HI> 368.</NOTE> and by reason of that Claim was advanced to the Throne by the Assistance of <HI>Lanfranc</HI>'s and the Bishop's Faction, who then swayed the people, but yet never owned any Election from them; so that if you rightly consider this Story, you cannot call it an Election, but a Designation or Nomination by his Father <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, and consented to by the <HI>major</HI> part of the Bishops and Lords of the Kingdom, but not by their Election or Decree as a Common Council, as you suppose.</P>
<P>But that for all this, Duke <HI>Robert</HI> his Brother being assisted by <HI>Odo</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bayenx,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Kent</HI> his Uncle, as also divers other <HI>Norman</HI> Lords, who being sa∣tisfied of his Right, raised a War in <HI>England</HI> against <HI>William,</HI> and great mischief was done on both sides, till at last a Peace was made between them upon these conditions (among others) (as <HI>Matthew Westminster</HI> re∣lates it) that because of the manifest Right Duke <HI>Robert</HI> had to the Crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. D. p.</HI> 7. <HI>F.</HI> 236.</NOTE> he should have a Yearly Pension of three thousand Marks out of the Revenue of <HI>England</HI>; and he, of the two Brothers that surviv'd the other, if he died without Children, should be Heir to the Deceased: And so far were they from thinking this Agreement stood in need of Ratification of a great Council, that there was but twelve of the Principal Men on each side sworn to see it duly observed.</P>
<P>But if we come to consider the next putting by of Duke <HI>Robert</HI> from his Right to the Crown, you will find it to have been done with a far less colour of Right
<PB N="842" REF="453"/>
than the former; for he being then absent in the <HI>Holy Land</HI> at the time of <HI>Rufus</HI>'s death, <HI>Henry</HI> his Younger Brother laid hold of the opportunity, and assembling di∣vers of the great Men of the Kingdom, he promised them to make a full Restitution of all their Antient Laws and Liberties,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. D. p.</HI> 7.</NOTE> and con∣firm them by his Charter, and abrogate such severe ones as his Father had made; thereupon they did unanimously consent to Crown him King: Now I cannot see how this, (managed with so much Artifice) corruption can properly be call'd an Election, since that ought to be a deliberate sedate Action, and at which all the persons concern'd ought to be present; but this could not pos∣sibly be, for King <HI>William</HI> was kill'd on the second of <HI>August,</HI> and buried the next day, and the day after that, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> this pretended Election was made, and the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle tells us,
<Q>That those great Men who were near at hand chose his Brother <HI>Henry</HI> King.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anno</HI> 1100.</NOTE></Q>
So that this looks more like the Combination of a Faction of Bishops, Lords, and great Men than the free Election of a King, since it was impossible for all that were, or ought, to be present from all parts of the Kingdom to have notice to assemble and dis∣patch that great Business in two days time.</P>
<P>But to let you see that Duke <HI>Robert</HI> did not fit down contented with this Usurpa∣tion upon his Right; for as soon as ever he came from the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> he straight made War upon his Brother, and many great Men of the <HI>Normans</HI> took his part; and this War was eagerly carried on for some time, and Duke <HI>Robert</HI> Landing in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> with an Army, K. <HI>Henry</HI> marcht against him with all his Forces, (but as the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle also tells us) some principal Men going between them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> brought them to an Agreement upon conditions that K. <HI>Henry</HI> should pay Duke <HI>Robert</HI> 3000 Marks Pension yearly, and that he of the Brothers who surviv'd the other, should be Heir of all <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Normandy,</HI> unless the party deceas'd should have Children of his own; so that though I grant King <HI>Henry</HI> recites in his Charter in <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.S. p.</HI> 369.</NOTE> that he was Crowned King by the Common Council of the Barons of <HI>England,</HI> yet his saying so could not give him a Right; and he must say this, or nothing, for no other, pretence or Title he could have; and there never was any other Usurper in his circumstances, but must say that, or some such thing, to make out a Title, and therefore to answer your Question, why Duke <HI>Robert</HI> took not upon himself the Title of King, neither upon the death of his Father, nor after that of his Elder Brother, I think this may serve for an Answer, that he parting with his Right to both his Brothers successively, he then lookt upon it as needless to take the Title of King upon him, as not looking upon himself then to be so.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have from your Dr. together with some assistance of your own, made a very cunning gloss upon these two great Instances of Vacancy and Election, to evade, if it were possible, that Right which the Common Council of the Kingdom then challeng'd to themselves; and therefore I shall make bold strictly to examine what you have now said. In the first place as to the Title of King <HI>William Rufus,</HI> though I grant it was founded upon his Fathers Testament, yet you see that this was not good alone without the consent and approbation of the Common Council of the Kingdom; I think I have sufficiently prov'd at our last Meeting, but one, when we discourst of the Force of the like Testament made by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor to King <HI>William</HI> the First, which according
<PB N="843" REF="453"/>
to the <HI>English Saxon</HI> Law (that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as still observed) was never valid until confirm'd by the consent of the <HI>Wittena Gemot,</HI> or Great Council; and he that had both these, whether next Heir by Blood or not, was always esteem'd as lawful King, as I have also proved from the Testament of King <HI>Alfred</HI>; and though you will take no notice of it, yet was this Testament of King <HI>William</HI> I. then produced and read in the Common-Council of the Bishops, Earls and Barons of the Kingdom, as ap∣pears by all the Antient Historians who treat of this matter. I shall only give you a taste of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 231.</NOTE> <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> expresly relates the circumstances of it, in these words, <HI>Optimates frequente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Westmo∣nasterium in concilium convenere, ubi loci post long am consultationem Gulielmum Rusum Re∣gem fecere,</HI> and Abbot <HI>Brompton</HI> tells us, that it was done in a full Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 983.</NOTE> <HI>Convocatis Terrae magnatibus,</HI> so that here was nothing wanting to a full Election or Confirmation at least of King <HI>William</HI>'s Title, and till this was done it is plain the Throne was Vacant.</P>
<P>But as for the claim that Duke <HI>Robert</HI> made to the Crown, though I do not deny but he might think himself to have a just Title to it, by a received custom among divers Nations, by which the eldest Son is looked upon to have a right before the younger; yet that this is no Law of Nature, or Reason, and consequently not Di∣vine, I think I have sufficiently prov'd at our second meeting: But that this right of Succession of the eldest Son (to be no fundamental Law of this Kingdom) I think I can sufficiently prove from our <HI>English Saxon</HI> Histories, as well as Laws; and as for what you say concerning those <HI>Norman</HI> Lords and Bishops who joyn'd with Duke <HI>Robert</HI> after his Brother was Crown'd King, it is call'd no better than Treason by all the Writers of those times, for <HI>Florence</HI> of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and <HI>Sim:</HI> of <HI>Durham,</HI> both tell us, that the King thereupon call'd together the <HI>English,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An. D.</HI> 1087.</NOTE> and open'd unto them the Treason of the <HI>Normans,</HI> and the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who seem'd to have lived about that time, compares the Treason of Bishop <HI>Odo</HI> to that of <HI>Iudas Iscariot</HI> against our Lord; and though I grant King <HI>William</HI> might make such an agreement with his Brother Duke <HI>Robert,</HI> as you mention, yet as for the 3000 Marks Pension, which you say he was to pay him, I very much doubt it, since no Historian but <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>Westminster,</HI> who lived between two and three hundred years after, makes mention of it, and therefore I think it is to be referr'd to the following agreement betwixt this Duke and his Brother King <HI>Henry,</HI> which the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle expresly mentions.</P>
<P>Having now examin'd and clear'd the Title of King <HI>William Rufus,</HI> I come next to justifie that of King <HI>Henry</HI> I. to the Crown, notwithstanding all you have alledg'd against it, which yet is no more than what you said before, that Duke <HI>Robert</HI> had an Hereditary Right, and therefore he could not be put by, which is to beg the Que∣stion, for you cannot prove to me that he had this Right either by the Law of Nature, the Law of <HI>England,</HI> or the Law of <HI>Normandy,</HI> not by the two former, as I have already prov'd, for your Conqueror himself being a Bastard, had no better Title to the Dutchy of <HI>Normandy</HI> than his Father's last Will, before he went to the Holy Land; which was not good without the consents of the Nobility of that Dutchy, as appears by the Historians of that time; so that the greatest Objection you have to make against King <HI>Henry</HI>'s being elected in a true Common-Council of all <HI>England</HI> is this, that the time was so short between the Death of <HI>William Rufus</HI>
<PB N="844" REF="454"/>
and his Election, that it was impossible for all the Parties that had Votes to be there present, which is a very bold assertion; for how can you or your Doctor tell that at the time when King <HI>William</HI> was kill'd, he might not then have held a great Council at <HI>Winchester</HI> (where he then Lay) who might immediately upon his Death chuse his Brother <HI>Henry</HI> for their King; for it is certain the Election was there the Day before his Coronation at <HI>London,</HI> and therefore it is very rashly done to affirm that this Election was not in a Common-Council of the Kingdom, when all the Historians,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.V.</HI> p. 156.</NOTE> and particularly <HI>W. Malmesbury</HI> tells us the manner of it, and the Disputes there were about it, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Henry</HI> was elected King as soon as King <HI>William</HI>'s Funerals were over, <HI>Aliquantis ta∣men ante controversiis inter proceres agitatis,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>H. de Knyghton</HI> reciting the cause, why Duke <HI>Robert</HI> was set aside, <HI>viz.</HI> because he had been always contrary and unnatural to the Barons of <HI>England</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 2374.</NOTE> therefore <HI>quod plenario consensu &amp; consilio totius Communitatis Regni, ipsum refutaverunt, &amp; pro Rege omnino recusav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nt, &amp; Henricum fratrem in Regem erexerunt</HI>; which plainly shews that it was the opinion of all the Antient Writers out of whom <HI>Knyghton</HI> took this passage, that this election was made by the free consent, and in a full Council of all the whole Community of the Kingdom; nor does the after claim of Duke <HI>Robert</HI> to the Crown at all alter the case, for the reasons already given, as also because the agreement that was made between them, that he that surviv'd should succeed the other, was never confirm'd or agreed to by the great Council of the Kingdom; and therefore those <HI>Norman</HI> Lords that join'd with Duke <HI>Robert</HI> here in <HI>England</HI> are justly taxed by <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmesbury,</HI> and the Saxon Chronicle,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anno</HI> 1104.</NOTE> with Infidelity and Rebellion: and though I grant that <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> (or rather <HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Wendover</HI> whom he transcribes,) seems to condemn King <HI>Henry</HI>'s taking the Crown as unjust, and contrary to Right, and that he therefore feared the Justice of God; <HI>eò quod fratri suo primogenito, cui jus Regni manifestè competebat temere usurpando injustè nimis abstulcrat</HI>; yet this author writing about the middle of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. who had succeeded his Father by a pretended right of Inheritance as well as Election, it is no wonder if He who writ near a hundred years after this transaction, should give his judg∣ment in this matter according to the common opinion and prejudice of that age, and must certainly speak by guess; for how could he otherwise affirm (unless he had been acquainted with that Kings thoughts) as he doth in the same place, that he felt <HI>conscientiam suam in obtentu Regni cauteriatam</HI>; since no other Writer either of that time, or after it, does thus blame King <HI>Henry</HI> for taking the Crown.</P>
<P>But as for the account you give why Duke <HI>Robert</HI> never took upon him the Title of King, if the Throne had not then been looked upon as vacant, be∣cause of the agreement which he made with his Brothers, by which he parted with his Right for a Pension, during his Life, is not at all satisfactory; for in the first place neither of these agreements were made till above a year after his pretended Title did acrue to him by the Death of his Father, and Brother; and therefore he ought, if he had look'd upon himself as true King, to have immediately taken the Title upon him, which he never did; so likewise the agreement it self makes wholly against your notion of any hereditary succession to the Crown, to be then setled, since the main clause in both these agreements is, that the survivor should be heir to him that died first, unless he left Children of his own to succeed
<PB N="845" REF="454"/>
him; which plainly shews that in the opinion of both those Princes, and of the great men that swore on either side to see it observed, they knew of no such setled Right of Succession in their Heirs, which they themselves could not part with, or else this Clause had been wholly in vain; since both King <HI>William</HI> and King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Children were to have succeeded to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> by vertue of both these agreements, before the Sons of Duke <HI>Robert,</HI> had his Son <HI>William</HI> (who was only Earl of <HI>Flanders</HI>) survived him.</P>
<P>But now if you please you may proceed with your other exceptions against the rest of the Instances I have here given you of the Vacancy of the Throne, till such time as the Common Council of the Kingdom had agreed whom to place therein.</P>

<P>As to what you have said in defence of the Vacancy of the Throne after the death of King <HI>Henry</HI> I. carries less shew of Reason than what you urged in the former Cases; since all Writers agree that this was a manifest Usurpation in <HI>Stephen,</HI> who could pretend no sort of Title to the Crown himself, as well as Perjury in the Bishops, Lords, and great Men of <HI>England,</HI> who having sworn Fealty to King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Daughter <HI>Maud</HI> in his life-time, made <HI>Stephen</HI> Earl of <HI>Blois</HI> their King; therefore <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury,</HI> and all the Writers of those Times do accuse <HI>Stephen</HI> of down-right Perjury and Usurpation, and likewise re∣late that he was advanced to the Crown through the power of the <HI>Londoners</HI> and <HI>Citizens</HI> of <HI>Winchester</HI>; but yet all these Endeavours had been in vain, unless he had been assisted by his Brother <HI>Henry</HI> Bishop of that City, and then the Popes Legate in <HI>England,</HI> and favoured by the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who Crowned him; and yet for all this there was but a very small Faction of the Bishops and Lords who were for his Croonation; for <HI>W. Malmsbury</HI> tells us, <HI>Coronatus est ergo in Regem Angliae Stephanus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 178.</NOTE> <HI>tribus Episcopis prae∣sentibus, nullis Abbatibus, paucissimis Optimatibus.</HI></P>
<P>And many of the Nobility and great Men of <HI>England</HI> were so sensible of this, that being headed by <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Gloucester</HI> (the Empresses base Brother) they raised a War against <HI>Stephen,</HI> which after her coming over hither was carried on with great vigour; and though I grant that after divers changes of fortune the Em∣press was at last forced to quit the Kingdom, yet her Son Duke <HI>Henry</HI> did not fail to continue his claim to the Crown in right of his Mother, and coming over into <HI>England</HI> renewed the War against King <HI>Stephen,</HI> which was at last compos'd by an agreement between them, which as <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> and <HI>Mat. West∣minster</HI> relate it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M. Par. f.</HI> 86. <HI>M. West.</HI> 246.</NOTE> was thus;
<Q>That King <HI>Stephen</HI> acknowledged in an Assembly of Bishops and other great men of the Kingdom, that Duke <HI>Henry</HI> had an Hereditary right to the Crown, and the Duke thereupon as kindly granted, that King <HI>Stephen</HI> should peaceably possess it during his Life;</Q>
so that it is certain, till this agreement (even by his own acknowledgment) he had no right to it; and though I grant that the Empress <HI>Maud</HI> for some reasons we are not able to give a true account of, never took upon her the Title of Queen, yet it is very certain that she acted as such during all the time she was in <HI>England,</HI> receiving Homage and Fealty from those Lords and others who came over to her side, and also granting Charters and conferring Honours by the Title of <HI>An∣glorum Domina</HI>▪ which shews she look'd upon her self to be the Supream Governess of the Kingdom, though not under the Title of Queen: so that I think you can
<PB N="846" REF="455"/>
find nothing in this transaction that can support your Notion of Va∣cancy.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray give me leave to answer what you have now said, before you proceed farther; first I cannot excuse neither King <HI>Stephen</HI> for taking the Crown, nor the Bishops and Great men that set it on his Head, from per∣jury and injustice; since the Emperess <HI>Maud</HI> had been before in a Com∣mon-Council of the whole Kingdom, declared the Lawful Successor, and that Fealty had been sworn to her as such: All that I insist upon in this affair is this; that <HI>Quod furi non deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, factum valet.</HI> And though this ought not to have been done, yet when once done did stand good; and therefore if whilst the Throne was vacant, King <HI>Stephen</HI> by the Election and Consent of the Bishops and Great Men of <HI>England</HI> was placed therein; he was there looked upon as true, and legal King as long as he lived: And this was the reason why the Emperess never took upon her the Title of Queen of <HI>England,</HI> no not when she had taken King <HI>Stephen</HI> prisoner; and one would have thought might have justly done it as a Conqueress: But yet she forbore it, because that Title was not then to be taken without the consent of the Great Council of the King∣dom; which I cannot find she ever held, her party being not great enough to make one: And though I cannot deny, but that she might in some particulars exercise some prerogatives of Royal Power; yet this was only upon a pretence of her being Elected and Stiled by this Title of Lady of the <HI>English,</HI> in a Sy∣nod of the Clergy at <HI>Winchester,</HI> by the procurement of <HI>Henry</HI> the then Bishop of that See, and the Popes Legat, who was now turned against his brother King <HI>Stephen.</HI> For she was never generally received nor own'd as Queen, nor did she ever exercise those great prerogatives of Sovereign Power, <HI>viz.</HI> Calling of Great Councils, making of Laws, raising of Taxes, or Coining Mony.</P>
<P>But whereas you represent King <HI>Stephen</HI> to have been Elected but by a very small party of the Bishops and Noblemen of <HI>England</HI>; yet it is very much to be doubted, whether <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmesbury</HI> (who Dedicated his History to <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Gloucester</HI> King <HI>Stephens</HI> greatest Enemy) being no friend to his Title, is to be altogether credited in this matter. For <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Huntington,</HI> (who lived not long after) tells us expresly;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 386.</NOTE> that, <HI>Omnes qui Sacramentum juraverant tam Praesules quam Consules &amp; Principes assensum</HI> Stephano <HI>praebut∣runt &amp; hominium fecerunt</HI>: And it is also as certain that the Earls of <HI>Gloucester</HI> and <HI>Chester</HI> (the two greatest men of <HI>England</HI>) did then likewise swear Allegiance to him, and own his Title, though they afterwards revolted from him again; Yet could they do nothing considerable against him, till his own Brother the Bishop of <HI>Winchester</HI> revolted also from him; upon pretence that the King had violated the Rights of the Church. And though it is true that after the Empres∣ses departure out of <HI>England,</HI> Duke <HI>Henry</HI> her Son came over and prosecuted the War against King <HI>Stephen</HI>; yet could it not be in his own, but his Mo∣thers Right, who was then alive; Nor could the agreement you mention, be made between the King and the Duke as having then a right to the Crown in his own Person, since we read of no concession the Empress his Mother had made to him of it: And therefore whatever Title <HI>Henry</HI> could claim there∣unto.
<PB N="847" REF="455"/>
Upon the death of King <HI>Stephen</HI> it was wholly due to this Kings adopting him for his Son,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Hen. Hunt.</HI> p. 395. <HI>Ri∣chard de Ha∣gulstad. Col.</HI> 314. <HI>Ioh. de Hag.</HI> p. 282.</NOTE> and declaring him his Successor upon condition, that he himself should enjoy the Crown during his life, which agreement was solemnly con∣firmed and ratified, and that by Oath. in a full Assembly of all the Bishops, Lords and great men of the Kingdom: For <HI>Ordericus Vitalis</HI> in his <HI>Annals,</HI> (p. 989.) Is very express in the manner of this great Transaction; in these words: <HI>Sic tamen in praesenti∣arum ipse Rex &amp; Caeteri Potentes Sacramento <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irmarent quod Dux post mortem Regis, si tem∣pore eum superviveret, pacifice, &amp; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>que cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctione Regnum haberet</HI>; therefore as long as the Empress <HI>Maud</HI> lived (who died after her Son King <HI>Henry</HI>'s coming to the Crown,) '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is plain he could have no Hereditary Right to it, notwithstanding what <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> and <HI>Matthew Westminster</HI> (who lived long after these Transactions, have said to the contrary) and therein are to be looked upon as Authors that speak their own sense, rather than that of the Writers of those times.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess what you have urged in this matter concerning Duke <HI>Henry</HI>'s be∣ing admitted as Heir of the Kingdom during the Life of his Mother the Empress <HI>Maud</HI> seems to the purpose, and there could be nothing said against it, but that this was done by the Concession of the Empress her self, who surrender'd all her pretentions to her Son, tho' we have no particular account of it, or else (which is more likely in my opinion) that the Government of Women being then unknown in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Normandy,</HI> and consequently odious to the English and Norman Nobility, and for which reason chiefly they had before set this Empress aside, they thought they did in effect perform their Oath to her, when they acknowledged her Title in her Son Duke <HI>Henry,</HI> who is said by the Historians of those times to have succeeded <HI>Stephen Iure Haereditario,</HI> which could not at all agree with your no∣tion of his receiving his Title from the Consent or Election of the great Council.</P>
<P>But I shall pass over this, and come to your next instance of the Vacancy of the Throne, which you pretend to have been upon the Death of King <HI>Henry</HI> the II. Now your only argument to prove this is, that King <HI>Richard,</HI> tho' his Eldest Son alive, was only call'd Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> and never King of <HI>England</HI> till after his Coronation; but whoever will but consider the circumstances of this matter, will find that he was indeed own'd for King of <HI>England,</HI> before his pretended Election or Coronation; for before his coming into <HI>England</HI> to be Crown'd, <HI>Ro∣cer Hoveden</HI> tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 373.</NOTE>
<Q>That every Freeman of the whole Kingdom, by the Command of his Mother Queen <HI>Elianor,</HI> swore, <HI>quod fideni portabit Regi Angliae Richardo Regis Hen. filio,</HI> which plainly shews, that he was then by common intendment looked upon as King before his Coronation; and though I confess that this very Author also relates that all the Estates of the King∣dom being assembl'd at <HI>London,</HI> by whose Council and Assent the said Duke was Consecrated and Crown'd King of <HI>England</HI>; and though <HI>Ralph de Diceto,</HI> then Dean of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s (who in the Vacancy of that Church then supplied the Office of the Bishop at King <HI>Richard</HI>'s Coronation) hath this passage,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 647.</NOTE> <HI>Comes itaque Pictavorum Richardus hereditario jure praemovendus in Regem, post tam cleri, quam populi solemnem &amp; debitam electionem involutas est triplici Sacra∣mento,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
Now what can this solemn and due election here signifie? Or what can
<PB N="848" REF="456"/>
it mean farther than that <HI>Richard</HI> being King by Hereditary Right, was so owned and recognized by the Clergy and Laity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire I may reply to this before you proceed farther. I confess what you say about the Empress <HI>Maud</HI>'s surrender of her Right to her Son Duke <HI>Henry</HI> would be considerable, if you had any Authorities from our Antient Historians to support it, but since you have not, I look upon it as no better than a meer sur∣mise of those of your opinion, that the Crown was then enjoy'd by an Hereditary Right without any consent or election of the people; and so likewise is your other fancy, that because Women were then looked upon as uncapable to Govern, therefore the Bishops and great men of the Kingdom, suppos'd they had suffi∣ciently perform'd their Oath of Allegiance to her by acknowledging her Son Duke <HI>Henry</HI> for the right Heir of the Crown; now if this had been so, pray tell me to what purpose King <HI>Henry</HI> I. (Father to the Empress) should have made all the Estates of <HI>England</HI> swear fealty to his Daughter, if a Woman had been then lookt upon as uncapable to Govern? or to what purpose should the Clergy in the Coun∣cil at <HI>Winchester</HI> chuse this Empress as the King's Daughter, Lady both of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Normandy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hov.</HI> p. 106.</NOTE> as <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmesbury</HI> tells us ex∣presly that they did, and that he was present at it? or how could the great Council of the Kingdom believe that they had sufficiently satisfied their Oath to the Daughter in conferring the Allegiance that was due to her upon her Son? I am sure no Heiress of the Crown would look upon that as a good perfor∣mance of their Oath at this day; when you can answer me these queries, I shall be of your opinion in this point; but till then I beg your pardon.</P>
<P>But as to what you say against the Vacancy of the Throne upon the Death of King <HI>Henry</HI> the II. till King <HI>Richard</HI> was Elected and Crown'd, I desire no better Authority to the contrary than those very Authors you have now cited for your opinion; for first <HI>Hoveden</HI> in the very place you have quoted him, says,
<Q>That the Duke was to be Crown'd King by the Council and As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt of all the Par∣ties there present; now if I understand any thing of Grammar or Sence, he was not King before, and therefore needed their Assent to make him so; likewise in the next quotation from <HI>Ralph De Diceto,</HI> the Duke is said <HI>Hereditario jure promo∣vendus in Regem,</HI> which words being in the Future Tense, shew he was not then, but was to be promoted to that dignity; now if his Hereditary Right alone could have done it, then to what purpose are all these words aforegoing?</Q>
so that though this Right gave him the fair pretence to succeed to the Crown, yet it is plain from both the Authors you have quoted, that he was not so till after the due Consent and Electi∣on of the Clergy and People, so that after, all your questions, (what can this solemn and due Election signifie? or what can it mean farther, than that <HI>Richard</HI> being King by an Hereditary Right was so own'd and recognized by the Clergy and Laity?) will receive a very easie answer from what has been already said, till you can shew me out of any Dictionary that <HI>Consilium</HI> and <HI>Assensus</HI> (which are the words of <HI>Hoveden</HI>) and the words <HI>Solemnis &amp; debita electio,</HI> ever signified an owning, or recog∣nition of an Hereditary Right.</P>
<P>I confess the only colour you have for your interpretation of those words in <HI>Hoveden</HI> which you have now cited of Queen <HI>Elianors</HI> making every Freeman of the Kingdom swear Fealty to <HI>Richard</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> as to their Liege Lord; from whence you would infer, that by common intendment of Law he was looked upon
<PB N="849" REF="456"/>
King of <HI>England</HI> before he was Crown'd, and consequently there could be no Va∣cancy of the Throne: now admit that he was commonly call'd King before he was Crown'd, or that the Queen his Mother would make the People swear to him as such, yet that could not make him so, since the same Historians also tell us, that <HI>Hubert</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> Earl <HI>Mareschal</HI> made the people of <HI>England</HI> take a like Oath to Earl <HI>Iohn</HI> as their Lord, (not King) immediately after the death of King <HI>Richard</HI> his Brother, and yet I suppose you will not affirm that their swearing Fealty to him as their Superiour Lord, made him King, or gave him a just Title to the Crown; and I desire you or any indifferent man to tell me which was <HI>Hoveden</HI>'s opinion, whether this swearing Fealty was a sufficient Decla∣ration of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing King, or else all those other expressions which signifie the con∣trary, when immediately before his Coronation he only calls it <HI>ducem Richar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m qui Coronandus erat in Regem,</HI> which I think is as plain a distinction, of his be∣ing a Duke before he was Crown'd, and a King afterwards, as words can make.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see it is in vain to urge this point any longer, and therefore I shall proceed to your next instance of the Vacancy of the Throne, after the death of King <HI>Ri∣chard</HI> until King <HI>Iohn</HI> was placed therein: now though it is certain that this Prince was an Usurper, upon his Nephew Duke <HI>Arthur,</HI> yet whether he was ever Elected in a Common Council of the Bishops, Earls and Barons of the Kingdom, is very doubtful. But suppose he were, it was done wrongfully, and to the prejudice of <HI>Arthur</HI> Duke of <HI>Britain,</HI> the right Heir to the Crown, who being young and a stranger, it is no wonder if he were put by, and his Uncle who was a man and better acquainted with <HI>England,</HI> and having the Interest of the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and most of the great men were of his party, and yet for all that <HI>Hove∣den,</HI> who was alive at this time, speaks not a word of his being Elected, but only that upon his coming into <HI>England</HI> he was received by the Nobility, and Crown'd by <HI>Hubert</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>; so that there is not one word there of any Election by, but only a submission from the Lords Spiritual and Temporal to King <HI>Iohn</HI>; and a recognition that he was their King: nor indeed could he need it if it be true what the same Author tells us.
<Q>That when King <HI>Richard</HI> despar'd of Life,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hov. f.</HI> 449.</NOTE> he devised to <HI>Iohn</HI> his Brother, the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and all his other Lands, and caus'd all those that were present to do him Fealty; and this is related by <HI>Hoveden,</HI> in all probability an Eye Witness of these transactions.</Q></P>
<P>So that the first Author we find to mention any thing of the particulars of this pretended Election is <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tthew Paris,</HI> who has given us the Speech which the Arch-bishop made at this supposed Election,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matt. Paris f.</HI> 197.</NOTE> and also re∣citing the Arch-bishops, Bishops, Earls and Barons, and all others who ought to be at his Coronation; the Arch-bishop standing in the middle of them, said thus,
<Q>Hear all of you, your Discretion shall know, that no man hath right to succeed in this Kingdom, unless, after seeking God, he be unanimously chosen by the University of the Kingdom (that is, those that are here said to meet at <HI>London</HI>) the rest of the Speech needs no repeating, only he lays it down for Law (which I think was never heard of before)</Q>
<Q>That if any of the Progeny of the dead King did excel others, they ought more readily to consent to the Election of him; and so upon this Speech made in behalf of Earl <HI>Iohn,</HI> and full of a great deal of fulsom slattery, he was declar'd King.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="850" REF="457"/>But to let you see what a sort of Man this Arch bishop <HI>Hubert</HI> was, here see what the same Author tells us in the same place, that being asked after∣ward, why he said these things?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> answer'd,
<Q>That he guested, and was thought ascertained by certain Prophecies that <HI>Iohn</HI> would bring the Kingdom and Crown into great Confusion; and therefore, lest he he might have too much liberty in doing, he affirmed, he ought to come in by Election and not by Hereditary Succession.</Q>
Now though this Learned Doctrine of the Arch bishop asserts a right of Election in the Convention of Bi∣shops, Earls, Barons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet by his own answer when he was asked why he said these things, it clearly discovers it to be only a design and artifice in the Arch∣bishop, to cause them to set up, and make <HI>Iohn</HI> King: and in which also he denies any such right of Election, but since <HI>Hoveden,</HI> nor any other of our antient histo∣rians make mention of this Election but only of his Coronation, and the Bishops, Earls and Barons assisting at it, not giving their consents to it, it may very well be, that that story of an Election and this Speech of Arch bishop <HI>Hubert</HI> might be only an invention of <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> or rather of <HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Wendover</HI> from whom he took most of his History: but that this doctrine of the Arch-bishop concerning the Election of our Kings, if meant according to the modern understanding of it, was then new. <HI>Gervase</HI> a Monk of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in the year 1122. who also speaking of the Coronation of <HI>Henry</HI> the First, says, it was manifest and known almost to all men, that the King's of <HI>England</HI> were only obliged, and bound to God for the possession of the Kingdom, and to the Church of <HI>Canterbury</HI> for their Coronation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 1338. <HI>N.</HI> 30.</NOTE> <HI>manifestum est autem &amp; omnibus fire notum; Reges Angliae soli Deo obligari &amp; teneri ex ipsius regni adeptione &amp; Ecclesiae Cantuariensi ex Coronatione.</HI></P>
<P>But that King <HI>Iohn</HI> was looked upon as an Usurper is very certain, since besides some of the honest English Nobility, that took Duke <HI>Arthurs</HI> part, the King of <HI>France</HI> did also make War upon King <HI>Iohn</HI> upon his Nephews account, because he looked upon him as true Heir to the Crown, and therefore when K. <HI>Iohn</HI> had pri∣vately made away his said Nephew in prison, the K. of <HI>France</HI> summon'd him as Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> and Peer of <HI>France,</HI> to answer for the Murther in an Assembly of the Peers of <HI>France</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> where for his refusing to appear, he was condemn'd to death and his Dukedom of <HI>Normandy</HI> declar'd for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eited to the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have said as much as can be, to prove that King <HI>Iohn</HI> had no Hereditary Right to the Crown, nor was so solemnly Elected to it (as <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> relates) but yet for all this, I think I may very justly oppose all that you have now said upon this Head; for in the first place, it was then very much dispu∣ted (as it hath been also since that time) if an Elder Brother died and left a Son a <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nor,</HI> whether his Younger Brother or the Son should succeed; for though the People of <HI>Anjou</HI> and those of <HI>Guienne</HI> own'd Duke <HI>Arthur</HI> for their Prince, yet the States of <HI>Normandy</HI> were of another mind, and as well by vertue of King <HI>Ri∣chard</HI>'s Testament, he was immediately after his Death invested with that Duke∣dom, nor was he then at all opposed in it by the King of <HI>France,</HI> though Suprea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord of the Fee, and as for <HI>England</HI> besides his Brothers Testament, whereby he left him Heir of all his Territories; it was also then generally held in <HI>England</HI> as most consonant to the Antient English Saxon Law of Succession, that the Uncle should succeed to the Crown before the Nephew, therefore it is no wonder if Duke <HI>Arthur</HI> found so small a party here, not any Bishop, Earl or
<PB N="851" REF="457"/>
Baron (as I read of) owning his Title, and as for the King of <HI>France</HI> it is also as certain, that he did at first own King <HI>Iohn</HI> for lawful King of <HI>England,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> and entred into a Treaty of Peace, and made a League with him as such; though it is true that afterwards, when he had a mind to pick a quarrel with that King, he then set up Duke <HI>Arthur</HI>'s Title; And though this Duke was made away in the beginning of King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Reign, yet did not the King or Peers of <HI>France</HI> ever take any notice of it, till about twelve or thirteen years after, when he had now unjustly Conquered all <HI>Normandy,</HI> and almost all that Kings other Ter∣ritories in <HI>France,</HI> and then wanting a Title to keep them, he began this Prose∣cution you mention against him, and upon his non appearance he was condemned unheard; but that the King of <HI>France</HI> himself, and all the great men of that King∣dom did look upon him to have been lawful King of <HI>England,</HI> ap∣pears by that Speech,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 236.</NOTE> which <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> relates to have been made after King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Deposition by the Barons of <HI>England,</HI> by a Knight whom Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>France</HI> had made his Procurator, to treat with the Popes Legat about his coming over hither;
<Q>where, when he had recited that King <HI>Iohn</HI> had been condemn'd by his Peers for the Death of his Nephew <HI>Arthur,</HI> and that he had been also for his great cruelties and other wickedness Deposed by the Barons of <HI>England</HI>; and farther reciting that the said King, without the assent of his Nobility had resign'd his Kingdom to the Pope to hold it of him, at an An∣nual Tribute of a thousand marks, (the rest I will give you in Latine, because you your self shall translate it,) <HI>etsi Coronam Angliae sine Baronibus alicui dare non potuit, potuit tamen dimittere tam▪ quam statim cum resignaverit, Rex esse desiit, &amp; Regnum, sine Rege vacavit, vacans itaque Regnum sine Baronibus ordinari non debuit,</HI> &amp;c. so that you may see that by the order of Prince <HI>Lewis,</HI> and the allowance of the King of <HI>France</HI> himself, every one of our opinions are maintain'd for good;</Q>
first, That King <HI>Iohn</HI> was before the resignation of his Crown to the Pope, true and lawful King. Secondly, That by that resignation to the Pope, he did dismiss or abdicate his Right to it, (for so I suppose the word <HI>demittere Regnum,</HI> is here to be render'd.) Thirdly, That upon this dismission of the Crown, the Throne became Vacant. Fourthly, That upon this Vacancy the Kingdom could not be conferr'd without the consent of the Barons▪ that is, the great Council of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>But let King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Right to the Crown have been what it would, it is certain, that he could not take it upon him, until such time as this Great Council had both heard and allow'd his Title, and that this was in the nature of an Election, not∣withstanding his Brothers Will, appears by that account which <HI>Roger Wendover</HI> and <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> have given us of it, which though <HI>Hoveden</HI> and other Writers have omitted, yet doth it not therefore follow, that this was all the pure inven∣tion of <HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Wendover</HI> or <HI>Matthew Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> since the former, he living near that time, might write from the relation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that were then present; and as for the latter, I look upon him, though a Monk, as a man of too great integrity to invent any thing of his own Head; and though I confess the account that Arch-bishop <HI>Hubert</HI> gives, why he put King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Title rather upon Election than Succession, looks very suspicious; since the Arch-bishop must thereby have made himself a Knave and a Hypocrite, and seems also to contradict what <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> had before said, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That all those that heard his Speech, dares not so much as doubt of these things, knowing that the Arch-bishop had not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s judged of this matter without cause;</Q>

and therefore I grant that this part of the relation concerning the Arch-bishops vindicating of himself, for thus giving his Judgment, might be a Story commonly taken up, and being told to this Authour, was by him inserted in his History at a time when I grant the Crown of <HI>England</HI> began to be thought successive by reason that King <HI>Henry</HI> the III. had succeeded as the eldest Son of his Father, though he was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for all that admitted without Election as I shall prove by and by; but that King <HI>Iohn</HI> was made King by Election, though he claim'd it from his Brother by successi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n likewise appears from his own Charter still to be seen at this day, in the Arch-bishops <HI>Archives</HI> at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> wherein he recites, that he came to the Crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.

<P>Notwithstanding what you have now said, I cannot agree with you, that by these words you have now cited from this Charter, is to be understood any formal Election of the Clergy and People; but that this unanimous consent mention'd in it, was rather their acknowledgment of his Title, and submission to him, than any thing else; for according to <HI>Hoveden</HI>'s relation of his coming to the Crown (which I think the most exact extant) the whole Nation submitted, and swore Fealty to him against all men, before he came over into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But as for his Son <HI>Henry</HI> the III. it is much more plain that he succeeded by Succession, and not by Election, as being the Eldest Son of the Late King his Father, as appears by the relation of his Coronation in <HI>Matthew Westminster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 277.</NOTE> who tells us thus. <HI>Henricus Iohannis primogenitus in Re∣gem inunctus &amp; solemniter Coronatus est</HI>; and tho▪ from the Speech which was made to the Clergy and Nobility that was then at <HI>Glou∣cester</HI> by the Earl <HI>Mareshall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S.

<P>Before I speak any thing to King <HI>Henry</HI> the III ds. Election; give me leave to reply to what you have said against the express words of King <HI>Iohns</HI> Charter; for if <HI>Favor</HI> and <HI>Consensus</HI> does not signifie somewhat more than a bare acknow∣ledgement and submission, I understand neither English nor Latine. Nor is this any answer to the express testimony of <HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Wendover,</HI> and <HI>Mat. Paris</HI>
<PB N="853" REF="458"/>
to the contrary. And as for <HI>Roger Hoveden,</HI> he does not say he was not Elected, but only omits the manner of it, as divers other Historians do: So that (at the best) this is but a negative Argument: And yet that <HI>Hoveden</HI> himself did not look upon him as King even after the whole Nation had sworn Fealty to him before his Coronation, may appear from this passage a little before his coming over: <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ielmus Rex Scotorum misit nuncios ad Iohannem Ducem Normandiae,</HI> &amp;c. Where you see he calls him no more than Duke of <HI>Normandy.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to the Election of his Son Prince <HI>Henry</HI>; if this be all you have to prove a Divine right of Succession in <HI>Henry</HI> the IIId. I doub. it will do you but little service; for according to your own principles it must have been lodged some where else than in this Prince: For when King <HI>Iohn</HI> his Father died <HI>Eleanor</HI> the Sister of Duke <HI>Arthur</HI> was then alive, and died not till the 25<HI>th.</HI> year of King <HI>Henrys</HI> Reign a close Prisoner in <HI>Bristol</HI> Castle, as <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> relates.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat. Paris F.</HI> 574.</NOTE> So that it is apparent he could have no such Di∣vine Hereditary Right as you suppose; and therefore perhaps his Father, to strengthen his Title, and to recommend him the more to the Peoples savour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat. Paris. F.</HI> 288. <HI>Mat. Westm. F.</HI> 276.</NOTE> appointed him his Successor by his last Testa∣ment. And <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> and <HI>Matthew Westminster</HI> tell us, that when King <HI>Iohn</HI> died <HI>Henricum Primegenitum suum, Regni con∣stituit haeredem.</HI> So that it seems there was then no such Heredi∣tary Right, for if it had, what need had there been of this Testa∣ment?</P>
<P>But for all this Divine Right I do not find that this poor Princess <HI>Eleanor</HI> had any of the Bishops or great Lords to take her part, but all the dispute then was at this great Convention at <HI>Gloucester</HI>; whether they should abjure Prince <HI>Lewis,</HI> whom most of them had before chosen for their Lord, and ad∣here to Prince <HI>Henry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 145.</NOTE> there present before them, as <HI>Matthew Pa∣ris</HI> tells us: <HI>Erat autem tâ tempestate inter Optimates Angliae fluctuatio maxima, cui se Regi committe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent; Iuvenine Henrico, An Domino Ludovico?</HI> So that it seems by the relation our Historians give us of this matter, it was not from any great sense that the Clergy and Nobility had of the justness of Prince <HI>Henry's</HI> Title, that made them agree to chuse him King; but the hatred they then bore to Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> when they found he had broken his contract with them, and put all the strong places of the Kingdom in the hands of French men; and treated the English Nobility with scorn and contempt: And there∣fore no wonder if they preferr'd an innocent young Prince of their own Na∣tion, who had never been guilty of his Fathers faults; before a Stranger whose fraudulent dealing with them, they had found not to answer their expectations; and therefore <HI>Mat. Westminster</HI> tells us, That <HI>Omnes nobiles Terrae in brevi ipsi Iuveni Regi Hemico, qui nihil culpae versus tos merueras fideliter adhaeserunt.</HI></P>
<P>But to prove farther that this King came in by Election and not by Succession, appears, by what our Historians relate concerning the manner of it. <HI>Henry de Knyghton</HI> in his Chronicle tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI></NOTE> that on the Feast of St. <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>Iude, Henry</HI> Son of King <HI>Iohn in Regem erigitur viribus, &amp; industria Gualonis Pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Legati</HI>; which plainly shews that he was not King before; and I desire no better an authority than your own Author <HI>Matthew West∣minster,</HI>
<PB N="854" REF="459"/>
who says that he was in <HI>Regem inunctus,</HI> anointed to be King, which shews, that he thought him not so before his Coronation; and though I grant <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> makes the Earl <HI>Marshal</HI> to begin his Speech with those words, <HI>Ecce Rex vester,</HI> as you relate them, yet this was no more than an allusion to that place in St. <HI>Iohn ch.</HI> 19. <HI>Be∣hold your King</HI>▪ it being usual in those days to begin their Speeches with a Text of Scripture. So that the Earl did not intend to be understood literally, for then he should have in this Speech contradicted what he had said b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore; for though to prepossess their minds, he says of the young Prince there present, <HI>Behold your King</HI>: Yet it is plain, that how much soever he thought the Kingdom his right, yet that it could not be conferred upon him without their choice; as appears by these words, which you your self have made use of, <HI>viz. You ought to chuse him to whom the Kingdom is due.</HI> And it is evident by the assent, which the whole Assembly gave to the reasons declared by him in this Speech, that it was their choice alone that made him King; their Votes being given in these words, <HI>Fiat Rex</HI>; which had been altogether needless, had they looked upon him as King already: And therefore the Speech of <HI>Hubert de Burgh,</HI> which you mention; may very well be reconciled to this Hypothesis of supposing a necessity of an Election and Coronation to confer a full and legal right in those times: For when he said, "<HI>That the King if dead, had yet left behind him Children who ought to succeed him.</HI> This, if strictly taken, is altogether false; for <HI>Eleanor</HI> the true Heiress of the Crown (according to your rule of Succession) was then alive: But if taken in a limitted sense is true, that is, the Children ought to succeed if the great Counsel of the Nation thought fit; without whose consent, though they might have <HI>Ius ad rem,</HI> yet had they not <HI>Ius in re</HI>: This Election and Corona∣tion being then looked upon as Livery and Seisen at this day is to an Estate in Fee, without which, though the writings are sealed and delivered, the Land will not pass.</P>
<P>To conclude, I pray answer me that question I have so long put, though with∣out any reply, <HI>viz.</HI> why, before this Election and Coronation was perform'd, none of those Princes that came to the Crown by your supposed Right of Succession, are call'd by any higher Title than Dukes of <HI>Normandy,</HI> or Earls of <HI>Poictou</HI>? So that from what has been here said, I think it plainly appears, that no less than seven of the eight Princes from your <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror (reckoning him for one) to King <HI>Henry</HI> the III. have owed their Title to the Crown, not to any right of Succession; but either to the Election of the People alone, or else to the will or designation of the last King, confirm'd by the general consent of the People given thereunto; and without which it would not have been good according to the ancient custom of the English, <HI>Saxons</HI> before your Conquest; where besides the Testament of the King deceased, there was also required the consent or Election of the great Council. So that you see here was no altera∣tion made in the form of our chusing our Kings after your Conquest from what it was before; for no less than seven or eigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> descents; and when you can answer this, I shall then come over to your opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In answer to your Question, I shall not deny but that all our Historians give all the Kings you mention no higher Titles than Dukes of <HI>Normandy,</HI> or Earls of <HI>Poictou</HI> before their Coronations; which though I suppose they might do from a foolish superstition of that Age, which made them fancy that none
<PB N="855" REF="459"/>
were properly to be called Kings until they had been Anointed, and solemnly Crown'd by a Bishop; yet that they looked upon them as Kings indeed, ap∣pears in that they ordered and disposed of all publick Affairs, conferr'd Offices and Bishopricks as if they were lawful Kings before your pretended Election, or the ceremony of their Coronation, and also had Ambassadors sent to them from Foreign Princes; as appears from your own Quotation out of <HI>Hoveden</HI>: Of those that were sent by the King of Scots to King <HI>Iohn</HI> before he was crowned, though it is true he there stiles him no more than Duke of <HI>Normandy</HI>: And this also may further appear by that passage I have cited out of the same Author; that King <HI>Richard</HI> had Fealty Sworn to him as King of <HI>England</HI> by all the Free∣men of <HI>England</HI> before he was Crown'd, and you your self acknowledge the same Oath to be taken by the same persons to King <HI>Iohn</HI> before he came over to take the Crown.</P>
<P>And Lastly, To make it yet plainer that there was no Vacancy or <HI>Inter-reg∣num</HI> in all these Successions you have mention'd; consult what Chronologer you please, or look into the most ancient Tables of the Succession of our Kings of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> or into our old Printed Statutes or Law Books; and you will still find the Reign of the Suceeding Prince to commence from the Death of his next Prede∣cessor without any Vacancy or <HI>Inter-regnum</HI> between. And these I think to be a great deal surer marks of their succeeding to their Royal Dignity, by a pre∣tence at least of a right of Inheritance from their Father or Brother; rather thau this fancy of yours that you lay so much stress upon: That because of their not being stiled Kings by our Historians till their pretended Election and Coro∣nation was over, they were not so indeed. And I hope this may serve to satisfie this mighty Objection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must beg your pardon if I still declare my self not satisfied with your an∣swers, for though I grant, that if this Argument of the Historians not stiling them Kings, had stood single without any thing else to support it, that your answers might have signified something. But if you please better to consider it, you will find that of these Princes (taking in <HI>William</HI> your Conqueror) claimed, as your self must ac∣knowledge, not by any Hereditary right, but by the Testament of the deceased Pre∣decessor: and if so, where was your setled right of Succession by right of Blood? Secondly, It is likewise as plain, that these four were never admitted or acted in <HI>England</HI> as lawful Kings, till those Testaments were confirmed by the Election of the Great Council, before whom they declar'd their Rights: And till this was done, how the Throne could be otherwise than Vacant, I cannot for my Life conceive. But as for two of them, (whom you call downright Usurpers,) (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>Henry</HI> the I▪ and King <HI>Stephen</HI>; it is certain they could have no colour of a Title till their Elections, and if not till then, and that neither your next Heir of the Crown, nor yet they themselves took upon them the Title of Kings; Was not this a Va∣cancy of the Throne in the mean time? Suppose that time to have been but for the space of three or four days, as it was after the death of King <HI>William Rufus.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place pray consider, that upon the death of every one of these Princes we do not find the Great Council of the Kingdom, which still assembled to Elect the Successor, was ever call'd in their names, but met by their own In∣herent Authority; for how could they be summon'd by the King before he took
<PB N="856" REF="460"/>
that Title upon him, which as your self are forced to acknowledge, he never did till after his Coronation.</P>
<P>Lastly, Pray remember farther, that whoever was thus Elected and Confirm'd by the Great Council, whether he was next Heir by Blood or not, was always looked upon as Lawful King, and has always passed for such in all our Chronicles and Laws, and not those that claimed as the right Heirs by Blood; and if this be not sufficient to prove that these Princes had no true and compleat right to the Crown till this Election was past, I desire you would shew me my mistake.</P>
<P>These things premis'd I think it will be very easie to reply to every one of those answers you pretend to have made to my Query. Therefore as to your First, That they were really Kings before their Election or Coronation, because they order'd and dispos'd of all publick affairs I do not deny; but that some of them, who Suc∣ceeded either as Heirs by Testament, or by right of Blood, might do many pub∣lick Acts, by reason that they looked upon themselves as Heirs Apparent to the Kingdom, and whom the Great Council I grant could not without high Injustice set aside, and upon this account they might also receive Ambassadors from Fo∣reign Princes, in Affairs relating to Peace or War, that they might know how to deal with them, or what to expect from them, after they were setled in the Throne; yet that they sent not to them by the Title of Kings, appears by that passage I cited out of <HI>Hoveden</HI>; but I defie you to shew me any one instance that any of these Princes above mention'd ever took upon them to exercise any of those Prerogatives of Sovereign Power, such as making War or Peace, Enacting Laws, Coining of Money, before their Election and Coronation; which though in some of them was done both at once, yet in others it appears plainly to have been at different times, and not upon the same day, as it happen'd in the case of <HI>Henry</HI> I. whose Election was at <HI>Winchester</HI> upon <HI>Saturday,</HI> and his Coronation was not till the next day; as also that of <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d.</HI> whose Election was upon St. <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>Iude</HI>'s Day, but his Coronation not till the day after.</P>
<P>But as for your next reply, which I grant to have been the strongest you have made, that King <HI>Richard</HI> I. and King <HI>Iohn</HI> had both of them Homage and Fealty sworn to them, as Kings by all the Freemen of <HI>England,</HI> before they were Crown∣ed; this were a material argument if it were made out, as I think it cannot: for in the first place, the bare swearing of Homage and Fealty to a Prince, doth not make him immediately King, though I grant it might give him in that Age a right to be looked upon as Heir Apparent to the Crown: thus <HI>Henry</HI> the I. made all the Lords and Great Men of <HI>England</HI> to swear Homage and Fealty to Prince <HI>William</HI> his Son, and so after his being drown'd, to the Empress <HI>Maud</HI> his Daughter, which was the true reason why she looked upon her self afterwards as Heiress to the Crown; so likewise King <HI>Stephen</HI> a little before his Death (at the great Council I have mention'd) caus'd all the great men of the Kingdom to Swear Homage and Fealty to <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> as his immediate Successour: so that you see this swearing of Fealty was in those days often perform'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore the persons that re∣ceived it were Kings indeed; and so I believe it was done in both those instances you now give me; for though I grant, that <HI>Hoveden</HI> (as you cite him) relates that Homage to be made, and Fealty sworn to <HI>Richard</HI> the I. by the Title of King; yet is it very much to be doubted whether this was not only by a <HI>Prolepsis,</HI> or perhaps a slip of the Pen in this Author; since he writ this History long a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter
<PB N="857" REF="460"/>
King <HI>Richard</HI>'s Death, and therefore without we had the very words of this Oath, there is no certain conclusion to be drawn from thence; and I think we may as well credit the Chronicle of Abbot <HI>Brompton,</HI> who likewise lived about the same time and recites all this affair almost in the same words with those in <HI>Hoveden,</HI> but there the Oath does not run exactly in the same words as in this Author, but thus, <HI>quod unusques∣que liberorum hominum totius regni Iuraret quod sidem portaret Domino Richardo, Domino Angliae filio Domini Regis Henrici, &amp;c. ficut legio Domino suo contra omnes mortales,</HI> where you see the Oath is not made to King <HI>Richard</HI> as King, but only as Lord of <HI>England,</HI> and that there is a great deal of difference between those two Titles not only in name but in Substance, I have already prov'd when I spoke of the Empress <HI>Maud</HI>'s stiling her self <HI>Domina,</HI> and not <HI>Regina Anglorum,</HI> tho' she had Homage rendred, and Fealty sworn to her, not only in her Fathers Life time, but also after her coming over again into <HI>England,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> by all that own'd her Title, and that <HI>Hoveden</HI> himself meant no more than this, appears by that passage I have already taken notice of (<HI>viz.</HI>) that <HI>Hubert</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 793.</NOTE> and <HI>William</HI> the Earl <HI>Marshal</HI> being sent over to keep the Peace, made all the men of the Kingdom, as well of Cities as Burroughs, with the Earls, Barons, and Free-holders, <HI>Iurare fidelitatem &amp; pacem Iohanni Normanorum duci, filio Henrici regis, filii Matildis Imperatricis contra omnes homines</HI>; where you see the Oath is taken to him only as Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> and not as King at all; and therefore you are mistaken to say that <HI>Hoveden</HI> mentions the like Oath to be taken to Duke <HI>Iohn,</HI> as it was before to King <HI>Richard.</HI></P>
<P>But I come now to answer your last argument whereby you would prove that there was no Vacancy or <HI>inter-regnum</HI> in this Age, which is, because that our Chro∣nicles and Tables of Successions do still begin the Reigns of each King, from the day of the Decease of his Predecessors, without any Vacancy or <HI>Inter-regnum</HI> be∣tween them; to which I reply, That none of our antient Chronicles or Historians reckon thus as I know of, but rather acknowledge a Vacancy of the Throne to have been between each Succession; and as for the Tables of the Succession of our Kings, when you can shew me one more antient than the time from which I grant the Crown of <HI>England</HI> began to be looked upon as a Successive, and not an Elective Kingdom, I shall be of your opinion: but admit it were so, since the Succession to the Crown has been for the most part mixt, partly Elective and partly Here∣ditary, our Kings might, to maintain the honour of their Title, still reckon their coming to the Crown immediately from the death of the last Predecessor, tho' there has been oftentimes some days and weeks between the one and the other, as I have now proved, and shall prove farther by and by, which being but small fractions of time, are not taken notice of in the whole account, which may be notwithstanding very agreeable to Law, for both my Lords <HI>Dyer</HI> and <HI>Anderson</HI> in their Reports do agree,
<Q>That the King, <HI>who</HI> is Heir or <HI>Successor,</HI> may Write and begin his Reign the same day that his Progenitor or Predecessor dies.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be to no purpose to dispute this point with you any longer, since I must confess that there were so many Usurpations in the Succession of most of those first Kings after the Conquest, that it is a difficult matter to prove any setled rule of Succession to have been then observed in <HI>England</HI>; and therefore I only desire you to take notice, that though it is true, King <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d</HI> was an Usurper, for the first Twenty five years of his Reign, yet for all the rest of it, which was near
<PB N="858" REF="461"/>
Thirty more, he was a true and lawful Prince, for <HI>Elianor</HI> his Cousin being dead in Prison without issue, and there being no more of that Line left, her Right wholly devolved upon King <HI>Henry,</HI> and he and his Children are to be from hence∣forth reckon'd to have a true Hereditary Right to the Crown without any Com∣petitors.</P>
<P>And that this was so, will plainly appear from the Testament of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d.</HI> (a Copy of which I have by me) where tho' he Bequeaths a great many of his Jewels to the Queen, and a great deal of Money to charitable uses; yet for this Kingdom, and other Territories in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> he makes no Bequest of them at all, either to Prince <HI>Edward</HI> his Eldest, or to <HI>Edmund</HI> his youngest Son, tho' his Father King <HI>Iohn</HI> had bequeathed the Kingdom to him, by his Will, (as you have already shewed) and what could be the reason of this? But that there being now no Title left, to contest with his Son, there was no need of it; and therefore tho' Prince <HI>Edward</HI> was absent in the Holy Land when his Father Died, yet a great Council being call'd in his Name at <HI>London,</HI> he was there only re∣cognized and acknowledged to be their natural Leige Lord and Law∣ful Successor to his Fathers Throne;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F.</HI> 49.</NOTE> pray read the words as they are in <HI>Walsingham</HI>'s Life of this King, <HI>Edwardum absentem Dominum suum Leigium recognoverunt, paternique successorem honoris ordinaverunt</HI>: we meet not here with any thing like Election, which no doubt we should not fail to do, if there had been any such thing practised.</P>
<P>So likewise upon this King's death, his Son King <HI>Edward</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> by the like Right succeeded as Heir to his Father; and tho' this Prince by suffering himself to be too much guided by his Minions, fell at length into such Arbitrary and Irre∣gular courses, as procured him the hatred and ill will of his Subjects to that De∣gree, that by the Disloyal and Ambitious practices of his Lascivious Queen, he being made Prisoner, a Parliament was call'd in his name, who took upon them to Depose him for his misgovernment contrary to all Law and Right; and though his Son Prince <HI>Edward</HI> had hitherto join'd with his Mother against his Father, yet is he herein so far to be commended, that tho' the Crown was offered him, by Election of the Great Council; yet the same Author tells us, he swore, that with∣out his Father's consent he would never accept it; whereupon divers Messengers or Delegates being dispatched from the Parliament to the King, then Prisoner at <HI>Kenel-worth</HI> Castle, who told him what had been done, and concluded of at <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> required him to resign his Crown, and permit his Son to Reign in his stead; which though with some reluctance he at last agreed to; and thereupon Prince <HI>Edward</HI> took the Crown not by Election as you set forth, but by the cession and resignation of his said Father, as appears by the account which this King gave of it to the Sheriffs of all the Counties of <HI>England,</HI> within a few days after his taking upon him the Crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B.

<P>Pray give me leave to answer what you have now said, before you proceed farther in this History of the Succession. In the first place I shall not deny, but that from the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> I. the Crown has been always claim'd (tho' not constantly enjoy'd) by right of Blood; yet that the custom was otherwise before, I think the Instances I have given from the time of your Conquest, are more than sufficient; it is likewise as certain that this Succession by right of Blood, was never setled by any positive Law, and therefore must be purely derived from that Tacit consent of the People called Custom. Secondly, That the two Houses of Parliament have often notwithstanding this claim, placed or fixed the Crown upon the Heads of those Princes whom they very well knew could have no Here∣ditary Right to it. Thirdly, That such Princes have been always obeyed and taken for lawful Kings▪ all their Laws standing good as this day without any confirmation by their Successors, tho' they pretended to a better Title. Now if I prove every one of these three propositions, I think the case will be very plain, that though the Crown has been claim'd and often enjoy'd by right of blood, yet hath it been held near as often otherwise since that time; so that the Succession to it hath been still declar'd under the direction and limitation of the Present King, and Par∣liament.</P>
<P>This being premis'd, I shall proceed in the next place to answer what you have said concerning King <HI>Edward</HI> the first's being only Recogniz'd and not Elected King by the Parliament, it is plain from this History, that the Great Council still maintain'd their an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient right of assembling upon the death of the King, and of Judging who should be his Successor, and that without any summons from him, which will serve to justifie (as do all the other instances aforegoing) that the late
<PB N="860" REF="462"/>
Convention meeting, and setling the Crown without any Writs or Authority deri∣ved from King <HI>Iames</HI> was no new thing; but that they have therein done no more than what hath been antiently practised in like cases; and tho' ('tis true) the words in <HI>Walsingham</HI> is <HI>recognoverunt,</HI> yet there is also other words which seem to intimate, that it was then in the power of the Great Council whom to declare for lawful Successor; the words are, <HI>Paternique Successorem honoris ordinaverunt,</HI> that is, they ordain'd or decreed him Successor of his Fathers Dignity, which sure is some∣what more than a bare Declaration of an undoubted precedent Right, and what power the Great Council was then looked upon to have in the ordering of this Kingdom appears by that Writ of <HI>Dedimus,</HI> for all mens taking the Oaths of Al∣legiance in the Country, which is still to be seen in the close Rolls, and begins thus; <HI>Quia defuncto jam celebris memoriae Domino Henrico patre nostro ad nos Regni Gu∣bernaculum successione Haereditaria Procerum Regni voluntate &amp; fidelitate nobis praestita sit devolutum, &amp;c.</HI> where besides the Hereditary Succession, the good Will and Fidelity of the Great Men is reckon'd as one of the means by which the Kingdom came to him; and that this course was also observed upon the accession of his Son <HI>Edward</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> to the Crown seems likewise as evident from the same Author, who tells us in the beginning of the Life of this Prince, that he succeeded his Father King <HI>Edward, non tam jure Hereditario quam unanimi consensu Procerum &amp; Magnatum</HI>; which observation had been altogether needless, had an unalterable Hereditary Right to the Crown been the setled.</P>
<P>But as to what you say of King <HI>Edward</HI> the 3<HI>ds.</HI> Right, whilst his Father was Living, to have been wholly due to his resignation, tho' the place I cited out of <HI>Walsingham</HI> be express in this point; yet against this you urge a Writ, or Decla∣ration, as also a Proclamation of this Kings, wherein he thus sets forth his Title, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That by the Voluntary resignation of King <HI>Edward</HI> his Father, and by the Council and Advice of the Prelats, Earls, and Barons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he had taken upon him the Government of the Kingdom;</Q>
and consequently that succeeding immedi∣ately upon his said Fathers resignation, there could be no Vacancy of the Throne; to which I answer, that I do not deny that after this King was once setled in the Throne, but that he might think it most to his honour, and the independency of his Title, to relye wholly upon his Right of Succession as Eldest Son, and Heir with∣out taking any notice of the Parliaments Election of him; tho' this be also convert∣ly expressed in these words, which are in this Writ, and Proclamation, <HI>viz.</HI> `That consenting to his said Fathers pleasure, he had taken the Government, <HI>de consilio &amp; advisamento Praelator. Com. Baron. Magnat. &amp; Communitat. praedict.</HI> which though you translate by Council and Advice of the Prelats, Earls, Barons and Commonalty: yet I do suppose that by <HI>consilio</HI> is here meane not Council, but Consent, as I have already proved the word <HI>consilium</HI> often signifies in our antient Statutes; for otherwise if this word must here signifie Council, it would be a plain Tautology, for Advice and Council are the same thing.</P>
<P>But to shew you also that there must needs have been a vacancy of the Throne, either upon the Deposition or Resignation of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> (take it which way you will) appears from matter of Fact, for it is plain, that when Prince <HI>Edward</HI> refus'd the Crown upon the Parliaments Electing him, unless his Father would willingly resign it, he did at their request resign his Title to it, by certain Commissioners sent down to him to <HI>Kenelworth</HI> Castle to take it; now that place
<PB N="861" REF="462"/>
being at least two days Journey from <HI>London,</HI> it is certain there must be as many days vacancy of the Throne if not more before the said Commissioners could get to <HI>London,</HI> and that Prince <HI>Edward</HI> had agreed to take the Crown upon his Fa∣thers Resignation; for till then the Throne was Vacant, since till the Prince had declared his assent to take it, he might have chosen whether he would have ac∣cepted of it or not; as not being satisfied whether his Fathers resignation were voluntary, and not by constraint. Now if there were a Vacancy of the Throne in this case, though but for two or three days; it serves to prove the matter in question as well as if it had been for two years.</P>
<P>So likewise let the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the IVth. begin either from the Re∣signation or Deposition of King <HI>Richard</HI> the II d. (take it which way you please) there must have been a Vacancy of the Throne; as appears by the Parliament Roll still extant. For it is there plain, that after the instruments of King <HI>Richards</HI> Resignation and Deposition were solemnly read, that the Throne con∣tinued Void for some space: Till such time as <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> stood up and made his Claim to it, in that form of words which stands to this day to be seen upon the Parliament Roll, and that the Arch Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> taking the Duke by the hand, had led him to the Throne, and placed him therein.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny but as you have set forth the matter of fact, there must have been a Vacancy of the Throne in these two cases; but since the depositions of both these Kings were contrary to Law, and their resignations extorted from them by constraint whilst they were in prison; they are neither of them looked upon as valid, or to be urged as presidents in future times. But however the Throne might seem then to be Vacant in point of fact, yet in Law it was other∣wise; for <HI>Edmund</HI> Earl of <HI>March</HI> ought to have immediately Succeeded upon the Death or Resignation of King <HI>Richard,</HI> as being Lineally descended from <HI>Philippa</HI> only Daughter and Heir to <HI>Lionel</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> Third Son of King <HI>Edward</HI> the IIId.</P>
<P>But to let you see that <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> (as much an Usurper as he was) yet was so sensible that the Crown could not be then enjoyed by Election, but by Right of Blood; and that the Parliament also thought themselves in duty bound to submit to him to whom by Right of Blood the Crown did belong:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. H. S.</HI> p.</NOTE> Will appear from this Dukes manner of laying claim thereunto: Which, since you have not particularly mention'd, I will.

Where you may see that this whole Parliament admit the Dukes Claim for good without proceeding to any formal Election of him.</P>
<P>And by vertue of this pretended Right, and Claiming as Heir of Earl <HI>Edmund</HI> (Sirnamed Croutch-back, Brother to King <HI>Edward</HI> the Ist.)

Henry</HI> the VIth.) should enjoy the Crown during Life, the Duke to be declared the true Heir, and to possess it after his Death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
And note that all this was done after a solemn hearing of all that could be said on both sides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess the matter of fact concerning King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth. coming to the Crown is truly recited by you from the Parliament Roll; yet for all that it doth not follow that the Parliament allowed this Kings seigned and false claim to be good by their not contradicting it: For though the Record says,
<Q>That upon the hearing of this Challenge or Claim, all the Estates of the Kingdom be∣ing then asked their Judgments severally; they declared, that the same States without any difficulty or delay, unanimously agree'd that the said Duke should Reign over them.</Q>
For considering the Dukes great Power, it was not safe tel∣ling him to his face, that he had no true Right by Inheritance; therefore they only declared in general words without expresly denying or affirming his said Claim, <HI>That he should Reign over them</HI>: Which words do rather amount to an
<PB N="863" REF="463"/>
Election of him to be King, without declaring what Title he had to be so: And this they thought they might very well justifie, not only for his having delivered them from the Tyranny of King <HI>Richard,</HI> but also because they then looked upon it as their Right not only to Depose the King in case of an apparent violation of the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, but also to place in his stead any of the Blood-royal, tho' not next Heir by Blood; according to the Message the whole Parliament had formerly sent to K. <HI>Richard</HI> in the beginning of his Reign by the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and his Uncle the D. of <HI>Gloucester</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. Knighton. Col.</HI> 2681.</NOTE> which I gave you at our ninth Meeting (as I remember:) And pray take notice the words were, <HI>Et propinqai rem aliquem de stirpe Regia, loco ejus in Regnisolio sublimare</HI>: Where observe that the words were not the next of Blood, but some near Kinsman of the Blood Royl.</P>
<P>And though it is true that both King <HI>Henry</HI> the Vth. and VIth. might both seem to succeed to the Crown by Right of Blood, yet I do rather attribute their right of Succession to an Act of Parliament made in the seventh, and confirmed in the eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the IVth.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.</HI> 7. <HI>Hen. IV. Cap.</HI> 2.</NOTE> whereby the Crown was entailed upon all his Sons by Name, and the Right Heirs of their Bodies: By vertue of which settlement both <HI>Henry</HI> the Vth. and VIth Succeded thereunto. For if he had thought his own feigned Hereditary Title to have been sufficient, he would never have troubled himself to have procured the Crown to be setled upon himself and his Children by Act of Parliament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this signifies nothing, for I have already sufficiently proved that in the 39th. year of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth. upon a solemn hearing before the Paliament of the Claim of <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> to the Crown, the said Act was set aside,
<Q>And it was there expresly declared that the said Dukes Title could no ways be defeated:</Q>
And this agreement is still on Record, between <HI>Henry</HI> the then pos∣sessor of the Crown, and the said Duke (whose Right it was) and the Judgment of the Parliament was then given in the behalf of proximity of Blood,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. H. S.</HI> p. 386.</NOTE> as to have always been the foundation and ground of Succession to the Crown of <HI>England</HI>; and of taking it from the Son of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth, and restoring it to the Duke of <HI>York</HI> and his Issue as right Heirs thereof: As appears by the Title and Pedegree of the said Duke set down at large in the first Article of this Agreement confirmed by Par∣liament; that is, by King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth. himself, who was then King <HI>de Facto,</HI> tho' not <HI>de Iure.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not deny the matter of fact to be as you have set forth, yet if you will but please to consider the time when this Declaration and Agreement was obtained, and the manner how it was done; you will quickly find, that it was rather got by force and constraint upon that poor Prince <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth. than by any real Right the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had to the Crown, after its being setled for three De∣scents in the House of <HI>Lancaster.</HI></P>
<P>For the proof of which I desire you in the first place to take notice that at this time the whole Kingdom was under general discontent, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only for the loss of all our Conquests in <HI>France,</HI> but also for the great mismanagement of Affairs at home; by reason of the exorbitant power of the Queen and her two favou∣rites the Dukes of <HI>Somerset</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI>; who made the King a meer Cypher,

and had without his consent made away <HI>Humphrey</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester</HI> (the Kings only Uncle then living) contrary to Law; so that affairs being in this ill posture, it was very easie for the Duke of <HI>York</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> to procure a sufficient Interest in the Nobility and Great men of the Kingdom, to raise an Ar∣my upon pretence at first, only of reforming the grievances of the Kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Grafton</HI>'s Chronicle.</NOTE> and bringing the said Dukes of Justice, the issue of which War was, that the Duke not being strong enough at first to oppose the Kings Forces, was forced to surrender himself, and to obtain his Pardon, took a Solemn Oath never to Rebel against the King again; but being af∣terwards Attainted at a Parliament held at <HI>Coventry</HI> for new Conspiracies, he then again Rebelled, together with the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>; and then that King <HI>Henry</HI> being carried to head his Army, was by the Duke of <HI>York</HI> taken Prisoner in the Battle near <HI>Northampton,</HI> and being thence by him brought up to <HI>London,</HI> a Parlia∣ment was call'd in the Kings name (though without his consent) wherein the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had the confidence to seat himself in the Royal Throne, and to make that challenge of the Crown you have recited; and under how great a ter∣ror all the Friends and Servants of this poor Prince was at that time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Record</HI> 39. <HI>H.</HI> 6. <HI>N.</HI> 11, 12, 13.</NOTE> appears plainly from this, that neither the Kings Attorney, nor any of his Council durst undertake to plead his Cause be∣fore the Parliament, nor yet would the Judges give their opinions in a matter of such great moment, but they all answer'd,
<Q>That this Mat∣ter passed the Learning of the Justices; and also that they durst not enter into any Communication in that matter, and besought all the Lords to have them excu∣sed for giving any Advice or Council therein; but the Lords would not excuse them; and therefore by their Advice and Assistance it was concluded by all the Lords that the Articles following should be objected against the Claim and Title of the Duke;</Q>
So that you see from the Record it self that the Judges were with much ado prevail'd with to object any thing against the Dukes Title.</P>
<P>Therefore considering the great contempt the Kings Person was then under by reason of his weakness, and the great hatred and weariness the Nation had then of the evil Government, of the Queen and her Favourites, it was no more difficult for the Duke of <HI>York</HI> to procure this Judgment in Parliament in savour of his Title, than that <HI>Henry</HI> the 4<HI>th</HI> should after he had put <HI>Richard</HI> the 2<HI>d</HI> in Pri∣son get him Depos'd, and make his own Title to be allow'd for good; and cer∣tainly if it were Rebellion for the Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> to take up Arms against King <HI>Richard</HI> the 2<HI>d</HI> and to Depose him, I cannot see why (according to your own Principles) it should not be the same crime in the Duke of <HI>York</HI> to take up Arms against King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<HI>th,</HI> to whom he had more than once sworn Faith and Alle∣giance, and having taken him Prisoner, to call a Parliament whereby himself was declared Protector of the Kingdom, and the Son of King <HI>Henry</HI> disinherited after a quiet possession in three descents, during the space of above sixty years, which if it will not give a thorough settlement after two Acts of Parliament to con∣firm it, I know not what can.</P>

<P>I confess you have given me a more exact account of this transaction than ever I had yet, and I should very much incline to be of your opinion, were it not that I am satisfied that our Kings have a Right to the Crown by Gods Law as well as mans, as also by the Law of Nature, and that more than one Parliament
<PB N="865" REF="467"/>
have been of my opinion in this matter, I shall shew you from several Statutes and Declarations of Parliament, which though not Printed, are yet to be seen at this day upon the Parliament Rolls; for after that <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI> or rather his queen for him, had broken the aforesaid solemn agreement made between this King and Duke in Parliament, whereby it was accorded, that if King <HI>Henry</HI> made War again upon the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> he should then forfeit his present Right to the Kingdom during his Life,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.

Rolls</HI> 1. <HI>Ed.</HI> 4. <HI>N.</HI> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <HI>B.H.S.</HI> p. 388.</NOTE> and having immediately call'd a Par∣liament, it was therein declar'd,
<Q>that all the proceedings against K. <HI>Ri∣chard</HI> the ad are repeal'd, and the taking him Prisoner by <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Darby</HI> was declared against his Faith and Allegiance, and that with violence he had usurped upon the Royal Power and Dignity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that he had by cruel Tyranny Murther'd and Destroy'd the said King <HI>Ri∣chard</HI> his Liege and Soveraign Lord, against Gods Law and his own Oath of Alle∣giance.</Q></P>
<P>And then they proceed further to declare in these words,
<Q>That the Commons being of this present Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> having sufficient and evident knowledge of the said unrightwise Usurpation, and intrusion by the said <HI>Henry</HI> late Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> upon the said Crown of <HI>England</HI>; knowing also certainly, without doubt and ambiguity, the Right and Title of our said Sovereign Lord (<HI>viz.</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th</HI>) thereunto true, and that by Gods Law, Mans Law, and the Law of Nature, he, and none other, is, and ought to be their True, Rightwise, and Natural Leige, and Sovereign Lord, and that he was in Right from the death of the said noble and famous Prince his Father, very just King of the said Realm of <HI>England,</HI> and will for ever take, ac∣cept, and repute, the said King <HI>Edward</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourth, their Sovereign and Liege Lord, and him and his Heirs to be Kings of <HI>England,</HI> and none other, accord∣ing to the said Right and Title.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And that the same <HI>Henry</HI> unrightwisely,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id.</HI> p. 389.</NOTE> against Law, Conscience, and the Customs of the said Realm of <HI>England</HI> Usurped upon the said Crown; and that he and also <HI>Henry,</HI> late call'd K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 5<HI>th.</HI> his Son, and <HI>Henry</HI> Late called <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<HI>th.</HI> his Son, occupy'd the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> and Lordship of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and exercised the Governance thereof, by Unrightwise, Intrusion, Usurpa∣tion, and no otherwise; that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>motion of <HI>Henry</HI> late called King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI> from the Exercise, Occupation, Usurpation, Intrusion, Reign and Governance of the▪ said Realm and Lordship, done by our Sovereign Lord King <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th.</HI> was and is rightwise, Lawful, according to the Laws, and Customs of the said Realm, and so ought to be taken, holden, reputed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccupied.</Q></P>
<P>I have been the larger on this point, because it is a full and free Declaration of the whole Parliament, nor only against all past as well as future Parliaments hav∣ing any thing to do in the disposal of the Crown, but is also as express a Declara∣tion as words can make, against any Vacancy of the Throne upon the Death of the

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot blame you for being very exact in this point, because the whole strength of your Cause depends upon it; but yet I doubt not but to shew you, that this Parliament was as much awed by King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Power, being now Con∣queror, as ever those Parliaments were that Depos'd <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the 2<HI>d</HI>▪ for you your self have sufficiently set forth the manner of it, that it was not till after a great Victory obtain'd against King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<HI>th.</HI> and I never found in all my reading, that a Victorious Prince ever wanted power enough to get a Parliament call'd to settle himself in the Throne, and declare his Competitor an Usurper; as I shall shew you more fully by and by: but that this Act of Parliament, which thus posi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ively declares <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th</HI> to be their Sovereign Lord, by God's Law, Man's Law, and the Law of Nature, I think can no ways consist either with Scripture, Reason, or Matter of Fact; for in first place, I think I have sufficiently proved, that there is no Divine Right of Succession for the Heirs of Crowns, any more than of other Inheritances, either by the Law of God, or that of Nature; and as for Man's Law, I think I have here also proved, that the Suc∣cession to the Crown by right of Blood alone, was never establisht by any positive Law, nor yet setled by any constant or interrupted Custom, when this Declara∣tion was made; for the Crown had then never descended from Father to Son. for above two Descents, without a deposition, or possessed by those who claim'd by Right of Blood, without any other Title; for as for the three Kings of the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> I have already proved (and your self must also own it) that they could have no Title to the Crown, but from the Acts of Entail of the 7<HI>th</HI> and 8<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 4<HI>th</HI> above mention'd so that according to Man's Law, that is Custom, and also the Statute Law of this Kingdom, the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> had all that time the better Title.</P>
<P>But to shew you what uncertain things Parliaments are, when King <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th</HI> had Reign'd ten years, he was driven out of the Kingdom, by the Earl of <HI>War∣wick</HI>'s turning suddenly against him, and in his absence he replaced King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI> upon the Throne, who had been all this while kept in Pri∣son; and the first Act this King did after his Restoration,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Grafton</HI>'s Chronicle.</NOTE> was to call a Parliament, which revoked all the former Statutes and De∣clarations of the 39<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<HI>th.</HI> and 1<HI>st.</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th.</HI> and then entail'd the Crown anew upon the issue of King <HI>Henry,</HI> the remainder to the Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> who then took part with King <HI>Henry</HI> against his own Bro∣ther.</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed that King <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th</HI> returning again not long after into <HI>England,</HI> and regaining the Crown from King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<HI>th.</HI> the said King was not only murther'd, together with his Son Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> but in the next Parlia∣ment, was also attainted of Treason, with all others of his Party, and yet lot let you see that this very Act is now null and void against King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<HI>th.</HI> and his Son Prince <HI>Edward</HI>; see an Act of Parliament of the first of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th.</HI> (not Printed) which because it is not commonly known,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rol.

famous Prince of blessed memory King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth his Uncle, at the Parlia∣ment holden at <HI>Westminstey,</HI> the fourth day of <HI>November,</HI> the first year of the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th.</HI> Late King of <HI>England,</HI> whereby his said Uncle contrary to the due Allegiance, and all due order, was attainted of High Treason, where∣fore our same Sovereign Lord, by the Advice and Assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament▪ assembled, and by Au∣thorities of the same, ordaineth, enacteth, and establisheth, that the same Act, and all Acts of Attainder, Forfailure, or Disablement made or had in the said Par∣liament, or else in any other Parliament, of the said Late King <HI>Edward</HI> against the said most blessed Prince King <HI>Henry,</HI> or against the right famous Princess <HI>Margaret</HI> Late Queen of <HI>England,</HI> his Wife, or the right Victorious Prince <HI>Ed∣ward,</HI> Late Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> Son of the same blessed Prince K. <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Marga∣ret, &amp;c.</HI> are void, annulled, and repealed, and of no force, nor effect; so that by vertue of this Act, the Title of the House of <HI>Lancaster</HI> was again declared to be good.</Q></P>
<P>But to conclude, I cannot but take notice of one mistake you have fallen into, by saying, that all proceedings against King <HI>Richard</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> are repeal'd by that Parliament of the first of <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th.</HI> which is not so; for though I grant that the dealings of <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Darby</HI> (as he is there call'd) in imprisoning the said King, and Usurping the Royal Power, is there expresly condemned, and his Murthering of him said to be against Gods Law, and his own Oath of Allegiance (as certainly it was) yet the Deposition of the said King <HI>Richard</HI> by Parliament is no ways repeal'd by this Act, for then all the Records thereof would have been quite Cancell'd and taken off the Rolls, whereas they still remain to be seen at this day; and you see by this Act I now recited,
<Q>That the attainder of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI> is declar'd contrary to due Allegiance, and all due order, and all for∣feitures, and disablements of the said King and Prince are quite annull'd and made void.</Q></P>

<P>I must confess you have so stagger'd me with this Act, that I know not what to say to it, but that it was made in the first Parliament of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th.</HI> and before he had married the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and consequently had no good Title to the Crown himself, therefore till then I look upon him as an Usurper; but I shall now proceed to sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w you, that that very King, nay, even <HI>Richard</HI> the 3<HI>d.</HI> him∣self, chiefly relied, not upon any Parliamentary Election, but upon their own pre∣tended Titles of being right Heirs by Blood; for after the death of <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th.</HI> his Son <HI>Edward</HI> the 5<HI>th.</HI> was proclaim'd King and might have quietly enjoy'd it, if his ambitious Uncle <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>Gloucester</HI> had not plotted to defeat him of it; and knowing very well that he had no way to bring it about, but by inciting a corrupt party of the Bishops and Lords,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Grafton</HI>'s Chronicle.</NOTE> together with the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and some of his Party in the City, to set forth by way of Petition to the Duke then Protector of the King and Realm,
<Q>That all the Children of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<HI>th</HI> were Bastards, supposing that King to have been Contracted with a certain Woman called <HI>Eleanor Boteler,</HI> be∣fore he Married Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; moreover, that the Blood of his Elder Bro∣ther <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence</HI> deceased, was attainted; so that none of the Lineal Blood of <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> could be found uncorrupted but in himself; and there was at the conclusion of that Roll, an Address to him from the Lords and
<PB N="868" REF="469"/>
Commons of the Kingdom; that he would take the Government upon himself: this fine artifice assisted on one side with his feigned excuses, which induced the less thinking sort of People to believe, he desir'd not the Royalty, and prompted on the other side with the fear of his power, procured his accession to the Throne, so that at last, he and his Wife <HI>Anne</HI> were solemnly Crowned King and Queen at <HI>West∣minster</HI>; and by these steps did that inhumane Prince, who had no Title to the Crown, either by descent, or by merit ascend the English Throne; see you that not by Election, but by pretence of blood, and by bastardising and attainting his Nephews, he set himself up for the only true Heir of the Crown; and therefore in the Parliament he call'd immediately after his Coronation, when they had declar'd almost the very same things as were before in the said Petition,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Collection of Records.</HI> 1 Richard III.</NOTE> they proceed further;</Q>
<Q>To declare that the Right, Title, and Estate which King <HI>Richard</HI> the III<HI>d</HI> had to, and in the Crown and Royal Dignity of the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> with all things thereunto, within the said Realm, and without it, annexed and appertain∣ing, was just and lawfull, as grounded upon the Laws of God and Nature, and also upon the antient Laws and laudable Customs of this said Realm, as also taken and reputed by all such Persons as were learned in the above-said Laws and Cu∣stoms, (and proceeds farther thus,) therefore at the request and by the assent of the three Estates of this Realm, (that is to say) the Lords Spiritual, and Tempo∣ral, and Commons of this Land, Assembled in this present Parliament, and by the Authority of the same, it is pronounced, decreed, and declared, that our said Soveraign Lord the King was and is the very undoubted King of this Realm of <HI>England,</HI> with all things thereunto belonging within the said Realm, and with∣out it, united, annexed, and appertaining, as well by right of Consanguinity, and Inheritance, as by lawfull Election, Consecration, and Coronation.</Q></P>
<P>So that you see tho' they put in his Election, as also his Coronation, as means of obtaining the Crown, yet the pretended hereditary right of blood was the main ground of his Establishment.
<Q>But as for King <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th,</HI> tho' he could claim the Crown by no true Right of Inheritance, yet would he never own it to be an Election by Parliament; for as soon as King <HI>Richard</HI> was slain in the Battle of <HI>Bosworth,</HI> the Lord <HI>Stanley</HI> put his Crown upon <HI>Henry</HI>'s head; who immediately stiling himself King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Lord</HI> Ba∣con's <HI>Life of</HI> K. Henry <HI>the</HI> 7th.</NOTE> as well by right of Con∣quest, as by being sole Heir Male of the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> He as such, caused himself to be Crowned King; and though he afterwards call'd a Parliament, in which he procured his Title to be recognised,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fol.</HI> 7.</NOTE> yet, as my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> very well observes, he was afraid to take the Crown (by his only true Title) in right of the Lady <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Queen, for fear he should only be King by Courtesie, and must upon the Queens death have resign'd it again; and should he take it by E∣lection, he knew there was a very great difference between a King that holdeth his Crown by a Civil Act of the Estates, and one (<HI>mind that</HI>) that holdeth it ori∣ginally by the Law of Nature, and descent of Blood; and therefore upon these Considerations, he resolved to rest upon the Title of the House of <HI>Lancaster</HI> as his main Right; and thereupon he caus'd an Act of Parliament to pass, wherein his Title was acknowledged (as my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> there tells us) not by way of De∣claration, or Recognition of Right, as on the other side, he avoided to have it
<PB N="869" REF="469"/>
by a new Law of Ordinance, but chose rather a kind of a middle way, by way of establishment, and that under covert and indifferent words,</Q>
<Q>that the inheritance of the Crown, should rest, remain and abide in the King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which words might be equally applied, that the Crown should continue to him; but whether as having former right to it (which was doubtful) or having it then in fact or possession (which no Man denied) was left fair to interpretation either way.</Q>
I speak not this to justifie all his actions, but to let you see that he chiefly insisted upon his right of inheritance, and absolutely disown'd any Title by Election from the People.</P>

<P>I cannot deny the matter of fact concerning King <HI>Richard</HI> the III<HI>ds</HI> Depo∣sing his Nephew, and Usurping the Crown to have been very wicked, and con∣trary to the received Law of <HI>England</HI> concerning the Succession at that time; and likewise that by Bastardizing his Brother the late King's Issue without due course of Law, and by attainting the blood of his other Brother the Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> he would have made the World believe that he was Lawful Heir by right of blood; yet you will not deny but that for all this, he was so sensible of the weakness of his Title, that though (it is true) his right by blood is declar'd in the first place in that Act of Recognition, yet it is plain he would not rely upon that alone, and therefore you see the Parliament there also insists upon his right by Election, and Coronation, which they would never have done, had it not been that they looked upon it for good Law, that whoever was Crowned King, and call'd a Parliament, and had his Title therein Recognized and Confirmed, was thenceforth true and lawful King to all intents and purposes; therefore though you have omitted it, I shall proceed to shew you, what this Statute also farther declares: For after they had declar'd the said King's Title,
<Q>as grounded upon the Antient Laws and Lau∣dable Customs of the Realm, according to the Judgement of all such Persons as were learned in them; they proceed thus: Yet nevertheless, for as much as it is consider'd, that the most part of the People is not sufficiently learned in the aforesaid Laws and Customs, whereby truth and right in his behalf, of likelihood may be had, and not clearly known to all People, and thereupon put in doubt and question; and over this, how that the Court of Parliament is of such Authority, that a Declaration made by the three Estates, and by the Authority of the same, maketh before all other things most faithful and certain quieting of Mens Minds, and removeth the occasion of doubts, and seditious Language; therefore they also declare that he was the undoubted King.</Q>
Whence 'tis evi∣dent, that the reason of this Law supposeth that the Subjects in general are not capable of understanding the Laws and Customs upon which the Titles of our Kings depend; and that the best satisfaction that the generality of the People can possibly have in those high Matters, was to rest on the judgment and determina∣tion of the Kingdom, declared by Act and Authority of Parliament, and therein to acquiesce for the preventing Sedition, so much as in Language: therefore what I said before in the Case of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> is also true in this, <HI>quod fieri non debuit, factum valet</HI>; and all the Acts made in the Reign of this King <HI>Richard,</HI> though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> horrid Usurper, were never repeal'd, but stand good at this day.</P>
<P>As to what you say concerning the manner of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>ths</HI> coming to the Crown is also true, but as for his Title to it by right of Succession, that was certainly false; for his Mother the Countess of <HI>Richmond</HI> was then alive, by whom he Claim'd the Crown, and liv'd divers years after he was King; so that though I
<PB N="870" REF="470"/>
grant that it is recited in the Parliament Roll that he claim'd the Crown in Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Parl.</HI> 1. Hen. VII.</NOTE> <HI>tam per justum titulum haereditantiae, quam per verum Dei judicium, in tribuendo sibi victoriam de Inimico suo in campo</HI>; tho' the latter of these Titles may be true, <HI>Viz.</HI> the Conquest of King <HI>Richard,</HI> especially when once he was confirm'd and recognized in Parliament, yet that the former could not be so, is plain from what I have now said; so that it is certain that King <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>ths</HI> best Title was neither by Inheritance nor Marriage with the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> but by the Act of Parliament, as appears by the unprinted Statute it self, still upon the Roll, which since you did not repeat,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Buck<HI>'s History of</HI> Ri∣chard <HI>the</HI> III<HI>d.</HI></NOTE> I will; the Title is <HI>Titulus Regis,</HI> and it runs in these words,
<Q>To the Pleasure of Almighty God, the Wealth, Prosperity, and Surety of this Realm of <HI>England</HI> to the singular comfort of all the Kings Subjects of the same, and in a∣voiding of all ambiguities and questions, be it Ordained, Established, and En∣acted by Authority of this present Parliament, that the inheritance of the Crowns of the Realms of <HI>England,</HI> and of <HI>France,</HI> with all the preeminence and dignity Royal to the same pertaining, and all other Seignouries to the King belonging beyond the Sea, with th' Appurtenances thereto in any wise due or pertaining, be, rest, remain and abide in the Most Royal Person of our now Sovereign Lord King <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th,</HI> and in the Heirs of his Body lawfully coming per∣petually with the grace of God so to endure, and in none other.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Now this was done some time before he Married with the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> for as soon as this Act was made, the Commons requested the King to marry <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> the Daughter of King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, that by God's Grace there might be Issue of the stock of their Kings (as their own words were;) and that this was rather to preserve the Blood Royal, than to give any new confirmation to his Ti∣tle appears from hence, that there was never any other Act after the Marriage to declare the right of the Crown to be in the King, and Queen, or so much as to entail it on the issue of their Bodies; so that it is plain he enjoy'd it not in his Wives, but in his own right, since he held it after her death, by vertue of this Statute, which plainly shows, (that in the judgement of that Parliament) the House of <HI>Lancaster</HI> was lookt upon to have the better Title: And (though it is true) that the King procured the Pope's Bull now in the <HI>Cotton Library,</HI> to strengthen his Title, threatning all those with Excommunication that should offer to rebell a∣gainst him; yet even that Bull (tho' his right by Inheritance and Conquest be first mentioned) concludes with his Title by the E∣lection of the Prelates,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. H. S.</HI> p. 391.</NOTE> Nobility, and People of <HI>England</HI>; and the Decree or Statute of the three Estates in their Convention, call'd the Parliament, as this Bull it self expresses it.</Q></P>

<P>I must confess you have told me more of these matters, than ever I heard of before, for I always thought that there had been no Act of Settlement upon King <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th,</HI> until after his Marriage with the Princess <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; for till then I look upon him as an Usurper upon her right, as he was also after her death upon his Sons successively; so that if you will have my Opinion, I conceive that this Statute being made before he had a lawfull right to the Crown is wholly void, as is also that of the repeal of the attainder of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VI<HI>ths</HI> for the same reason.</P>
<P><PB N="871" REF="470"/>
<Q>But let his Title be what it will, it is ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ain, his Son King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII<HI>th</HI> Suc∣ceeded to the Crown, as Heir rather to his Mother, than his Father, and so was in by remitter; but as for King <HI>Edward</HI> the VI<HI>th,</HI> he was undoubted Heir by right of blood, as being the only Heir Male to his Father; and though it is true, that King <HI>Henry</HI> made divers Statutes whereby he alter'd the Succession of the Crown as to his two Daughters <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> sometimes declaring them both illegitimate, and then again giving them a right to Succeed by Act of Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. H. S.</HI> p. 393.</NOTE> yet these Acts of Succession were obtained purely by the King's Sollicitation, and Command; and tho' at last he got himself impower'd to make a Will, whereby he might settle and entail the Crown on whom he pleas'd, yet all these Acts of Parliament, as also this, will signifie just nothing after his death; for tho' his said Daughters Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> did one after another succeed his Son King <HI>Edward</HI> the VI<HI>th,</HI> yet was it not by vertue of any of these Acts of Parliament, or by the aforesaid Will, but by pure right of inheritance (or colour of it at least) and therefore in the first of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> there is an Act decla∣ring the Queens Highness to have been born in most just and faithful Matrimony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Mar.</HI> 2 chap.</NOTE> and also repealing all Acts of Parliament, and Sentence of Divorce made or had to contrary.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Now certainly the intention of this Act was to declare her Succession to be In∣heritance by right of blood; so likewise in the first of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Lords Spi∣ritual and Temporal, and Commons do declare and confess that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> is in very deed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Eliz.</HI> c. 1.</NOTE> and of meer right, by the Laws of God, and by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, their most rightfull and lawfull Sovereign Queen, and that she was rightly, lineally, and law∣fully descended and come of the Blood-Royal of this Realm of <HI>England</HI>; all which (whether it were true or not in her) yet the lineal and lawful descent of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> was the ground upon which she was declar'd to be their Rightfull and Lawfull Queen.</Q></P>
<P>And though I grant that King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth. had by his Last Will and Testa∣ment post poned all the Issue of his Sister <HI>Margaret</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> and pre∣ferred the Children of his younger Sister the Queen <HI>Dowager</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> (which she had by <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Suffolke</HI> before them: Yet was this Will afterward cancelled, and torn off from the Rolls in Chancery where it was Recorded;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. H. S.</HI> 394.</NOTE> and that by order of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> (as is supposed.) So that <HI>Iames</HI> the VIth. King of <HI>Scotland</HI> was by Right of Blood De∣clared and Proclaimed King of <HI>England</HI> immediately upon the Death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as right Heir of the Crown. And in the first Par∣liament after his Coronation, his Title is by them particularly recognized in the words which I desire you to read with me:
<Q>Where after setting forth his Pedigree as lineally descended from the Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> eldest Daughter of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th,</HI> and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, Daughter of King <HI>Edward</HI> the IV<HI>th</HI>; they farther acknowledge King <HI>Iames</HI> their Lawful and rightful Leige Lord, and Sovereign; and farther say, as being bound thereunto both by the Laws of God and Man, that they do recognize and acknowledge that immediately upon the dissolution and decease of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> late Queen of <HI>England,</HI> the Imperial Crown of the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> and all Kingdoms &amp; Dominions belonging to the same, did
<PB N="872" REF="471"/>
by inherent Birth-right, and lawfull and undoubted Succession descend and come to his Most Excellent Majesty, being lineally, lawfully, and justly, next, and sole Heir of the Blood Royal of this Realm▪ and thereunto they do most hum∣bly and faithfully submit and oblige themselves, their Heirs and Posterities for e∣ver, until the last drop of their bloods be spent.</Q>
I have been the more particu∣lar in the recital of this Act, because it stands not only as a perpetual Declaration of the sense of the Representatives of the whole Nation for an hereditary Suc∣cession of the Crown without any vacancie or election, but also because it contains, their solemn engagement for themselves and their posterities for ever to King <HI>Iames,</HI> and his issue, and consequently to his right Heirs for ever; so that nothing can be more directly contrary than this Act to the late proceedings of the Con∣vention, first in declaring the Throne vacant, and then placing the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> therein.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not deny but that King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII<HI>th,</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI> the VI<HI>th,</HI> both succeeded by right of inheritance, but whether the former claim'd it as Heir to his Mother or his Father, is much to be doubted; since being Heir to both of them, he never declar'd by what Title he held the Crown: But as for his two Daughters, Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it is certain their best Titles were from these Acts of Parliament; for as to Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> it is plain, that at her coming to the Crown, she could not be looked upon as Heir by right of blood, because by the Statute of the 25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII<HI>th,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 22.</NOTE> his Marriage with Queen <HI>Catherine</HI> her Mother was declar'd unlawful, and the Crown setled upon the King, and the Heirs of his Body lawfully begotten on Queen <HI>Anne Bullen</HI>; and besides all this, she was but Sister by the half blood to King <HI>Edward</HI> the VI<HI>th,</HI> and so could not inherit as heir to him; and though in the first year of her Reign, the Parliament (tis true) took off her illegitimation, and repeal'd the Acts of the 25<HI>th,</HI> and 28<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. whereby she was declar'd illegitimate; yet in this, the Parliament seems rather to provide for the honour of her descent, than (as you would have it) to declare her Succession to be Inheritance by right of blood, because the Statute of the 35<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII<HI>th,</HI> whereby the Crown was setled upon Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> and the Heirs of his Body, the remainder upon the Ladys <HI>Mary,</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; and whereby the King had also power given him, of disposing the Crown by Letters Patents, or by Will, was not at all repeal'd; and for which, a memorable
<Q>Reason is given in both these Acts, least if such Heirs should fail, and no provision made in the King's Life, who should Rule and Go∣vern this Realm, for lack of such Heirs, that then this Realm should be destitute of a Lawful Governour; whereby it seems plain, that the Parliament then e∣steemed no Heirs to have a Right by Law, farther than had been declar'd by these Statutes.</Q></P>
<P>So likewise for Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> her Title was more apparently by Act of Par∣liament, and that she looked upon her self sufficient to have succeeded, by vertue of the limitation of the Statute of the 35<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, last mention'd, appears in that she never procured her Mothers Marriage to be declared good, and consequently her own illegitimation to be taken off; so that take it which way you will, it is certain that either Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> or Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Title must have been only by Act of Parliament, since she was born whilst Queen <HI>Catherine,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI>'s first Wife was living; and therefore, when the Parliament you men∣tion,
<PB N="873" REF="471"/>
in the first Year of
<Q>Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> declar'd, that she was Rightly, Lawfully, and Lineally descended, and come of the blood Royal of this Realm, yet these words can only be understood of such a lineal and lawful descent as is here declar'd to be so by vertue of this, as well as the former Statute;</Q>
and not ac∣cording to any hereditary descent at Common-Law, since it is very well known, that as long as the <HI>Popes</HI> dispensation for King <HI>Henrys</HI> Marriage with the Princess <HI>Ca∣therine</HI> his Brothers Wife was allowed for good, as it was till the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>ths,</HI> and all the first 25 years of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII<HI>ths</HI> Reign, the Princess <HI>Mary</HI> was looked upon as the only presumptive Heiress of the Crown; this I tell you, not to invalidate Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Title, but to let you see that Acts of Parliament, if they declare that which is apparently false in matter of Law or Fact are not to be credited, unless you will give them more power than God himself, who can∣not (as all Divines agree) make that to have been done which was never done, or that not to have been done, which hath once come to pass.</P>
<P>I come now in the last place, to examine the Act of Recognition of King <HI>Iames</HI> the Firsts Title to the Crown, which I will not dispute to have been by right of blood, since none of the descendants of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th</HI> could have any Ti∣tle before him; for though it is true it was otherwise ordain'd by King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII<HI>ths</HI> Will, yet that (as you your self show) was not only cancell'd in Queen <HI>Marys</HI> time, but was also void in it self; for, whereas by the Statute of the 35<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII<HI>th,</HI> there was a power given him to dispose of the Crown, either by his Letters Parents, or else by his last Will Signed with his Hand, yet was this power never legally executed; for those that have argued against this Will,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi.</HI> Lething∣ton's <HI>Letter to Sir</HI> Will. Cecil. <HI>Ap∣pendix to the</HI> 2<HI>d Vol. of the History of the Reformation.</HI> fol. 269.</NOTE> have told us, that he never Sign'd it in his life time, but that a stamp of his Name was put thereunto after his decease, as most ma∣nifestly appeared by open declaration made in Parliament of this matter by the Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> and others, that King <HI>Henry</HI> did never Sign it with his own Hand, as was also proved by the Pardon ob∣tain'd for one <HI>William Clerke,</HI> for puting the Stamp unto the said Will, after the King was departed.
<Q>So that though I grant that King <HI>Iames</HI> had a very good Title to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> by Inhe∣ritance, yet whether it was from King <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th</HI> alone, or from Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Wife, is not there declar'd; only that he was lawfully descended of Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> Eldest Daughter to King <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th,</HI> and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Wife, Eldest Daughter of King <HI>Edward</HI> the IV<HI>th,</HI> and therefore, that they are bound both by the Laws of God and Man to Recognize his Majesty as sole Heir of the blood Royal of this Realm;</Q>
all which is so far true if by Gods Law, and Mans Law, you will thereby understand such Laws as God impowers the King and Parliament to make, for otherwise, there is no more heed to be taken of this Declaration, than that which was made before to <HI>Richard</HI> the III<HI>d,</HI> which also declared him to have a good Title to the Crown by the Laws of God, and Nature, and the Laws and Customs of this Realm. So that I see no∣thing in all this Act of Recognition, that at all contradicts my notion, that King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Title is wholly derived from the Act of Settlement made on King <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th,</HI> from whom he was lineally descended; so that though his Pedigree be also derived from Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Eldest Daughter to King <HI>Edward</HI> the IV<HI>th,</HI> yet this was only <HI>ex abundanti,</HI> to show that he had every way a Title to the Crown, and
<PB N="874" REF="472"/>
if she her self had any Title, it was wholly by vertue of those Acts of Parliament of the 39<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI<HI>th,</HI> and 1<HI>st</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the IV<HI>th,</HI> which vested the Crown in <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and King <HI>Edward</HI> the IV<HI>th</HI> his Son, and which last Act first declar'd that the three <HI>Henrys</HI> of the House of <HI>Lancaster</HI> were only Kings in deed, and not of right; for before that time I defie you to show me in all our Histories or Law-books any such distinction. In all foregoing times he that was so∣lemnly Annointed and Crown'd King in Deed, was also looked upon so to be in point of right, and therefore let those Statutes you so much insist upon, talk never so much of any Kings being so, by any fundamental hereditary right precedent to, and independent from the power of the two Houses of Parliament: I am very well satisfied that such a Declaration must be void in it self, since I have sufficiently proved that there was no such Law of Succession ever setled by any general Cu∣stom, or Common Law, since it hath been near as often broken, as observed; and as for any positive or Statute-Law enacting any hereditary right of Succession you do not so much as pretend to show it; so that I think I have sufficiently proved the three Propositions I laid down, <HI>viz.</HI> That ever since the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, though the Crown has been claim'd by right of blood, yet has it not been very often enjoy'd by Princes who had no just pretence to that Title Secondly, that the two Houses of Parliament have often, notwithstanding that claim, placed, or at least fixed the Crown upon the heads of those Princes who they very well knew could have no hereditary right to it. Thirdly, That such Princes have been al∣ways taken for lawful Kings, all their Laws standing good at this day, without any Confirmation by their Successours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not think that you who were so great an admirer of the two Houses of Parliament, should now be so much against their power in joyning with the King to declare what the true right of Succession to the Crown is, and hath ever been from time beyond memory: But I see Acts or Declarations of Parliament signifie nothing with you if they are against your Hypothesis, or else you would ne∣ver go about thus to expose those Acts of Parliament of King <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth. and King <HI>Iames</HI> the Ist. Whereby they are declared both by the Law of God and Man undoubted Heirs of the Crown. And the last Act I cited, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That of King <HI>Iames</HI> the Ist. doth sufficiently confute your Notion of a Vacancy of the Throne: Where it is expresly declared,
<Q>That immediately upon the decease of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Crown of <HI>England</HI> with all the Dominions belonging to the same, did by Inherent Birth-right, and Lawful and Undoubted Succes∣sion descend and come to his Majesty King <HI>Iames.</HI></Q>
So that if there then were no Vacancy of the Throne, I cannot see how there could be any such thing now; the next Heir to the Crown (be He who they will) being certainly not so far removed from King <HI>Iames</HI> the Ist. as himself was from King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth. under whom he claimed.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must still confess my self to have a great veneration for the solemn De∣clarations of King and Parliament, made by any Statute; yet not so as to Idolize them, or to look upon all their Declarations as infallible: I grant indeed that whosoever is by them Declared and Recognized for King or Queen of <HI>England,</HI> is to be acknowledged and obeyed as such, by all the Subjects of this Kingdom; without farther questioning his Title: But if not content with this, they will also take upon them to declare that such Kings or Queens have an undoubted Hereditary
<PB N="875" REF="472"/>
Right by the Laws of God and Nature, When I plainly find from the Holy Scrip∣tures, as well as the History of matter of Fact, and the knowledge of our Laws, that they have no other Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le than what the Laws of the Land have conferred upon them;
<Q>and therefore you your self cannot deny, but that it was gross flat¦tery in the two Houses of Parliament to declare, that <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId (for-example) had a true and undoubted Right to the Crown, by the Laws of God, and Nature, and also by the Laws and Customs of this Realm, when you know he was a notorious Usurper upon the Rights of his Brother King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Children.</Q>
now how can I be assur'd that the like Declaration made to K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng <HI>Iames</HI> the I. was not l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kewise a piece of Courtship of the Representative of the Kingdom to this King then newly setled in his Throne; since we find the People of this Nation, when they are in a kind fit, never think they can say, or do too much for their Princes; and therefore I must freely tell you, that it is not the bare Declaration of a Parlia∣ment that this or that has been always the Law or Custom of this Realm, when we can find from History that it has never been so held for above four hundred years at least, and therefore not beyond the memory of Man (as you suppose) since that must be before the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the First as I have already proved to you at our Eighth Meeting.</P>
<P>But to answer your Objection against the vacancy of the Throne, I do freely grant, that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Crown descends by lineal Succession, there can be no va∣cancy of the Throne, as it did in the Case of King <HI>Iames</HI> the First: yet doth it not therefore follow, that there can never be any such Vacancy in any Case whatsoe∣ver, since certainly it may so happen, that all the Heirs Male of the Blood-Royal may fail, as it happen'd in the Case of <HI>Scotland,</HI> when <HI>Iohn Balioll</HI> and <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> contended for the Crown, which not being to be decided by the Estates of the Kingdom, they were forced to referr it to our King <HI>Edward</HI> the First; and as also happen'd in <HI>France,</HI> when <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Valois,</HI> and our <HI>Edward</HI> the III<HI>d,</HI> both claim'd the Crown, which was decided by a great Assembly of the Estates of <HI>France</HI> in the favour of the former, who claim'd as Heir of the Male Line, against King <HI>Edward</HI>▪ who was descended by a Woman; and if King <HI>Iames's</HI> Abdication, or Forfeiture (call it which you will) is good, pray give me a sufficient Reason, why the Convention of the Estates of <HI>England</HI> should not have as much Authority as those of <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Scotland</HI>; this being as much or more a limited Kingdom, thau either of the other ever were.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not deny that, but pray shew me any sufficient Reason why the Con∣vention should now Vote a Vacancy of the Throne, since there was certainly an Heir Apparent not long since in <HI>England,</HI> and I hope is now safe in <HI>France,</HI> who ought to fill it, or at least there should have been some sufficient cause alledged against him, to prove that he was not true Son either of the King or Queen; and till this was done, they could not with any Right or good Conscience, place any other Re∣lation of his in the Throne, since every Person ought to be esteem'd the Son of that Father and Mother that publickly own him for such; for it is a Maxim in our as well as your Law, <HI>Filiatio non potest probari.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>How this could be performed without first declaring the Throne vacant, I cannot apprehend; for you your self must grant, that there have been great doubts and suspitions of the Realty of this Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>; and therefore, that being one great reason of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s coming over, The truth of this Child whe∣ther
<PB N="876" REF="473"/>
he was really born of the of the body of the Q. is first to be examin'd and deter∣min'd, before he can be declar'd K. of <HI>England</HI> in the room of his supposed Father, whom we will also suppose Civilly (though not Naturally dead) and till this be done, (unless you would have had him been declar'd King without ever examining the truth of the matter) the Throne must have continued vacant till it could be decid∣ed, whether he or his half Sister the Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> were to fill it; and if so, whilst the Convention remain'd in this suspence, they could do no other than Vote the Throne vacant till they were sufficiently satisfied who had the best Right to it.</P>
<P>But to answer your argument, that unless something could have been presently alledg'd against this Infant to have proved him not to have been born of the Body of the Queen, he ought to have been declar'd King: the Maxime you mention may be well allow'd in the case of Common Inheritances, but not in that of Crowns, for in those we have read that Common and violent presumptions have been looked upon as sufficient proofs to set aside a suppos'd Heir of the Crown:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi. Marianas</HI> History of <HI>Hispan.</HI></NOTE> as for example, something above two hundred years since, <HI>Henry</HI> King of <HI>Castile,</HI> call'd the Impotent, (because he was not able to get his Queen or any other Woman with Child) did out of hatred to his Sister <HI>Isabella,</HI> permit a favorite of his to lye with his Queen, and get her with Child, she was brought to Bed of a Daughter, but the Estates of the Kingdom would by no means admit her for Legitimate, because the Queen had before declar'd her Husband to be Impotent, and therefore they did not only protest against her Legitimacy in the Kings life time, in an Assembly of the Estates, but also as soon as he died, they set this pretended Princess quite aside and declared the Sister of the Late King, Queen of <HI>Castile,</HI> who was Mar∣ried to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Arragon.</HI> Now tho' I will not say, that either the suspi∣tions or proofs against the present Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> are as pregnant as those against that Princess; yet certainly they were sufficient to debat him from being placed in the Throne, till such time as it shall be made apparent that he is really Son to the Queen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Convention had gone this way to work, I grant there might have been some colour for what they have done, but then they ought before they had placed any body else in the Throne, to have first examin'd the Truth of the Queens being with Child, and her being truly deliver'd of this Prince, before ever they had declar'd the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> King and Queen, and till this had been done, certainly the Throne should have still continued Vacant; therefore I doubt your Convention have made more haste than good speed in this matter, which certainly requir'd much more deliberation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, I will for once admit that they ought in the first place, to have ex∣amin'd your Princes Title, but this is still to be understood, as far as it was possi∣ble for them to do it, as it ought: now pray tell me, how this could be done, when the Infant was not only carried away into a Foreign Kingdom, but also the Mid∣wife, the Nurse, and several other of the Queens near Servants and Attendants, went away along with him? who if they had been here to have been cross exa∣min'd, might have declar'd the Imposture (if it be one.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray Sir, are there not Protestant Ladies enough left behind, who have already Depos'd before the Council (as appears by their Depositions pub∣lished by the Kings express command, and enrolled in Chancery, <HI>in perpituam Rei
<PB N="877" REF="473"/>
memoriam</HI>) not only that her Majesty was with Child, but that also she was really deliver'd of this Prince; so that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the Convention, ought to have in the first place summon'd those Witnesses you mention to be now in <HI>France</HI> to have appear'd before them, and if they had not come, then to have proceeded as the matter had required.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must then grant that the Protestant Witnesses alone, who are now in <HI>England</HI> were not sufficient, for if they should have Depos'd, that this Child had been an Impostor, I suppose, you would not have rested satisfied that they had spoke nothing but the Truth: since the Witnesses now in <HI>France</HI> (who best know the matter of Fact) might have sworn the contrary; but as for sending any Sum∣mons for them into <HI>France</HI> it was altogether in vain, and also that which the Con∣vention were not at all oblig'd to do; it was in vain, because neither King <HI>Iames</HI> nor his Q. did ever own the Power of the Convention to hear or determine this affair, and therefore would not have let the Witnesses come over; for after the Throne was declar'd Vacant, the King must by sending those Witnesses have racitly own'd the Authority of the Convention, in declaring himself to have Abdicated the Throne, as also that they might place his Son therein: so that any such Summons would certainly have been only rejected with scorn, and we should gain nothing, but the loss of so much time, and hindred our present settlement and defence, a whole Summer. Nor was the Convention oblig'd to do it, since the Parliament it self is not bound to take cognizance of any person or thing that is not within the King∣dom of <HI>England</HI> or the <HI>Territories</HI> belonging to it; and therefore it was not their business to enquire (without it had been brought before them) what was become of this Infant, whether he was legitimate or not, or whether he was alive, or else had been cast away at Sea, or taken by Pyrates, any of which might very well have been; and therefore indeed this business could never have been decided, unless the Infant himself were actually present and sufficient proof made, not only that this was the same Child that was born of the Queen, but which was also carried away into <HI>France,</HI> all which could never have been examin'd as it ought, without the Childs personal presence here, which I suppose you will grant that King <HI>Iames</HI> and his Queen would never admit of as things now stand; therefore since a thorough examination into this business was impossible to have been per∣form'd, The Convention have done no more than what can be justified, in first declaring the Throne Vacant, and then who should fill it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but admit the case were so as you have put it, the Kingdom ought however to have remain'd without a King, till the succession had been duly setled. since according to the act of recognition to King <HI>Iames</HI> I.
<Q>The Nation did not only oblige themselves but their Posterity (that is, we that are now alive) to that King and his Right Heirs;</Q>
and therefore till this Princes Right had been determined, either the Convention should have Govern'd, or else they ought to have made the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> only Governour or Regent of the Kingdom, and not to have placed him and his Princess in the Throne, till the young Prince had died, or else had been proved to be an Impostor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not but I can shew you not only the unreasonableness. but also the unpracticableness of this supposition. First, its unreasonableness, since you are very much mistaken to alledge that the whole Nation, by that Act of recognition to King <HI>Iames</HI> obliged themselves, and their Posterities, to him and his right Heirs. 'Tis
<PB N="878" REF="474"/>
true they there tell him,
<Q>That they made that Recognition as the first fruits of their Loyalty and Faith to him, and his Royal Progeny and Posterity for ever, and also when they have acknowledged him to be justly and lawfully next, and sole Heir of the Blood Royal of this Realm. and that they thereunto submit and oblige themselves, their Heirs and Posterities for ever, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is no more meant or expressed in all this, than that the whole Nation did by their Re∣presentatives in Parliament oblige themselves and their Children to King <HI>Iames</HI> and his Posterity for ever, and I think that this part of the Recognition is sufficient∣ly perform'd, by placing two of his Great Grand-children in the Throne, for as to the words rightful or lawful Heirs, they are not to be found in all this Statute.</Q></P>
<P>But as for your Notion of a Regency, it is plain it could have signified nothing, either for our present security, or future settlement; not to the former, since this Regent (be he whom he would) must have Governed in the Right of some body or other, since I never read of a Regency in <HI>England</HI> during a Vacancy of the Throne; therfore I will at present admit that the Vote for King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Abdica∣tion had never been made, only that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had been declar'd Re∣gent of the Kingdom, till such time as King <HI>Iames</HI> would have given the Nation sufficient satisfaction of his reforming all past miscarriages, and that his future Go∣vernment should be according to Law. Now I would very fain know how it can be justified according to your Notion of the King's absolute irresistible power, to place a Regent over the Kingdom to Govern in his stead, whether he will or not, when it is certain he is neither a Minor, an Ideot, nor a Lunatick: so that then he must have return'd again to the Government whenever he had pleas'd, or else the Convention must have been Judges whether the security or satisfaction he offered was sufficiently satisfactory or not, for if he himself was to be sole Judge in this case, I suppose you will grant this Regency would quickly have been at an end; but on the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide, if this Right of Judging had been left in the Conven∣tion, whether the King's proposals were satisfactory or not, they might also have voted them not to be so; and till this was done, they might very well have justi∣fied there keeping him out of the Kingdom by force, now how that could have consisted with your doctrine of the Kings Irresistible Power I desire you would satisfie me if you can; so that by this Regency, the King must either have been deprived of his whole Power, or he must not; if the former, that would have been as good as Deposing him from being King, and had left him no more than the bare Title, and whether this had not been a great deal worse, (as more Hy∣pocritical) than the Conventions declaring him to have Abdicated the Government, I leave it to any indifferent person to Judge.</P>
<P>But if you will suppose that this Regent must have Govern'd in the name of your Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> as being declared King, that would have been to have granted his Title to be good without hearing of it, and had been indeed to have given up the main point in dispute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you would fain find out any shifts for this pretended Vacancy, and placing those in the Throne to whom it doth not belong; yet though I grant that the word Right <HI>Heirs</HI> are not expresly recited in this Act of Recognition to King <HI>Iames</HI> I. yet for all that, it is implyed, for the Oath of Allegiance is Enacted by I. <HI>Eliz.</HI> to be taken to the Queen, her Heirs, and lawful Successors; and by the Oath
<PB N="879" REF="474"/>
of Supremacy (Enacted in the IVth of King <HI>Iames</HI>) we are likewise obliged to swear, that we will bear true Allegiance to his Majesty, his Heirs, and Successors: now who these Heirs are, this very Act of Recognition doth sufficiently declare, <HI>viz.</HI> The next Heir by Descent of Blood; for as King <HI>Iames</HI> is hereby acknow∣ledged to be Heir by Inherent Birth-right: so when they oblige themselves, and their Posterity's to King <HI>Iames,</HI> and his Progeny, it is to be understood (by parity of reason) that they oblige themselves and the Nation, for all future Generations to Him and his Issue in that sense, as that their Allegiance should be only due to him, or her who should be Lawful Heir to their Father, Brother, or Uncle, according to those rules of Succession, that had been commonly received for above four hun∣dred years last past, that is to say the Eldest Son, Brother, or Daughter, being still to be prefer'd before the Younger, and Sons before Daughters, and the same rule must also hold for their descendents; since upon this ground it was, that the Title of the House of <HI>York</HI> was prefer'd by Parliament before that of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and the Title of the King of <HI>Scots</HI> who was descended from the Eldest Sister, before that of the House of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> who came from the Younger, and this being never alter'd by any subsequent Statute, (or if it had, I think it would not have been good;) the Convention ought either to have declar'd the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> King im∣mediately, or at least to have continued the Throne Vacant, let the difficulties or inconveniences that you suppose might have followed, to be never so great; and therefore it was their duty to have fought out King <HI>Iames</HI> and the Prince, where∣ever they had been, and to have desired him to have sent over the Prince, together with the Witnesses that went away with him; and till this had been absolutely refus'd, or else that upon a fair hearing, this Prince had been proved an Impostor. I say till one of these had been done, the Throne ought still to have continued Vacant (if it were so at all) nor till this had been clear'd could they have justified the placing any body else upon the Throne, though never so nearly related to the King; whom I will suppose for discourse sake, to have really Abdicated the Kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not deny that the legal and common course of Succession ought to be inviolately observed according to the Rules you have now laid down, when ever it may consist with the publick good and safety of the Kingdom; and yet for all that I cannot believe, that the King himself, much less any other, that only pre∣tends as next Heir to him, can have such an absolute Right to the Kingdom, as that no considerations whatsoever can make them lose or forfeit their Right there∣unto; therefore I look upon the Government of a Kingdom not to be like that interest which a private Man hath in an Estate, which is his Right let him be what he will, or let him mannage it how he will. Whereas in the Right to a Kingdom, I take it to be a true Maxim, That the Representatives of a Nation (as the Convention was) ought to have more regard to the happiness and safety of the whole People, or Common-wealth, than to the Dignity or Authority of any particular Person whosoever, or howsoever nearly related to the Crown, when it is evident that the advancement of such a Person to the Throne, will prove destructive to our Religion, Civil Liberties and Properties.</P>
<P>Now give me leave to apply what I have said to the Point now in question; Let us therefore at the present suppose, that your Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> is true, and lawful Son to King <HI>Iames</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; and let me also farther suppose, that
<PB N="880" REF="475"/>
in his late passage over Sea, he was taken by the Pyrates of <HI>Argiers,</HI> or <HI>Tunis,</HI> and by them been carried to one of those places, and been bred up in the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, and after he had been Circumcised and fully grounded in that abominable Superstition, the Grand Seignior, together with the Kings of <HI>Argier,</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> should send this Nation word, that if they would not admit him quietly for their King, and allow him all those Priests he should bring with him a free exercise of their Religion in <HI>England,</HI> they would then make War upon this Nation with all the Forces they could raise. I ask you what we ought to do in this case, whether we should receive him for our King, or keep him out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess it is a nice Question, and since it is a thing that never did yet, nor I hope will ever come to pass, I think I may freely Answer you, That supposing this Prince could be proved to be the very same who was carried away so many years ago, we ought, notwithstanding his false Belief, to receive him; especially if he would solemnly Swear, only to worship God in private after his own way; and that he would Swear not to violate our Religion, or invade our Liberties and Properties; and this being done, I think we ought then to admit him for our lawful Sovereign; since, as you your self have already acknow∣ledged at our third Meeting, the Supreme Powers are not to be resisted, be∣cause they are of a different Religion from that of the People or Nation they Govern.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well: But let me tell you, In this you are much more kind to <HI>Mahome∣tan</HI> and Heretical Princes, than the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> who have decreed, That no Prince ought to be received as right Heir to a Crown, who is a Pagan, Turk, or Heretick; and upon this ground it was, that the States of <HI>France,</HI> during the time of the League, by the Pope's Decree, refus'd to own <HI>Henry</HI> King of <HI>Navarre</HI> for their Sovereign; and also, that the Papists of the Nuntio Party in <HI>Ireland</HI> during the late Rebellion, refused to own the late Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> for Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom, because the King was a Protestant.</P>
<P>But pray answer me a Question or two further; Suppose this Prince re∣fus'd to promise these or such things, or else if he did promise, and Swear them, pray tell me how could we be assured, that according to the Principles of that Religion he had been bred under, and those Arbitrary Notions he had learned concerning the Absolute Power of Kings in <HI>Barbary,</HI> and which he would believe due to himself, as being as Absolute a Monarch as any of them; I say, how such a Prince ever could be trusted? Since if he had the whole Power of the Militia in his hands, he might bring in what number of Turkish or Moorish Guards he should think fit, who might easily set up that Religion and Government too, in this Nation, since, according to your Principles of Passive Obedience and Non-resistance, no Man ought to lift up so much as a Finger against him, though he went about to make us all Turks and Slaves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, supposing all this, as long as it is his Right he ought to have it, let the consequence be what it will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have said enough, I desire no more; but I hope every true Protestant and English man will be of another mind if ever such a case should happen; but indeed, it appears very strange to me, that a natural Disability, such as Ideocy or Lunacy, should be esteem'd sufficient in all Kingdoms to debarr the next Heir from the Government, and yet that a Moral or a Religious Disability should not
<PB N="881" REF="475"/>
have the same effect; and though I grant that a King ought not to be Rebelled against, or resisted, meerly because he is of a different Religion from that of his Subjects, for I was never for resisting King <HI>Iames</HI> meerly upon that score; yet it is another thing when a Prince is not actually possessed of the Throne, but is to be admitted to it upon such Conditions as may appear safe for the Religion and Civil constitution of a Kingdom. In this case, if a Prince be certainly infected with such pernicious Principles either in relation to Religion or Civil Government, it is much otherwise; as for Example, That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks; That his own Religion is to be propagated by Arms, Blood, or Persecution; That no Government can be safe for the Prince, or in which he can appear Great or Glorious, but as an absolute Monarch; let such a Prince be either a Christian or a Mahometan, I think it would be a certain ruine to a Kingdom to be obliged to receive such a Prince, when they were morally sure, that he would not only subvert their Religion, but destroy the very professors of it, and not only those, but alter the Civil constitution too, by turning it from a limited Kingdom into an absolute despotick Tyranny.</P>
<P>To conclude, I shall only desire you to consider, into what a Country your Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> is carry'd, and what Instructors he is like to have, and what Principles he will receive from them: and then pray tell me, if he continues there till he is a Man, what difference there will be between this young Prince bred up in such a Religion and such Principles, and the same, if he had been carried away by Pyrates to <HI>Argier,</HI> as I at first suppos'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a very invidious Comparison; for though I do not approve of the Roman-Catholick Religion, yet sure there is a great deal of difference between that which professes all the Articles of our Creed, and in which we of our Church own Salvation may be obtained, and the Mahometan Superstition, which denies that fundamental Article of our Creed, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That Jesus Christ is the Son of God; and as for Civil or Political Principles, I hope the King his Father will take care to have him instructed by some of those English Noblemen or Gentlemen who are now with him, in the Customs and Constitutions of the English Go∣vernment, and wherein it differs from the French, as we read Chancellor <HI>For∣tescue</HI> did Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> Son to <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth. and I hope he will come over again to practise them in his own Country be∣fore he comes to be infected with the Arbitrary Principles of the French Government;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Fortescue <HI>de Laud.

Angl. in proem.</HI></NOTE> but as for those of not keeping Faith with Hereticks, and a propagating his Religion by Persecution, I doubt not but the King his Father will take care not to commit his Education to any of those who are infected with such Principles; and I am the more in∣clin'd to believe it, because it is very well known that his Majesty's tenderness and moderation in matters of Religion, and not persecuting any body for the belief or bare profession of it, as it was the greatest cause of his late Decla∣ration of Indulgence, so it was the main original of all his late Misfortunes; nor can I see any reason why a King by being a Roman Catholick, must ne∣cessarily be a Tyrant and a Persecutor, since you cannot deny but that we have had many good and just Kings of that Religion, and it is from those Princes that professed it that we derive our <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and most of the priviledges we now enjoy.</P>

<P>Though I would not be thought to affirm, that the Romish Religion is every way worse than the Mahometan, yet this much I may safely affirm, that there is no Doctrine in all that Superstition, so absurd and contrary to Sence and Reason, as that of Transubstantiation, held by the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> in which the far greatest part are certainly Idolators, which can never be object<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d against the Turks; and therefore though I will not deny but that a Man may be saved in the Communion of the Romish Church, yet it is not for being a Papist, but only as far as he practises Christ's Precepts, and trusts in his Merits, that he can ever obtain that favour from God.</P>
<P>But as for those evil Principles both in Religion and Civil Government, which you cannot deny but are now commonly believed and practiced in <HI>France,</HI> and which you hope King <HI>Iames</HI> will take care that the Prince his Son shall be bred to avoid; I wish it may prove as you say; but if you will consider the Men that are like to be his Tutors and Instructors in matters of Religion, <HI>viz.</HI> his Fathers and Mothers Confessors the Jesuits, and for Civil Government, those Popish Lords and Gentlemen of notorious Arbitrary Principles and Practises, who are gone over to King <HI>Iames,</HI> you will have small reason to believe, that there is ever a <HI>Fortescus</HI> now to be found among the English-men in <HI>France,</HI> or who is likely to instill into him those true English Principles you mention.</P>
<P>And though I do not affirm, that every Popish Prince must needs be a Persecutor, yet since that wholly depends upon those Priests that have the manage∣ment of their Consciences, shew me a Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> who has a Jesuit for his Confessor, and tell me, if he hath not deserved that Character.</P>
<P>But though I am so much of your Opinion, that King <HI>Iames</HI> ownes the greatest part of his Misfortunes to his Declaration for Liberty of Conscience; yet was it not so much to the thing it self, as to his Arbitrary manner of doing it by assuming a Dispensing Power contrary to Law; and you may be very well assured by the little opposition which the late Acts met with for taking off the Penalties against Conventicles and not coming to Church, in respect of all Dissenters, ex∣cept the Papists, that King <HI>Iames</HI> might have as easily obtain'd a like Act to pass in respect of those also, as to the free profession of their Religion, and having Mass in their Houses, which is more than the Papists will allow the Protestants in any Country in Europe. And therefore I must beg your pardon if I still find great rea∣son to doubt whether K. <HI>Iames</HI> his tenderness towards those that differ'd from him in matters of Religion, and the Indulgence he gave them were purely out of con∣sideration of tender Consciences, and not rather thereby to destroy the Church of <HI>England</HI> Established by Law; since the Dispute began between King <HI>Iames</HI> and his Parliament, was not about Liberty of Conscience, but those Offices and Commands which the King was resolved to bestow upon the Papists, whether the Parliament would or not. And certainly there is a great deal of difference be∣tween a Liberty for a Man to enjoy the free profession of his own Religion, and the power and benefit of having all the chief Imployments of Honour and Pro∣fit in the Common-wealth. But that the Indulgence of Popish Princes towards those that dissent from them in matters of Religion, may not always proceed from pure Tenderness and Compassion, appears from a Manuscript Treatise of <HI>F. Parsons,</HI> that great Jesuit in Queen <HI>Elizabeth's</HI> time) which I have been told was found in King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Closet after his departure. This (if you can see it) will
<PB N="883" REF="476"/>
shew you, that the subtil Jesuite doth there direct his Popish Successor in order to the more quiet introducing the Romish-Catholick Religion, to grant a gene∣ral Toleration of all Religions, out of a like design. Thus did <HI>Iulian</HI> the Apostare long ago, tolerate all the Sects and Heresies in the Christian Religion, because he thereby hoped utterly to confound and destroy it.</P>
<P>But as to what you alledge concerning <HI>Magna Charta</HI>'s being granted by Popish Princes, and that there has been many good Kings of that persuasion: As I will not deny either the one or the other; so I desire you to remember with what strug∣lling and great difficulties this Charter was at first obtain'd and afterwards preserved, though it was no more than a Declaration of most of those Antient Rights and Liberties which the Nation had always enjoy'd. And you may also remember that they were Popish Princes, who more than once obtain'd the Pope's Dispensation to be discharged from those solemn Oaths they had taken to observe those Charters; and though there hath been divers good Princes before the Reformation, yet even the very best of them made the severest Laws against Protestants, and were the most cruel in their Persecutions, witness King <HI>Henry</HI> the IVth, <HI>Henry</HI> the Vth, and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> And indeed, it is dangerous to rely upon the Faith of a Prince, who looks upon it as a piece of Merit to destroy all Religions but his own; and when he finds it cannot be done by Law, will not stick to use any Arbitrary means to bring it about. To conclude, pray consider whether the strict observing or violation of <HI>Magna Charta</HI> and his Coronation Oath, hath been the cause of King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Abdication. Pardon this long Discourse which your Vindication of the Opinion and Practises of Popish Princes hath drawn from me.</P>

<P>Pray Sir, let us quit these invidious Subjects, which can do no good, since Princes must be own'd and submitted to, let their Principles and Practice▪ be never so Tyrannical, and let us return again to the matter in hand. I will therefore at present suppose the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> to have been either dead, or justly laid aside. now make it out to me how you can justifie the placing the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> in the Throne, when the Crown is really her right after the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and not her Husbands; as also the putting the Government solely into his hands, since this can no ways agree with the Act of Recognition to King <HI>Iames</HI> the First, which you your self cannot deny but ought to be observed, when it may be done without any apparent hazard or prejudice to the Protestant Religion and the Con∣stitution of our Government, which I think might have been as well, if not better secured, by letting it have gone in the right Line, that by placing the Crown upon the Head of a Prince, who, though it is true, is of the Blood-Royal by his Mother, yet being a Foreigner▪ is a meer Stranger to our Government and Laws, and has been bred up in <HI>Calvinistical</HI> Principles, and upon that score is not like to have any good intentions towards the Government and Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> as appears by his late agreeing to abolish Episcopacy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon his ac∣cepting that Crown from the Presbyterian Convention.</P>

<P>If these be all the objections you have to make against placing King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> in the Throne, I hope they will not be of any great moment to your self, or any other considerate man; for if that upon the Abdication of King <HI>Iames</HI> and the impossibity of determining your Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Title (if it be one) a Regency was impracticable and unsafe for the Nation at this conjuncture of time, when we want a King to hold a Parliament, as well to raise Money to
<PB N="884" REF="477"/>
defend us against the Power of <HI>France,</HI> as also to make new Laws for the ease and reformation of the Kingdom, all which a Regents acting without Royal Authority could never do, by the constitution of this Kingdom: so that if there was now a necessity of placing some body in the Throne, for the Common Good and Safety of the whole Common-Wealth, I think you your self cannot but acknowledge, that the Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> had an Hereditary right to the Crown, and if her High∣ness had, the Prince her Husband also ought to Govern the Kingdom in her Right during her life, and those who deny King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth to be Lawful King be∣fore his Marriage with the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> will yet grant he was so in her Right after his Marriage; and this has not been only the Custom in <HI>England,</HI> but also in other Kingdoms of <HI>Europe,</HI> as I can give you several Instances. For upon this ground it was that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Arragon,</HI> by Marrying with <HI>Isabella</HI> Queen of <HI>Castile,</HI> Governed that Kingdom during his Life; so also <HI>Anthony</HI> Duke of <HI>Bourbon</HI> marrying with <HI>Iane</HI> Queen of <HI>Navarre,</HI> did in her Right administer the Government of that part of it, which was left unconquer'd by the <HI>Spaniards</HI>; and here at home <HI>Philip</HI> Prince of <HI>Spain</HI> by his Marriage with Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> had certainly in her Right Govern'd this Kingdom, and had enjoyed something more than the bare Title of King, had he not by the Articles of Marriage, confirm'd by Act of Parliament, been expresly debar'd from it.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Admit all this to be true, yet this was only the enjoyment of a bare Matri∣monial Crown, and held no longer than during the Lives or Marriage with those Queens you mention. But pray tell me, how can the Convention according to the antient constitution of this Kingdom, justifie the settlement of the Crown, not only on King <HI>William</HI> during the Queens Life, But for his own Life also, to the prejudice not only of his own Issue (if ever he have any by the Princess) but also of the Princess of <HI>Denmark</HI> and her Heirs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not but to shew you, that this may be easily justified by the constitu∣tion of the Kingdom, and former Precedents of what hath been done in the like cases. First, as to the Constitution, I have already proved that upon the deposi∣tion of a King, (which is all one with a Forfeiture of the Crown) the Great Coun∣cil or Parliament hath taken upon them to Elect or Admit either the next Heir by Blood, or some Prince (tho' more remote) of the Royal Family to the Crown; thus King <HI>Henry</HI> the IVth upon the Deposition or Resignation of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Ild. was placed in the Throne by the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> after the two Houses had Voted and consented he should Reign over them; though I grant that by right of Blood, <HI>Edmund</HI> Earl of <HI>March</HI> ought to have succeeded to it; but he being then a Child was passed by unmention'd, Duke <HI>Henry</HI> being then powerful, and having deliver'd the Kingdom from the Tyranny and Evil Government of <HI>Richard</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Id. I shall pass by <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId. because I own his Government to have begun by Unsurpa∣tion and to have been established by the Murther of his Nephews. But as for <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth. I have already shew'd you, that the Parliament before his Mar∣riage with the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> setled the Crown upon him, and the Heirs of his Body, by vertue of which he held it all his Reign: whereas there is no such thing done in the present case of King <HI>William,</HI> since he hath only the Crown setled upon him during his own Life, with the remainder after his decease without Issue by the Queen to her, and not his Right Heirs; and as for such Children as he may have by her, it is agreeable to reason, that he should hold the Crown by
<PB N="885" REF="477"/>
that which we call the Courtesie of <HI>England</HI> during his Life, and not from a King to become a Subject to his own Children, in case he should desire to live here after her Majesties decease, which I hope God will prevent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have drest up a pretty plausible Title for King <HI>William</HI>; but yet all that you have said amounts to no more than this, that because other Kings have been Usurpers he may be so too; for as to all the instances you have brought, they have been only from depositions or manifest usurpations, both which our Laws have condemned as absolutely unlawful, as I have shew'd you hath been declar'd by two Acts of Parliament, against the Title of <HI>Henry</HI> the IVth, and his Descendents; but since you will not insist upon the right of <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId. I pass to that Act of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth. which (as I told you before) so I must repeat it again, that it was done upon his supposed Right by Blood, as Heir to the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and upon that pre∣tence he claimed the Crown as his Right, in his Speech to the first Parliament he called; besides the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Queen <HI>de Iure</HI> made no claim to the Crown, and so did tacitly resign it, which seemed to make him <HI>de Iure</HI> as well as <HI>de Facto</HI> King, and if it were done otherwise, I look upon that whole Act as void in it self, because made by him before his Marriage with that Princess, and whilest he was and Usurper upon her Right; so that certainly it is no argument that since Parliaments have acted illegally, therefore your Convention may do so too; for it is a known Maxime in our Civil Law, a <HI>facto ad Ius non valet consequentia,</HI> there∣fore whatever they have done toward creating a good Title to King <HI>William</HI> in res∣pect of the Queen his Wife, and his Issue by her, yet this doth no way excuse the wrong done to the Princess of <HI>Denmark</HI> and her Issue, in case they survive your King.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very wonderful to me, to see how ingenious some Men are in finding faults with the present settlement of things, though never so much for the best, if not done exactly according to suit with their Humour, or Hypothesis, when in∣deed there can no fault be justly found with it, for you agree that if the Queen hath a Right, King <HI>William</HI> hath so also, during his Life, and whether the Princess of <HI>Denmark</HI> and her issue may survive the King, is yet uncertain; but if either she or they should happen to survive his Majesty, yet since she hath made no claim or protestation in the Convention, against the Kings holding the Crown after the Decease of the Queen. I cannot see why this should not pass for a tacit Resignation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Right, as well as in the case of the Princess <HI>Elizabeth</HI> you but now mentioned.</P>
<P>But admit his present Majesty according to the late received rules of Succession, hath not a Title by Descent; yet according to those principles I have already laid down, he certainly has not only a Right to the Crown, from that inherent power which I suppose doth still remain in the Eslates of the Kingdom, as Representa∣tives of the whole Nation to bestow the Crown on every Abdication, or Forfei∣ture thereof, on such Prince of the Blood Royal, as they shall think best to de∣serve it▪ and upon this account I conceive there is none of the Blood, that can stand in competition with his Present Majesty for Prudence, Valour, Moderation, and all other Royal Vertues; and therefore it is not at all to be wonder'd at, if the Convention hath in this case exercised that Original Power, which the People re∣served to it self, at the first institution of Kingly Government in this Island; espe∣cially if we consider his present Majesty not only as a Conquerour over King <HI>Iames,</HI> but as our Deliverer from his Oppression, and that Arbitrary Government that we were so lately under, and which was like to be much worse, had his reign con∣tinued a little longer.</P>
<P><PB N="886" REF="478"/>Therefore I cannot but here take occasion to vindicate his Present Majesty from those exceptions you have made against his Country, and Civil, as well as Reli∣gious Principles, First, As to his Country, 'tis true he is a Foreigner; yet that can he no exception against his admission to the Throne, since it was none against his great Grand-father King <HI>Iames,</HI> and I doubt not but his Majesty may under∣stand as much of the English Constitution and Government, as his said Grand fa∣ther did, when he first came to the Crown.</P>
<P>But as for his principles in Religion, I cannot see any reason to suspect him more inclinable to the Church Government of <HI>Holland,</HI> then that of <HI>England,</HI> since he was bred up under a Mother, who was always firm to the Religion and Discipline of our Church, and ever since he was Married to the Princess, he hath always shew'd a very great respect to its Liturgy and Ceremonies, by his so constant frequenting his Princesses Chappel; so that besides his Majesties Interest to main∣tain Episcopacy, as most agreeable to the Monarchy, and Antient Constitution of this Kingdom, it is likewise (if he were able) not in his power to destroy the Church of <HI>England,</HI> since the main body of the Clergy, Nobility, and Gentry of this Na∣tion is to zealous for its preservation, that if he had any such inclinations, it would not be easie for him to effect it, and he is too wise a Prince to let others persuade him so visibly against his own interest, and having so late an example before his Eyes, that it was King <HI>Iames</HI>'s ruine to attempt it.</P>
<P>As for what you say of <HI>Scotland,</HI> 'tis true, Presbitery is for the present set up there, but it is uncharitable to impute this to the Kings inclinations; for it is no∣torious, that of them which call themselves Episcopal in that Kingdom, a very great number did either out of prejudice to the Princes Cause, or in contempt of his Power, refuse to be chosen Members of the Convention, or else after they were chosen, did so far adhere to King <HI>Iames</HI>'s interest as to desert it; as did my Lord <HI>Dundee,</HI> and many others, and by that means gave the Presbyterian Party an advantage to carry all things as they pleas'd; and this Party finding the King not well settled here, and the <HI>Irish</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> in Arms against him, took hold of that opportunity to put the abolishing of Episcopacy into the very instrument of Go∣vernment, and to press it upon him at a time when an unavoidable necessity and the obstinacy of too many of the Episcopal Party forced him to consent to it. wherefore this no way shews his Majesties inclinations to set up Presbytery even in <HI>Scotland</HI>; much less doth it prove he would set it up here, where the Circumstances, are quite different; for here the main body of the People hate that Government, and will be so far from desiring it, that they will never endure it; so that as to this, your fears of King <HI>William</HI> are as vain, as your hopes of King <HI>Iames.</HI></P>
<P>I shall conclude with a few words in answer to your reply against those exam∣ples wherein I have shewn you that the Crown hath always been under such a dis∣position as the two Mouses of Parliament should appoint, to which you have no∣thing else to object, but that their admission of <HI>Henry</HI> the IV<HI>th</HI> to the Crown was condemned as unlawful by two Acts of Parliament, which I have already answer'd, by showing you that those Acts were obtain'd by <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the IV<HI>th</HI> his Son, by actual Rebellion, and by as great a force upon King <HI>Henry</HI> the VI<HI>th,</HI> as ever was used against King <HI>Richard</HI> the II<HI>d,</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the IV<HI>th,</HI> and as for the Statute of the first of <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th,</HI> you have found out a very easie way of answering it; by affirming that it was done whilst he was an Usurper,
<PB N="887" REF="478"/>
and before his Marriage, or that he had any right to be King. But by this way of arguing, no Act he ever passed would be good, since It is certain he did never take upon him to Govern in right of his Queen, as all those that have writ his Life do acknowledge; and therefore if the Parliament would then settle the Crown upon him and his right Heirs without any respect to his Queen, or her Issue or Sisters, in case she should die Childless, I cannot see why the Convention may not as well now settle the Crown upon King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and their issue, with re∣mainder to himself for Life; especially since he hath also another Title of his own to confirm it (<HI>viz.</HI>) that of a Conqueror over King <HI>Iames,</HI> and our Deliverer from his Arbitrary Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not go about to derogate from King <HI>Williams</HI> Personal Vertues, which you so highly extoll; only I wish I may not prove too true a Prophet, since that is not the main question between us. I shall only take upon me to answer in the first place what you have urged on the behalf of King <HI>William</HI>'s pretence to the Crown as a Conquerour over King <HI>Iames,</HI> and Deliverer of the Nation; for what∣soever he may pretend to in respect of the latter, I am sure he cannot justly pre∣tend to the former; since sure he can never have any right by Conquest: who expresly sets forth in his first Declaration, that he only came to obtain a Free Par∣liament, and to Redress our Grievances. Much less can he be properly call'd a Conquerour, who never overcame his Enemy in any pitched Battle, but by false Stories made the King's Army desert him, and then, when this was done, having forced the King to leave the Kingdom for fear, he has in the day of his power by these means obtain'd the Crown; and as for a Deliverer, you must pardon me, if I can∣not think him so, since I am not yet satisfied that the worst of King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Op∣pressions ever deserved that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> should take the pains to come over to redress them.</P>
<P>And therefore your paralell between your King's Title, and that of <HI>Henry</HI> the IV<HI>th,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th</HI> doth not at all agree, since both of them claimed not so much by Conquest, or force of Arms, as by a pretended right of inheritance, as you may see by both their Claims. And as for <HI>Henry</HI> the IV<HI>th,</HI> 'tis plain, he looked upon his Title by descent of blood (having been allow'd in Parliament) to be so good, that for the first seven years of his Reign he never thought it worth while to pass an Act for the Settlement of the Crown upon himself, and his Issue; but for <HI>Richard</HI> the III<HI>d,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th,</HI> they were so far from owning their Titles to any Act or Declaration of Parliament, that they first clap'd the Crown upon their own heads, and after they had done it, they immediately call'd their Parliaments; which tho' they recogniz'd their Titles, yet did not make them Kings, but found them so. whereas the Convention has by their sole Authority, made the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and Princess, King and Queen of <HI>England,</HI> to the prejudice of the right Heirs of the Crown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not, but what I have already said, may very well be desended, not∣withstanding the utmost you have now argued against it. In the first place, as to what you say against King <HI>William</HI>'s Title, as a Conquerour over King <HI>Iames,</HI> is very trivial; for though it is true, the Prince declar'd before he came over, that his coming was for no other end but to obtain a Free Parliament, Redress Grievances, and to remove Evil Councellors from King <HI>Iames,</HI> yet that is still to be understood, that the King would agree to those reasonable demands the Prince then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; for
<PB N="888" REF="479"/>
if by his own obstinacy he would bring things to that pass, as that instead of redres∣sing those violations he had made upon our fundamental Laws, he raised an Army to support himself in them; and when he thought this Army would not sight in his so bad a Cause, he then disbanded it; and by that, as well as the desertion of the Throne, owned himself vanquish'd: Can any body deny the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> a right of making what advantage he could of his Successes? And therefore I doubt not but that the Prince might if he pleas'd have taken upon him the Title of King immediately upon King <HI>Iames's</HI> first departure; and have summon'd a Parliament to recognize his Title, as <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th</HI> did after his Victory at <HI>Bosworth</HI> Field; nor would this have made him a Conquerour over the Kingdom, since he never made War against it, but came to deliver it from Tyranny and Oppression. Nor did <HI>William</HI> the Corquerour himself by his Victory over King <HI>Harold,</HI> ever pretend to a right by Conquest over the whole Kingdom, but only over the Estates and Per∣sons of those who had fought against him, as I have fully proved at our Tenth Meet∣ing; nor did <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th</HI> in the first Speech he made to the Parliament after his taking upon him the Crown, claim a right to it by Conquest over the King∣dom, as his own words were in that Speech you mention to this first Parliament, but only that by the just judgment of God in giving him the
<Q>Victory over his E∣nemy in the Field; and he then farther declar'd, that all his Subjects of whatso∣ever State and Condition, should enjoy their Lands and Goods to them and their Heirs as they did before, except such Persons who were to be attainted by Act of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>Nor is it any objection against his right by Conquest that he obtained no Victory in a pitch'd Battle; since I never heard or read, that to make a Prince a Conque∣rour, it is necessary that so many thousand Men should be kill'd upon the spot; for admit the adverse Prince against whom he fights, will through Cowardise desert his Army, or that his Army will desert him, either through fear, or a sence of the greater justice of the adverse Princes Cause, or an affection to his Person, so that it never come to a Battle, yet it has been in all Ages looked upon as all one with a Victory, as I can show you from several examples in History: and particularly in <HI>Plutarch</HI> concerning <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> King of <HI>Epyrus,</HI> who making War a∣gainst <HI>Demetrius</HI> then King of <HI>Macedon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In vita</HI> Pyrri.</NOTE> and both Armies being en∣camped near each other, the Army of the latter forsook him, and went over to <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> as well out of hatred to him, as esteem for his Enemy; so that <HI>Demetrius</HI> being forced to steal away in disguise, <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> thereupon was im∣mediately in the Field Proclaimed King of <HI>Macedon.</HI> And I doubt not but the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> might have done the same, had it not been for his great moderation, and least it might give his Adversaries occasion to traduce him, that he came over for no other end but to drive the King out of his Kingdom; and therefore he chose ra∣ther to owe the Crown to the free Act of the Nation, than to his right by Conquest over King <HI>Iames</HI>; but yet I do not think he hath at all lost that right, though he doth not think fit (for fear of giving offence) to insist upon it; and therefore cer∣tainly the Convention might very well justifie the setling the Crown upon his High∣ness during his Life, not only as a Conquerour over K. <HI>Iames,</HI> but a Deliverer of the Nation from his Oppression, though the Prince was pleas'd to accept it upon those terms expressed in the late Declaration of the Convention, and upon his free pro∣mise
<PB N="889" REF="479"/>
to preserve preserve our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, which he has since also confirm'd by his Coronation Oath.</P>
<P>But as to what you say, that the Prince made the Kings Army desert him, and wrought the People into hatred of his Person by lying Stories and mean Arts, is al∣together untrue; since I know of no Reports he made of the King, or his Govern∣ment, but what are in his first Declaration, and that is certainly true in every part of it, and as has been justified by the express Declaration of the Convention in every particular, except that concerning the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> which I confess is left still undecided because (as I have already proved) it is impossible to give any certain judgement in it, unless the Witnesses as well as the Infant himself could be brought over hither.
<Q>nor doth the Prince in his said Declaration say any more concerning that business than that there are violent suspicions that the pretend∣ed Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was not Born of the Queen; but for the report of the Secret League with <HI>France</HI> for the extirpation of the Protestant Religion, as there is no such thing in his Highnesses Declaration, so the spreading of it cannot be laid to his charge, since he never gave it out as I know of;</Q>
yet there are certainly great pre∣sumptions, and too much cause of suspicion that it may be so, as I proved at our last Meeting. But though you will not allow the Prince the Title of our Delive∣rer, yet I am sure the greatest part both of the Clergy, and Laity of the Church of <HI>England</HI> were once of Opinion, that King <HI>Iames</HI>'s violations both upon our Reli∣gion and Laws were so great, that nothing could preserve the Kingdom from a total Subversion in its Establisht Religion, and Civil Constitution, but his High∣nesses coming over; and most of the Bishops were of that Opinion, who, now the Government is setled, refused to take the Oath of Allegiance to their present Majesties.</P>
<P>But to answer what you say, that the manner of <HI>Henry</HI> the IV<HI>ths,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>ths</HI> coming to the Crown, doth not at all agree with this Case of King <HI>William,</HI> because they claimed by right of blood, which you say King <HI>William</HI> can∣not do; that is not so in respect of the Queen, who has certainly a right to succeed her Father by right of blood, in case the Prince off <HI>Wales</HI> be not the true Son of the Queen, and untill he can be proved so, we must at present look upon him as if he were not so at all; so that the Convention hath done no more in setling the Crown upon the King, during his Life, than what the Great Council of the Kingdom have frequently done before upon other vacancies of the Throne, as I have proved from the Examples of <HI>William Rufus,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the First, King <HI>Stephen,</HI> King <HI>Iohn,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Third. And it is very hard to suppose the whole Nation to have been guilty of Perjury and Treason, up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n their Swearing to, and Fighting for those Princes after they were so Solemnl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Elected, Crowned, and Invested with the Royal Power. But as for <HI>Edward</HI> III. his first and best Title was from the election of the Great Council of the Kingdom, who I doubt not but if they had found him unworthy of the Royal Dignity by reason of folly or madness, or Tyrannical Principles, would have set him aside, and have made his young<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Brother King, a Protector to govern in the King's Name with Royal Power having never been known in <HI>England</HI> till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI<HI>th</HI>; but as for <HI>Henry</HI> the IV<HI>th,</HI> notwithstanding his claim by right of Blood, I have already proved that the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lia∣ment by their placing him in the Throne did not at all allow it, nor is any such Right recited in the Act of the 7<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the IV<HI>th,</HI> which by the Crown is
<PB N="890" REF="480"/>
entail'd upon that King and his four successive Sons. And though it is true <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh also claim'd the Crown by right of Inheritance, in his Speech in Parli∣ament, yet they were so far from allowing it, that they do not so much as mention it in that Act of Setlement, which, as I have recited, they made of it upon that and the Heirs of his Body: And therefore I think I may still maintain, that the Convention hath done nothing in the present Setlement of the Crown, but what hath been formerly done upon every vacancy of the Throne, either by deposition or resignation of the King, or Abdication, or Forfeiture of the Crown; as in the case of King <HI>Iames,</HI> in which the Convention have done no more than exercised that Power which has always been suppos'd to reside in the great Council of the Kingdom, of setling the Crown upon such a Prince of the Blood-Royal as they shall think best to deserve it.</P>
<P>Thus much I have said to preserve the Antient Right of the Great Council of the Nation. But to put all this out of dispute, I have been credibly inform'd, that the Princess of <HI>Denmark</HI> her self did by some of her Servants in both Houses, as well of the Lords as Commons, declare upon a great Debate that arose about se∣curing her Highnesses Right to the Crown immediately after her Sister the Queen; that her Highness had desired them to assure the Convention, that she was wil∣ling to acquiesce in whatever they should determine concerning the Succession of the Crown, since it might tend to the present setlement and safety of the Nation: which I think is a better Cession of her Right to his present Majesty, than any you can prove that the Empress <HI>Mawd</HI> made to her Son <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, or than the Countess of <HI>Richmond</HI> ever made to her Son <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have often talked of this forfeiture and extravagant Power of your Convention, by whom you suppose they are not obliged to place the Crown upon the head of the next Heir by Blood, which I shall prove to be a vain Notion; for if there be an absolute forfeiture of the Crown, the Government would have been absolutely Dissolved; for since there is no Legal Government without a King, if the Throne were really vacant, and that the People might place whom they pleas'd in it, yet the Convention can have no Power to do it, as their Representatives; since upon your suppos'd dissolution of the Original Contract between the King and the People, there was an end of all Conventions and Parliaments too. And therefore if a King could have been chosen at all, it ought to have been by the Votes of the whole body of the Clergy, Nobility, and Commons, in their own single Persons, and not by any Council or Convention to represent them, since the Laws for restraining the Election of Parliament-men only to Freeholders, are upon this suppos'd Dissolution of the Government, altogether void; and if you say such a way of Election is now impossible, I shall do so too; but however, it plainly shews the absurdity of supposing a King could ever now be fairly Elected were all the Blood-Royal totally extinct.</P>
<P>As for what you say concerning that Cession which the Princess of <HI>Denmark</HI> made of her Right to the Crown, I never heard any thing of it before; but ad∣mit it were so, this could only serve in relation to her self, and she could not give up the Right of her Brother the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> no, nor that of her own Children, if God shall give her any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Objection concerning the total Dissolution of the Government proceeds from a wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of your consideration of what the antient Government of <HI>England</HI>
<PB N="891" REF="480"/>
was, not only before, but a good while after your pretended Conquest; which was not a setled Hereditary Monarchy, but a Testamentary, or Elective Kingdom, where the Kings, being often recommended by the Testament of the precedent King, were chosen out of the Royal Family, though not according to the Ruler of Succession now in use; and therefore in all such Governments, it is very well known, that there was at the first institution of Kingly Government among them, a great Council, or Assembly of Estates of the whole Kingdom appointed, who upon the death of the last King and vacancy of the Throne, were still to meet of course to appoint a Successor, which was commonly one of the Sons of the last King, or at least some other Prince of the Royal Blood. Thus it was, till of late years, in <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Swe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>den,</HI> and so it was antiently in <HI>France</HI> during the Suc∣cession of the first Race; as also in <HI>Spain</HI> during the Government of the <HI>Vandals</HI>; and so it likewise was in <HI>England</HI> during the whole Succession of our English <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, and so I have also proved it continued till <HI>Edward</HI> the First. And though since his time that the Crown hath been claim'd by right of Inheritance, yet in all times precedent it is apparent that the great Council of the Kingdom upon the dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of every King, Assembled by their own inherent Authority, to consider whom they should place in the Throne, which they then looked upon as vacant. And therefore though I grant in the case of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, the Parliament did not only ordain him Successor to his Father, but also recogniz'd his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight by Blood; yet for all this, they still remain'd their an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient Power of meeting without Summons from the King▪ he being in the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> and they not knowing whe∣ther he was alive or dead; so that it is a false assertion to affirm, that there can be no Government without a King, since in all those vacancies of the Throne, it is plain, the Government devolved of course upon the geat Council of the Nati∣on. And though it is true, there can be now no Parliament without a King, ac∣cording to the present notion and acceptation of that Term, yet before that word was ever in use, (which is no older than about the middle of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third) it is plain, that our great Councils often met by their own inherent Authority without any King, and preserved the Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of the Kingdom till a new King was either chosen or declared. And though 'tis true the Crown hath been long enjoy'd by those who have claim'd by Inheritance, yet there is no reason for all that, if the like cases should fall out as have done in former times, why the Government should devolve to the mix'd Multitude now, any more than it did then; since it may be as well suppos'd, that the same tacit Contract still continues of maintaining the Original constitution of great Councils, which I have proved to be as Antient as Kingly Government it self. And though per∣haps the Form of chusing or sending th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Representatives of the Nation may have been alter'd in divers particulars by for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Laws, or received Customs, yet this is nothing to the purpose, as long as the thing it self remains the same in Substance as it was before; for it can never be thought to have been the in∣tent of the People who Established this form of Government, that upon the extinction of the Royal Family, the Government should be so quite dissolved, as that it should be left to the confused Multitude to chuse what form of Go∣vernment they should think fit.</P>
<P>Therefore to conclude, I wish you would be perswaded to own this Go∣vernment as it is now Established, and to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Oath of Allegiance which
<PB N="892" REF="481"/>
is enjoyn'd by the Declaration of the Convention, who are the only proper and legal Judges we can now have of conferring the Rights of those to whom our Allegiance is due. And if in case a Dispute about the right Heir of the Crown, the People of this Nation were not all bound to the decision of this Assembly, we must necessarily fall together by the ears, and fight it out as they do in the <HI>East-Indies</HI>; where upon the death or deposition of a King, he has still the Right who can Conquer his Competitors in Battel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I wish there were not something very like it practised here of late; for I think you will grant, that if the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Party had not prevail'd over the King's, the Convention would never have placed the Crown upon his head.</P>
<P>But I must beg your pardon if I cannot agree to your Proposals of taking the New Oath of Allegiance to King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> since I have already taken the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance to King <HI>Iames,</HI> and I do not be∣lieve that any Power on earth can disengage me from that Oath as long as he and his Son the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> are alive: For as to your Doctrine of Abdi∣cation or Forfeiture, they are too hard for my Reason to understand, or for my Conscience to comply with; and therefore it is all one to me whom your Con∣vention places on the Throne, since I am very well satisfied, that none but the King can have a Right to it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I could see some better reasons for this opinion of yours, than those you have already given, for if you could convince that me the Nation hath done any thing in this Revolution which cannot well be justified by the Antient Customs and Constitution of the Kingdom, I should come over to your opinion; But if King <HI>Iames</HI> has truly Abdicated or Forfeited the Crown (as I hope I have suffi∣ciently made out) and that your suppos'd Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> either is not really, or else cannot now be proved to be the true Son of the Queen, by reason of those Obstacles and Impediments I have shewn you; I cannot see any thing to the con∣trary why you should not be wholly free, and discharged from your former Oath of Allegiance to King <HI>Iames</HI>; so that King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> being now placed on the Throne, your Allegiance to King <HI>Iames,</HI> and the suppos'd Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> is lawfully determined: pray tell me therefore, why you cannot take this new Oath of Allegiance; since you have the Judgment and Declaration of the Con∣vention, which is the Representative of the whole Nation, to justifie you in so doing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must tell you once again, that I think Allegiance is not only due to the King by the Law of the Land, but also, by the Laws of God and Nature, and conse∣quently cannot be dissolved by any subsequent Judgment of a Convention, who are and always ought to be Subjects to him and his Right Heirs, as long as they are in Being; and therefore I should not allow the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> for such, were the King now actually dead: nay if King <HI>Iames</HI> himself had stayed in <HI>England,</HI> and had been so over awed by fear, or overcome by persuasions, as to have declar'd in Parliament, that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was not his true and lawful Son born of the Queen, and had thereupon setled the Crown upon the Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> as his Heir Apparent; I could never have thought my self oblig'd to swear Allegiance to her, or to own her for my lawful Sovereign, as long as the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> or the Heirs of his Body are in Being; since I am very well satisfied,
<PB N="893" REF="481"/>
and that by unexceptionable proofs that he is really the Son of the King and Queen; for I think I have sufficiently made out by several Declarations of Par∣liament, that the Hereditary Right of the Crown can never be defeated nor alter'd by any Statute whatsoever, but according to the Act of Recognition of King <HI>Iames,</HI> the first's Title (which I have already urged) the Crown ought to descend to the next Heir by Blood, according to the rules of Descent, I have now laid down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot but admire your obstinacy in this matter, which proceeds from your old errour of believing, that there is a Natural or Divine Right of Succession to Crowns different or abstracted from the Civil and Political Laws, and Constitu∣tions of particular Kingdoms, which I think I have already confuted, by shewing you that there was no such thing in Nature as a Patriarchal Right in <HI>Adam</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> or their Heirs; nor yet to any other King as their Assigns, or Representatives; and therefore though I grant that Allegiance to every lawful King is due by the Laws of God and Nature, yet who that King is, or who is to be his lawful Suc∣cessor in limited or mixt Monarchies (as ours is) can only be determined by the Assembly of Estates of the whole Nation: for notwithstanding all you have said, there is a very great difference between the Legal Rights of Princes, and the na∣tural Rights of Fathers and Husbands, which yet may cease and be dissolved in some cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E.L.R.</HI> p. 27.</NOTE> as I have already sufficiently proved: for I think it is evident that not only a Legal Title, and Legal Authority may be parted from each other; but that Legal Titles and Legal Authority may be rightfully separated from the persons to whom they were once due, which na∣tural Rights can never be. A King may cease to be a King, though a Father can never cease to be a Father; for Laws have not the same force and power that na∣ture has. Now all men confess this separation may be made by a voluntary resigna∣tion as also by Conquest in a just War, both which will divest such a Prince of all Right and Authority to Govern; and if it may be done by either of these ways, his Right and Authority is not inseparable from his Person; since then there is no natural inherent property in Lands or Kingdoms, but what proceeds from the particular Laws of each Kingdom, or Common-Wealth: therefore who ever the Supream Power appointed by the Constitution of such Kingdoms shall Judge or Determine to have a true and legal Right to the same are to be own'd, and esteemed as the true legal owners and possessors thereof, by all the Subjects: so that if a King can part with his Kingship, it is possible he may lose it too; since there are more ways than one, of parting with that which may be parted with, If then a voluntary Resignation of a Crown, or Conquest in a just War, can give another Prince a just Title to it, I cannot see why a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acit Abdication or Forfei∣ture of a Crown upon a limited Kings total breach of the Fundamental Laws and Constitution of the Kingdom, should not as much discharge all the Subjects of their Allegiance to him, and also give the great Council, as the Representative of the Nation, a like Right of Ordaining a Successor upon such a Vacancy of the Throne, and who being once placed therein, all the people of the Nation ought to pay the same Allegiance to him as they did to his Predecessors.</P>
<P>But as for the latter part of your supposition, that the right Heirs of the Crown by blood, must always necessarily succeed to it, that is likewise sounded upon two very false principles, first, that a lineal hereditary succession to the Crown, is
<PB N="894" REF="482"/>
established by the Fundamental Laws and Customs of the Kingdom. Secondly, That the Succession to it cannot be limited by the Parliament or Great Council of the Nation, the former of which suppositions I have confuted at our last meet∣ting: and as for the other, you cannot deny but the Crown has been frequently setled and limited by Act of Parliament, contrary to the common rules of Suc∣cession, as hath been sufficiently proved by the Statute above mentioned of <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th,</HI> as also by those several Acts concerning the Succession in <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII<HI>ths</HI> time, and so it continues at this day by the Statute of the 13<HI>th</HI> of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 1.</NOTE> whereby it is declared Treason during the Queens Life, for any person to affirm that the Queen and Par∣liament had not power to make Laws to limit and bind the descent and inheri∣tance of the Crown: or that this Act was not of sufficient force, to bind, limit and govern all Persons, their Rights, and Titles that in any way claim any Interest or possibility in or to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> in Possession, Remainder, Succession, Inheritance, or otherwise howsoever; and every Person so holding or affirming after the decease of the Queen, shall forfeit all his Goods and Chattels: So that I can see no just reason you can have to refuse Swearing Allegiance to Their present Majesties, and Their Successors, according to the limitation in the said Act.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I see it is in vain to argue these Points any longer with you, since it would only force me to repeat the same things over again, which will nei∣ther edifie you, nor my self; only give me leave to tell you this much, that the last part of your Argument (which is the only thing that is new in all your Dis∣course) is founded upon a very wrong ground; for though I should grant, as I do not, (since this Act you last mentioned is expired) that the Crown may be limited, or intail'd by Act of Parliament, contrary to the due Rules of Suc∣cession, yet even that will not hold in respect of the present settlement thereof by the Convention, upon the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> for their two Lives; since you cannot but know that no Parliament yet, was ever so presumptuous as to take upon them to settle or limit the Succession of the Crown without the consent of the King or Queen then in being. Whereas the present Settlement was first made by the Convention, upon the making of the Prince and Princess King and Queen; tho' I grant it was afterwards confirmed by another pretended Act, whereby all Princes that are or shall be Roman Catholicks when the Crown shall descend unto them, are debarred from their right of Succession; This though I grant to be made after the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> took upon them the Title of King, and Queen; yet since that Statute was not made in a Parliament call'd by the King's Writs, but in a Convention, who owe their Meeting wholly to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Letters, it is not only void in respect of the subject matter, but also in the manner of making it; and therefore I cannot believe that the Throne was ever vacant. And I have as little reason to be satisfied, that the Prince and Princess could be lawfully placed therein, or that all Ro∣man Catholick Princes can ever be barred from their right of Succession, when ever it may fall to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this be all you have farther to object, I think I can easily answer it; for in the first place, I have already told you, that the Convention did not take upon them to create or make any new form of Succession to the Crown, but only to de∣clare
<PB N="895" REF="482"/>
that the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> are Rightful and Lawful King and Queen of <HI>England</HI>; for upon supposition of King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Abdication of the Crown, and that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> cannot be taken for the lawful Son of the King 'till he can be brought over, and that his Legitimacy be duly proved, it must 'till then certainly be their right, and no others; and as for King <HI>William</HI>'s holding the Crown during his own Life, I have already told you it was not done without the tacit consent of the Princess of <HI>Denmark</HI> her self, though I doubt not but it may also very well be justified upon those suppositions of the forfeiture of the Crown by King <HI>Iames,</HI> and the Conquest the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> made over him; which are sufficient in themselves to barr any legal claim of those that either are or may pretend to be right Heirs.</P>
<P>But as for the other part of your Objection, whereby you would prove, that Popish Princes cannot be excluded from the Succession, because the Act was made not in a Parliament, but a Convention; this wholly proceeds from your want of Consideration,, that at the first institution of the Government, and long after, whilst the Kingdom continued Elective, there was no differ∣ence between a Great Council or Convention, and a Parliament; for pray call to mind the four first Great Councils after your Conquest (reckoning that for one wherein King <HI>William</HI> I. was Elected or declared King) whether it was possi∣ble for those Councils to be summon'd in the Kings Name, before any body had taken upon themselves the Title of King; the like I may say in the case of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the III<HI>d,</HI> and that this continued after the Succession was setled in the next Heir by Blood, appears by that Great Council that was summon'd after the death of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, which Recognized or Or∣dain'd his Son Prince <HI>Edward</HI> to be his Successor. So likewise the Parliament that deposed King <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, sate both before and after his deposition, and resignation, and elected his Son <HI>Edward</HI> the Third to be King, and appointed his Reign to begin from the time of their Election, and not of his Fathers resignation of the Crown; so also upon the deposition of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, the same Parliament that deposed him, placed <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth in the Throne; and though the Writs of Summons were in the name of King <HI>Richard,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Rot. Parl.</HI> 1<SUP>o</SUP> Henry IV.</NOTE> and they were never re-summon'd or new E∣lected in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, yet did they still con∣tinue to sit, and made divers new Acts, and repealed several old ones, all which hold good to this day.</P>
<P>And that the Parliament are the only proper Judges of the right of Succes∣sion, even without the King, you your self must grant, or else how could they de∣clare in the Thirty Ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the VI<HI>th,</HI> that the claim which <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> made to the Crown could no way be defeated? and certainly if that unfortunate Prince King <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth had had sufficient Power or Interest in that Parliament, they might, and would have adjudged the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Claim to have been groundless and contrary to Law, and then I be∣lieve it would scarce have ever been heard of again.</P>
<P><PB N="896" REF="483"/>But to make it out beyond exception, that a Convention may become a Lawful Parliament, though never call'd by the King's Writs, when the King's Authority and Presence come once to be added to and joined with it, ap∣pears by the first Parliament of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second; which though Sum∣mon'd in the Name of the Keepers of the Liberties of <HI>England,</HI> yet nevertheless continued to Sit and make several Acts which hold good to this day; and I doubt not but they might have made the like limitations of the Crown in re∣spect of Roman-Catholick Princes, as the Convention have now done, and that it would have held good at this day, since it is so much for the security of our Religion, Liberties and Properties that it should be so, since we have found by a dear bought experience in the Reigns of the four last Kings of the Scotch Line, that still as they began to favour the Popish Religion and Interest in this Kingdom, so did the Protestant and true English Interest in respect of our Religion, Liberties and Properties still decline, 'till at last they were like to be totally ruin'd, and extirpated; for that restless and dangerous Faction very well know, that there is no means possible for them to re-establish their Superstition among us by due and legal Methods, but only by introducing Ar∣bitrary Power, taking away Parliaments, or else making them wholly to de∣pend upon the King's Will, as we see was labour'd and almost effected in the Reigns of the two last Kings; and therefore I cannot but believe that the pre∣sent Parliament has not only acted wisely, but also legally, to enact that for the future no Prince who is actually a Roman Catholick shall succeed to the Crown though he be next heir by blood.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must still tell you I am as little satisfied with your suppositions of the forfeiture of the Crown by King <HI>Iames,</HI> and the Conquest to the Prince of <HI>O∣range,</HI> as I am with your instances out of History concerning the power of the Great Councils meeting and chusing a King by their own inherent Authority, since besides that it was done by Usurpation in those rough and unsetled times; yet I believe if the antient Writs of Summons were now in being, you would find that they were called by those Usurpers, though not by the Title of Kings; but I defie you to show me since the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the First any Par∣liament ever call'd without the King's Writs of Summons; and though upon the deposition of <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the Second the Parliaments you mention might continue to sit, and transact publick business, yet was it during a plain Usurpation upon those Princes whom you your self must grant to have been unlawfully deposed; and therefore we find upon the Parliament Roll of the 21<HI>st</HI> of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, that an Act of the first of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third confirming the Judgment given upon the two <HI>Spencers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Par. n.</HI> 64. 21. Ric. II.</NOTE> was not only repeal'd in Parliament, but declared to be unlawful, because <HI>Edward</HI> the Second was living, and true King, being imprison'd by his Sub∣jects at the time of that very Parliament of 1 <HI>Edward</HI> III. But as for your last instance of a Conventions declaring it self a Parliament in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, there is a great deal of difference between them, and the present Convention; since they did not take upon them to declare or
<PB N="897" REF="483"/>
make a King (as this Convention has done) but only to recognize him to be their Lawful Sovereign which (as I have already told you) being that which was their duty to do, they might very well justifie, though they were not Summon'd by the King's Writs; but however, all their Acts were looked upon as made without legal Authority, and therefore were confirmed in the first le∣gal Parliament of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Reign.</P>
<P>But as for the Authority of the Statute of the 13<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Eliz.</HI> whereby you would prove, that the Parliament has at this day power to alter or limit the Succession of the Crown; besides, that such an Act being against the funda∣mental rules of Succession, was void in it self, yet if you please to look upon the Act in <HI>Rastal</HI>'s Statutes, you will there find it was only made to serve a present turn, and to keep the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> and her Party from enterprizing any thing against Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; and therefore it is there only declar'd to be Treason during the Queens life, for any Persons to maintain, that the Queen could not riot with the Authority of the Parliament limit the Succession of the Crown; and as for the last Clause, that makes it forfeiture of Goods and Chattels, to maintain the contrary after her decease; this was made to strengthen and confirm the former part of the Sta∣tute,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B. H. S.</HI> P. 40.</NOTE> which was a provision and security against such preten∣ces and Practices as had been lately made against her by the Papists, on the behalf of the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> Title; and this Clause could not take effect after her death, but was added to preserve Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Me∣mory from being defamed after her decease, or being slanderously charged with the heinous Crime of Usurping the Crown, which must have been the in∣evitable consequence of affirming, that she, and her Parliament could not limit the Succession. For to confess the truth, I think Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> best Title was by Act of Parliament, since her Legitimacy might be justly question'd, by rea∣son that her Mothers Marriage was declar'd unlawful by the 28<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII<HI>th,</HI> and she was as good as declar'd illegitimate by her Father in that very Act that setled the Crown upon her; but that this Statute of the 13<HI>th</HI> of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> is now looked upon as expired, appears in <HI>Palton</HI>'s, and all other late Collections of the Statutes since her time; wherein the Title of the Statute is barely mention'd with <HI>EXP.</HI> immediately following it, to shew it is looked upon as expired: So that you are mistaken to affirm that the Convention has done nothing in the late limitation of the Crown, but what may be justified from that Statute; therefore if it be not Law at this day, I think they had no Authority to alter the Succession of the Crown from the right Line, let them be of what Religion they would.</P>

<P>I see you do all you can to evade the force of my Authorities from Hi∣story, and direct matter of Fact; and therefore as to what you say, that those were rough and unsetled, and therefore no Precedents to be drawn from thence, this is to beg the Question; for what could be the Law concerning the Succession of the Crown for the first hundred and fifty years after the Con∣quest, but the constant usage of the Great Council of the Nation, as low as the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third; and it is a bold assertion to accuse the whole Nation
<PB N="898" REF="484"/>
of Perjury, and Rebellion against their Lawful Kings during all those Succes∣sions I have now instanced in; nor have you any thing to say against those Parliaments that met in the 1<HI>st</HI> of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. and <HI>Charles</HI> the II. but that their Meeting was Lawful because it was only to recognize those Kings, and not to make them, which is indeed to beg the Question, since you cannot deny but those Parliaments are held for good, notwithstanding they were not call'd by the King's Writs. But as for making a King the present Parliament have not taken upon them to do it; since they do not in the Act for the Succession Elect King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> to be our Law∣ful King and Queen, but only declare or recognize them to be so, upon supposition that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> is either an Impostor, or else his Legi∣timacy impossible to be tried and determined by them. Nor are your Ob∣jections material against the Authority of those Acts of Parliament which were made in the 1<HI>st.</HI> of King <HI>Henry</HI> the IV<HI>th</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> the II<HI>d.</HI> which were never Summon'd by those Kings Writs. For as to the first of those In∣stances most of those Acts of <HI>Henry</HI> the IV<HI>th.</HI> stand good at this day, without ever being confirm'd by any subsequent Parliaments. And tho' I grant that the publick Acts made in the first Year of King <HI>Charles</HI> the II<HI>d.</HI> were con∣firm'd in the next Parliament of that King, yet this does not prove that they would have been void without it; since divers private Acts passed in that Parliament which were never confirm'd in any other, and yet are held for good: As particularly an Act of that Parliament for making the Church of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Parochial. And this Act, though never confirm'd, was yet adjudged to be in force by the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Hales</HI> and the rest of the Justices of the Court of <HI>King's Bench,</HI> in a Case concerning Rate Tythes between the Minister and some of the Parishioners of the said Parish.</P>
<P>Nor is what you have now said to prove the Statute of the 13<HI>th.</HI> of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (whereby the Crown is declared capable of being limitted by Act of Parliament) to be now expired; since it is plain by the purport of the Act, that it is Declaratory of the former Laws of <HI>England</HI> made in King <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th.</HI> and VIII<HI>ths.</HI> and other Kings Reigns, whereby the Succession of the Crown had been frequently entail'd upon those who were not the next Heirs by Blood; and tho' the Queen be only mentioned in it, yet it certainly as much concerns her Successors, as all future Parlia∣ments: as the Oath of Allegiance, in which the Queen is only mentioned, does all future Kings and Queens: And it is not only made Treason du∣ring her Life, but also there is a loss of Goods and Chattels to be inflict∣ed on all those who shall maintain after her decease, that the Queen and Parliament had not Power to Limit the Succession. And if the Parliament in her Reign could do this, I desire to know whence it is that the present Parliament may not have the like Power?</P>
<P>As to what you alledge concerning the Judgment against the two <HI>Spencers</HI> being revers'd in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Richard</HI> II. because done whilst <HI>Edward</HI> II. was still alive, I desire you would take notice, that this Parliament of <HI>Richard</HI>
<PB N="899" REF="484"/>
the Second was wholly made and pact by King <HI>Richard</HI> after the Banish∣ment of the Dukes of <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>Norfolk</HI>; and that as well the Lords as Commons, were in such fear of the Arbitrary Power he then exercised, that they past whatever he would: And in this Parliament it was that the Pro∣ceedings against the Chief Justice <HI>Tresilian</HI> and his fellow Judges, who had been Condemned and Executed by Judgment in Parliament in the 11<HI>th.</HI> of this King, were reverst. And no prove the Illegality of this Parliament, you need but consult the Statute-Book in 1<HI>st.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the IV<HI>th.</HI> where you will find one of the first Statutes after his coming to the Crown, is to repeal all Acts and Proceedings made in that last Parliament of <HI>Richard</HI> the II<HI>d.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt this will not do the business; for we maintain, that <HI>Henry</HI> the IV<HI>th.</HI> also his Son, and Grand-Son, were Usurpers; and consequently all the Acts made in their Reigns were null and void.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will grant you for once, that <HI>Henry</HI> the IV<HI>th.</HI> was an Usurper, and that <HI>Edward</HI> the III<HI>d.</HI> was so also during his Fathers Life-time; but then it doth not follow, that all the Laws and Statutes made during those Times, were null and void, since you must needs know the contrary; for even in that Parliament of the 21<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Richard</HI> the II<HI>d.</HI> though 'tis true that Judg∣ment against the <HI>Spencers</HI> was revers'd for the Reason you have given, yet did that Repeal extend to no other Statutes but that, tho' made in the same Parliament of <HI>Edward</HI> the III<HI>d.</HI> whilst his Father was yet living: But they are all of them held for good at this day, as are also all the Statutes of the three <HI>Henry</HI>'s, whom you suppose to be Usurpers, which have not been repealed by any subsequent Statutes, as I can assure you those of the first of <HI>Henry</HI> the IV<HI>th.</HI> are not, and therefore are good Laws at this day: So that nothing can be a plainer proof than this, that let the King's Title to the Crown have been it would, yet Allegiance was due to them as long as they continued in the Throne.</P>
<P>Therefore to conclude, let me tell you, I think it behoves you, if you mean to keep that Office you hold under the Government, to take the Oath of Allegiance to their present Majesties, since you owe your Protecti∣on to their Government, which certainly deserves a Temporary Allegiance as long as you enjoy the benefit of it. And indeed, the Oath it self is so loosly worded, that methinks any Man may take it without any scruple, since it doth no ways declare, that the present King and Queen have an Here∣ditary Right to the Crown, but only the Person swears to bear true Alle∣giance to their Majesties King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; which I think even Strangers and Denizens are bound to take as long as they continue in the Kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry you should think me, after so long an acquaintance, capable of doing any thing against my Conscience for any Worldly advantage whatso∣ever; and therefore I must freely tell you, that as for the Imployment I hold, I will rather part with it, if it were never so great, than do any thing against my Conscience, and that reputation I have hitherto maintained in the World of being an Honest Man.</P>
<P><PB N="900" REF="485"/>And therefore I cannot take the Oath as a meer Denizen that owes Protection to the present Government: Not only because this Oath is in∣consistent with that I have already taken, but also there is much more re∣quired of those that owe a Natural Allegiance to their rightful King, than can be required of Strangers, till they become Naturaliz'd by Act of Par∣liament. And therefore it is, that when any War breaks out between Neighbouring Princes, all such Denizens who do not become absolute Sub∣jects of this Kingdom by Naturalization, if they will act like Honest Men, must look upon themselves as oblig'd either to quit the Kingdom in case a War be declar'd against their natural Prince, or at least are oblig'd not to act any thing to his prejudice, though they may still inhabit and Traffick here; which is a quite different Case from those who are not only born the King's Subjects, but have also taken the Oath of Allegiance to him. And therefore I can by no means think it Lawful to take this New Oath to King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> though it were required in no higher a sense than as King and Queen <HI>de facto</HI>; since it can no ways consist with that Oath which I have already taken to King <HI>Iames</HI> and his right Heirs; as I shall prove to you another time (since it is now very late) from the true sense and meaning of those words, <HI>I will be Faithful, and bear true Alle∣giance,</HI> &amp;c. which can only be sworn to such Kings and Queens, who be∣sides a bare Possession, have also a Legal and Hereditary Right to the Crown.</P>

<P>I shall be very glad to hear you farther upon this Question; for if that can be made out, I fear too many of the Clergy as well as Laity, by mistaking the true Sense of this Oath, have been Forsworn.

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>HAving in the two last Discourses considered the Law∣fulness and justice of King <HI>Jame</HI>'s Abdication, as as also of the late Conventions place King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> in the Throne; it might have seem'd needless to add any thing farther on this Subject, had it not been for the satisfaction of so many of the Clergy, as well as Laity, who not being satisfied with the rightfulness of their Majesties Title, nor with the Decla∣ration of the said Convention, whereby they are Recognized to be of <HI>Right,</HI> and by the Laws of this Realm, King and Queen of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. have taken an Oath of Allegi∣ance to them only as King and Queen <HI>de facto,</HI> or for the time being.</P>
<P>For the justification of which, it was necessary to con∣sider all that can reasonably be said upon this Question, ac∣cording
<PB REF="487"/>
to those several Heads set down in the Title Page of this Discourse; for the performance of which, I shall only tell you, that it is a Collection out of the best Trea∣tises that have been written on this Subject, and from the best Reasons that I could gather by discoursing with divers Learned Men who have refused this Oath; who if they have done it out of Conscience (as we ought charitably to believe they have) are infinitely to be preferred in the Opi∣nions of all honest men, before divers others, who I doubt have taken the Oath with dissastisfied Consciences, for meer gain, or the consideration of worldly advantages, and with a design to return to their former Allegiance to King <HI>James,</HI> as soon as with safety they may; and who, though they have taken this Oath themselves, yet do more highly applaud and favour the refusers, than those that have taken it with truly satisfied Consciences, and intend to keep it when they have done.</P>
<P>But though I confess I have here urged all the cogent Reasons I could Collect, either from the Law of the Land, or that of Nature, for the taking this Oath to their pre∣sent Majesties; I must also acknowledge, that though I have taken some answers out of a Learned Drs. Case of Al∣legiance, yet I must confess I absolutely waved entering into the defence of that Hypothesis, upon which that Treatise is built; since it would not only be tedious, but unnecessary; tedious, because it would be too long for such a short Dis∣course as this, to repeat all the Arguments he has made use of, together with all the answers that have been made to it in so many Treatises that have been written against it; unnecessary, not only because I take a different Method from his, and have ran into all those dark Labyrinths of Law and History, which he sedulously avoids; but also be∣cause his Hypothesis of making Allegiance due to the meer possession of Power, as to the Ordinance of God, let the Possessor come by it which way he will, (and that without any Election, or Recognition of the People,) is that which
<PB REF="487"/>
satisfies no party of Men concerned in the present Dispute; not the <HI>Jacobite,</HI> for he cries out, that it is but the same Argument new vamp'd, which <HI>John Goodwyn,</HI> and <HI>Ascham</HI> set up for Obedience to <HI>Oliver,</HI> and the <HI>Rump</HI>; and that upon this ground, the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> should he once Conquer <HI>England,</HI> would have as much right to our Al∣egiance as King <HI>James</HI> himself; whilst those who have acted out of a Principle on the behalf of their present Majesties, say, that by his thus setting them up with an absolute ir∣resistible Power; we do but change hands, and it is no thanks to his Hypothesis, if we fall not into the same Ar∣bitrary Government, which by King <HI>James</HI>'s Abdication we have so wonderfully escaped.</P>
<P>I have therefore confined my self in this Discourse only to such Arguments as can be deduced from Reason, History, or the Law of the Land; since I must freely confess, that the Argu∣ments that Reverend Author has made us of from Scrip∣ture, for the support of his Opinion seem to me a much darker Labyrinth than what he endeavours to shun.</P>
<P>But as to point of time, I have resolved to look no far∣ther than the first six Weeks of their Majesties Reign, to avoid either the arraigning or defending any thing that has happen'd since that time.</P>
<P>And tho' I have taken no notice of this present Parlia∣ments Recognition of their Majesties Title, as being done after the time to which I limit this Discourse; though what was done by the former Parliament, may be suffici∣ently defended upon the grounds I have laid down in this, and the former Discourse; yet do I not deny, but that the solemn Recognition of a free Parliament summon'd in their Majesties Name, has taken away those Obejections which were made against the Conventions declaring them to be rightful King, and Queen, and then Voting themselves a Parlia∣ment, when they were not Summoned by Writs issued in the Name of the King, or Queen, according to the usual form.</P>
<P><PB REF="488"/>Only I must confess I have made bold in one Point to look beyond the time prefixt; and that is, in relation to the late Schism began by some of our Clergy, and carried on by some of the Laity who refused the present Oaths: but since I have made use of some Reasons against it, which have not (as I know of) been yet hit upon by any former Writers on this Subject. I wish they may prove for their satisfaction; but if not, since I write only to disco∣ver truth, I desire that any of the present new Dis∣senters will shew me my mistakes; and I shall take it kind∣ly, not only for my own sake, but that of others, who may otherwise be misled by my Arguments.</P>
<P>I have only one thing more to add, in relation to some∣what I promised at the end of the Preface to the last Dia∣logue, concerning the late Revolutions being different from the last Civil War, and Murther of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First; which though I have finish'd, and thought to have inserted into this Discouese, yet since it proves rather too long without it, and that the Bookseller urges for its speedy Publication; I have thought fit to omit it; since also the greatest part of it relates to matter of fact, which is va∣riously stated by those who write the History of those times, yet I shall make bold to give you the heads of those inqui∣ries I have made, and shall leave you to satisfie, your self in these Points following; first, if after King <HI>Charles</HI> the first had not only passed all Bills for redressing those Grie∣vances the Nation lay under at the beginning of the Parlia∣ment in <HI>1640.</HI> but had also passed the Bill to make it not to be Prorogued, or Dissolved without their own consents; I say, whether there were then any such violations of our Re∣ligion, and fundamental Laws which should require the Parliament and Nations puting themselves in a posture of defence against the King's Arbitrary Power. Secondly, whe∣ther the fears and jealousies of Popery and Arbitrary Go∣vernment which (notwithstanding all that the King had done) still troubled many Mens minds, were a sufficient
<PB REF="488"/>
ground for the two Houses to demand the put<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the whole Militia of the Kingdom out of his own Power, into such hands as they should nominate and appoint. Thirdly, whe∣ther upon his refusal of their Adresses for the Militia, their going about to take it out of his hands by force, and par∣ticularly their shutting him out of <HI>Hull</HI> was not an actual making War upon the King when he was as yet un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>armed, and had given out no Commissions to raise Men, or Arms. Fourthly, when the War was begun, whether the King did not in all his Messages to and Treaties with the Parlia∣ment, propose and seem to desire Peace upon equal and reasonable terms. Fifthly. Whether the two Houses did not instead of complying with those reasonable Proposals, still insist upon higher Terms, as their Victories and Suc∣cesses over the King increased. Sixthly, when the King was deliver'd up by the <HI>Scots,</HI> whether the Parliament and Army did not keep him as good as a close Prisoner, and vote no more Addresses to be made to him, meerly because he refused to pass whatever Bills they brought to him. Se∣venthly, When at last he was forced by necessity to grant them at the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> almost whatever they demanded, whether he was not hurried away from thence by <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Army; and for the major part of the House of Commons, who had Voted the King's Concessions satisfactory, excluded the House by force; till the far less Party had reversed all that the rest had done, and then Voted the King should he called to an account for making War upon the Parlia∣ment, and for Treason against the Kingdom. Eighthly, Whe∣ther in pursuance of this, they did not appoint Iudges to Trie the King, who upon his refusal to own their Authority, Condemned him to death, and cut off his head before the Gates of his own Palace. Ninthly, Whether this fag end of a Parliament did not alter the whole frame of the Go∣vernment both in Church and State, destroying both Monar∣chy, and Episcopacy, and Voting the House of Peers useless, and dangerous; and setting up a Democratical Commonwealth,
<PB REF="489"/>
or rather an Oligarcy in their stead, consisting of about fifty or sixty Men, wholly governed and awed by <HI>Crom∣well,</HI> and the Officers of the Army.</P>
<P>Now let any Man but impartially consider all these Trans∣actions with the late Revolution, and read what hath been said in the three last Dialogues, and then let him tell me∣ingenuously, whether he thinks this Revolution hath been be¦gun upon the like grounds, and carried on by the same vi∣olent Courses, or has ended with the same direful effects as the late Civil War, and Murther of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First.</P>
<P>I have no more to propose on this Subject, but only to wish that these Discourses written with a real design for the publick good and peace of my Countrey, may be read with the like affection with which they were written, and may really promote that end for which they were designed; but if not, that they may at least serve as an Impartial History to Posterity of those Principles and Opinions on which this late great Revolution hath been brought about in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>; and also those on which it hath been so violently op∣posed by the dissenting Party.</P>

<HEAD>THE Thirteenth Dialogue BETWEEN Mr. <HI>MEANWELL</HI> a Civilian, AND Mr. <HI>FREEMAN</HI> a Gentleman.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, I hope I do not interrupt you by coming too soon, for the truth is, since I intend that this shall be the last Dispute I shall ever have with you upon this Subject, I was very desirous to have it dispatched as soon as I could, that when I have once discharged the duty of an old Friend and Acquaintance, my mind may be at rest which side soever you take.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, I thank you, and though I intended to go abroad this Eve∣ning upon an Appointment, yet I will not put it off, that I may enjoy your better Conversation, therefore pray begin where you left off, and prove to me that I may lawfully take this new Oath of Allegiance to King <HI>William,</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot see any reason why you may not safely do it, since our best Common Lawyers are of this Opinion;
<Q>for my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> in his Third institutes in his Notes upon the Statute of Treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 7.</NOTE> the 25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the III<HI>d</HI> gives it for Law, that this Act is to be understood of a King in possession of the Crown, and Kingdom; for if there be a King Regnant in possession, although he be <HI>Rex de Facto, &amp; non de Iure,</HI> yet is he Seignior <HI>Le Roy</HI> within the purview of that Statute, and the other that hath Right, and is out of possession is not within this Act, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
And if it be Treason to Levy War against him, or to Conspire his Death as long as he conti∣nues King, it can only be so, because the Subjects Allegiance is then due to him, for that all Men have either taken the Oath of Allegiance, or else are supposed to have done it.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="906" REF="490"/>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must beg your pardon, if I cannot come over to your Opinion, neither in point of Law or Reason; for as long as I am perswaded in my Conscience that King <HI>Iames</HI> is King <HI>de Iure,</HI> so long must the obligation of my former Oath last; and I suppose that you will grant that it is as impossible to owe Allegiance to two Kings at once, as it is to serve two Masters, and therefore you must pardon me, if I suppose that my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> depending too much upon the com∣monly received sence of the Statute of the Eleventh of <HI>Henry</HI> the VII<HI>th,</HI> which he quotes in the Margin, may be mistaken in this Great Point, and may have also given occasion to divers others of his profession to fall into the same Errour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not but my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> and others of his profession who maintain the same Opinion, may very well be defended, as well from that Statute, as other Authorities; but to pass by that at present, I shall first discourse with you upon this point, of the lawfulness of taking this Oath to their present Majesties King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and therefore you misunderstand me, if you believe that I think this Oath doth require from you the performance of all those duties of Allegiance and Subjection which I my self am oblig'd to, who am fully satisfied of their Title, and therefore must venture my Life and Fortune in their quarrel, to the utmost of my power against all Persons whatsoever; but all that I think can be required of you is, that whereas King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> are actually in possession of the Regal Power so long as they continue thus possessed of it, you may I think Swear that you will be so far true and faithful to them, as not to enterprize any thing against them, but that you will pay them that obedience and submission which may be lawfully paid to an actual Sovereign; not engaging hereby to uphold them in the possession of the Throne against King <HI>Iames,</HI> and without debarring your self from exerting that Allegi∣ance you have sworn to him upon any emergent safe opportunity for the reco∣very of his Right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must beg your pardon, if I cannot assent to take this Oath in this low and qualified sence that you would now put upon it, since besides the significa∣tion of the words themselves, I am very well satisfied that the imposers of this Oath do intend something more than a bare negative obedience to the present Power, since it is the only Oath which is required from those who take Imploy∣ments either Civil or Military, and from whom certainly, not only a passive O∣bedience or Submission, but also an active obedience and assistance is required in defending the Crown and Dignity of the present King and Queen <HI>de facto,</HI> with their Lives and Fortunes, against all Persons whatsoever; or else how could the present Government ever trust them? and all this cannot be sworn to, with∣out a breach of that Oath they had formerly taken to King <HI>Iames</HI>; and therefore if I should take it in this sense (as the Oath itself seems to imploy) I should be perjur'd; besides, by these words of being true and faithfull, I should look upon my self as oblig'd to reveal all Plots and Conspiracies which I may any ways happen to know of against King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> which I think would be derogatory to my Allegiance to his Majesty, since I should thereby discover and accuse such of his good Subjects as endeavour'd to restore him, and should thereby hinder him as much as in me lay, from being restor'd again to the Throne.</P>
<P><PB N="907" REF="490"/>But if we consider the word <HI>Allegiance,</HI> it is yet more strict, and if I should Perform it to King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> according to the true intent and legal sence of that word, I think it could no ways consist with that Oath of Al∣legiance I have already taken; since Allegiance is thus explained in the next following words of the Oath I have already taken;
<Q><HI>and him, and them</HI>; viz. (the King, and his Heirs) I will defend to the utmost of my power against all Conspiracies and Attempts whatsoever, that shall be made against his, or their Persons, Crown, and Dignities.</Q>
Now what kind of assistance is here meant by the word <HI>defend,</HI> may be under∣stood from all the Writers of our feudal Laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. A.</HI> p. 15.</NOTE> who expound the <HI>jus defensorium,</HI> by telling us that the word <HI>protegere</HI> implies a necessity of de∣fending by Arms as due from the Supream Lord or Sovereign; and further, that Subjects are in the same sence reciprocally bound to defend the Honour and Dignity of their Sovereign: and these words Allegiance, and the defence that follows it may be likewise understood from our feudal Laws, whereby the Vas∣sals were bound by their Oath of Allegiance, as also by vertue of the tenure of their Lands to a military defence of their Supream Lord the King, from whom all the Lands in <HI>England</HI> are held, and this is according to <HI>Glanvil,</HI> and all our old Lawyers; and though I grant that military tenures are all now taken away by a late Statute, yet am I still obliged to the like defence of the King and his heirs, not only from the words of this Oath, but from the municipal Laws of this Kingdom also; which oblige all the Subjects that are capable, to take up Arms for the King, when need shall require.</P>
<P>Which my be thus further proved; first, from the Antient Laws of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> P. 14. <HI>Vid.</HI> Lambardi, <HI>L. L.</HI> Edwards <HI>&amp; L. L.</HI> Will. I. c. 52.</NOTE> and <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour,
<Q>by both which, all the People or Freemen of the Kingdom were to affirm upon their Faith and Oath, within the whole Kingdom, and without, that they will be faithful to to their Sovereign Lord King <HI>William,</HI> and every where preserve his Lands and Honours with all fidelity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Stat.</HI> 51 <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> and with him will defend them against all his Enemies.</Q>
To this, succeeded that, which the Lord <HI>Coke</HI> calls legal Ligeance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calvin<HI>'s Case.</HI> Cowel's <HI>Inst.</HI> l. 2. <HI>tit.</HI> 3. § 14.</NOTE> or the Common-Law-Oath of Allegiance, which he cites out of <HI>Britton</HI> (who wrote under <HI>Edward</HI> I.) which all the Subjects were oblig'd to take at twelve years of age at the Sheriffs-Court, and at the Leete, and without the taking of which, they had no warrant to abide in the Kingdom; and the form of it was this effect:
<Q>You shall Swear, that from this day for∣ward you shall be true and faithful to our Sovereign Lord the King, and his Heirs; and truth and faith shall bear of life, and member and terrene honour, and you shall neither know nor hear of any ill or dammage which you shall not defend, (that is, oppose) to the utmost of your power.</Q></P>
<P>And my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> also here informs us, that five things were observed by all the Judges from this Oath in the debate of <HI>Calvin</HI>'s Case. First, that for the time of its obligation, it is indefinite; and without limit.
<Q>Secondly, two excellent qualities were required, that is, to be true, and faithful. Thirdly, to whom? to our Sovereign Lord the King, and his Heirs. Fourthly, in what manner? and saith and troth shall bear of life and member; that is, untill the
<PB N="908" REF="491"/>
letting out the last drop of our dearest heart blood. Fifthly, where, and in what place? in all places whatsoever; for you shall neither know nor hear of any ill which you shall not defend; such is the Ligeance which the Law has prescribed in that antient Oath, which is still in force; it is neither circum∣scribed by time, nor place; it is unconditionate, and unreserved; it is not a lazy passive Allegiance, requiring nothing but pure submission, but an active and vigorous Loyalty, exacting all that is in the sphere of moral possibility, and engaging us to spend our dearest blood in the defence of our Sovereigns Person, and the preservation of his Crown and Dignity.</Q></P>
<P>For it is to be observed, that by the Law, this Allegiance is due to the Kings Person; so the same Author says it was then resolved by all the Judges, that
<Q>that Ligeance was due to the natural person of the King, (which is ever accom∣panied with the politick capacity; and the politick capacity as it were appropri∣ated to the natural) and not due to the politick capacity only.</Q></P>
<P>To conclude, if my former Oath of Allegiance to King <HI>Iames</HI> doth still con∣tinue (as I am satisfied in my Conscience it doth) I cannot take a new Oath of Allegiance to King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> since I should thereby be obliged by the force of these words in the Oath (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<Q>I will be faithful, and bear true Allegiance, to yield it as much to those that are not my Lawful Sovereigns, as I am to those that are so, which will be contrary to my first engagement;</Q>
for though I grant that there is no express Declaration of the Right of the present Possessors of the Throne, and that I have heard that the word <HI>rightfull</HI> (which was at first inserted into this Oath was struck out) because as many as could be might be drawn in to take it; yet as long as the words that remain import the very same thing, it is all one as if the word <HI>rightfull</HI> were there; for though the deliberate omission of the word <HI>rightfull,</HI> does necessarily infer that we are not obliged in this Oath to a recognition of their right to the Crown, yet it does not infer, that we are not obliged to pay as high a degree of Allegiance as to any rightful King whatsoever; that omission indeed is an Argument that the word King in the Oath does not necessarily signifie a King <HI>de jure</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. A.</HI> p. 24.</NOTE> but it is no argument, that true allegiance does not signifie true Allegiance, that is an obligation to adhere to the King against all his Enemies; for there was no debate, that we know of, about the sense of the word Allegiance, neither is there the least intimation given that they de∣sign'd to restrain it to a lower signification, though it was plainly necessary to do it, if they intended to alter the commonly received meaning of it; where∣fore, as the striking out of the word rightfull would not have proved, that they did not intend to oblige us to an active assistance of King <HI>William,</HI> against all men living; if those words had been expresly inserted in the Oath; so neither will it prove that the same duty is not now required of us, if the word Allegiance do, as I have proved <HI>in terminis</HI> import it; and that as fully, as if it had been in express words requir'd in it.</P>
<P>And that this word Allegiance implies something more than a bare passive sub∣mission or neutrality from all Subjects, as well as Magistrates and Officers, ap∣pears by that passage in the Statute of the 11th of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, which you have now cited; where 'tis plainly and expresly declared,
<Q>that every Subject by the duty of his Allegiance, is bound to serve and assist his Prince
<PB N="909" REF="491"/>
and Sovereign Lord at all seasons when need shall require; this is so express and authentick a Declaration of the true duty of Allegiance, that no Art or Sophistry can possibly evade it.</Q></P>

<P>I confess you have argued this point of taking this new Oath of Allegi∣ance, not only like a Civilian, but a common Lawyer also; and I cannot de∣ny the force of what you have said, that this Oath must extend to an active obedience, and defence of their present Majesties in their right to the Throne, and not only to a bare sluggish submission, or a luke-warm Neutrality.
<Q>And therefore I cannot say but you are justly scrupulous in not taking this new Oath, untill you are satisfied of their Majesties Right as well as present Power; but if you will please to observe the purport of this Act of the 11th of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, (which you now mention'd) you will there find it as good as expresly declar'd that Allegiance is due to him who is lawful Sovereign, and the King for the time being is still to be looked upon as such; for the words in the Sta∣tute are, that no Man shall suffe for assisting the King for the time being, without specifying by what Title he holds the Crown, whether by an heredi∣tary Right, or by Conquest, Election, or the solemn recognition of his Title by all the Estates in Parliament; so that by this Act, all that Allegiance that was once due to the former King <HI>de Iure</HI> becomes thereby wholly transfer'd to the King <HI>de facto.</HI></Q></P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant what you now say would go a great way to satisfie me, could you once prove that this Statute is now in force, and is not now either, abro∣gated, or expired; or else (which I rather incline to believe) is not absolutely void in it self. In the first place therefore I hope to shew you that this was not Law before this Statute was made, and therefore not declaratory of what was Law, but endeavours to make that to be Law, which was not so before; so that the King for the time being there mention'd, must be a King <HI>de jure,</HI> or at least one that was presumed such; because at that time the Consti∣tution knew no other,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib. A.</HI> 11. <HI>H.</HI> 7. p. 2.3.</NOTE> for that Possession was not a sufficient Title before the 11th of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, will evidently ap∣pear from these following Remarks. First, that all the Kings of the House of <HI>Lancaster</HI> are declared in the Statute of the first of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth, to be Kings in Deed, but not of Right, and pretended Kings, and par∣ticularly <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth is said to be rightfully amoved from the Govern∣ment, and his Reign affirmed to be Intrusion, and Usurpation, and himself Attainted for being in Arms against <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth. Secondly, all Patents of Honour, Charters, and Priviledges, which were granted by the House of <HI>Lancaster</HI>; all Acts of Royal Authority which the Kings of <HI>England</HI> have a right to execute by vertue of their sole Prerogative, (nay, Acts of Parliament themselves, particularly those relating to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and some others, which by parity of Reason supposes the rest in the same Condition,) all Acts of this nature were confirmed by the first of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth, which is a good Ar∣gument that this Parliament believed the Authority by which they were per∣formed to be defective and illegal▪ for we never find any such general confir∣mation as these pass upon the grants of the King <HI>de jure.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="910" REF="492"/>Thirdly, in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId was At∣tainted of High Treason in Parliament, under the the name of Duke of <HI>Glou∣cester</HI>; from whence 'tis plain, that as there was no Statute, so neither was there any Common Law to support the Title of a King <HI>de facto,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Lord</HI> Bac. Henry VIIth.</NOTE> for Treason is an attempt against the Kings Person, his Crown and Dignity, but no Man can commit Treason against himself; therefore if <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId had been a King in the sence of this Law, we may be sure he would not have had such an infa∣mous censure past upon him after his death. <HI>Bradshaw,</HI> and his High Court of Justice, were the first that were so hardy as to pronounce a King of <HI>England</HI> guilty of Treason.</P>
<P>Fourthly, If this notion of a King <HI>de facto</HI> had been allowed in the 11th of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, the Principal Assistants of <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId could not have been attainted; for <HI>Richard</HI> being actually in the Throne, he was according to your Modern way of arguing,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 4.</NOTE> Rightful King; and consequently the People ought to own him as such, and defend him against all opposers; and if so, certainly they ought not to be con∣demned as Traytors for doing their duty, as we find many of those were who fought for King <HI>Richard.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, at the end of this Parliament, <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth granted a General Pardon to the common people who had appeared against him in the behalf of <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId, now Pardon supposes a fault, and the breach of a Law, which they could not have been charged with, if the plea of a King <HI>de facto</HI> had been warranted by the Constitution.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must freely tell you, that you do not argue so much like a Lawyer in this Argument as you did in your former, and you have in that forgot to what end those Statutes you mention were made, and what is the purport of them, or else some body hath misinformed you; for though I grant that all those hard expressions you mention, are given of the Kings of the <HI>Lancastrian</HI> Line in those Statutes of the 1<HI>st</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth, yet do none of these expressions prove, that they were not true and legal Kings in the eye of the Law all the while they Reign'd; since divers Persons were attainted for High Treason against them, whose attainders were never reversed, but stand good to this day; as in parti∣cular the attainder of the Earls of <HI>Kent, Salisbury,</HI> and of <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> who were all attainted by Act of Parliament, in the second of <HI>Henry</HI> the IVth, and also the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and his Son the Lord <HI>Piercy,</HI> attainted in the 5th of this King, all which attainders were never reversed: So likewise <HI>Ri∣chard</HI> Earl of <HI>Cambridge</HI> was found guilty of Treason by his Peers, and his At∣tainder confirmed by Act of Parliament in the second of <HI>Henry</HI> the Vth, and though it is true this Attainder was afterwards reversed in the first of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth, because the said <HI>Richard</HI> was not only his Grandfather, but was also Condemned for endeavouring to make <HI>Edmund</HI> Earl of <HI>March</HI> his Brother-in-law King of <HI>England,</HI> from whose Sister King <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth claimed the Crown; yet the very reversing this Attainder by Act of Parliament, declares it to have been good untill that Repeal, since it was not declared void; all which are plain and evident proofs, that Treason may be committed against the King <HI>de facto,</HI> and consequently that Allegiance is also due to him, and not to the King <HI>de jure.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="911" REF="492"/>I have likewise also proved that all those Statutes which were made by those Kings, and are not repealed, stand good at this day without any confirmation by King <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth; and this you have no way to answer, but by in∣stancing in Patents of Honour, or Charters of Priviledges granted by those Kings, and confirmed by <HI>Edward</HI> the IV<HI>th,</HI> from whence you would inferr, that some other Acts of like nature were in the same condition; which, let me tell you, in no good argument against them; for if you please to read that Statute of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth you mention, and you will there plainly see, that the Grants, Patents, and other things there confirmed, or either judicial Proceedings in the Courts of Justice, or else such Charters, or Patents which being thought to the prejudice of the Crown were <HI>ex abundanti cautela,</HI> thought necessary to be confirmed by those particular Persons, Religious Houses, and Corporations who thought themselves concerned, nor were all others of like nature who were not so confirmed, thereby void, since they hold good at this day; and if you understand any thing of our Law, you cannot but know, that no Grants of the King can be made void by implication; and to shew you farther, that the Letters Patents made by <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth were looked upon as good in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth, appears good from <HI>Bagot</HI>'s Case in the Year-Book of the ninth of that King; where a Patent of Naturalization granted by <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 1.2.</NOTE> though it were not confirmed by that Statute of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth, was by the greatest part of the Judges held to be good, and the reasons there given for it are very re∣markable; since it was urged by the Council in behalf of the
<Q>Plaintiff, that King <HI>Henry</HI> was then King in Possession, and it behoves that the Realm should have a King, and that the Laws should be kept and maintain'd; and therefore though he was in only by Usurpation, nevertheless every judicial Act done by him, concerning Royal Jurisdiction shall hold good, and bind the King <HI>de jure</HI> when he returns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So likewise a Charter of Pardon of Fe∣lony, and Licenses of Mortmain shall be good, and also the King that now is shall have the advantage of every forfeiture made to the said King <HI>Henry,</HI> &amp;c. and mark this farther, it is there also held that a Man shall be Arraigned for Treason done against the said King <HI>Henry</HI> in compassing his death; and the rea∣son is very remarkable, because the said King indeed was not meerly a Usurper, for the Crown was intail'd upon him by Parliament; and this being not at all contradicted by the Court, is still taken for Law; and upon this report, and not only upon the Statute of the 11th of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, did my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> found his Opinion I now mention'd, that a King <HI>de facto</HI> was within the Statute of the 25th of <HI>Edward</HI> III. and though now it is true, that the farther arguing of this Case of <HI>Bagots</HI> adjourned to a farther day, when the Justices did not argue, but the Serjeants and Apprentices at Law, (that is the Baristers as we now call them) yet it seems to have been allowed by the whole Court, that if King <HI>Edward</HI> who was then King, had made his Charter before he was decla∣red so, it should be void at that time; for every one who shall make a Charter of Pardon, ought to be King in Deed, at the time of the making thereof.</Q></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray Sir give me leave to reply to what you have now said against my first two Arguments, before you go on to answer the rest; for I confess the Authorities you bring seem so express against me, that if I cannot take them
<PB N="912" REF="493"/>
off, there will be no further need for your answering the rest; I will not there∣fore deny, but that all publick Acts and Proceedings at Law, which are for the publick good and safety of the Kingdom, do hold good though made under Usurpers, and that for this Reason; because such Acts being for the publick be∣nefit, it is to be suppos'd that the King <HI>de jure</HI> did give his tacit consent to them; for (as it is well observed in the Case you have now cited) that it behoves the Realm should have a King (that is some Civil Government) and that the Laws should be kept and maintain'd, but then those Laws can extend only to such things as are for the publick good, and do not tend to the disinheriting of the King <HI>de jure,</HI> or barring him or his Heirs of their Right, as did that Act of the 7th of <HI>Henry</HI> the IVth, whereby the Crown was intail'd upon himself, and his Sons, which was declar'd to be void by the 39th of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth; so likewise this Act is void for the same reason, since it would give a Right to the Subjects to defend the King for the time being, though an Usurper against the true and lawful King, who would be thereby not only defeated of his Right himself, but also his right Heirs would be so too, which would be directly contrary to the intent of the said Statutes of the 39th of <HI>Hen.</HI> VI, and 1<HI>st</HI> of <HI>Edw.</HI> IVth but now mention'd, but also to the Act of Recognition of King <HI>Iames</HI> the Firsts Title.</P>
<P>And therefore I must still maintain that my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> is mistaken in suppo∣sing a King <HI>de facto</HI> to be within the intent of the Statute of the 25th of <HI>Edw.</HI> the IIId, for sure it would seem a very odd question for any one to ask touch∣ing the Laws that are made in any setled Monarchy for the defence of the Kings Person, Crown and Dignity, who is meant by the King in those Laws; whether the Lawful and Rightful King of that Realm, or any one that gets into the possession of the Throne, though he be not a Rightful King, but an Usurper.</P>
<P>So likewise as to that Clause in this Statute, which makes it Treason to Con∣spire the Death of the Kings Eldest Son and Heir; it could be never intended for the Son of a King <HI>de facto,</HI> since that would be to own him for right Heir of the Crown for ever, and thereby intail it upon his Family, to the prejudice of the Right Heir of the King <HI>de jure</HI>; and therefore, though I grant some of the Judges and Lawyers held the Law to be so as you have cited it in <HI>Bagot</HI>'s Case, and that a King <HI>de facto</HI> may enjoy those Prerogatives in some respects, yet can∣not this be extended to the prejudice of the King <HI>de jure,</HI> and his Right Heirs; and though I also grant that divers Acts of Parliament made by Kings <HI>de facto,</HI> have for the most part held good without being confirm'd by any subsequent Statute of the King <HI>de jure,</HI> yet have they been also repeal'd sometimes; meerly because made whilst the King <HI>de jure</HI> was alive, as I shall prove more at large by and by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>I shall also take the boldness to reply to these answers of yours, before I proceed to answer the rest of your Arguments; in the first place, let me tell you that this notion of a tacit consent in the King <HI>de jure</HI> suppos'd to be given to all Statutes made for the publick good is to serve upon all occasions, when those of your Party cannot tell how otherwise to answer the Arguments that are brought against them, and you may as well tell me that they do also give their tacit consents to all other Acts that Usurpers may do; and I may as well
<PB N="913" REF="493"/>
suppose that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the Wife of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, the Lawful Heiress of the Crown, did in the person of her Husband give her tacit consent that this Act of the 11th of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth should hold good for ever, since it is so much for the publick good and peace of the Nation, that the Statute de∣clares it to be against Law, Reason, and good Conscience, that Sub∣jects should suffer for fighting for the King for the time being; but I very much wonder if this suppos'd tacit consent were given to all Acts of Parliament by the Kings <HI>de jure,</HI> why upon their return to the Government, he did not also express this consent by confirming all those Acts which were made by his Prede∣cessors the Kings <HI>de facto,</HI> or else declare them void: but since they neither did the one nor the other, it is plain it was because even they themselves looked upon it as altogether needless.</Q></P>
<P>Nor is your reason at all satisfactory, why a King <HI>de facto</HI> cannot be intended by the Statute of the 25th of <HI>Edward</HI> the IIId, because that maketh it Trea∣son to Conspire the death of the King's Eldest Son and Heir, which say you can only be meant of the Eldest Son of a King <HI>de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which is to beg the question; for though it is true, this Clause in the Act was intended for the preservation of the King's Eldest Son, yet it doth no where determine that this must be the Eldest Son of a King <HI>de jure</HI>; for though I own this Clause was made to pre∣serve the Crown in the Right Line from Father to Son, yet does it make no difference between the Son and Heir of a King <HI>de facto,</HI> and one <HI>de jure</HI>; nor have you yet answer'd the Authorities I have brought from the Acts of attainder of those Lords, who Conspired against the three Kings of the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> which stand unreversed unto this day: and which also confirm the Opinion gi∣ven in <HI>Bagot</HI>'s Case, where it is said expresly, that a Man may be arraigned for Treason committed against the King <HI>de facto,</HI> by the King <HI>de jure</HI>; and therefore I think my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> may very well be justified in his Opinion, notwithstand∣ing the question you put, whether the Statute could mean him who is lawful and rightful King, or any other who gets into the possession of the Throne? Now this seems to me no such odd question; for when the Law only mentions the King, and the Law-Makers certainly knew that Kings without an hereditary right had often ascended the Throne, if they had intended to except all such Usurpers, they should have expresly said so. But indeed that distinction of a King <HI>de facto,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>C. A.</HI> p. 56.</NOTE> and a King <HI>de jure,</HI> was not known 'till many years after, being first heard of in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth; for a King <HI>de facto</HI> (as the late Chief Justice rightly as∣serts) is <HI>Seignior Le Roy,</HI> within that Statute, and there is no other King but he whilst he continues so. For King signifies that person who has the Supream Govern∣ment in the Nation; and a King <HI>de jure,</HI> is he who should have the Govern∣ment, but has it not; that is, who of right should be King, but is not; and the Statute of Treason tells us what is Treason against him who is King, not against him who should be, but is not King; and reason good it should be so; for it is not meerly a legal Title by descent,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. L. R.</HI></NOTE> but a legal investi∣tute, and recognition by Parliament that makes a legal King, or a King in Law, as it makes a legal Magistrate; and then all Kings <HI>de facto,</HI> who are placed in the Throne by a Legal Authority, and with all Legal and acusto∣med Ceremonies, are legal Kings, and as such, may require a legal Allegiance:
<PB N="914" REF="494"/>
so that all those hard words in the Statute of the first of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth, that call those Kings of the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> Kings in Deed, and not of Right or pretended Kings, mean no more than this, that they were Kings for the time being, and according to the Laws which had made them so, though not according to that hereditary Right of Succession which those Statutes require: If you have any thing to reply to this, tell me, or else I will proceed to answer your two other Arguments.</P>

<P>I will not at present say more to this than I have done, and therefore you may proceed if you please.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your two next Arguments are from the attainders of <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId, and his principle Assistants which were by Act of Parliament, as to that Prince him∣self, as also his adherents, the attainders of Kings <HI>de facto,</HI> and their Assistants in after Parliaments, do not prove that Subjects cannot be guilty of Treason a∣gainst a King in possession; nor does the Statute of Treason relate to a King <HI>de jure</HI> only, for that Statute was not made to secure Princes Titles, but the quiet of their Government whilst they sate upon the Throne; for though a King, if he be an Usurper, when ever the Rightful King regains the Possession of his Throne, if he were a Subject before, may be attainted of Treason for his Usurpation, as was <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId, for Treason against his own Nephew King <HI>Edward</HI> the Vth; yet this does no way prove that <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId was no true King during his Usurpation; but only shews the Parliaments abhorrence of his Treason, and to deterr others from falling into the like, attainted him, and several of his Accomplices who had assisted him in his said Usurpation; for that they were not barely attainted for defending King <HI>Richard</HI>'s Title, appears from this, that the Earl of <HI>Surrey</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and divers other Noblemen and Gentlemen who fought for King <HI>Richard</HI> at <HI>Bosworth</HI>-Field were never attainted at all.
<Q>But as for the Pardon that you say passed in that Parlia∣ment of the 1<HI>st</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, you are very much mistaken in the pur∣port of it; for if you please to look upon it again, you will find, that it was not a General Pardon for the Common People who had fought on the behalf of <HI>Richard</HI> the Third,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> 1 Hen. VII. <HI>Cap.</HI> 6.</NOTE> but of all those who had come over with <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth himself, or who were with him in the Field against <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, for all manner of Murthers, Spoils and Trespasses committed by them, in taking part with King <HI>Henry</HI> against his Enemies; so that you see the assisting of a King <HI>de facto</HI> was not only justifiable, but those that had fought against him, thought themselves not safe till they had their Pardons.</Q></P>
<P>Nay, farther, that Attainders passed in Parliament, are no proof that the Princes against whom they were passed were not lawful Kings, appears from hence; that when <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth was driven out of the Kingdom and dis∣possessed of the Throne, the next Parliament under <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, passed an Act of Attainder against him, and his Adherents. But as for the Attainder of <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, you are very much mistaken to suppose, that it was for any Treason committed against <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, but it was for breach of the agreement made with his Father the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and in making War again upon him; for had he not done this, he had continued lawful King during his life, by the Duke of <HI>Yorks</HI> own consent; for in the Parliament Roll you your
<PB N="915" REF="494"/>
self have already cited, it is thus expressed;
<Q>That consider∣ing the possession of the said King <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Parl.</HI> Edw. IV. 39 Hen. VI. <HI>n.</HI> 18.</NOTE> and that he had before this time been named, taken, and reputed King of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and Lord of <HI>Ireland</HI>; the said Duke is content, agreeth and consenteth, that he be had, re∣puted and taken for King of <HI>England,</HI> and of <HI>France,</HI> with the Royal Estate, Dignity and Preheminence belonging thereto, and Lord of <HI>Ireland,</HI> during his life natural; and for that time, the said Duke, without hurt or prejudice of his said Right and Title, shall take, worship and honour him for his Sovereign Lord:</Q>
So that you see that by the Judgement of the Parliament, and by the express consent of the Right Heir of the Crown, a King <HI>de facto</HI> was to be own'd by this Right Heir for his true and lawful Sovereign, and therefore could not be attainted for detaining the Crown from him, or his Son.</P>

<P>I will not dispute this point any further; but yet methinks though Trea∣son might be comitted against the King <HI>de facto,</HI> whilst he continues King; yet this is not for any Allegiance due to him, but because such Treason being against the due order of Government, and the common peace of the Nation, such actions are therefore Treason from the presumed or tacit consent of the King <HI>de jure.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant indeed, that such Acts are against the Order of Government,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>C. A.</HI> p. 58, 59.</NOTE> and very destructive to it, which is the only rea∣son why they are made Treason by Law; and this is as good a rea∣son why the Law should make them Treason against a King <HI>de facto,</HI> as against a King <HI>de jure,</HI> for they ere equally against the order of Government, and de∣structive to it, whoever is King; and that is the only reason why they made it Treason at all. Now this presumed or tacit consent of the King <HI>de jure</HI> is a very pretty notion, and serves you for a great many good turns, it makes Laws, and it makes Treason, and gives Authority to the unauthoritative Acts of a King <HI>de facto</HI>; that is to say (or you say nothing) that the presumed consent of a King <HI>de jure,</HI> invests the King <HI>de facto</HI> at the time with his Authority; for if he have no Authority of his own, unless what the presumed consent of the King <HI>de jure</HI> give him, that cannot make any Treasonable Act done against him to be Trea∣son; for it cannot alter the nature of things, nor make a Man guilty of Trea∣son against any person to whom he ows no duty of Allegiance. And if the presumed consent of the King <HI>de jure</HI> can invest the King <HI>de facto</HI> with his Au∣thority, it must transfer the Allegiance of the Subjects too; and then Subjects are as safe in Conscience, as if the King <HI>de jure</HI> were on the Throne; for it seems there is his Authority and tacit consent, though not his person.</P>
<P>But indeed, this is all meer trifling, the King <HI>de facto</HI> has Authority, or else none of his Acts of Government can have any; for that which is done by a person who has no Authority, can lay no obligation upon us; whence then has he this Authority, since he has no legal Right to the Throne? not sure from the presumed consent of the King <HI>de jure,</HI> which is nonsence to suppose, but from the possession of the Throne, to which the Law it self, as well as the Principles of Reason, have annexed the Authority of the Government.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am so far of Bishop <HI>Sanderson</HI>'s Opinion in his Case, concerning ta∣king the Engagement, that when Usurpers or Kings <HI>de facto</HI> have taken upon
<PB N="916" REF="495"/>
them the Government, they are obliged to administer it for the common good, and safety of the People; and as far as that comes to we are also obli∣ged to live peaceable under them, and to yield obedience to them in things ab∣solutely necessary for the upholding civil Society within the Realm, such as are the defence of the Nation against Foreigners, the furtherance of publick Justice, the maintenance of Trade and Commerce, and the like. But sure this is no ar∣gument for transferring our Allegiance from the lawful King and his Heirs whilst they are alive; and therefore I must still suppose that this Statute of the 11th of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth can do no service to the present Government, because its vertually repeal'd by several Statutes; as first, by the 28th of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth, concerning the Succession of the Crown, wherein it is expresly provi∣ded, that if any of his Children should Usurp upon each other, or if any of those to whom he should bequeath the Crown by his last Will, or Letters Pa∣tents, should take the Crown in any other manner than what should be thereby limited, that such Children or others should be guilty of Treason for so doing. Now it is plain such Treason must only have been committed against the right Heir, and consequently the person so taking the Crown, was not to be looked upon as King <HI>de facto.</HI> It is also vertually repealed by the Statute of 1<SUP>o</SUP> <HI>E∣lizabeth,</HI> by which we are obliged to swear to be true to the Queen, her Heirs, and Lawful Successors; (<HI>i. e.</HI> those who have a right to the Crown by proxi∣mity of Blood) as also by the Oath of Supremacy, Enacted in the 4th of King <HI>Iames,</HI> by which we are likewise sworn to bear true Allegiance to his Majesty, his Heirs, and Successors; from which Oaths I argue, first, that if we are sworn by Act of Parliament to pay Allegiance to the Heirs of a King <HI>de fure,</HI> who ne∣ver were in possession, than a <HI>fortiori</HI> to a King <HI>de jure</HI>; who besides the le∣gality of his Title, had been actually recognized as Sovereign, and enjoy'd an uncontested administration of the Regal Power. Secondly, If our Laws o∣blige us to swear subjection to the Heirs <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of a Rightful Prince, than by unde∣niable consequence we are bound not to translate our Allegiance to those who are unjustly set up by the People; for without all question the words Heirs and Lawful Successors, were made use of on purpose to secure the hereditary Rights of the Monarchy, and to prevent all Usurpations upon the direct Line. And since by vertue of that Statute which framed the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy, we are not to acknowledge any pretended Governours to the pre∣judice or disinherison of the Heirs of the King <HI>de jure,</HI> then most certainly we ought not to do this in opposition to the King <HI>de jure</HI> himself; so that now we can have no pretence to make Right the necessary consequence of meer pos∣session of the Crown, any more than in private Estates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, I agree with you in what you have said, that Kings <HI>de facto</HI> are to be obeyed in all things tending to the publick good of Society; but then it will also follow, that Allegiance is due to them, from that great Law of prosecuting the same publick good, since it were much better that Kings <HI>de jure</HI> should lose their Right, than that a Nation should be involved in a long and cruel War to the weakning and impoverishing thereof, and to the destruction of so many thousands of ordinary as well as Noble Families; as was seen in the long Civil Wars between the Families of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and <HI>York</HI>; so that I cannot but think it would have been much better for this Nation, if that Family had
<PB N="917" REF="495"/>
continued to Govern us unto this day, rather than that <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth should have obtained the Crown with so great a destruction of the People of this Na∣tion, and so great cruelty as was then exercised upon King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth, and the Prince his Son, as you may read in the History of those times.</P>
<P>But I come now to answer the rest of your Arguments, whereby you will prove this Statute of the 11th of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth to be vertually repeal'd; and here by the way I must tell you, Gentlemen of this Opinion, that I cannot but admire your wondrous sagacity, in discovering this Act to be repeal'd, when my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> and all the rest of our Lawyers do still suppose it to be in force; but indeed, the reason you give for it is not urged like a Common Lawyer, and therefore I think it will signifie little; for though I grant that an Act of Parliament may be vertually repeal'd by a subsequent Act, yet it is only in such Cases where they are absolutely contradictory, and inconsistent with each o∣ther; but if they are not so, an Act of Parliament can never be said to be ver∣tually repeal'd: and therefore I shall now show you, that notwithstanding the Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth, and the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance you have now mention'd, this Statute may very well continue in force, and unre∣peal'd. First, as to the Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, whereby it was declar'd Treason for any one of his Children, upon whom the Crown was setled, to Usurp upon each other; yet that part of the Statute which makes this Treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sess.</HI></NOTE> was repeal'd by the first of <HI>Edward</HI> the the Sixth, and by the first of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; or admit it had not been so,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 12.</NOTE> yet this Clause in the Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth would haue been absolutely void in it self against any such Usurper when actually possessed of the Crown, since it was held by all the Judges in the Case of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, who at the time of his coming into <HI>England</HI> stood attainted by Act of Parliament, that this attainder need not be reversed, since Possession of the Crown takes away all precedent defects.</P>
<P>But as to the Statutes of the first of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and the fourth of King <HI>Iames,</HI> by which the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy were Enacted; I con∣ceive neither of these Oaths can amount to a vertual repeal of this Act, for though I grant one end of these Oaths may be to secure the right of the King or Queens Heirs by lineal descent, yet it will not therefore follow, that a King <HI>de facto,</HI> or for the time being may not be legally defended in the Throne; for as for that part of the Oath which was taken to King <HI>Iames</HI> himself, it can hold no longer than whilst he continued King: If therefore the Estates of the Kingdom have adjudged him to have forfeited or abdicated the Crown, the whole Nation ought to take this as to have been legally done, since it was done by the judgment of the highest Authority in the Nation, when King <HI>Iames</HI> had deserted the Throne; the like I may also say for the other part of the Oath of Allegiance, whereby we are obliged to his Heirs and Lawful Successors, for since there has been a dispute concerning the succession of the Crown between the Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> and your Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> if the Convention who are the sole proper Judges in this Case, have thought fit for the reasons I have already given you at our last Meeting, to declare King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> the lawful King and Queen of <HI>England,</HI> all the Nation ought to accept them for
<PB N="918" REF="496"/>
such, since it was done by the highest Authority at that time extant in the Na∣tion, and the only proper Judges of that right; and if disputes about legal rights (of which certainly that of succeeding to the Crown is of the highest impor∣tance) ought to be decided by Law, and not by the Sword, (which is not the decision of civil Authority but of force) the sentence of competent Judges must end the dispute;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E.L.R.</HI> p. 8, 9.</NOTE> and if the Estates of the Realm be not the proper and legal Judges of such Disputes that concern the right to the Crown, there can be none; and if they be, Subjects must acquiesce in their Judgments, or it is all one as if there had been none; for if Men may pretend Conscience, and adhere to their own private Opinions as sole Judges, the dispute must end in blows, which is contrary to the reason and nature of humane Societies, which were instituted to prevent Civil Wars, and to end all Controversies by a legal Judgment without the Sword.</P>
<P>And to let you see farther, that as to the Allegiance of the Subjects it is all one in respect of us who are Subjects, whether the Convention have judged right or wrong in this case. Let us suppose a Person who has only a pretence, but no true right to an Estate, should commence a Suit of Law for it, and at last obtaine a Verdict of the Jury, and also a Judgment of the Court of Kings-Bench for his Title; can any Man deny, but that the Sheriff is by vertue of this Verdict and Judgment oblig'd to put this Abator into possession of this Estate, notwith∣standing he may know of his own knowledge, that the person who has obtain'd this Judgment has no true right to the Estate, or will any Lawyer doubt whe∣ther all the Tenants of the Mannour are not oblig'd to swear homage and fealty to this suppos'd Lord if they are required by him so to do. Now though the true Heir or owner has the legal right to the Estate, yet by the supream Law of all Societies, which refers the decision of all personal rights to a legal Autho∣thority; he who by a legal judgment is possessed of it, has the legal right in the Estate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 19, 20.</NOTE> against all other claims, and legal Au∣thority must desend him in it; and all who will submit to Laws and Legal Authority, must acquiesce in it.</P>
<P>And thus it must be with respect to the Rights of Princes, as well as of Sub∣jects, the right to the Crown has been often disputed, as we all know, and to say that when such disputes happen, there is no Authority in the Nation to de∣cide them, is to say that Princes have no rights to their Crowns by the Laws of that Nation; for there can be no Civil Rights of which there neither are nor can be any Civil Judges; for no man, no not a Prince can be judge in his own Cause, and if Princes have no legal rights, they can lose no legal rights when they lose their Crowns; and I doubt their natural rights swill affect the Consciences of very few Subjects: Therefore every independent Civil Society which is not wholly governed by the Sword, must from the nature of such Societies, and the reason of their institution, have authority within it self to decide all Contro∣versies which may arise about the rights of every member of that Society, and to preserve it self from falling into a state of War, which is a dissolution of all Civil Government; and if there ought to be such an Authority in every Civi∣lized Nation, when this Supream Authority has given sentence in such Disputes, this must also determine all the Subjects, and ought likewise to have the same effect upon the contending Princes themselves, and no right, or pretence of
<PB N="919" REF="496"/>
right ought to affect the Conscience after such a final Judgment; unless Civil Rights can oblige Subjects to dissolve Civil Governments, and to dispute Civil Rights, not by the Law, but by the Sword; which is to overthrow all Civil Rights, and put an end to the Authority of Laws.</P>
<P>I hope this may serve to shew you how much you are mistaken to suppose that there can be no King in an hereditary Monarchy, but the next lineal Heir; and tho' I grant no Allegiance can be due or ought to be paid to him who is no King; yet will it not follow that none can be due to any Prince if he be not the next heir; for that no obedience can be due to him who is no King I readily grant, but yet he may be a legal King in this Kingdom who is not the next Heir by blood, as almost half of the Kings of <HI>England</HI> since the Con∣quest were not, and yet have been always own'd and obey'd as legal Kings.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess what you say would go a great way to satisfie me, could you prove, that there was no difference between the succession to Crowns and private inheritances, where I grant that the judgement of the Supream Court of the Nation is to determine not only the pos∣session, but the right too, in respect of the person who loses his Estate by an unjust verdict, or illegal judgment; whereas it is otherwise in the Ti∣tle of Crowns, to which Princes have a right, as well by the Laws of God and Nature, as also by the receiv'd setled Laws and Customs of the Kingdom concerning the Succession by descent, which is call'd in the 13th of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in the Statute (we have so much debated at our last Meeting) the Common Laws of this Realm, and it is there declared, that it ought to direct the right of the Crown of <HI>England</HI>; and it is there made Treason during the Queens life to affirm the contrary; and this course of lineal Succession at Com∣mon Law was also declar'd by solemn judgment in Parliament, in the case (I have so often urg'd of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Title to the Crown against <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth,) that it could no way be defeated by Act of Parliament; and therefore I must still tell you, that you go upon a wrong ground, when you suppose that there can be now any dispute who is rightful King of <HI>England,</HI> since I have often told you, that he can neither abdicate or forfeit his Right to the Crown, and that no Parliament whatever (much less a Convention) could have any power to declare he had abdicated the Government, and that thereby the Throne was become vacant; for though I grant the judgement of the Estates of the Kingdom when legally assembled, ought to be received with great sub∣mission and respect; yet must it be only in such matters which they have a legal cognizance of, and which they are impower'd by the Laws and Consti∣tutions of the Kingdom to determine; but since their Voting him whom you your self cannot deny to have been their lawful King, to have abdicated the Throne (when indeed he had not) and then not only to declare the Throne vacant, but also to place those therein, whom you your self dare not affirm to be the next Heirs by blood, are things quite out of their Element, and beyond the Sphere of their Authority; and though I grant that they may sometimes judge concerning the Succession of the Crown, and who is next heir to it, yet is this only to be understood as far as they judge according to the Common Laws of the Succession already laid down at our last Meeting, and not when
<PB N="920" REF="497"/>
they go quite contrary to them; and therefore, though I own the Parliament might justly declare <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth to be an Usurper, and consequently might be deposed, yet doth it not therefore follow, that they had a like right to declare <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth an Usurper, and to pass an Act of Attainder against him, as I confess they did after that Prince had held the Crown for ten years together, since that was beyond their power to enact or declare by the fundamental con∣stitution of the Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry your answer can afford nothing new but only the repetitions of the same false Principles and Arguments that have been already so often an∣swered in our former Conversations; for in the first place I have sufficiently proved that neither the Laws of God nor Nature have ordain'd any such thing as a lineal Succession of Kings, or any irresistible or unforfeitable power in them which they can never fall from let them act never so tyrannically; for I think I have sufficiently prov'd, that not only in absolute Monarchies, but also in limi∣ted Kingdoms, where the King has not the sole Supream power, a King may not only be resisted, but may be also declar'd to have abdicated or forfeited his right to Govern in case of any apparent obstinate violations of the fundamen∣tal Constitution in those great points that make that Government to differ from a despotick Monarchy, and that if they had not this right, all their liberties will signifie nothing, and their Lives, Liberties, and Estates, would lie wholly at the Kings mercy, to be invaded and taken away when ever he pleas'd. I am forced to repeat this, to remind you of the Reasons upon which those Principles are founded, and therefore you do but fall into your old mistake, when you affirm, that by the fundamental constitution of the Government, the Great Council of the Nation (which was but the same with our late Convention) had no power to declare the King to have broken the Original Contract between him and his People.</P>
<P>Therefore what you say concerning the want of Authority in this Great Council, to declare the Throne vacant is altogether precarious, unless you could also prove that it is against the fundamental constitution so to do: whereas I have so far proved the contrary, that the Throne has been declared vacant no less than eight times since the Conquest, which makes up almost a third part of the Successions of all the Kings and Queens that have Reigned since that time; so that if the custom and practice of Great Councils or Conventions (and those not condemn'd by any subsequent Statutes) can be the only Rule or Guide for the Consciences of all the Subjects of this Nation, we have certainly had that as solemnly declar'd now, as in any other Great Council or Convention that has been ever held in this Kingdom; but as to what you say concerning the want of power in those Councils, to declare or recognize who are the right Heirs to the Crown, but not to make them so, is very pleasant: since that were all one as if two Men who contended for an Estate, should bring the matter before the House of Peers, and when that was done, and the Case solemnly heard by Council on both sides, that party who had lost the Cause, should declare that this Court (tho' the highest in the Kingdom) had no power to judge in preju∣dice of himself, who had an undoubted right to the Estate, which were only to give the Lords power to give judgment only for one side; and why the other Party if the judgment had been given against him should not have made the
<PB N="921" REF="497"/>
like Plea, I cannot understand: So that such a Judgement would be altogether in vain.</P>
<P>Therefore to apply this to our purpose, though the Parliament being pre∣vail'd upon by the strength and faction of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> did as I granted (at our last Meeting) declare <HI>that his Title could in no wise be defeated,</HI> yet <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth being then in the Throne, they might have certainly given a contra∣ry judgement if they had pleased, and then I suppose the Title of the House of <HI>York</HI> might have been so defeated as that the Nation had never been trou∣bled with it again; and so also, when by the power of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth, a Parliament met, and declared him to be lawful King from the time of his Fa∣thers death; yet when the said King was driven out of the Kingdom by the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth restored to the Throne, a Parli∣ament was summon'd in the 49th of this King, wherein <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the IVth was declared an Usurper,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Claus</HI> 49. H. VI. <HI>m.</HI> 6.</NOTE> and himself attainted and to which Parliament the Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> Brother to King <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth is first Summoned, as well as the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> with all the other Bishops, Temporal Lords, and Judges, (of whom <HI>Littleton</HI> the Authour of the Book of Tenures was one) so likewise upon King <HI>Edwards</HI> recovery of the Crown the year following,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. Claus.</HI> 11 Ed. IV. <HI>m.</HI> 1</NOTE> King <HI>Henry</HI> was again deposed, and a Par∣liament called, wherein all the Dukes, Earls, and Barons, with the Arch-Bishops of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> and most of the rest of the Bishops Swore to Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> after called <HI>Edward</HI> the Vth, as Right Heir of the Crown.</P>
<P>Now I desire to know what other Law or Rule there was then for the Sub∣jects Allegiance, but the solemn judgement or declaration of the Estates of the Kingdom assembled in Parliament, since their Acts and Judgements were in this dispute directly contradictory to each other; so that it is evident from the constant practice of those times, that the King <HI>de facto</HI> was always own'd as Lawful Sovereign, and had Allegiance still paid him by all the People of this Kingdom, except those who being the heads of one or the other Party were either attainted, or else forced to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lye the Kingdom.</P>
<P>But as for all others, though different and contrary Oaths of Allegiance were impos'd upon the People, sometimes by the one, and sometimes by the other of those Kings, according as they got possession of the Throne; yet I can no where find, that ever any body suffer'd for barely swearing Allegiance to the King <HI>then in Being,</HI> for it was always taken for Law, that Allegiance was due to the King <HI>de facto,</HI> since ordinary Subjects are not suppos'd to understand the legal right or justice of the Kings Title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must still say that there was some colour for the Peoples thus acting (as you say they did) during the contest for the Crown between the two Fa∣milies of <HI>Yorke</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> when I grant it was somewhat a difficult mat∣ter to judge which of the two had the best right to the Crown, by reason that the House of <HI>Lancaster</HI> had held it for three descents, as also from the specious∣ness of their Title, since it was founded upon a pretended claim by right of blood, upon supposing that <HI>Edmund,</HI> Sirnamed Cronch-back (who was one of the Ancestors of this House of <HI>Lancaster</HI>) was the Eldest Son to <HI>Henry</HI> the
<PB N="922" REF="498"/>
Third, which had it been true, would have given <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth a good right to the Crown, not only against <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, but his own Grand∣father <HI>Edward</HI> the Third likewise (had he been then alive;) and this descent falling out long before the memory of any man then living who could confute the falsity of this pretended Pedigree. The People of <HI>England</HI> might very well be excus'd for owning an Usurper, and paying Allegiance to him, since they did not know but his claim might have been right, especially since it was approv'd of in full Parliament without any contradiction, as I have already shewn you at our last Meeting.</P>
<P>But what is all this to the matter now in debate between us, when the Li∣neal Succession of the Crown has been so often declared to be the only means of acquiring a just Title to it; and every one knows very well who was own'd for lawful King of <HI>England</HI> within these three Months, and also who was pray'd for in all our Churches as his Son and Heir apparent; and therefore I must still tell you, that your parallel between those Kings <HI>de facto</HI> of the House of <HI>Lanca∣ster,</HI> and those Princes whom the Convention have now voted to fill the Throne does not at all agree, since every Subject of this Kingdom who has but sence enough to go to Market, can very well tell (if they will deal sincerely) to whom their Allegiance is due.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to what you have now said, it is no more than a repetition of what you have already urged to evade the force of these clear Authorities; but in∣deed it was all one when a Prince had been once recognized for Lawful King by Act of Parliament, whether the People knew his Title not to be good by right of blood or not. And this I have plainly proved to you from the instance of <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, who though both his Elder Brothers Children were then alive, and the Eldest of them had been Proclaim'd King, and also own'd for such by himself, and whose Title he had also sworn to maintain in his Brother King <HI>Edwards</HI> life time, as appears by the Clause Roll of the 11th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth; yet when he had once depos'd him, and had call'd a Parliament which recognized his Title, his Acts and Judicial Proceedings stand good at this day; and though he himself was attained, and declar'd a Tyrant and an Usurper,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mem.</HI> 1.</NOTE> yet all the Subjects who acted under his Authority, and had taken an Oath of Allegiance to him, never needed an Act of Indemnity for so doing; whereas those that came over with <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth were sain to have an Act of Pardon past to Indemnifie them for fighting against <HI>Richard</HI> the Third (as I have now show'd you.) And though this Parliament of the first of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh agreed to repeal divers Acts which the King found fault with; yet as for all other Statutes made in the Reign of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Third (which have not been since repealed) they are still in force without any confirmation; likewise when <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh had prevail'd over <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, and that he was slain in the Field, though all the Nation very well knew that <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh could not be Heir of the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> because his Mother was then alive, and had never formally given up her right, if she had any, as certainly she could have none, as being descended from <HI>Iohn</HI> Earl of <HI>Somerset,</HI> who was base Son to <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> by <HI>Catherine Swinford,</HI> whilst his Wife was alive; and though I grant after his Marriage with the said <HI>Catherine,</HI> the Children born of that Bed
<PB N="923" REF="498"/>
were made legitimate by Act of Parliament in the 20th of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, yet that legitimation only respects such private Priviledges and Inheritances which they might enjoy or succeed to as Subjects, and not in respect of the Crown; the Succession of which they were expresly declared uncapable of by that very Act of Legitimation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. <HI>the Act Printed at large in</HI> Bucks <HI>Hist∣ory of</HI> Richard <HI>the</HI> IIId.</NOTE> still to be seen upon the Parliament Roll. But for all this, when <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh had called a Parliament, and was therein recogniz'd for their Lawful Sovereign, and that the Crown was setled by Statute on the King, and Heirs of his Body (without any mention of the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who ought to have been Queen by right of blood) yet none of the Subjects of this Kingdom (as I can find) ever scrupled to swear Allegiance to him, before ever he married that Princess; though they as well knew that he could have no right by blood as you can suppose, that the People at this day can know whether King <HI>Iames</HI> has abdicated or forfeited the Crown or not, or whether your Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> be his true and lawful Son; for since they are both nice and difficult Points, and having been determined by the Convention, the Supream Judges in this Case, in favour of their present Majesties, and that they also recognized their Title after they became a Parliament; I can see no manner of reason why all the Subjects of this Kingdom may not as well justifie their taking this new Oath of Allegi∣ance to them, notwithstanding their former Oath of Allegiance to King <HI>Iames,</HI> and his Right Heirs, as well as the People of <HI>England</HI> could justifie their taking an Oath of Allegiance to <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, notwithstanding their former Oath to <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, and his Right Heirs, before ever <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh had Married the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Heiress of the Crown; especially since this Act of the 11th of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh (which we are now disputing about) was made expresly to secure and indemnitie all those who should attend upon the King for the time being, and do him true and faithful service of Allegiance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And therefore it lies upon you still to prove, that this Statute is either expi∣red, or else void in it self; otherwise (besides the constant practice of former times) we have here an express Act of Parliament declaring it every Mans duty to pay Allegiance to the King for the time being, and then certainly he is as much oblig'd to Swear it too.</P>

<P><Q>I doubt not but I shall prove to you that this Statute ex∣pired with <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A.</HI> 11. H. 7. p. 5.6</NOTE> from a Clause in the Act it self; for if you please to read immediately after those words you have now cited, that all those who do the King for the time being true and lawful Allegiance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> [it follows thus] shall be secured from all man∣ner of forfeitures and molestations relating to their Persons or Estates (<HI>but mark</HI>) provided always that no person or persons shall take any benefit or ad∣vantage by this Act, which shall hereafter decline from his or their said Al∣legiance: now we know a proviso is an exception or restraint upon the lati∣tude and comprehensiveness of the Law, and that all Statutes are perfectly null so far as the proviso reaches.</Q>
Having premised this, I shall endeavour to prove that this Act was design'd only for the security of that Reign in which it was made, and cannot be stretched any farther. To make this appear, let us now suppose a competition between the King <HI>de jure,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh (that
<PB N="924" REF="499"/>
is one <HI>de facto</HI>) and that the Subject engages for the latter; in this case if the King <HI>de facto</HI> prevail, there is no need of the assistance of this Statute; for we cannot imagine any Prince could be so impolitick as to punish those who have ventur'd their All to maintain him in his Government; this besides the ingra∣titude of the action, would proclaim the injustice of his Cause, and would serve only to ruine his interest.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding this objection, you have now made, I doubt not but this Clause will bear a very fair and legal interpretation, and that not in re∣spect of the Allegiance that might be due to the King <HI>de facto,</HI> but to the King <HI>de jure</HI>; since if it were not for the indemnity provided by this Statute, the King <HI>de facto</HI> would have been oblig'd to have punished them for opposing their lawful Prince.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is easily answer'd, for pray do Kings <HI>de facto</HI> always perform that which the Law requires; if so, they never would have been Kings <HI>de facto,</HI> since they could not make themselves Masters of the Sovereign power with∣out dispossessing those who are supposed the right owners of it. Secondly, the possessour would not so much as seem oblig'd to punish his adherents upon a competition, except he own'd himself to be no more than an unjust Usurper, but we have neither example nor reason to expect such singular concessions as these, for no Usurper will own himself in the wrong, so long as he intends to enjoy the advantages of his injustice: upon supposition therefore, that the Victory had fallen on the side of a King <HI>de facto,</HI> the Act would be wholly superfluous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why may we not also suppose that this Clause was inserted, not only to secure those who had assisted the King <HI>de facto</HI> against your King <HI>de jure,</HI> but also to debar all those who had fallen from their Allegiance to the King <HI>de facto,</HI> from receiving any benefit by this Act if ever they should plead it in their own justification, after the King <HI>de jure</HI> had prevail'd, and was again set∣led in the Throne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may take it in this sence if you please, but if you do, it will not at all mend the matter, for tho' those that stood by the King <HI>de facto,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 6.</NOTE> will have great occasion for an Act of Indem∣nity, yet this Act will be as helpless to them now, as it was needless before; for either they must submit to the King <HI>de jure</HI> or not; if they do not submit, it's easie to imagine the Consequences, how a Victorious and irresistible Prince will treat the obstinate and rebellious opposers of his just Title if they do submit (as of necessity they must) then they can claim no manner of priviledge and indemnity from this Act; for they cannot come into the Party of the King <HI>de jure,</HI> without deserting that <HI>de facto; i. e.</HI> without declining their Allegiance to him, who was King when this Statute was made; by declining which Allegiance, the proviso expresly excludes them from all manner of benefit or advantage by this Act. In this condition the Law would have left the <HI>de facto</HI> Party, if the Sovereignty had been disputed be∣tween <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, and the House of <HI>York</HI>; and that the Prince <HI>de jure</HI> of the House of <HI>York</HI> had been successful: from whence it's undeniably plain, that neither the design nor words of this Statute can be drawn to such a mon∣strous construction as to enact bare possession to be a good Title, and make
<PB N="925" REF="499"/>
Might and Right the same thing. The only design of this Parliament was to continue the Crown to <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh during his life; which both by the body and proviso of the Act was effectually done as in them lay, for divers rea∣sons that might then prevail with the two Houses to consent to a temporary alteration of the Succession to the Crown, such as these, that though <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh had no just Title in his own right, yet in the right of his Wife he had, which he did no way disavow by this Act; and you must also remem∣ber that at this time <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth had several Children by his Queen, <HI>viz.</HI> Prince <HI>Arthur, Henry,</HI> &amp;c. So that now the contending Families of <HI>Yorke</HI> and <HI>Lancaster</HI> being thus hapily united, there was no reason to sear, that a security (though an unusual one) to the present possessor, could be prejudicial to the right Line, especially since the force of that Act was confined to the Reign of that Prince, as has been already proved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may fancy if you please, that you have prov'd this Act to be ex∣pired, but I think if you better consider of it, you will find your self mista∣ken, for though I may very well suppose that the King and Parliament to de∣ter men from falling from their Allegiance to the King for the time being, might insert this Clause upon a supposition that the next King whoever he was, whether by right of blood, or only <HI>de facto,</HI> would out of a generous a∣version to Traytors and Deserters hinder them by vertue of this Clause, from enjoying any benefit by this Act; yet I shall not longer insist upon't, whether it be insignificant or not, and therefore will at present grant it to be so, but what then? Will a void Clause vitiate or render expir'd an Act of Parliament which is made indefinitely, without fixing it to any time, or person? the words in the Act are, the King for the time being; which must certainly ex∣tend to any other King as well as <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth; for I suppose that an Act of Parliament, and a Deed agreed in this, that an unnecessary Clause can by no means render the whole void.</P>
<P>But as for what you say in relation to this Acts being a security for the Title of the Queen, and her Children (whom you suppose to be the right Heirs of the Crown) this rather serves to strengthen the Act than otherwise; for if this King had a good Title in her right, then it may be also very well suppos'd that she gave her assent to this Act in the person of her Husband, and that not for the benefit, but to the prejudice of her own Issue, since if after her death (which happen'd some years before his) her Son <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> had set up his present Title to the Crown in the right of his Mother, and so would have dethron'd his Father as an Usurper; I suppose no reasonable Man will deny but that this Act would have indemnified all those who had taken up Arms in defence of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth against his Son, though (in your sence) King <HI>de jure</HI>; and if it would justifie the Subjects then, I cannot see why it may not do the same thing now in their swearing Allegiance, nay, fighting for the King in possession, against him whom we will for the present suppose to be King <HI>de jure.</HI></P>

<P>Well, however I think I can prove that this Act was no more than tem∣porary from the judgement of the Judges in the Case of <HI>Iohn</HI> Duke of <HI>Northumberland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A.</HI> 11. H. 7. p. 56.</NOTE> who when he was Tryed for Treason, for leading an Army against Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> to settle the Lady
<PB N="926" REF="500"/>
<HI>Iane Gray</HI> in the Throne, desired to be informed by the Judges, whether a man acting by the Authority of the Great Seal, and the Order of the Privy Council (or Princes Council, as <HI>Stow</HI> and <HI>Heylin</HI> word it) could become there∣by guilty of Treason; to which, all the Judges answer'd, that the Great Seal of one that was not lawful Queen, could give no Authority or Indemnity to those that acted by such a Warrant, upon which the Duke submitted; though without question he did not want Lawyers to inforce his Plea with this Statute likewise, if his cause would have born it; from whence I infer against Sir <HI>Edward Coke,</HI> that Treason lies against a King <HI>de jure,</HI> tho' out of possession; for it's plain by all our Historians, that Queen <HI>Mary</HI> was so far from being possessed of the Crown when the Duke of <HI>Northumberland</HI> acted a∣gainst her, that the Lady <HI>Iane</HI> was not only Proclaimed Queen in <HI>London,</HI> and most of all the Cities and Great Towns in <HI>England,</HI> but the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> with all the Forts and Naval Forces were under her Command; and she had also Allegiance sworn to her by the Privy-Council, and by the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen, and she had also the Seals in her power, by which all Patents and Commissions were granted and issued in her Name; and if all this be not sufficient to constitute her Queen <HI>de facto</HI> according to this Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, I know not what was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet I can tell you what was yet wanting, which because she had not, she was certainly neither Queen <HI>de jure,</HI> nor <HI>de facto,</HI> and that was a solemn Coronation, and Recognition of her Right by Parliament; which legal investiture since she never had, she was not the Queen for the time being, and consequently not intended within this Statute of the 11th of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth; for though it is true, she was appointed Successour of the Crown-by the Letters Patents of King <HI>Edward</HI> the VIth, yet since she could not claim by right of blood, there being so many before her, all the Kingdom looked upon it as an Usur∣pation, and an artifice of the Duke of <HI>Northumberland</HI> (whose Son she had Mar∣ried) to get the Government of the Kingdom into his sole power: so that it was no wonder if the greater part of the People were so averse to her Title, and that those of the Nobility who took her part, so quickly revolted from her, when once the fear they were in of the Duke of <HI>Northumberland</HI>'s power was re∣moved; for had this Bequest of the Crown to the Lady <HI>Iane</HI> held good, this King∣dom instead of being Hereditary, would have become wholly Testamentary, and disposable by the last Will or Letters Patents of the King or Queen for the time being, without the consent of the Great Council of the Nation, which is con∣trary not only to the then receiv'd Laws of Succession, but also to the an∣tient constitution of the Kingdom, as well before as after the Conquest.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all this, I doubt not but that if the Lady <HI>Iane</HI> had so far prevail'd against Queen <HI>Mary</HI> as to have been able to call a Parliament, and to have had her Title own'd and recogniz'd therein, as it was in the Case of <HI>Ri∣chard</HI> the Third, and <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, but that she would have been true and lawful Queen according to the intent of the Statute we are now discoursing of, and then the Duke of <HI>Northumberland</HI> must likewise (if he had fair play) have been indemnified for taking up Arms in her defence against Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> since Queen <HI>Iane</HI> would have been then within the letter of this Statute, as much as King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="927" REF="500"/>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must pardon me, if I cannot be of your opinion in this matter, since if the bare Coronation and recognition by Parliament could confer a legal right to the Crown upon one who had no hereditary right to it before the consequence of it would be, that the Crown would be so far from being Elective (as you suppose it to have antiently been) that it would be in the power of every bold Usurper or Rebell who had but the confidence to call him∣self King, to gain a legal Title to be so, according to your Principles: and then if <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> could have found a Party strong enough in the Army to have declar'd him King, and had call'd a Parliament in his own name, who had recogniz'd him for their Lawful Sovereign, he would then have had as much right to our Allegiance as King <HI>Charles</HI> the IId, which certainly was not only contrary to the settlement of the Crown upon <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, and the Heirs of his body, but also to that solemn recognition of King <HI>Iames</HI> the Firsts Title, as lineally descended as right Heir to the said King <HI>Henry,</HI> which I insisted on at our last Meeting.</P>
<P>And therefore if you will have my sence of this Act, it is either expir'd (for the reasons I have already given) or else was void <HI>ab initio</HI>; since it is not only contrary to the setled course of Succession of the Crown according to the Laws of lineal descent for divers hundred years last past, but also to those of justice and right reason, for an Usurper not only to seize the Throne by force, but if he can once get himself solemnly Crown'd, and then recogniz'd by an Act of Parliament of his own calling, (which your self cannot deny but to have been ever too obsequious to the will and power of Usurpers, as appears by those instances you have given me in <HI>Henry</HI> the IVth, <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth, and <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId,) the consequence will then be, that the whole Nation would not be only bound to swear Allegiance to him, but would be also oblig'd by this Act to desend him in his Tyranny and Usurpation to the utmost of their power, and it would also indemnifie them for so doing; which would be to establish iniquity by a Law, and would destroy all the setled foundations of right and wrong, which I affirm God himself is not able to alter, without de∣parting from those great attributes of immutability and Justice, so essential to his Divine Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will not be very difficult to reply to these Arguments, since they are grounded on such false Principles as are already answer'd. As first, that this Kingdom is by the fundamental constitution of it an Hereditary Monarchy, and that consequently none but he who has a right by inheritance can re∣quire our Allegiance, but pray tell me where you can find this fundamental constitution? for I think I have sufficiently prov'd that there never was any such thing known in <HI>England</HI> till between four and five hundred years since that King <HI>Edward</HI> the First succeeded to his Father <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, without any Bequest of the Crown by his Testament, and before any Election, or Coro∣nation, since he was then in the Holy-Land. But suppose it now to be an Hereditary Monarchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>C. A.</HI> p. 57.</NOTE> it doth not therefore fol∣low, that the Monarchy should continue always in such a Fa∣mily, for that may sail, or may be changed by Conquest or Usurpation, as has often been, and the constitution continue. So that the most that can be said is, that when any particular Family, by the Providence of God, and the
<PB N="928" REF="501"/>
consent and submission of the People, is placed in the Throne, of right the Crown ought to descend to the Heir of that Family; but suppose it does not, must we pay Allegiance to no other person though p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssessed of the Throne? Pray Sir, shew me that fundamental consti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ution; for its being an Hereditary Monarchy does not prove it, and according to the Judgement of the best Lawyers, the Laws of the Land require the contrary; <HI>viz.</HI> that we must pay our Allegiance to him who is actually King, not to him who ought to have been King, but is not, and to think to confute this, by pretending this fundamental constitution of an Hereditary Monarchy, is to take that for granted, which is still to be proved.</P>
<P>And therefore I am not at all frighted at the dreadful consequences which you suppose must follow if this Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth should be Law, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it would be in the power of every Rebell and Usurper who could get himself Crown'd, and then own'd to be King by a Parliament of his own calling to have a legal right to our Allegiance, and that <HI>Cromwell</HI> if he could have got himself once Crown'd, and recogniz'd, might have been defended in his unjust Usurpation against King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second. But, admit this to have been so; yet it is still to be understood, that at this Coronation he had taken the Oath anciently taken by our Kings, and that the Parliament he had summon'd to recognize his Title, had consisted of the antient Lords and Com∣mons, consisting of Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, which never was observ'd in any of those Mock-Parliaments which <HI>Cromwell</HI> call'd; had all these Conditions been observ'd, I believe he would have been as legal a King with∣in this Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, as he himself ever was before he Married with the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which was not till near half a year after he had the Crown setled upon him by Act of Parliament. So that though upon e∣very translation of the Crown from one Family to another, the first Prince of that Family could have no Hereditary Right to it, yet we find such Princes to this day taken for Lawful Kings; thus your <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, King <HI>Henry</HI> the IVth, and King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, are each of them looked upon as true and lawful Kings (according to our constitution) as if they had been right Heirs of the Crown by lineal descent; and though you may say, that as to <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> I. he had a good right by Conquest; that is, only <HI>gratis dictum,</HI> since I have already prov'd that he could be really no Conquerour.
<Q>And if the English Saxon Monarchy was hereditary before the Conquest (as the Gentlemen of your opinion suppose) he could be no other than an Usurper upon <HI>Edgar Athling</HI> the right Heir of the Crown by blood; and as for <HI>Henry</HI> the IVth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, though they both pretended a feigned Title to the Crown as Heirs by blood, yet it is plain by the very Acts of Recognition I have cited, that they durst not insist upon that Title, since I have already prov'd there is no such thing mention'd in that Act of Parliament wherein the Estates of the Kingdom unanimously agreed that <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> should Reign over them, nor yet in the subsequent Act, whereby the Crown was intail'd upon himself, and his four Sons successively; so likewise the Statute of the first of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, it is only drawn in general terms; declaring that the Inhe∣ritance of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. shall rest, remain, and abide in the Person of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, and the Heirs of his Body lawfully coming, &amp;c.</Q>
<PB N="929" REF="501"/>
Nor is there indeed any breach made upon this Statute (as you suppose) nor yet upon the Act of Recognition of King <HI>Iames,</HI> which you so much insist upon, since the Crown is certainly setled upon two Princes, who are not only lineally descended from them, but who are also to be looked upon as right Heirs unto them, since the Great Council of the Nation, who are the Supream Judges have declar'd them to be so.</P>
<P>But as for the rest of your Speech, whereby you would prove that this Act must needs be void, because contrary to the Laws of Justice and right Reason; this also depends upon your former errour, in supposing that Princes have a Divine or Natural Right to their Crowns▪ antecedent to the municipal Laws of their respective Kingdoms, which is already sufficiently confuted; so that tho' I grant it is not in the power of God himself to alter the natural foundations of right, and wrong, just, and unjust; yet it is likewise as certain that the Civil Rights of Princes, as well as those of Subjects, can no ways be accounted for according to those Natural Laws; since all Civil property, as well in Crowns, as other Possessions, must depend upon the particular Laws and Constitutions of each Kingdom and Nation, as I have already sufficiently made out.</P>
<P>And therefore though I grant that all Legal Authority ought still to go according to just or rightful Titles,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. L. R.</HI> p. 25, 26.</NOTE> yet since God makes no Kings at this day. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut those who are made Kings by some humane Acts, and have a legal right to Kingship by some humane Laws: Now how can you prove from hence, that in <HI>England</HI> none can have a legal right to govern, but those who have the rightful Title of a Li∣neal Succession? for if the Title alone does not conferr the the Authority, but that the Law says a legal investiture by Coronation and Recognition by Parlia∣ment shall also conferr it, it is evident that an Hereditary Title, and a Legal Au∣thority, may be separated, and yet the Authority continue Legal still; for Legal Authority must be conveyed in such manner, and by such forms as the Law has prescribed, or appoints to that purpose; for there is no other way of conveying it; and then that Authority which is so given in form of Law (and that only.) is the Legal Authority. If then the Estates of the Realm, who are the only proper Judges of such Disputes, have adjudged the Crown to one, whom we will at present suppose to have no antecedent legal Title to it, yet he thereby becomes legally possessed, not only of the external force and power, but of the legal Authority of the Government also; and therefore he may challenge as his due, all Legal Obedience, (which is the true notion of Alle∣giance, for nothing more than Legal Obedience can be due to a meer Legal Au∣thority) so that because he is invested with the Legal Authority, the Crown is his Legal Property, against all other Claims, and his Subjects must defend him in it, as the Legal Properties of private Persons being once determined by Judgements of inferiour Courts of Law, are also to be defended by the Civil Power against the force of him who perhaps may have the better Title to the Estate by right of blood. And if God makes Kings by humane Acts, I hope it is no injustice in God to make him a King, whom the Law makes a King▪ and to enjoyn our Obedience to a Legal King; which Legal Authority may be said to be annexed to the Legal Title, while there is no Legal Judgement a∣gainst it: which was not the Case of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and the Lady <HI>Iane</HI> her
<PB N="930" REF="502"/>
Competitor; nor yet of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI>: since neither the one' or the other were ever Crowned or acknowledged as Lawful Queen, or King by Parliament, and therefore could obtain no Legal Title against the Right Heirs; but on the other side, when one is solemnly declar'd King or Queen, being Crown'd or plac'd on the Throne by the Estates of the Realm, he is then Legal King, and has the Legal Authority, as the Royal E∣state and Dignity, was owned to be in <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth, when the Duke of <HI>York</HI> claimed the right to the Crown.</P>

<P>I am not yet convinc'd I am mistaken in this matter; for waving at present any Natural or Divine Rights of Princes, I think this Act of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, (if suppos'd to be now in force) is no ways to be reconcil'd with the former declar'd Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom; much less can this last pretended Act of Recognition of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> reverse the Statute of Recognition made to King <HI>Iames</HI> the First, whereby the Parliament does not only own him for true and lawful King by descent from <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, and <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth, but also engaged themselves and their Po∣sterities to his Majesty, and his Royal Progeny for ever.
<Q>And they do likewise conclude in these words (I have not yet mention'd) which [Act] if Your Ma∣jesty shall be pleased (as an argument of your gracious acceptation) to adorn with your Majesties Royal Assent (without which it can neither be compleat and perfect, nor remain to all Posterity according to our most humble desires, as a Memorial of your Princely and tender affection towards us;) we shall add this also to the rest of our Majesties unspeakable and inestimable benefits. Here they plainly acknowledge these two things.</Q>
First, that the Crown de∣scend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by proximity of blood, and that immediately, even before any Cere∣mony of Coronation, or otherwise; so that there can be no <HI>inter-regnum,</HI> or vacancy of the Throne; and accordingly it is a maxim in Law, that <HI>Rex non meritur.</HI> Secondly, That the Assent of the King is that which gives the life, being, and vigour to the Laws, without which they are of no force; therefore I shall plainly prove these Acts to the contrary to be void. It is a Maxim in our Civil as well as your common Law' that every <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>natus-Consultum,</HI> or Decree of the Senate as also every Statute or Act of Parliament must be abrogated and repeal'd by the same Authority by which it was made; since therefore that Act of the first of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth, whereby he was declar'd to be Lawful King, as descended from <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nel</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> third Son of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, by <HI>Philippa</HI> his Daughter, and Heir; and that <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, who had successively held the Crown were Usurpers, and only pre∣tended Kings; it would necessarily follow, that none can after this so Solemn Law and Declaration, lawfully succeed to the Crown of this Realm, but such as have a true and just right as Heirs by blood, according to the course of descent al∣low'd of by the common Laws of this Kingdom; and therefore <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth being an Usurper, and enjoying no more than a Matrimonial Crown, could not joyn with a Parliament in making any Law contrary to that of the first of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the IVth, which had been so solemnly past, and setled in Parliament by a King whose Title was by descent indisputable.</P>
<P><PB N="931" REF="502"/>So likewise in the matter now in dispute between us, I can never apprehend how a pretended Statute made in a Convention, and not in a Lawful Parlia∣ment summon'd by the King, can first declare the Throne vacant, and then appoint those to fill it, who certainly can have no just Title to it, according to that Act of Recognition of King <HI>Iames</HI>;
<Q>which expresly declares, that they themselves could not have made that Act to be compleat and perfect to remain to all posterity, without his Royal Assent; which being once past into a Law.</Q>
by a King whose Title was indisputable, can never afterwards be alter'd (if ever it can be at all) but by a Parliament as legally call'd, and that by a King whose Title is also as Legal as that of King <HI>Iames</HI> the First's; this Objection, though I have often urg'd in other words, yet could I never yet obtain a sa∣tisfactory answer from you.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though I have already in part answer'd this Objection at our last Meet∣ing, and have also partly done it already in this; yet since I see you so much insist upon it, and do also urge it again in other words, with a fresh addition of new arguments; I hope you will not think me tedious, if I am also ne∣cessitated to repeat the same things again, and put you in mind of what I hayh already prov'd; which when I have done, I doubt not but this argument of yours will signifie very little. Your first mistake therefore is, that King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth being an Usurper, had no power to alter the course of Heredi∣tary Succession, setled by the Statute of the first of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth whereby he was declar'd lawful King; in answer to which, I must put you in mind, that this was the first time that ever this Point was so setled before, and that not till after a long War, and that by subduing all those that held with the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> he had made such a perfect Conquest of all that oppos'd him, that there was no Lords or Commons in this Parliament but what were intirely of his Party; yet we see that when <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth got the upper hand again, and his party revers'd this Statute of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth, and declar'd the Crown to belong to <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth, and his Heirs, which Act was to re∣vers'd again by the next Parliament, in the eleventh of <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth; when he again recover'd the Crown by another Battle against <HI>Henry</HI> the VIth, so evident it is, that whoever is once seated in the Throne, and is recognized by Act of Parliament tho' of his own summoning, all his Acts till they are repeal'd do hold good, though he were declar'd an Usurper, and himself attainted by Act of Parliament; and therefore admitting that <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth was an Usurper at the time when this Act we now discourse of was made, yet would it not render this Act void as you suppose, since it was never yet repeal'd by any subsequent Statute.</P>
<P>But indeed, <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth was no Usurper at the time when this Statute was made; for you your self have already granted that he had a good Title in right of his Wife, which he never renounc'd, or disavow'd; and therefore we may very well suppose that she, though Queen <HI>de jure,</HI> gave her tacit consent to this Act in the person of her Husband; and if so, I cannot see any reason why it should not stand good, not only against her self, and her own Chil∣dren, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also against all others who should claim under her Title; but if you say she could not do this in prejudice of her own right Heirs, because the Crown had been already declar'd by Act of Parliament to be Hereditary, and
<PB N="932" REF="503"/>
not to be acquir'd by Usurpation; this is to beg the question, and to suppose an Hereditary descent to have been the fundamental Law, and constant practice of the Succession of the Crown before that time; whereas I have al∣ready prov'd, that till the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, the Crown was partly Hereditary, and partly Elective; and ever since that time, though it has been still claim'd as Hereditary, yet has it been always believed to be the right of the Parliament to declare who was Lawful King: and that whosoever was so declar'd and recogniz'd, has been always looked upon in the eye of the Law as the only Rightful and Legal King, to whom the Allegiance of the Subjects was due, and whose Statutes are obligatory at this day.</P>
<P>This being so (as it cannot be deny'd) your Argument from the Act of recognition to King <HI>Iames</HI> the First may be easily answer'd, though I should grant at present (for discourse sake) that their now Majesties King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> are only King and Queen <HI>de facto,</HI> for if all the Statutes of these three Kings of the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and of <HI>Richard</HI> the Third (nay even those Statutes by which themselves were declar'd to be lawful Kings, and the Crown setled upon them and their issue) have at all times held good, till they were lawfully repeal'd I desire you would shew me any sufficient reason why the late Act of Recognition of their present Majesties Title, and for the settlement of the Crown upon their right Heirs of the Protestant Re∣ligion, should not have the like force and effect in respect of our Allegiance to them, as it had been to all other Kings <HI>de facto,</HI> who have hitherto sate upon the Throne, though perhaps it may derogate from the intent of that Statute of Recognition of King <HI>Iames</HI> the First; nor does it make any difference, though we suppose that this Act was made by a King by descent, and that we now discourse of only by a King and Queen <HI>de facto,</HI> and a Parliament call'd or own'd by them; since the Law allows no difference as to their Legislative Power between Acts made by a King <HI>de facto,</HI> and one <HI>de jure.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore, though I grant that those conclusions you draw from this Statute are true, that there is no <HI>inter-regnum</HI> or vacancy of the Throne. And Secondly, that the assent of the King is that which gives the life, being, and vigour to the Laws; yet as for your first conclusion, that there can be no va∣cancy of the Throne, it is only to be understood, that ordinarily, and ac∣cording to the common course of Succession there can be none, and yet ex∣traordinarily there may, as you your self must grant: since upon the death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> there might have happen'd a contest between King <HI>Iames,</HI> and the then Earl of <HI>Hartford,</HI> as Heir to <HI>Mary</HI> the French Queen, second Si∣ster to King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth, upon whose Heirs the Crown was setled by <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth's Will, as I have already mention'd at our last Meeting; and if it had been a doubt whether this Will had been rightly made, or not, could have been no otherwise decided but by War, or else the solemn Judgement and recognition of Parliament of that Title they had judged to be best; and he who had been so declared, would certainly have been lawful King, and all the Nation had been oblig'd to swear Alleglance to him. Apply this to the present case, admitting King <HI>Iames</HI> to have truly Abdicated the Throne, and see whether it be not exactly the same; supposing (for once) your Prince of <HI>Walts</HI> to have been indeed the Son of the late King and Queen; and though it
<PB N="933" REF="503"/>
is true, he is not yet declar'd an Impostor, yet is he neither acknowledged as their right Heir, for the Reasons I have already given.</P>
<P>But as for your next conclusion, that it is the assent of the lawful King that gives force and vigour to a Law; from whence you would infer, that the late Act of Recognition and Settlement is void, because not made by those who were lawful King and Queen at the time of the making this Act; this is also to beg the question; for though it is true the Act of Recognition to King <HI>Iames</HI> declares this Act could not be compleat without his Majesties Royal Assent, yet it is not there said, that no other King but he who claims by de∣scent (as King <HI>Iames</HI> did) could pass an Act that should be good in Law; since we find by the whole Course both of Law, and History, that the Sta∣tutes made by Kings <HI>de facto,</HI> are as truly and as much Laws, as those made by your Kings <HI>de jure</HI>; and Attainders for Treason committed against them, have been so far from being declar'd void, that they could not be revers'd by any other means than by particular Acts of Parliament made for that purpose, as I have already shewn you from divers instances, both from History, and Records. Nor is your exception against the present Parliaments not being call'd by the Kings Writ of any force, since I have already prov'd at our last Meeting, from the example of the Great Council that assembled to recognize and or∣dain <HI>Edward</HI> the first to be King when he was in the Holy-Land; as also by the Parliaments of <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, by which they were de∣posed, and <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth declar'd to be their Suc∣cessors: That those Parliaments could not be summon'd by those Princes whom they so recogniz'd, and therefore though they were call'd by the Writs of the former Kings; yet their Authority determin'd as to be the Parliament of that King that call'd them, upon his ceasing to be King; and therefore must owe their sitting longer, wholly to the Authority of him they had already de∣clared King, whose Presence and Authority was then looked upon as sufficient to give them power to sit and make Laws with the succeeding King, though they were never summon'd by him.</P>
<P>To these Parliaments I may add that of the first of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, which called home the King, and after his return, made several Statutes both publick, and private, which stand good to this day; so that to conclude you have no reason either from Law or History to maintain that there can be no vacancy of the Throne, or that none can be declar'd King or Queen, but in a Parliament summon'd by the Writs of that Prince, whose Title they are to recognize.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not deny the matters of Fact to have been as you lay them, as to the Great Councils or Parliaments you mention; but in answer to this, you may remember, that as for those Parliaments call'd in the name of <HI>Edward,</HI> or <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, there is no Procedent to be drawn from them, because they serv'd only to depose their Lawful Kings, and to set up those who had no right, at least as long as they liv'd; and you very well know, that any coer∣sive power in the two Houses of Parliament over the King, is expresly re∣nounc'd and declar'd against in the Parliament of the thirteenth of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, as I have already shewn you; but as for the Convention which was call'd in the first year of that King, I have also given you my judgement of it; that though they might lawfully meet to vote the return of their Lawful So∣vereign,
<PB N="934" REF="504"/>
and to recognize his Title, yet were they not for all that a lawful Parliament, as to the raising of Moneys or making of Laws; and there∣fore what ever they did to both these, they were fain to be confirmed by the Parliament of the 13th I now mention'd.</P>
<P>But indeed I cannot but admire as this mungrel hodge podge course of Suc∣cession which you now suppose to take place in <HI>England</HI>; for you cannot deny but the Crown is hereditary, and has been always claim'd as such for near 500 years; and yet for all that, when ever an Usurper and a Parliament shall a∣gree together, he to take the Crown by force, and they to recognize his Ti∣tle as soon as he pleases to call them, he must then be looked upon as a lawful King, and the just and rightful Title of the true King, or lawful Heir of the Crown shall be so far destroy'd, as that Allegiance must be due to this Usurper, though perhaps he obtain'd the Crown by the most horrid vilanies in the World; as the deposing and murthering of his Lawful Sovereign, as <HI>Henry</HI> the IVth did, and which would also have been the case of <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> had he ever taken upon him the Title of King; so that is to set on foot at once two contrary legal rights, a legal right and title to the Crown by descent of blood, without a right to exercise the Authority belonging to a King, and a legal right to wear the Crown, and exercise the authority belonging to it, without any antecedent legal right to the Crown it self; which would indeed render the legal authority in <HI>England</HI> to be like the right that men have to those Creatures that are <HI>ferae naturae,</HI> which belong to him who can get them into his power; for as to the consent or recognition of Parliament, I look upon that as a meer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>auble, since your self cannot shew me any Usurper since the Conquest, though never so wicked and notorious, who ever fail'd to have his Title so recognized and confirmed by Parliament, as you your self cannot deny, which methinks is a high derogation from the Dignity of a true Hereditary Monarchy, such as ours either is, or at least ought to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall reply but this once upon this head, since I see there can be no∣thing new said upon it: and therefore you your self are for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to repeat what you have already <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urged at our last Meeting; only you strive to support it by fresh Authorities; therefore as to the Parliaments which deposed King <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, I cannot blame you for denying them to be lawful precedents, because they make directly against your opinion; but you say nothing to that of the first Great Council or Parliament of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, which not only ordain'd he should be King, but also appointed all the Great Officers of the Kingdom which were to govern it in his absence; but you may deny the authority of those Parliaments of the first of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, and first of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, as much as you please in a Chamber, but if you should do the like at <HI>Westminster-Hall</HI> against any Act of Parliament, because made whilst <HI>Edward</HI> or <HI>Richard</HI> the Second were living, you would soon be over-rul'd, and told that those Laws had still continued in force, and unre∣peal'd, and it did not belong to private men to question those Acts that have been hitherto receiv'd for Law.</P>
<P>But as for what you have said against the authority of the Acts of that Par∣liament that brought in the King, I have already prov'd that they were only confirm'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>cantela,</HI> and that they had been good without it, appears
<PB N="935" REF="504"/>
by this, that all their private Acts, though never confirm'd in the following Par∣liament, are still in force. But if the solemn Recognition of a Kings Title by Parliament be such a bauble, and so easily obtain'd (as you suppose,) I may say the same of that Act which recognized King <HI>Iames</HI> the firsts Title; that it was done meerly out of flattery upon his Accession to the Crown; nor can you reply that they might do this, because he was the only right Heir, this is to beg the question, since if he had not been so, it would have been all one, as you your self confess.</P>
<P>As for the rest of your Arguments which you draw from the different means which our Law allows for Princes succeeding to the Crown, which you call a mungrel hodge podge course of Succession, and that it derogates from the Dig∣nity of a true Hereditary Monarchy; to which I shall only say, if now our Law has established it so, no private Man ought to judge otherwise; for <HI>nemo debet esse sapientior legibus,</HI> is a maxime as old as true; but indeed, though our Laws do establish a legal right in the present Possessor of the Crown, when once Crown'd, and Recogniz'd by Parliament, since they will not allow the Parlia∣ment to judge of or examine the Kings Title. or by what means he attain'd the Throne; yet this does not to alter the ordinary hereditary course of Succession for the Law still looks upon the Crown as Hereditary, and the change of the Person or Royal Family does not make the Crown cease to be so; and there∣fore whoever has possession of the Crown, has an Hereditary Crown, and as such, may leave it to his Heirs as long as they can keep it; as is plain from the example of the three <HI>Henries</HI> who succeeded each other, and who had not only Allegiance sworn to them, but they who acted contrary thereunto, were judged and executed as Traytors; so that the Law did all it could to maintain the Crown in the right line of Succession; and if any Kings have gain'd it by Usur∣pation, though the Parliament have own'd the Authority of such an Usurper, yet have they not thereby approv'd the action; and you your self must acknow∣ledge a great difference between these two, since you have more than once ac∣knowledged that an Usurper, or King in possession, has a good Title to a Crown, in case all the right Heirs are extinct, or by their not claiming it for any long time, are suppos'd to have made a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acit cession of their right; since it is not so much to the Person as to the Authority (which we grant to be from God) that we pay our obedience.</P>
<P>But let us also for once suppose that there may be a legal Title to a Crown without a right to exercise the Authority belonging to it; and a legal right to wear the Crown, and exercise the Authority belonging to it, without an ante∣cedent legal Right to the Crown it self; this is no such absur∣dity as you suppose,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. L. R.</HI> p. 18.</NOTE> if you please to consider that allow'd distinction between <HI>jus ad rem</HI>▪ and <HI>jus in re,</HI> with the reason of it; for tis an approved distinction in Law, that one may have a right to a thing, and another a right in it; the one is a right of a legal claim, the other of a legal possession: and that this may and must be in all Civil Governments, and meer legal Rights, appears from the different Laws and Customs on which such different rights are founded. This I have hinted before, but must now explain it more particularly; in all Civil Societies there must be particular Laws to determine personal and particular Rights; and whatever is due to any
<PB N="936" REF="505"/>
Man by such Laws, is his legal Right. But yet we know these Laws can de∣termine no controversie without a living Judge; for if every Man were to judge for himself, every Man will make the Law to be on his side, and then we had as good have no Laws at all; and therefore the Fundamental Laws of all Societies, which is superior to all particular Laws, is this, That the last and final Judgment of Authority, shall be taken for Law, and that shall be every Man's right as to all the Effects of Law, which is thus adjudged him; whoever calmly considers these things, will find that it is impossible it should be other∣wise without overturning all Civil Governments. And this I have proved to you from the Example of a right owner of an Estate, when outed of his Possession by a Verdict of a Jury and an unjust Judgment in one of the King's Courts, that no Man ought to restore him by force to his Possession, till he has again reverst that unjust Judgment given against him.</P>

<P>Though I grant this is true in the Case of private Persons, and their In∣heritances, yet is it not so as to Princes who hold their Crowns by a Title su∣perior to the ordinary Municipal Laws, and therefore are not only Kings by Law, but by Divine Right, and a Fundamental Constitution of the Govern∣ment; and so cannot have their Title adjudged by Parliament, as you suppose; for our best Divines have unanimously concluded out of Scripture, that all law∣ful Kings and their Royal Power is from God, by Divine right, and is not from the People, no not in Elective Kingdoms, (such as <HI>Poland,</HI> for Example;) for even there, the conferring of the Royal Authority is from God, and not from any Law made by the People, and neither they nor their Representatives have any thing to do to judge of it; for I would gladly know who made that Law which made the King, certainly the King did not make it, for that Law which made the King, must (of necessity) precede and be before the King, who had his Royal Power and Kingly Office from that Law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you are very hard put to it, since you are again forc'd to flie back to your old Covert of a Divine Right in Kings, which is, not to be deriv'd from any Law made by the consent of the People, and if this be true, I de∣sire you would show me, how Kings can at this day owe their Crown<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> imme∣diately to God, and not to the Law, since God does no longer confer King∣doms by any express Designation of the Person, but by the ordinary course of his Providence; and then pray tell me, why all Princes whatsoever, when they are once seated in the Throne, let them come by it which way they will, must not derive their power alike from God? and consequently, Kings by an un∣just Conquest, or Usurpation, are as much from God, as those who ascend the Throne by the Consent or Election of the People; for if the Peoples con∣sent, do no more then design the Person, but that it is God alone which gives him his Authority, then which way soever he obtains this power of the Sword, which is the onely sign of God's conferring this Authority, it will be also the Or∣dinance of God, and consequently their present Majesties being once seated in the Throne are upon, these principles as much to be obey'd as the Ordi∣nance of God; as King <HI>Iames</HI> or any other Hereditary Monarch whatever.</P>
<P>But if you do not like this Doctrine, and tell me of a legal Successive right which King <HI>Iames</HI> and his right Heirs have to the Crown, according to the Fundamental Constitution of the Nation; this is plainly to own the King to
<PB N="937" REF="505"/>
be so by the Law of the Land, though in words you deny it; for every he∣reditary right is either a continued Usurpation by force, which can give no right at all; or a right by Law, which is by the consent of the People to en∣tail the Crown on such a Family, which certainly is to make a King by Law, that is, by the consent of the People. But if you will suppose that it was the Authority of the first King alone who thus intail'd the Crown upon himself, and his right Heirs, I desire you would shew me how the Crown could be so intail'd without the consent of the People, so as that his Successor may not alter it, and give it by his last Will or Testament to which of his Sons or Daughters he pleases; since Sir <HI>Robert Filmer</HI> himself acknowledges that a testamentary heir to a Crown in an absolute Monarchy, is as much by Divine right, as if he had come in by Succession, as appears by the instances he gives in <HI>Seth,</HI> who could have no right to succeed his Father <HI>Adam</HI> in the Government of Mankind, while <HI>Cain</HI> his Elder Brother was alive, by the Will of <HI>Adam</HI> his Father; the like I may say of <HI>Solomon,</HI> who by his Fathers Crowning him King in his life time, and thereby making him his Successor, gave him a right to Rule over <HI>Adon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jah</HI> his Elder Brother; so that I may ve∣ry well ask you, if the present Law of the Land did not proceed from the free consent of the People testified by long Custom, or express Declaration of the People by their Representatives in Parliament; I desire to know why the King of <HI>England</HI> cannot as well settle the Crown by his last Will upon which of the Blood-Royal he pleases, as that it should be Lawful for the En∣glish Saxon Kings to exercise this Prerogative, as Dr. <HI>Brady</HI> supposes they did before the Conquest, without the consent of the Great Council of the Nation? So that I think I may much better ask you what that Law was, and who made it, which you suppose to make Kings prior to, and inde∣pendent from the consent of the People; since if there be any such Law, it is either as yet unknown to Mankind, or else all those who are once possess'd of Kingdoms, have an equal Title to them by Divine Right? But indeed, it is only some Divines who were more scrupulous than knowing in Politicks, who first started this question, whereas indeed there is no such great My∣stery in it; for that Law by which the first King of <HI>England</HI> for Example was Elected, was not in being before the King was made, nor yet was the King in being before that; but when the first King was made so, by the consent and election of the People, the King, and the Law that made him so, be∣gan both together; that is, the People by chusing of him to Govern upon cer∣tain Conditions, and he by accepting the Crown upon those Conditions, was that Law by which he then took the Crown, and by which it has been held ever since that time. So that if the Crown ought to be enjoy'd ac∣cording to a legal right, and that there must be some Judges appointed of this right, when ever any Disputes may happen about it, either every pre∣tender to the Crown must judge for himself, and then he will be both Judge and Party in his own Cause, or else it must be left to the conscience of e∣very individual Subject in <HI>England</HI> to side part with what Party he pleases, that may thus pretend to it: and so there may be a dozen Competitors for the Crown at once, and all with equal right as for ought that any body
<PB N="938" REF="506"/>
knows; or lastly, this right must be left to the determination of some Civil Judges to judge whose Right it is; and who can these Judges be who shall thus judge what are the antient Laws of Succession, and Rules of Allegiance, but the Great Council of the Nation?
<Q>therefore, if they have already de∣clar'd and recogniz'd King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> to be lawful King and Queen of this Realm, I think every Subject of the same may very well justifie their Swearing Allegiance to them; not only by vertue of this Statute of the 11th of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, which requires Allegiance to be paid to the King in being, but also from the equity and reasonableness of the thing it self, to hinder the Nation from falling together by the ears, and to entail Civil Wars from Generation to Generation, if the Subjects were oblig'd by their former Oath of Allegiance to the King <HI>de jure,</HI> to endeavour to restore him by force of Arms; and therefore the Preamble to this Statute very well and truly sets forth, that it is not reasonable, but against all Law, Reason, and good Conscience, that the Subjects going with their Sovereign Lord to the Wars, any thing should lose or forfeit for doing this their true duty and service of Allegiance to the King for the time being.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray tell me, is not this very strange and unjust, and that by your own showing, that a Prince should have a legal Right and Title to the Crown, without a right to exercise the Authority belonging thereunto; for they must now pay Allegiance to the King in being, let him be never so great an Usurper; so that indeed the preamble to this Act is expresly false, since I think it is very unreasonable, nay against all Law, Reason, and good Conscience, to Swear Allegiance to an Usurper; since by that means, not only all good Subjects would be put out of a capacity of endeavouring to re∣store the King <HI>de jure</HI> to his Throne, though never so unjustly depos'd, or driven out, as in duty they ought; but also those who were instrumental in this Rebellion, and in depriving the Lawful Prince of his just Rights, may not themselves endeavour to restore him, which would put them out of all possibility of making amends for the wrong they have done him, and of making restitution, by again restoring him to his Throne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this be all the difficulty that is left upon your mind, I doubt not but to prove to you, not only from the Law of the Land, that Allegiance may be lawfully Sworn in this Case, but also that it is for the common hap∣piness and peace of the Nation, which is the main end of all Government that it should be so; and therefore I shall first freely grant, that though it is Rebellion unjustly to deprive a King and his right Heirs of the Crown, and that those who had a hand in it, are bound in conscience to endeavour to re∣store him or them to their just rights again; yet this must be done by no other methods but what are consistent with the publick peace and safety of the Common wealth; for if a King <HI>de facto,</HI> has once got possession of the Throne, and has been Crown'd and Recogniz'd by Parliament, from what has been already proved, I think it is very plain, that they ought to obey him, not only from the very letter of this Law, but also, because I have now said, all private Persons ought to submit their Judgements in this matter to that of their Representatives, who if they have judged falsely, are
<PB N="939" REF="506"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bear the blame, but yet their Judgement for all that is to be held for good, 'till it be reversed in the same way in which it was given, since if after such a recognition every private person should still be free to pay his Allegiance to him whom he suppos'd King <HI>de jure,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. O.</HI> p. 57.</NOTE> it would certainly follow, that the Civil Society or Com∣mon-wealth must of necessity fall into Civil Wars, which is against the na∣ture of Civil Societies, and inconsistent with the duty of self-preservation, which obligeth men not to expose their Lives and Fortunes, but to obtain a greater good than both those, which can only be the publick good of the Community, and not the single interest of any one person or Family; and though I grant it is a great sin in those who are instrumental in raising Re∣bellion, and who are thereby guilty of a very enormous Crime, yet that which made it so, was not barely the injury they committed against the Prince to whom (if alone consider'd) the breach of an Oath, (in with∣drawing their Allegiance, could be no greater a Sin than the breach of an Oath to another person) but indeed the fatal mischief and irreparable dam∣mage they did the Common-wealth, is that which aggravates the Sin; and if a new commotion to restore the King <HI>de jure,</HI> would in all probability, prove yet more destructive, and a Nation by being so much weakned by a former Civil War, be less able to bear a new Civil War, which may happen so far, to the weakning of it, as to expose it to the Invasion and Conquest of a foreign Nation, who may be Enemies both to our Religion and Civil Constituti∣on in such a case I cannot think it our duty to restore a Prince by force, though never so unjustly driven from his Throne. And therefore if I had been then a man, tho' I should have been as much for bringing home King <HI>Charles</HI> as any body ought to be, yet I should have been only for it in the way in which it was brought about, and should never have desir'd it, if it could not have been done but by an Army of <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Irish</HI> Papists; and the like I say now, as to King <HI>Iames,</HI> as long as he is joyn'd with the Interest of <HI>France,</HI> and is already gone into <HI>Ireland</HI> on purpose to renew the War, by the Arms and Assistance of those, whose Fathers, as well as several of them∣selves, did all they could to destroy, not only the Royal Power, but also the English Religion and Government in that Nation.</P>
<P>And therefore I must freely tell you, that if even Rebels have put it out of their power to make reparation for all the wrongs they may have done by Rebelling against their Lawful Prince, because he in possession is too powerful to be driven out again without a violent Civil War, and a general concussion of the whole Common-Wealth; This reparation to the injur'd Prince being not to be made without a greater evil than that they endeavour'd avoid, it ought to be omitted till it may be done with more safety to the Nation, or else not at all. I say, if there be no other way to make repa∣ration to their injur'd King, but by engaging the Nation in fresh Civil Wars, they ought not to attempt it by such unlawful and destructive means.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess the Discourse you have now made, carries the greatest ap∣pearance of truth, of any thing you have yet said; since it is drawn from

the publick Good of the Nation, which I grant to be comprehended under the common good of Mankind, and you have done well to own it to be Rebeli∣on, to deprive a lawful Prince and his Heirs of the Crown; yet that it is un∣lawful to restore them again to it, if we think it cannot be brought about without a general Subversion of our Religion and Civil Liberties, may be a question; I grant indeed, if we could be absolutely certain of this, there would be some colour for this Argument: but since future things are not ca∣pable of Demonstration, if the restoring our lawfull Prince be a Duty incum∣bent upon every good Subject, we ought to endeavour it, though with some Danger and Hazard of what ever is dear to us; for God will either protect us both in our Religion and Civil Liberties, for thus honestly performing our Duties (according as we are bound by our Allegiance) or if he has call'd us to suffer for the Truth he will either find us Patience to bear it, or else provide us a way to escape; this I speak in Relation to the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Irish,</HI> whose Conquest and Malice you are so much afraid of, in case the King should happen to be restor'd by their assistance; but indeed, I think this a needless fear, since I suppose the King will be too wise to bring over so many of either Nation, as shall be able to make an entire Conquest of this Kingdom, least thereby both he and his Crown may lie wholly at their Mercy, when the Business is done; nor do I think it either in the power of the <HI>French,</HI> or <HI>Irish,</HI> to perform these dangerous things, not of the former, because (as I now said) I suppose the King will never bring over more of them along with him, than what may serve to make a stand a∣gainst the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Forces, till his Good and Loyal Subjects can come in and join with them to his Assistance; and as for the <HI>Irish,</HI> they are also the King's Subjects, and though Ignorant they are, very inveterate a∣gainst the Protestant Religion, and the <HI>English</HI> Nation and Interest; yet they may be so govern'd, and over-rul'd by the King, as not to be able to do us any considerable Damage</P>
<P>But as to the King of <HI>France,</HI> I do really believe he is far from intend∣ing to make an entire Conquest of this Kingdom for himself, much less de∣siring to make the King as Absolute a Monarch here, as himself is in <HI>France,</HI> for us to the form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he has too much consideration of his own Glory, and Reputation in the World, to seize upon the Kingdom of a near Kinsman and Allie of his own Religion, and who had been driven from his Throne chiefly for being too much in his Interest; and besides all this, he may ve∣ry well fear, that if he went about any such thing as an entire Conquest of this Nation, all Parties may join against him as a common Enemy, and drive him out again, as the <HI>English</HI> Barons did Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> in the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the III<HI>d.</HI> nor can it be the <HI>French</HI> King's Interest to make our King Absolute here; for then having the Persons and Purses of his Subjects wholly in his own Power, King <HI>Lewis</HI> might justly fear, that either this King, or his Successors may prove as dangerous Enemies to the Crown of <HI>France</HI> as ever they have been in former Times, if ever our Kings should go about to revive their ancient pretentions to <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Normandy,</HI> or make War upon some other Quarrel; and thefore I think it will be more far the Interest of
<PB N="941" REF="507"/>
<HI>France,</HI> to leave us our Laws, Liberties and Priviledges as we now en∣joy them; nay, to make an express Capitulation for them, and when he has done to foment those Jealousies and Disputes, that are still like to arise between the King and Us about them, thereby to hinder us from joining a∣gainst him; then by rendring the King Absolute to take them quite away, and put the sole power of the Purse as well as of the Sword wholly into his Hands.</P>
<P>To Conclude, you do also very much misrepresent the matter in suppo∣sing, that though the King cannot now be restor'd without falling into a new Civil War, yet that, does it not therefore follow, that such a War is not to be desir'd for the Publick Good of the Nation; since we shall there∣by not only restore the Crown to its right Owner, and the Succession of it to the lawfull Heir; but also shall restore Episcopacy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and prevent the Church of <HI>England</HI> from falling into a dangerous Schism, by de∣priving the Arch Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and as many other of the Bishops, who are so Honest as not to take the new Oath for standing out against it, by the Temporal Power of a pretended Parliament, without the Judgment of a Lawfull Convocation, who are the only proper and legal Judges.</P>
<P>You likewise as much mistake, in supposing that this War can no ways be finisht, but by so great a Concussion as shall so much weaken the King∣dom, as to render it expos'd to the Invasion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Foreign Enemies, in which you may be very much deceived; for who can tell but the hearts of this Na∣tion may come to be so inclin'd to receive their lawful King, and his right Heir, and may be so weary of the present Usurpation, as upon his first ap∣pearance in <HI>England,</HI> with an Army sufficient to defend those who shall come into him; so many of his Subjects will take this advantage, as will be more than enough to restore him with as little Blood-shed, as when he was driven out, and then I think no indifferent Man but will acknow∣ledge that such a War would prove for the best, since it will not only setle the Government upon in ancient Foundation of a lineal Succession, but will also extinguish those fatal causes of War, not only from among our selves, but also from Foreign Princes, as long as the King, and the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and his lawful Heirs shall continue in being, which I hope will be much long∣er then those upon whom your Convention has setled the Crown, either in Present or Reversion.</P>

<P>I doubt not but to show you, that all you have now said, is either built upon false Principles, or else deduced by very uncertain Consequences; for in the first place, though you doubt my Principle, that the People of this Nation, are not bound to restore King <HI>Iames</HI> to the Throne, if it cannot be done without the evident Destruction both of our Religion and Civil Liber∣ties, which certainly is true (granting it to be never so much our duty to restore him, when with safety we may;) for if the obligation of all Moral Duties whatsoever, is only to be judged of according as they more or less conduce to the Happiness or Destruction of the common good of Mankind, (whereof this particular Nation makes a part) it will necessarily follow; that this Duty of restoring King <HI>Iames,</HI> is not to be practised, if it cannot
<PB N="942" REF="508"/>
be brought about without the Destruction of our Religion and Civil Liber∣ties, since it is only for the maintenance of those, that even Kings themselves were first ordain'd in this Nation; and it is evident, that this Kingdom may be sufficiently Happy and subsist in the State it is now in, though neither King <HI>Iames</HI> nor your <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Wales</HI> be ever restor'd to Reign over us.</P>
<P>So that then all the Difficulty that remains, is, That since his Restoration being not otherwise to be brought about without the assistance of great numbers of <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Irish</HI> Forces, whether it be not only so small a hazard as you make it, but twenty to one, that his coming in upon these Terms will produce those dreadfull Effects, which I say, will certainly happen from it? and though I grant that future things, especially, in the Revolutions of Go∣vernment are not capable of Demonstration as Mathematical Propositions, yet if all the circumstances of Time, and the Temper and Disposition of the King himself, and those who are to join with Him in bringing Him in again be considered, it shall appear, that Morally speaking nothing less then the evi∣dent Destruction of our Religion and Civil Liberties will follow. I think I may still positively affirm, that we are not oblig'd to restore Him till this Temper of Mind be alter'd, and that he can be restor'd without these Fatal Consequences I now mention; and if these cautions are not observ'd, I de∣ny that God hath any way promis'd to protect either our Religion or Civil Liberties, or that he is bound to provide us a way to escape as you suppose; if to perform this suppos'd Duty of Allegience thus unseasonably, we slight the onely means God has ordained for our Preservation. But as for the pati∣ence under those Sufferings that may then happen, that is a very sorry reason to embrace them, since God may give us that Grace, if he pleases, as the only Comfort we can have left us, when by our own Folly and mistaken No∣tions of Duty, we have brought all those Evils upon our selves.</P>
<P>I shall therefore now proceed to show you, that these Evils I speak of, must necessarily happen to us, in Case King <HI>Iames</HI> be restor'd by the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Irish</HI> Papists. In the first place therefore, it is very falsly suppos'd, that this Alteration can be brought about without an entire Subduing, or Conquest not only of their present Majesty's, but the whole Nation, is apparent since none but the Papists and some few of the Clergy, Nobility and Gentry de∣sire his Restoration, and who if they were put altogether, will not I believe amount to the hundredth Man, who would be either willing or capable to come in to his Assistance with Men or Money; and therefore it is a vain Sup∣position to believe (as you do) that this new Revolution can be brought a∣bout without any more Dificulty or Blood-shed then the last, as long as the present King and Queen continue to Govern us according to the Declarati∣on they subscrib'd upon their acceptance of the Crown, and the Coronati∣on Oath they have since taken; which I hope they will always do, since nothing but following King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Example, as well as to Religion, as Ci∣vil Liberties can ever make this Nation willing to receive Him, or your Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> with so little difficulty, as you are pleased to imagine.</P>
<P>Since therefore the Business must be wholly done by force, I shall in the next place consider all those Suppositions you have laid down, as well in re∣spect
<PB N="943" REF="508"/>
of the <HI>French</HI> as <HI>Irish,</HI> who are the only Hands that I see likely at pre∣sent to do this Work. First, as to what you say, that the King would be too wise then to bring over along with him so great numbers of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Nations, as shall be able to make an entire Conquest of this Kingdom, least thereby both he and his Crown, may lie wholly at their Mercy, when the Business is done: you have hereby granted as much as I desire. For if their Majesties are never like to be without an Army in <HI>England,</HI> of at least Fif∣teen or Twenty Thousand Men as long as this War lasts, and that the Mili∣tia of this Nation, which are almost totally against King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Interest, and do amount altogether to above a Hundred Thousand Men, I think you your self will grant that King <HI>Iames</HI> cannot attempt coming over hither with an Army of less then 30 or 4000 Veteran Soldiers of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Nations, though you should reckon the Papists and others who should come into his Assistance at 20000 more, who if they should be (altogether) able to beat not only King <HI>William</HI>'s standing Army, but the Militia of the Kingdom to Boot; I desire to know what shall hinder them from making as perfect a Conquest of this Nation, as ever <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Army did, either of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland</HI>? And consequently, of seting up what Religion or Government they please in this Kingdom; which, that it will not be, that which is now exercis'd either in Church or State; I think any unprejudiced Man will easily grant me.</P>
<P>But your next Suppositions are altogether as Precarious, that it is not ei∣ther the Design, or Interest of the <HI>French</HI> King, to make an entire Conquest of this Kingdom for himself, nor yet to make King <HI>Iames</HI> an absolute Monarch here, one of these I must needs believe will happen; for though perhaps that King may at present stand so much upon his Glory, as not Seize the Kingdom of a Kinsman, and an Allie wholly to his own use and benefit; yet it is most likely, that he will retain <HI>French</HI> Garrisons in all or most of the strong places of <HI>England,</HI> not only for the security of the Charges he will have been at to place King <HI>Iames</HI> in the Throne; but also as a tye upon us that we shall never endeavour to drive him out again, let him use us as he pleases; so that tho' I grant, he may not make an absolute Conquest of us now, yet it may be in his or his Sons power to do it hereafter, if ever King <HI>Iames</HI> his Son shall go a∣bout to shake of that Yoke when once the present Obligation is forgot, or the near Relation between the two Kings shall be farther remov'd: nor is what you say less Precarious, that it will not be for King <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Interest to destroy our Liberties and make King <HI>Iames</HI> an absolute Monarch, because the King∣dom will be then weaker and more divided-then it is now, by those Jealou∣sies and Disputes we shall then maintain with the King about our Civil Rights, which is indeed so far true, if he Governs when he returns in the same Ar∣bitrary manner as he did before; but if he Govern according to Law (which no wise Man can expect) there needs be no more Divisions among us then was for a great while after King <HI>Charles</HI> the Seconds coming in; but that the <HI>French</HI> King should fear, if he once made the King of <HI>England</HI> an absolute Monarch, and put the whole power of the Purses as well as Swords of his Subjects in his Hands, he might then become so formidable as to be an equal
<PB N="944" REF="509"/>
Match to <HI>France</HI> it self, and to be able to demand either the whole Kingdom, or any part of it, is yet more pleasant, since <HI>France</HI> is now in comparison with <HI>England,</HI> not only in respect of Men, but also the Revenues belonging to the King as Ten to One; and I think I may very well maintain, that if <HI>England</HI> should once come to be Govern'd as <HI>France</HI> is, it would be so far from growing Richer, or more Powerful thereby, that from the Intestine Grieviances, and Discontents that such a violent course of Government would cause in the minds of the People, of all Sorts and Conditions by those excessive Taxes and Op∣pressions, that would follow from such an Arbitrary Government the King∣dom would quickly diminish and decay, as well in People as Trade and Riches, and so consequently in power too; which is but the product of both these, notwithstanding whatsoever the fair appearance of an outwardly Magnificent Court, and a great standing Army may produce in the minds of those that do not truly consider or understand the true Grandure and Safety of the Prince, and Happiness of the People.</P>
<P>But granting all this to be as you suppose, pray tell me what shall become of our Religion and Civil Liberties, not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> respect of the <HI>French</HI> King, but of King <HI>Iames</HI> himself; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> believe, that either of them will cease to be instigated by the Jesuits their Confessors to destroy the Northern He∣resie (as they term our Religion) as well in <HI>England,</HI> as it has been in <HI>France</HI>? No, the poor <HI>Vaudois</HI> in <HI>Savoy</HI> have been too recent an Example, that the King of <HI>France</HI> would carry the Persecution to the same degree here, as he did there, and that King <HI>Iames</HI> being wholly in his Power, will not be able to withstand his Commands; besides, the constant Solicitation of his Confessors of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Order and Principles of those of the <HI>French</HI> King, to which Holy Fathers, the Protestant Religion in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Savoy</HI> do chiefly owe its De∣struction.</P>
<P>To Conclude, let us suppose that King <HI>Iames</HI> shall now prevail in this War by the help of the <HI>Irish</HI> Army, now rais'd by the Earle of <HI>Tirconnel,</HI> can we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pect better Quarter if the King prevails by their Arms and Assistance, then if they were intirely <HI>French?</HI> For having once Conquer'd this Nation, it will not be in the King's Power to Govern them so easily as you expect, but being inve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>te Enemies to the <HI>English,</HI> they will not only possess what Estates they please of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility and Gentry in <HI>Ireland,</HI> but in <HI>England</HI> too, which will be declar'd forfeited by their Owners opposing of King <HI>Iames,</HI> and then I will leave it to your self to Judge in what a Condition we shall be in, both as to our Religion, and Civil Liberties, when the King shall come to be manag'd by Men who are declar'd Enemies to both; neither will it be in the power of those few moderate men, either of the Popish or Pro∣testan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Religion, who take King <HI>Iame</HI>'s part, to hinder it, since the other Party will by means of the Priests and Jesuites, and the interest of <HI>France,</HI> run down all sober Councils, and they will be but looked upon but as Trim∣mers (at best) that oppose it.</P>
<P>But as for King <HI>Iames</HI> himself, I desire to know of you what trust there can be put in him, or what assurance he can give us for the maintenance of our Religion, and Civil Liberty, more than the renewing of those Promises,
<PB N="945" REF="509"/>
and that Oath which he has already broken; this being most likely to be the consequence of things, if King <HI>Iames</HI> prevail. I shall leave it to your self, or any indifferent person to judge, if what I have undertaken to prove, be not as clearly made out as future things are capable of, and are sufficient to deter any Man that loves his Religion or Country, from joyning in such pernicious Designs.</P>

<P>I confess you have made a long and tragical Narration of the dread∣ful consequences that may follow both upon our Religion, and Civil Liber∣ties, if the King prevail by the present assistance of the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Irish</HI> Arms; and were I sure of all this, I should so far agree with you as to this point, as never so joyn with them for the Kings return, and yet for all that I can ne∣ver look upon my self as freed from that Allegiance I owe the King, as well by being born his Subject, as from the Oath I have already taken to him and his Heirs, as long as they are in being; for I think I have already prov'd as well from Law, as Reason, That first the Bond of Allegiance (whether sworn, or not sworn,) is in the nature of it perpetual and indispensable. Secondly, that it is so inseparable from the relation of a Subject, that al∣though the exercise of it may be suspended by reason of a prevailing force, whilst the Subject is under such force, (<HI>viz.</HI>) where it cannot be imagined, how the endeavour of exercising it, can be effectually serviceable to restore the Sovereign power to the right owner, for the establishment of that pub∣lick Justice and Peace wherein the happiness of Common-wealths consists, yet no outward force can so absolutely take it away or remove it, but that still it remaineth vertually in the Subject, and obligeth to a vigorous en∣deavour (whenever the force that hindereth it is over) &amp; to the actual exercise of it for the advantage of the party, to whom of right it is due, and the ad∣vancement of the common good thereby, upon all fit occasions. Thirdly, That no Subject of <HI>England,</HI> that either hath by taking the Oaths of Supre∣macy or Allegiance, acknowledged, or that not having taken either Oath, yet otherwise knoweth, or believeth that the true Sovereign power in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> to whom natural Allegiance is due, is the King, his Heirs, and Lawful Successors, can without sinning against his Conscience, take any new Oath, or do any other act whereby to transfer his Allegiance from the King or his Heirs, to any other party who have no right to it, and thereby put himself into an incapacity of performing the Duties of his bounden Allegiance to his Lawful Sovereign, when it may appear to be useful and serviceable to him. This is the express Opinion of the Learned Bishop <HI>Sanderson</HI> in his case of Conscience concerning the lawfulness of taking the Engagement; which though he did not think absolutely unlawful, because it might be interpreted in a dubious and qualified sence, without abjuring the Kings lawful right to the Crown; yet cannot this new Oath be taken in the like doubtful sence, because (as I have already prov'd) the words in the Oath being to bear true Allegiance to King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> would be indeed a transferring of our Allegiance from our lawful Prince, to others, which is absolutely unlawful.</P>

<P>I am somewhat pleas'd to see you are so far come off from your bi∣gotry, as not to think your self bound to assist for the restoring King <HI>Iames,</HI> as long as it is no otherwise to be done but by the evident destruction of our Religion, and Civil Liberties; but yet you say you cannot take the Oath, because it is Bishop <HI>Sandersons</HI> Opinion, as well as that of our best Lawyers, that Allegiance is perpetual, and untransferrable to another, whilst the King or his Heirs are in being. Which let me tell you (speaking as a Lawyer) since it may well be proved from this Statute, as from the constant practice before that time; that Allegiance was due to the King <HI>de facto,</HI> and that by the judgement of all the Judges in the Reign of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the IVth; but to speak of this matter, either as a Civilian, or a Divine, I think we are freed from the former Oath both by the Law of Nations, as well as the Law of God. For as for natural Allegiance, by which you suppose a man is indispensably Subject to the King in whose Territo∣ries he is born, and that as long as he lives, I can by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o means understand, that being born in a Country, makes one a Subject for all his life to the Go∣vernment of that Country; or why being when born in a Country, it, should make one become a Subject, more than being in the same Countrey at another time.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. O.</HI> p. 49.</NOTE> Besides, common ex∣perience shews this to be false, because whoever is born in a Country, where his Parents are Foreigners, may, (as it is allow'd by all) leave that Country when he pleaseth; but perhaps i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be said, he is a Subject to that Prince where his Parents were born; but what if they were born under the same Circumstances? or suppose his Parents are of different Countries, as if a Dutch Woman, and an English Man have a Child in <HI>France,</HI> since <HI>France</HI> does not pretend to him, which of the Nations can claim him for their Subject? or must he be divided? So that I can see nothing at all in this notion of natural Allegiance, that can oblige any body in Conscience to observe it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If then Natural Allegiance signifies nothing, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y tell me is no body oblig'd to obey the King, or not to plot against him until he has taken an Oath of Allegiance to the contrary? this would make mad work indeed, and upon these Principles no man were bound to obey the King or his Laws, and not to conspire against his Person, or Government, untill he had taken the Oath of Allegiance; so that three parts of four of the Kingdom would be absolutely free from this great duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, you are very much mistaken, since I think I can found Al∣legiance to the King and Government upon a much firmer foundation than that of being born his Subject, that I am so far from supposing that our obli∣gation commences from our taking the Oath of Allegiance, that though I think it may serve to inforce our former obligation to our King and Country, yet does it not super-induce any new obligation thereunto; for indeed our obligation to any particular Government may be made out from much surer Principles, <HI>viz.</HI> That every person though he be born free, yet is he for the sake of his own safety, obliged to part with his liberty, and put himself under the protection of some Government;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 49.</NOTE>
<PB N="947" REF="510"/>
nor can he be secure in what he enjoys but by it; nor can he have a right in a Countrey (that is already possess'd) to property, but by owning the Government of that Countrey; and when by enjoying the Rights and Privi∣ledges of the Subjects of that Common-wealth, he has own'd himself a mem∣ber of it, and a Subject to its Government, he is then bound to maintain this Government, and also the King that administers it, from a double obliga∣tion: the one particular in respect of himself, and that protection he receives from him; the other more universal proceeding from that duty which is in∣cumbent upon every particular Subject to maintain the peace and happi∣ness of the Common-wealth, as long as he continues a Member thereof. So that he is bound never to disturb it as long as the main ends of Government can be had and enjoy'd therein; and this is the only means that I know of, by which any man (except by express Oaths and Promises) can consent to become Subject to any single person, or Government: Now this tacit consent of particular persons being separately and singly given, unthinking people take no notice of it, and suppose they are as naturally Subjects as men; and consequently that they have no more right to free themselves from their Sub∣jection, than from their Humane Nature; nay, must suffer themselves to be destroyed rather than endeavour it, let the Government oppress them never so unmercifully; which is indeed to reduce men to the condition of brute Beasts, who belong to this or that Owner; because he either bought them with his Money, or else because they happen'd to drop from their Dam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon his ground.</P>
<P>From what has been here spoken, I think we may deduce this general Conclusion, that every ordinary Subject who enjoys the common benefits and protection of any Government, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bound in gratitude, not only to obey it; but also to be true and faithful to it during the time he lives under it, and is bound likewise not to conspire against it; and therefore that Oaths do not alter the nature of Allegiance, or make it due where it was not be∣fore, or any ways extend it, but only add a new tye to pay that Allegiance which is due upon the account of protection. He that lives under a Go∣vernment, though he has not sworn to it, ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it the same Allegiance as he that has; and if he should deny his Allegiance to it, would be equally guilty of Treason, though not of Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury. It is evident by the universal practice of Mankind, that no Subjects ever thought themselves obliged by those Oaths of Fidelity (which all Governments have constantly imposed on them) when they could not be protected by them, and that this failure of Protection did not proceed from any fault in the whole Nation, or People themselves. And this may be prov'd by the common and constant practice of all the Subjects of <HI>Europe</HI>; for who does not know that the Subjects of the King of <HI>France</HI>'s last Conquests in <HI>Flanders,</HI> have been forced to swear Allegiance to him, though they were satisfied that his Title was unjust, and that their Natural Sovereign the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to whom they had formerly sworn Allegiance, is still living? We have had also a late Example of the Subjects of the Duke of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ein Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>torp,</HI> who having both his person taken Prisoner, and his Territories unjustly seiz'd upon by the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI>

in time of Peace, the Subjects of the said Duke were forced to swear Alle∣giance to the King, notwithstanding their former Oath to their Master; nor do our Modern Casuists as I know of, blame them for so doing. And why the People of <HI>England</HI> should be tied to harder terms than all the rest of <HI>Europe,</HI> I wish you could give me a sufficient reason; since the Legislative Power of <HI>England</HI> (wherein it is certain the People have a share) are pre¦sum'd to recede as little as possible from natural equity, and therefore design by imposing such Oaths,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 55.</NOTE> only the good and preservation of the Civil Society; whose interest it is, that they who have the publick Administration of Affairs should not be di∣sturbed; but it is not at all material to that end, whether this or that Man hath this power provided they are well managed; nor can it without the greatest absurdity be suppos'd, that such numbers of Men as Societies are compos'd of, who are by nature equal, should oblige themselves by the most solemn ties to become most miserable by living without protection; nay, to lose even their lives, rather than own the Government that can and does protect them; for no other reason, but such an extraordinary fond∣ness to this or that Person, or Family, as to fancy to be inseparable from him: not to the necessaries or real conveniencies of life but only an Office (for Government is no other) which is but an imaginary happiness; I grant therefore, that People should be true to those that have the present admi∣nistration of Civil Affairs, is all that all Oaths of Fidelity require; and it is evident from the intent of it, that the late Oath of Allegiance required no more, and to extend it farther than the King in Being, is not recon∣cilable with the reason, end, and design of paying obedience; which is the peace and happiness of the Civil Society; which can never be maintain'd, if people may, for the sake of a single person disturb him that has the ad∣ministration of their common Affairs; and it would require impossibilities; because private persons are incapable of paying Allegiance to a King when out of possession of the Government.</P>

A.</HI> p. 15.</NOTE> that the persons o∣blig'd by it are only such as are born within the Kings Dominions; for persons born without the Realm may be also his natural Subjects, as are the Children of Embassadors born beyond Sea, and the Children of Aliens born within the Kingdom are not therefore Natural Subjects of the King; so that the meer circumstance of Birth does not alone entitle any one to the priviledges of a Natural Subject, nor consequently bind him to all the duties of Natural Allegiance: But it is therefore called natural in our Laws, be∣cause,
<PB N="949" REF="511"/>
as the best Lawyers have affirm'd, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded upon the Law of Na∣ture, which gives the Sovereign power a right to the Allegiance of every one who is Born under the Jurisdiction of it. As every Son is born a Subject to his Parents, and is by the law of Nature oblig'd to Honour, Obey, Assist and Support: So also is he born a Member of the body Politick, and by consequence a Subject to the Sovereign of it, and accordingly by the same eternal Law, is bound to pay all faithful Service and Obedience to him, when he in a capacity to perform them.</P>
<P>But your next Mistake is yet worse, when you confound that common Obligation of a Foreigner or meer Denison to be true and faithful to the Common Wealth wherein he lives, with this Natural Allegiance of every <HI>English</HI> Subject; for though I grant the taking the Oath of Allegiance does not inforce any new Obligation upon him that takes it, more than he was subject to before; yet for all that, I think you will not deny, but that there is a great deal of difference between that common Obedience or Submission which such a Foreigner pays to the King, and his Laws in a Country where he Sojourns, and that more perfect Allegiance arising either by Birth or from such a strangers being naturalized, and by taking the Oath of Allegiance, becoming as true and perfect a Subject as a natural <HI>English</HI> Man; and hence it is, that in all Wars declar'd between Neighbouring Princes, whatever Subjects of theirs shall presume to stay and reside in each others Dominions after once they are recall'd home, may be justly Executed as Traytors when ever they shall be taken; and therefore though I grant that every Person now living in <HI>England,</HI> and of ripe Age, is oblig'd to obey your King and Queen, <HI>de facto,</HI> in all ordinary and lawful things which tend to the publick Benefit and Defence of the Civil Society or Common-weal, and which being for the benefit of the King <HI>de jure,</HI> and his leige People; it is to be morally suppos'd they have his Tacit consent for what they do as long as it tends only to this end; yet does it not therefore follow, that the bare protection of this usurpt Government, and the enjoyment of the common priviledges of a Subject, should give such a King <HI>de facto,</HI> or Government a right of exacting an Oath of Allegiance to them, since I have already prov'd from the true significati∣on of being true and faithful, as also from the legal signification of the word Allegiance, that no true Subject can lawfully take it without renouncing his Allegiance to his natural Prince; since not only a bare Neutrality or Obe∣dience in not transgressing the Laws, is thereby required of them, but also an Active Obedience and Duty in performing the King <HI>de Facto's</HI> commands, and the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending him when ever there is occasion in his ill-gotten pow∣er.</P>
<P>But since the only difficulty is, how a strict observation of this Oath can consist with the quiet and happiness of the Subjects, when ever a new Oath of Allegiance comes to be impos'd by the King <HI>de facto,</HI> since the Subjects may be all ruin'd that do not take it, if it be once offer'd to them. This dif∣ficulty might be easily remov'd, if the whole Nation would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lick firmly to the Duty required by their former Oath of Allegiance, and resolve never to take a new one, for then the numbers of the refusers would be so great▪
<PB N="950" REF="512"/>
as that they would be more than could be made to suffer for their refusing it. I speak of such Subjects as are in our case, and who are not forced by a Prince, who either has the Right or Power of a Conqueror to compel them by force, and therefore your instances of the Subjects of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or of the Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> who were conquer'd, or else as good as conquer'd by the power of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI>; whereas, we are only over-aw'd by an inconsiderable number of <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> and might set our selves free, if we would give but a vigorous Effort towards it: For that King <HI>William</HI> is a Conqueror over the whole Nation, I think you dare not affirm. And with∣out he were so, he could challenge no right to our Allegiance as such; and therefore I must still believe, that the Oath of Allegiance I have taken to King <HI>Iames</HI> and his Heirs is perpetual, unless you could show me, that their Right is determin'd which you have not done by any thing you have yet said; and therefore I cannot be of your Opinion, that the bare protection of an usurpt Power, can justifie our Swearing Allegiance to it, either in Law or Conscience, for then all Men had been oblig'd to pay as firm an Allegiance to the <HI>Rump Parliament,</HI> and also to <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> as to King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> since both the former protected the People as much in their Religion, Civil Liberties and Properties, as the latter I fear will ever do.</P>
<P>And that the bare protection of a Government does not give it no abso∣lute right to the Allegiance of all those that enjoy their protection, I think may be sufficiently prov'd from the instance of a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> or any other Foreigner: who though by his living here, and enjoying the common pro∣tection of the Government, I grant he is oblig'd to be obedient to its Laws, and is not to Act or Conspire against it, yet this does not discharge him from his natural Allegiance which he still owes to his former Prince, so as to do any thing which may prejudice that Allegience he owes to him, either by Conspiring, or Fighting against him. And this was solemnly declard to be Law by the Judges of the <HI>Kings-Bench,</HI> in the case of Dr. <HI>Story,</HI> in the 13<HI>th.</HI> Year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; He being a violent Papist, fled over into <HI>Flanders</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> and there conspiring with him, to invade this King∣dom, and being afterwards taken and brought over Prisoner, was Tryed as a Subject of <HI>England,</HI> though he refused to plead as such, because he said he had Sworn Allegiance to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> notwithstanding, which Plea he was Executed as a Traytor, as you will find at large in my Lord Chief Justice <HI>Dyers</HI>'s Reports;<NOTE PLACE="marg">13. <HI>Eliz.</HI> p. 303. b. l. 2.</NOTE> which Judgment is al∣so confirm'd by the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Coke</HI> in <HI>Calvins</HI>'s Case, where he expresly Asserts, That a Person born under the Dominion of the King of <HI>England,</HI> owes him perpetual Faith and Alle∣giance, and this by vertue of the Law of Nature, because <HI>Iura naturalia sunt immutabilia</HI>; from whence will also appear the falsity of your Conclusion, that Oaths of Allegience extend no further then to the King in Possession, or to that Government to which we do at present owe our common Protection, and therefore that our Law has a much higher consideration of this inherent Al∣legi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce that belongs to a King <HI>de Iure,</HI> as to his particular Person, and his Heirs; so that it cannot be indifferently paid to any body else who can by
<PB N="951" REF="512"/>
seizing of the Government, force us to owe our Protection to them. Which appears by what my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> hath also laid down, to have been agreed by all the Judges upon this Oath of Allegiance, in <HI>Calvins</HI>'s Case as I cited it to you at the beginning of this Evenings Conversation; so that I confess, I much wonder, considering what he has there said, how he can so positively maintain as he doth (in the place you have also quoted) that Allegiance is due to the King <HI>de Facto,</HI> and not to Him <HI>de Iure,</HI> whilst the former is possest of the Crown, since it seems a flat contradiction to me how a Subject is to pay Allegiance as long as he lives to the King and his Heirs, of life and mem∣ber; that is, until the letting out of the last drop of our dearest Hearts-blood, and that in all places whatsoever. And yet that this Obligation should last no longer, then whilst the King <HI>de Iure</HI> is in actual Possession of the Throne, and therefore I think I have still very good reason to maintain that we are still o∣blig'd by our former Oath of Allegiance to King <HI>Iames,</HI> so as not to take a new one to any other King, unless we had been constrain'd to it by an absolute Conquest, which you your self will not maintain to be our present Case.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, you have now argued this point very stifly, and I confess, what you have said, carries with it the greatest appearance, both of Law and Reason of any thing you have yet urged upon this Subject; and therefore, if I can fairly answer it, I hope you will come over to my Opinion, and take the Oath which is now required of you. In the first place therefore, I cannot deny, that all you have said concerning a natural Allegiance due by Birth to the King, is true according to our Laws, and I do my self allow the thing, <HI>viz.</HI> That Allegiance is due to him, though not for the Reasons upon which our Lawyers have founded it, but upon those I have already given; and therefore though granting it was held to be Law in the Case of Dr. <HI>Story,</HI> that his Plea of his becoming a Subject to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> was over-rul'd by the Judges, and he refusing make any other Plea, was condemned upon a <HI>Nihil Dicit.</HI> Yet this being only a Penal Law, I think obliges the Subject to the penalty if he be taken, but does not oblige him in Conscience never to change his Prince or the Government he was born under without their con∣sent, let his Circumstances become never so uneasie under it; and that this is so, I need go no further then the late Case of the <HI>French</HI> Refugees, who thought they are strictly commanded by their King, not to stir out of <HI>France</HI> whatsoever persecution they may suffer, yet I think no Man of Sense, can blame them if being persecuted there, they remove themselves into other Countries, and become perfectly Naturaliz'd Subjects or Denisons at least in that Government whereunto they remove; and this is so known a thing, that no Casuist as I know of, thinks it a sin in such Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> as finding it for their advantage go over into another Country, to settle and make their Fortunes, or are there Naturaliz'd, or made free Denisom in those Kingdoms or Common-wealths whereunto they remove; nor are such Persons oblig'd in Conscience, to return Home upon the Command or Summons of that Prince, to whom you suppose them to be Subjects by Birth; nor is your Ar∣gument at all convincing, that because a Mans owes a duty to his Parents by the law of Nature, and by being Born their Child, that therefore the subje∣ction
<PB N="952" REF="513"/>
to the Prince under whose Government he is Born, must be alike per∣petual, since the ground upon which you found this Consequence is altoge∣ther false, since I have already prov'd at the first meeting we had to discourse of these matters; that a Man's being Begotten, and bred up by his Parents, does not make him become their Subject or Servant in the state of Nature as long as he lives, so that he may never withdraw himself from their sub∣jection without their leave.</P>
<P>But in the next place, I think I am as little mistaken in my Notion of Allegiance, which I suppose every Person who is a true and perfect Subject of the Government, owes to the King or Sovereign Power thereof; for tho' I grant there is a great deal of difference between that imperfect Allegiance or bare Submission which every Foreigner owes the King or Government un∣der which he resides, and that more perfect Allegiance which every Subject owes the King, who enjoys all the Rights and Previledges of a true <HI>English</HI> Man; yet to let you see that this distinction proceeds not from the bare pro∣tection of his Person and Goods by the Government under which he lives, but by his being Naturaliz'd and becoming thereby a perfect Member of this Civil Society, is plain from your own showing; and therefore whosoever not only enjoys the common protection of an Inhabitant, but also all the Rights and Priviledges of a true <HI>English</HI> Subject is bound to swear Allegiance if requir'd to the King or Queen <HI>de facto,</HI> without enquiring into their Right or Title; for if they are strangers, or have never taken any Oath of Allegiance before, they cannot be under any former Oath; and as for natural Allegiance, I have already prov'd it to be a meer legal Notion, and this Allegiance I have also prov'd to to be due to the King and Queen <HI>de facto,</HI> not only from the Opinion of the Judges in <HI>Bagots</HI>'s Case, but also from my Lord <HI>Cokes</HI> inter∣pretation of the Statute of Treason, which though you suppose to be contra∣dictory to what he had before laid down in <HI>Calvins</HI>'s Case; yet if you please better to consider of it, you will find it not to be so; for though it is true, the Judges do there assert, That the Obligation of the Oath of
<Q>Allegiance is indefinite and without Limitation, as being made to the King and his right Heirs; and also that it extends to the venturing of life and members, and to the letting out of the last drop of our Blood; yet is this still to be under∣stood only of such a one, and his Heirs who still continues to be King in a legal Sense, which can be only he who is King for the time being, as he is stil'd in this Statute of the 11<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th.</HI> and only during the time that he continues in actual Possession of the Throne:</Q>
And therefore the word King or Majesty being indefinite and without having any respect to his Title, whether by descent of Blood, or else by his being Crown'd and Recogniz'd by Parliament; it is no contradiction to suppose this Allegiance is only due to the King in this limited Sence, according to this Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<HI>th.</HI> where pray take Notice that I have made this Allegiance to be only due to Kings and Queens <HI>de facto,</HI> because they only are within intent and letter of this Statute, as also of that of Treason, according to the legal Govern∣ment of this Nation by the Fundamental Laws thereof, and can no ways be extended to any other Powers under other Titles, such as the Rump Par∣liament
<PB N="953" REF="513"/>
under the Title of a Common-wealth, or <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> under that of a Protector; who though they took upon them to Protect the Peo∣ple after a sort in their Lives, and Estates, yet since it was not according to the true Rights and Priviledges of the Subjects of this Nation, which they highly violated, and in some points quite destroyed; and that they also took upon them this protection without the free consent of the lawful Re∣presentatives of the Nation Assembled in a full and lawful Parliament; I can by no means allow them to have given the People such a true and legal Protection as the Law requires to constitute a true and perfect Allegiance, or can make them to be the Supream Power of the Nation, and within the Statute of the 25th of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third; so that this Statute, and that of the 11th <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, must be our Rules in this Case.</P>
<P>But I cannot but smile at the expedient you have found out to hinder the People of this Nation from being ruin'd if they do not take the Oath of Allegiance to their Majesties. which is by a general and absolute refu∣sal of it; and this you suppose, if unanimously agreed on, would hinder them from suffering any thing by this their refusal; and you think they are also strong enough to oppose it, because the King has only a small Army of Foreigners which he still maintains here, and this you think may lawfully be done, because their Majesties do not claim by Conquest, but by the E∣lection of the Convention; and therefore that this Case does not come up to that of the Subjects of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Holstein</HI>; in which Argument I doubt not but to shew that every one of your suppositions are false, for though the Nation is not Conquer'd, yet it is certain that all priva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Subjects are under as great a restraint by this legal change of the Government, as if they were in the power of a Conquerour; for to resist would be equally fatal to them in both cases, and there is no visible Power nor Authority that can defend them against the present Power, in case they should go about to refuse this Oath when it is offer'd to them; and therefore though I grant the King's standing Army of Foreigners is but small, in Comparison of the whole Nation, since he does not intend to keep us in Subjection by force, but only to hinder any sudden Insurrection of those of your Party; yet besides all this, God be thanked, their Majesties have the main body of the Common People of the Nation on their side, who are sufficiently able to destroy all those that shall go about to make those vigorous efforts you so much desire; so that you have nothing else to plead, but that which I hope never to see, that we are not under a force, because we still entirely en∣joy our Religion, Liberties, and Properties; and though the King out of his great goodness and modesty, did not think fit to insist upon his Title by Conquest over King <HI>Iames,</HI> and his Adherents, yet I think I have already prov'd at our last Meeting, that he may as justly claim by Conquest, as his Name-sake <HI>William</HI> the First, since he came not over to Conquer the Na∣tion, but to vindicate his former right, and after his Conquest of King <HI>Harold,</HI> could have no just Title to the Crown, till he had been solemnly elected and recogniz'd for King, according to the Laws and Customs us'd at that time: and why the Nation might not do the same thing now for their
<PB N="954" REF="514"/>
Deliverer from King <HI>Iame</HI>'s Arbitrary Power, I should be glad if you could shew me a sufficient reason; but if the whole Nation should have been as pevish and discontented as those of your Principles, and should not look upon the King as their Lawful Sovereign, because he does not claim by Conquest, it would be altogether as grateful and reasonable, as if a Wo∣man having by the assistance of an honest Gentleman, been rescu'd from being ravish'd, and he afterwards falling in love with her himself, should Court her to Marry her, she should refuse him, because he had not ravish'd her when he might, or at least have forced her to Marry him whither she would or no; apply this Comparison to the Case in dispute, and see if it does not hold; and therefore I must still maintain that the parallel Cases of the Subjects of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Holstein,</HI> are still good, as to those of your Opinion, who have no notion how Allegiance can be transfer'd, unless by perfect force, and Conquest; since if you please to desire it, I'll undertake the Government shall seize upon your E∣states, and Imprison your Persons, till you do take the Oaths, as the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> did those that refus'd to swear Al∣legiance to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard you a great while upon this Subject, and I wish I could say I were fully satisfied with your Reasons; however, since it grows late, I will not dispute this Point any farther, but will take time to consider what you have now urg'd, but only I must needs tell you thus much; I could wish that Princes could find some other way of securing themselves of their Subjects Fidelity, besides this test of an Oath of Allegiance, which serves as a snare to many pious and conscientious Men; whereas those of none, or at least of very loose Principles, will swallow any Oath that can be imposed upon them; and I am sorry to see so many of those, who I know are in their hearts of my Principles, prevail'd upon to take it, not out of Consci∣ence, but meer Worldly interest, and advantage; and whom I am sa∣tisfied will never serve this Government the more heartily or sincerely for having taken it; and therefore to tell you the truth, I begin very much to incline to <HI>Grotius</HI>'s Opinion, that promissary Oaths are absolutely unlawful; yet considering the several changes and turns of Government which we have seen in <HI>England</HI> for above forty years last past, I am so far for the good and happiness of my Country, as to think every true English Man oblig'd so far to obey the Powers in being, as may tend to the common good and defence of the Nation, by the administration of Justice between Man and Man, and in the punishment of Offenders, and for defence of the Nation against Foreign Enemies. But, sure me∣thinks this might very-well be done without the imposing any Oath at all, either upon Magistrates, or Officers, and much less upon ordinary Subjects; since if they are perswaded in their Consciences that it is Lawful to act under this present Government, let them do it if they will; but a for the Common People, I confess they are so stupid, that they have seldom any other measures of the justice or lawfulness of any Govern∣ment,
<PB N="955" REF="514"/>
or Princes Title, than the ease or advantage they find by it; and therefore upon the whole matter, I think it were much better for the Government in the unsetled state it is in, to follow <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Example, and to impose no Oaths of Allegiance at all, since the Government may be as secure without it, (as for all that I can see) they can be with it; and as it is now managed, I see little it can serve for, but to distinguish and divide us one from another; and besides, its being a snare to the Consciences of so many that take it, it is like also to prove the ruine of divers of our Bishops, and other honest Men, both of the Clergy, and Laity, who will certainly rather lose their Dignities and Imployments, than ever take it; which will also cause a great Schism in the Church, as I doubt you will find when it is too late; whereas if these men might have held their Bishopricks, and all other Preferments and Offices without having this Oath impos'd upon them, I doubt not but they would serve both the Church and State in their several stations, according to their duties, and as far as lawfully they could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny but you have spoken very honestly, and like a good English Man, in many things you have now said, in case your inten∣tions towards the present Government were real, as your words are fair; and therefore I cannot wonder that you have been formerly a stiff asserter of the lawfulness and necessity of the Oath of Allegiance, should now be for taking it quite away, now it grows too hard for you self, and those of your Opinion to digest. As if to oblige Sub∣jects to defend their Governours, were a necessary security for your rightful Princes, but were unnecessary for those whom you shall think fit to suppose to be Usurpers. And though I confess I must very much pity the over-nice Principles of those of your way, who are truly peace∣able, and consciencious, and are like to be ruin'd by their refusal of it; yet for all that, I very much doubt whether it would be for the best to take this Oath quite away, since it would make a strange altera∣tion in the Government, to admit all persons into ordinary Charges, much less into Imployments of Trust and Profit without taking any Oath at all. Your only Objections against it are these: First, that you doubt that it is unlawful to impose promissary Oaths, and the next is, that it will not perform the end for which it is intended (<HI>viz.</HI>) to distinguish those who will serve the Government faithfully, and those that will not; since you confess that a great many who are not at all satisfied in their Consciences, will for interest, not only hold their old Imployments, but will also take new ones under it, which I grant is not to be avoided, if men will venture to be damned. So likewise on the other side, I must tell you, that the quite taking away the Oath of Allegiance will not at all mend the matter, but make it much worse; since then, not only those whose Consoiences will give them leave to take the Oaths, but also those who think they ought not to take them, will be alike capable of Imployments; and when they are in them, though I grant they may be both alike free to act as they please against the present Go∣vernment,
<PB N="956" REF="515"/>
and for restoring of King <HI>Iames</HI>; yet I must needs tell you for all that, that I am much more fearful of the ill will or malice of those who think themselues oblig'd in Conscience to overthrow the pre∣sent settlement, and who continue stiff to their first Principles, than of those who will so far comply with this present Government and their own interest, as to take the new Oath of Allegiance in whatever sence they please: for I am very well satisfied, that such men, though they are not so right for the Government as I could wish them, yet either fear of punishment, or else the consideration of their own self-interest, will always make them desire to retain those Imployments they have al∣ready got, since they can never be assured of bettering their Condition under King <HI>Iames,</HI> and a Popish Government, should he ever return; whereas those that are bigotted to Principles, will always think it their duty by vertue of this notion of a Natural Allegiance, as well as their former Oath, to endeavour to restore him by all the ways and means that can ever lie in their power: But as for the unlawfulness of a pro∣missory Oath, since you your self speak doubtfully of it, and few Ca∣suists, except <HI>Grotius,</HI> have been of that Opinion; I think it is not safe to quit our antient Laws, which particularly prescribe, that not only all Magistrates, and Officers, but also all other of the Kings Subjects, should take the old Oath of Fidelity or Allegiance (as we now stile it in the Court Leet, or Sheriffs Torne, when they come to the Age of fourteen years; which Oath as appears by what we can find of it in <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessors, and King <HI>William</HI>'s Laws) which we have al∣ready recited) as also you may find it in Sir <HI>H. Spelman</HI>'s Glossary, <HI>(Tit. Fidelitas)</HI> was made to the King as their Leige Lord, of Life, and Limb; and which implies an active Obedience to defend him a∣gainst all his Enemies, without any exception of such as may claim by Inheritance, or right of Blood.</P>
<P>Now this being so, I cannot be perswaded that the Government ought to quit any lawful means whereby it may preserve it self, and distin∣guish those who would really serve it, from those who will not; and though perhaps the Government may find it self mistaken in its account, in some Men whose Consciences are large enough to swallow any Oath whatsoever, yet I think I may still safely maintain, that it is still in less danger from a few such Libertines, than from those of your Opi∣nion, who would not only keep their Places under this Government, but will also continue in a perfect state of War against it, let them be treated never so kindly; and therefore, as to those dreadful Conse∣quences of Schisms in the Church, and the lessening and dividing our Party; as to the former, we must run the hazard of it, since it was ne∣ver heard of, that the Bishops, who are in some respects Temporal Ba∣rons, held their Bishopricks under any King since the Conquest, with∣out owning his Authority: And I can also shew you, that the King and Parliament have either actually deprived, or else declared such Bi∣shops Traytors to the Government. So that if any such a Schism be
<PB N="957" REF="515"/>
made, it will proceed from a scandal unjustly taken by some scrupulous Men, and not by the Government. And as for the other inconvenience, I think it is much safer for the Government to imploy fewer Men then by not knowing who are Friends or Foes to trust all promiscuously, though perhaps notwithstanding their utmost care, some Men of little or no Con∣sciences will places in this as well as they have done formerly, which can by no other means be prevented as I know off, but by chus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Men of honest Principles, and sober Morals, and of a quiet different Interest, to those imploy'd in the two last Reigns; and therefore I am so far from taking away the present Oath of Allegiance, that I rather wish that there were a new one more strict and full then the present ordain'd to be ta∣ken by all those who shall take Offices, and Employments of Trust or Profit, whereby they should not only declare their present Majesties to be true and lawfull King and Queen of this Realm; but also, that they will defend them against all their Enemies, King <HI>Iames</HI> himself not excep∣ted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess I cannot expect so great a Tenderness from this Govern∣ment, which has been introduced by so much Artifice, that they should absolutely take away all Oaths of Allegiance whatsoever, since I doubt not but it will assume to it self all those advantages which any former usurped Power could pretend to; yet this much I must needs tell you as a Friend, the depriving those Bishops and Dignified Clergymen who shall refuse this new Oath, will be highly ungrateful; since many of them have been as violent opposers of Popery and Arbitrary Government as any Men in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> as appears by their late Petition to the King; if therefore the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and those other Bishops I know to be so averse to this Oath, should be deprived upon the refusal of it, since it will be done uncanonically, by the Temporal Power of an Act of this Convention, with∣out the Sentence of the two Houses of Convocation, I doubt that it will be thought by many to be a sufficient Cause of departing from the present Church Communion, and of seting up distinct Congregations by those who will be deprived, and turned out of their Livings for refusing this Oath, and what the consequence of that may prove God knows.</P>
<P>But whereas you think this present new Oath not full enough, and there∣fore wish there were another made, declaring the present King and Queen to be lawfully and rightfully so, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> since this would amount to as good as an Oath of Abjuration of King <HI>Iames,</HI> and his Title, I doubt it were better let alone; for I do not think the present Government will get any thing by it, since the intent of the Oath you propose, can only serve, either to gain the present Government more new Friends, or else to fix the old ones faster to it, or else to discover secret Enemies; now if I can prove it will not serve for any of these three ends, I suppose you will grant that it were better to let it alone; now that it will be so far from gaining it more Friends, that it will rather serve to drive away a great many from it, is apparent; since many men are now in Offices and Imployments, who think they may law∣fully take this new Oath of Allegiance, as long as the present King and

Queen are not therein declared to be lawfully and rightfully so, and I be∣lieve may serve them faithfully enough in their several stations, who if they should come to be put to it, to declare and swear that they were rightful and lawful King and Queen, would rather lose their places than take it; neither will it fix those that are for this Government faster to it, since those that are zealous for it, will be so whether they took any Oath or not; and I have already proved, that by the word Allegiance in this Oath, it is im∣plied, that the present King and Queen are to be defended as lawfully so, by the Swearer to it, which is the main reason, that I, and those of my O∣pinion, can by no means think it lawful to take it. Nor lastly, will it disco∣ver any secret Enemies to your Government; since those who being rightly instructed in the true sence of this Oath, and what is thereby required, shall notwithstanding, take it against their Conscience, will I doubt take any Oath whatever the Convention shall think fit to impose; since nothing but the fear of losing their present Imployments, or else the desire of getting new ones, could have made them take the Oath as it is, since to my know∣ledge, it hath been taken by many now in Places much against their own judgement; and I doubt the conviction of their Consciences too.</P>
<P>I speak this only in relation to some of loose Principles, but as to my self, and many more of my Acquaintance, who refuse this Oath, we should be so far from taking any Place of Trust under this Government, that we should not do it tho' no Oath were at all required of us; since I think it not only wicked and dishonourable for any honest man to serve a Party only to watch an opportunity to betray it; but I also believe my self obliged by my former Oaths, as well as the duty of a natural Allegiance which I owe the King and his right Heirs, not to serve those whom we look upon as Usurpers of their just Rights.</P>
<P>But if you would also have this new Oath to be an absolute abjuration of the King and his Title, it will not only be unjust, but impossible; since who can tell but either by the help of a foreign Force, or the general consent of the Nation, tired out by a long expensive War, either his Majesty, or the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> may be again placed upon the Throne; and then sure, whenever they shall call a Parliament to recognize their Title, they will be even accord∣ing to your own hypothesis, more lawful and rightful Kings than King <HI>William,</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; since they will not be only Kings <HI>de facto,</HI> but <HI>de jure</HI> too; and therefore I believe it was out of this Consideration; that in all those long and various Contests which so often happen'd between Competi∣tors for the Crown, they never presumed to proposed to the Parliament the passing any Act to impose an Oath to abjure the Title or Person of the Rival Prince. Thus in all the long Wars between King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and <HI>Maud</HI> the Empress, as also between the two Houses of <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> each of whom, as they prevail'd in their turns, were very well contented to make the Subjects take the ordinary Oath of Fidelity to themselves, without abjuring each others Title; and even in the later times of the Rump Parlia∣ment, when the most violent and hot-headed Commonwealths-Men would have imposed an Oath of Abjuration of <HI>Charles Stuart,</HI> and all his Family,
<PB N="959" REF="516"/>
(as they then termed his late Majesty) the most Wise and Moderate Men among them, such as <HI>Lenthal</HI> their Speaker, and others, stifly oppos'd it, saying it would be a fighting against Providence, to take an Oath never to own his Majesty for their King, if once he should come in again without their assistance; and I think there is as much, if not more reason now against such an Oath of Abjuration, as ever there was then.</P>

<P>I cannot deny but you have spoken like an honest Man, in absolutely refusing to act under this Government, though without an Oath, unless you could be satisfied of the lawfulness of the Powers to whom it is taken. And I must acknowledge, that you therein act with much more Sincerity and Ho∣nour, then divers of your Party, who tho they have been, and are of your Opinion, as to the Justice of King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Title, yet think they may take this Oath well enough in that looser and more qualified Sence you grant they put upon it; and therefore to answer in the first place, what you have said against the imposing any more explicite or stricter Oath of Allegiance, then what is already appointed, though I think I can very well answer all the Ar∣guments you have now brought against it: Yet to let you see I am a fair Ad∣versary, I will shew you how far I agree with you, and wherein I must differ from you.</P>
<P>In the first place therefore let me tell you, That you very much mistake me, if you believe, that by this new Oath I propose, I'do design an express Abju∣ration of King <HI>Iames,</HI> or the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> in Case that King should ever happen to recover the Throne, and call a Parliament who shall again Re∣cognize him for lawful King, and the Prince for the Right and Undoubted Heir of the Crown. I am too sensible of the frequent Alterations that have happened in this Nation, even to desire or propose any such thing, since a Man may as well abjure the having a Feavour, or the Small Pox. Change of Government, and consequently our submission to it, when ever it hap∣pens, being no more in our power to prevent then the having those Diseases; all therefore that I intend by a stricter, and more explicate Oath of Allegi∣ance, is, only for Men who shall undertake any imployments of Trust and Consequence, either Spiritual, Civil or Military in the Common-wealth, since I grant the Oath as it is now worded may be sufficient for all ordinary Subjects, from whom a passive Submission, and true Obedience is a sufficient performance of their Duty; but as for all others that either now have, or expect to enjoy Places of Trust, I could wish a stricter Oath asserting their present Majesties to be lawful and rightful King and Queen of this Kingdom, and that the Taker will defend them in the present Possession of it, to the ut∣most of their Power against all Persons whatsoever, King <HI>Iames</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> not excepted; and this I must think necessary, not only from that Low and qualified Sence of this Oath, which I gave at the beginning of this Nights Conversation, and in which Sence you cannot deny, but that many if not the greater part of those, who still hold such imployments have lately taken it, and as long as they do so, how they can ever think themselves obli∣ged to defend their Majesties against King <HI>Iames,</HI> nay, or any <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Popish</HI> Forces that shall act by his Commission, I cannot understand; for since they
<PB N="960" REF="517"/>
now look upon the present King and Queen, to have no other right to the Crown than what their bare Power and present Possession of it gives them, no wonder if such Men take the first opportunity to Revolt, and joyn with King <HI>Iames</HI> as soon as ever he Lands with an Army, or appears upon our Coasts with any Fleet formidable enough to oppose ours, and (must also, if they are true to their Principles) in the mean time do all they can to protect, and indemnifie those who being of tender Consciences, cannot stretch it as far as themselves, and who under-hand do Act as far as they dare for King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Interest; and though it is true you have very solidly proved, not only as a Civilian, but like a Lawyer that the word Allegiance inserted in this Oath, does of its own Nature imply, not only that the King or Queen to whom it is taken ought to be rightly and lawfully so, but that more than a bare Neutrality, <HI>viz.</HI> a reall and vigorous defence of them, and their right against all their Enemies is required, and imply∣ed by it, and that is one great Reason why you say you cannot take it. Now though I confess the Reason you have given are very weighty, and convincing, yet since the words are in themselves too general, and doubtfull for every Person that takes or holds such Offices or Imploy∣ments of Trust, to understand it in that Sence, I could be glad there were another more plain and explicite Oath to be administred to those who expect to keep or hold such Imployments. Since the present Go∣vernment cannot well be safe without it, as long as such Persons are im∣ployed, who can take the Oath with a Mental Reservation of serving King <HI>Iames</HI> as soon they safely may by vertue of that former Oath of Allegi∣ance they have taken to him.</P>
<P>This being the Case, I shall now answer all the Objections you have brought against it, which indeed are rather framed to keep those Men in places that they may serve your designs when ever they are a∣ble; than to do any service to tender Consciences. First then I think I may maintain, that such an Oath will notwithstanding what you have now said, have contrary effects than what you are pleased to allow; for in the first place, it will gain the present Government more new Friends amongst these Neuters, who steer their Allegiance to it only from its present Settlement, and the hopes of its Continuance when they find that none can be imployed in places of publick Trust, who will not take an Oath to acknowledge their present Majesties to be Lawfull and Rightfull King and Queen, and who will also Swear to Defend their just Right, which will for the most part put Place<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Trust into their Hands, who will think themselves oblig'd faithfully to perform what they have Sworn. Secondly, it will also fix the old Friends of this Government faster to it, when they see none but themselves, or those who will really come in∣to the Government upon their Principles admitted to such Places of pro∣fit and trust; and whoever will take this Oath, are to be presumed to take it willingly and wittingly, and understanding what they do, since the words will be of themselves so plain and evident, that they will ad∣mit none of those loose, and doubtfull Sences in which so many have
<PB N="961" REF="517"/>
taken the present Oath of Allegiance; but your main Objection against this is, that a new Oath will not discover secret Enemies to the Govern∣ment, because that most of the same Persons that have taken the former Oath will take any other that can be requir'd of them; which I sup∣pose is not so, since you your self do grant that such an Oath would be a snare to a great many, who if it were not for that, would serve this Government faithfully enough, that is to say, as long as there is no ne∣cessity of shewing their Good-will to King <HI>Iames,</HI> or have no opportunity given of returning to their former Allegiance to him with safety to them∣selves: and you your self cannot deny, but according to their Principles they must needs perform it when ever they think they may; now certain∣ly it were very well to be rid of such false Friends (if it were possible to discover them) by such an Oath, then to keep them where they are, on∣ly to take an opportunity not only of doing a Mischief, but of serving this Government very carelessly and lukewarmly, whilst they are in those places they enjoy; as also of favouring and assisting those that are the declare Asserters of King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Right as far as they dare; so that then all the dis∣pute remains about those who having Consciences large enough to swallow any Oath whatever, provided it will suit with their present advantage; no Oath can tye them, or serve to discover their private Sentiments; as I cannot deny but that there too many Men of such large Consciences as you describe, and could heartily wish they were fewer, yet though I grant an Oath alone will not keep them out; yet it might be in great part prevented, if the King would take a true Character of the Men fit for publick Imployment, from those about him of whose Worth and for∣mer Intergity he is already fully satisfied; but admitting, some such Men shall get into Places, and consequently when they are in, manage things for their own Advantage, (that is, Vilely and Corruptly;) yet even these will not prove half so fatal to the Government as those Men of half Consciences, who think they may take this Oath in their Own Sense, and for their own present Advantage, and also believe it no Breach of it to assist King <HI>Iames</HI> whenever safely they may, because they hold their pre∣sent Oath to be only Temporary, but their former to have a perpetual Obligation upon them. Whereas those of no Principles at all never E∣spouse any Interest longer then it serves their own turns; so that as long as they can make their Fortunes under this Government, they will never desire to change it for another, in which they cannot but expect a much less free enjoyment of their Liberties, and Properties, which are things that all Men (as well those who have no Principles, as well as those that have) desire to to enjoy. And lastly, some even of these Men that have been formerly notorious Asserters, of, and advanced in the Arbitrary Go∣vernment of King <HI>Iames</HI> out of shame and as well as fear of the loss of their Credits with those of their own Party (which they are not assur'd but may again prevail) will stick to take this stricter Oath, though they do not this that is now enjoyned, since they can find an Evasion for the one, but will scarce be able to do it for the other.</P>

<P>I grant that such an Oath would be a Vertual, and implied Abjurati∣on of King <HI>Iames</HI>'s present claim to the Crown, and would also oblige all Persons to fight against him, and hinder his regaining it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which though I grant to be the design of it; Yet would not such an Oath oblige us at all to abjure the obeying King <HI>Iames,</HI> should he ever by an irrestible Providence be again set over us, since it is not abjuring of a Future, but a present right which I now contend for; and that, all the Antient Oath of Fidelity or Allegiance (as it is now called) were of the like Na∣ture, and taken in the same Sence with this I propose: I shall shew you from the form of the Oath of Fidelity, which all Freemen were to take at Fourteen Years of Age, as appears by King <HI>William</HI> the Firsts Law which I have so often cited,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE>
<Q>Whereby all Free∣men were to affirm upon Oath, that within the Realm and without, they will be True and Faithfull to King <HI>William</HI> their Lord, and preserve his Lands, and Honour with all Fidelity; together with his Per∣son, and defend them against all his Enemies.</Q>
So likewise in the anci∣ent Oath of Homage, which was taken by all the Earls, Barons, and Te∣nants in Capite in <HI>England,</HI> at the Coronation of our Kings: It was in these words,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vi Spelmans</HI>'s <HI>Gloss.</HI> f. 23. H.</NOTE>
<Q>I <HI>N.

Spelman</HI> gives us out of the Customary of <HI>Normandy,</HI> the words were much the same, only the person is there sworn to be True, and Faithful in the King and his Heirs (which they were not be∣fore <HI>Edward</HI> the Firsts time.)</Q>
And also what they would hear of no Evil or Damage against them, which they would not hinder to their Power; now pray tell me, were not all these Oaths taken to the King for the time be∣ing, as Lawfull and Rightfull King? and since they were thereby to yield him Life and Limb, that is, were to defend him with their Lives against all his Enemies, then certainly all others who might pretend to, or claim the Crown were included within this number; and though it is true in these ancient Oaths, there is no Swearing to the present King, as Lawfull and Right∣full King, yet these words were needless in that Age; when (as I have prov∣ed at our last meeting) there was no difference between a King <HI>de Iure,</HI> and one <HI>de facto</HI>; and whoever was crowned King, and Elected, or Recognized by the great Council of the Kingdom, was looked upon as Lawfull and Right∣full King, and as such, was to be defended against all his Enemies; so that it was till that distinction was broacht, that there might be a King <HI>de de facto,</HI> different from the King <HI>de jure,</HI> (which I have proved was not elder then <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
<PB N="963" REF="518"/>
the IV<HI>ths.</HI> Reign.) There was no need of any mention of such words in the Oath of Allegiance as lawfull King, and lawfull Heirs, which are first found in the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, prescribed by the Statutes of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and King <HI>Iames</HI>; in the latter of which, (it is needless to recite it Verbatim) it is first sworn, That the King's Majesty is Lawfull and Rightfull King: secondly, There is an express abjuration of the pretended Au∣thority of the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> which shews that the Abjuration of the Tem∣poral as well as Spiritual Right of a Foreign Prince (who claims it ever since King <HI>Iohns</HI> Resignation) is no new invention; and lastly, there is an express abjuration or Engagement to defend the King's Person to the ut∣most of the Swearers Power against all Conspiracies at Attempts whatsoever, and why the same words may not be inserted into this new Oath, as well as it was in those. I can see no Reason since they are only Declarative and Per∣suant to the late Act of the Convention, whereby after the Declaration of the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects, King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> are Declared,
<Q>That they were, and of Right ought to be by the Laws of this Realm, our Soveraign Leige, Lord and Lady, and King and Queen of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>

<P>Well, it is late, and besides to no purpose to argue this Point any longer, since it concerns not me, nor any of my Principles what new Oaths you make and impose upon those whose Consciences will never per∣mit us to take them. What I have said, was only to shew you the Folly, and Weakness of such Oaths, and Consequently, that they can be subservi∣ent to no other end then a renewal and aggravation of the Sin of Perjury a∣mong us, which God forgive this sinful Nation, among the many crying Sins it now growns under. Yet give me leave still to mind you, that you have not given any answer to the Objection I have made concerning the Schism that is like to follow from the depriving of all such Bishops and Cler∣gy that shall refuse to take the new Oath by such a time, which Deprivation being uncanonically ordain'd by the meer lay power of the Convention, with∣out the authority of a Convocation or Synod; such proceedings are sufficient cause for all of our way to break off all Church Communion with you, as soon as the Arch Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and those other Bishops shall happen to be de∣prived and new ones put in their Places, since all Church Communion wholly depends upon the lawfullness of the Bishops, who are the supreme Pastors of our Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I forgot to say any thing of this, because I said so much to answer concerning the new Oath I proposed as sit to taken by those in places of Trust; but since you desire it, I shall say somewhat though not so large as I could speak upon this Subject, First, I must tell you it is altogether a new No∣tion, and contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> whereby it is declared that the Kings of this Realm have the same Power with Persons in the Church, as the Kings of <HI>Iudah</HI> and <HI>Israel</HI> had among the Jews; therefore you must either depart from the Doctrine of this Canon, or else the King and Parliament, (who are certainly as much the supreme Power of the Na∣tion, as the Kings of <HI>Iudah</HI> were to that of the Jews) may as well deprive
<PB N="964" REF="519"/>
the Arch Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> (for Example) for Treason, or Disobedi∣ence to the Government, as <HI>Solomon</HI> did <HI>Abiathar</HI> for Anointing his Brother <HI>Adonijah</HI> King; and besides this, I can shew you many Examples of the like power exercised by the Roman and Greek Emperours, in depriving and banishing not only Bishops, but Patriarchs; for the matters of State without any Sentence or Judgment of a Synod, or general Council of other Bishops; if your Doctrine were true, the poor Greek Church would be in a sad Con∣dition and all her Members in a perpetual Schism for some Ages past; that there hath been scarce any Canonical Elections or Deprivations of the Patri∣archs of any of the great Seats, <HI>viz. Constantinople, Antioch,</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> but they are all nominated, and put in and out at the Grand Seigniors, nay, Visiers Will and Pleasure, as any Man who will but pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Sr. <HI>Paul Rycauts</HI> account of the Greek Church may easily see.</P>
<P>But indeed you fall into this Errour for want of considering the original of Bishop-pricks in <HI>England,</HI> and the true meaning of this intended De∣privation; for pray take Notice, that though Episcopacy was setled in <HI>England</HI> in the time of the <HI>Britains,</HI> yet all the Seas, and Jurisdictions of the Bishops of this Realm, in respect of such and such Diocesses, have been wholly owe∣ing to the bounty of our Kings, and the Authority of our Great Councils, which were also confirmed by the Popes Bulls; and since the Reformation to the Authority of the King and Parliament, as were all the Bishop-pricks e∣rected in <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII<HI>ths.</HI> Reign; so that let the Bishops meer Spiritual Power of Ordaining, Excommunicating, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be derived immediately from Christ if you please; yet the Exercise thereof as limited and appointed to this or that Precint or See, is as meer a temporal Institution, as that of Parishes which was not introduced till long after Christianity was settled in this Island. So that the Exercise of this Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction within the See of <HI>Canterbury</HI> (for Example) being a Civil Institution, it hath anciently belonged to Supream Powers, not only to confer this Power, (as appears by their ancient Investitures of our Bishops <HI>per Baculum &amp; Annu∣lum</HI>) but also to take it away, for Treason or Disobedience against the State; since the King and Parliament do not pretend to deprive them of their Spiritual Character, or Episcopal Orders, but only of their right to exercise it within such Sees, or Diocesses; thus, although the Arch-Bishop of <HI>York</HI> and the Bishops of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Wichester,</HI> with the rest of the Po∣pish Bishops, were deprived by Act of Parliament in 1<SUP>o</SUP><HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> for not taking the Oath of Supremacy; the Queen and Parliament never took upon them to degrade those Bishops of their Episcopal Orders, but only to forbid their acting as Bishops in their former respective Diocesses, and there∣fore I doubt not, but that notwithstanding this Depriviation, those Bishops might (if they had pleased) have ordained Priests, and confirmed Children, and that such Ordinations and Confirmations, would been good even in our Protestant Church, if such Priests or Children had afterwards turned Protestants; since 'tis very well known that the Church of <HI>England</HI> ownes the orders of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> to be valid which is more then we do for the ordinations of meer Presbyters coming from those Pro∣testant
<PB N="965" REF="519"/>
Countrys where there are no Bishops at all; the like I may say for their Confirmations too.</P>
<P>But pray Sir, consider how upon your Principles, this Schism can be so Universal as to influence and involve all <HI>England</HI> in it, for if the Arch Bi∣shop of <HI>Yorke</HI> (for example) will rather take this Oath then suffer Depri∣vation, and that the rest of the Bishops of his Province should be of the mind (as I am credibly informed they will;) pray tell me how the People of that Province (being a distinct Church, or body Ecclesiastical from that of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as to all Spiritual matters, as having a distinct Convocation of their own,) can ever be involved in this Schism, by the deprivation of the Arch Bishop and Bishops of the Province of <HI>Canterbury</HI>?</P>
<P>And pray also tell me in the next place, how all the Members of the two Universities can ever be involv'd in this intended Schism, since they owe no Canonical Obedience to the Arch-Bishops of <HI>Canterbury</HI> or <HI>York,</HI> nor to any other Bishop, but only to their Chancellour and the Vice-Chancel∣lour as his Deputy, who exercise all Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction within the said Universities; and therefore their Church Communion cannot depend upon the Canonical or Uncanonical deprivation of any Bishops in <HI>England</HI> I desire you to consider these things as a Canon-Lawyer, and give me your answer if you can, against the next time we meet, and then tell me whether the causes of this threatned Schism be so just and apparent that it is like to involve so many of the Wisest, and most Considerate of the Clergy and Laity into open separation from the Church, as you suppose it will; not but that I will grant there be many of the Clergy of this Opinion; who as well out of Conscience, as for their own interest, will be contented to set up and encourage such a separation, thereby to make themselves heads of se∣parate Congregations, when they shall be deprived of their present Benefices and Imployments, upon their refusal of this Oath.</P>

<P>I must confess I never heard so much said upon this head before; and if you could make out to me all the matters of fact you have now in∣stanced in, I know not but that I may come over to your Opinion; tho' let me tell you, this is the first time that ever you can shew me that any Bishops were deprived in <HI>England</HI> by the meer Lay Authority of the King, and a Great Council or Convention of the Laity, whilst they continued of the same Church-Communion with those Bishops; for as to your instance of the Popish Bishops deprived by Parliament in the Reign of Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth,</HI> I doubt you will find it does not come up to the Point in question, since the Queen and Parliament having then newly declared themselves Pro∣testants, did not own them for true and Orthodox Bishops, and consequently thought they might justly depart from their Communion, and upon the same account might deprive them, and the Queen might then nominate others of their own Religion in their Places.</P>

<P>I cannot but differ from you in the matter of fack as you now relate it;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Dr.</HI> Burnet'<HI>s Hist. of the Reformation.</HI> 2d <HI>Part.</HI></NOTE> for Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and the Parliament were when they made this Act, so far from being separated from the
<PB N="966" REF="520"/>
outward Communion of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that Mass was then said, and the Romish Priests still continued in all the Parishes and Churches of <HI>England,</HI> and yet they still maintain'd an outward Communion, though their Bishops were deprived by the Civil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower, and others ordain'd in their stead. So that it is plain, the Papists themselves had then no notion of this new cause of Schism, by reason of their Bishops being Uncanonically deprived; nor indeed can we well vindicate the Honour or Legality of our Reformation, if the Protestant Bishops who succeeded in the places of those who were thus deprived by Act of Parliament, could not be Canonical, because their Predecessors deprived by the Lay Power, were still alive.</P>
<P>But admit this was the first time that ever it had been thus practiced, yet if it were then reasonable, and done upon good grounds; I cannot see but when the necessity of the Church and State require it, and that the Clergy in Convocation are so wilfull, and wedded to some old false notions, as not to consult the peace and safety of the Church and Kingdom; why the King and Queen (who are acknowledged to be Supream over Ecclesiastical as well as Temporal Persons) may not together with the two Houses of Parliament make the like Law now, as was done in the first of Queen <HI>E∣lizabeth,</HI> for a less matter; for none of those Popish Bishops, though they believed Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to have no better than a Parliament Title to the Crown, yet ever denied her to be their lawful and rightful Queen; only they would not own her Supremacy in Spiritual Matters.</P>
<P>But leaving the farther discussion of this Point, to those who better un∣derstand it, I would gladly know of you what you intend to do, and what you would have us do, who are like to be made Deputy Lieutenants and Justices of Peace; for if as you your self allow, there be a necessity that some Civil Government be maintain'd during King <HI>Iames</HI>'s absence, I desire to know of you how it can be managed, and who shall manage it, in case all the Gentlemen of <HI>England</HI> were of your Principle, and should positively re∣fuse the Oath of Allegiance to their present Majesties; for if King <HI>Iames</HI> be never so much our lawful King, it is not now possible for us to be Govern'd by him, since he is go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and God knows whether ever he may re∣turn again; since then you cannot have him if you would; and that there is a necessity we should be Govern'd by some body. And since it is also as certain, that those who actually Govern us, will exact this, or the like Oaths of Allegiance from us, as were due to their Predecessors, and that no man must expect to enjoy or execute any Place or Office, not only of profit, but of burthen and charge, for the necessary execution of Justice, and the maintenance of Civil Government (without which we cannot live or subsist) without taking this new Oath of Allegiance, as the only means to qualifie them for it; if then the end (<HI>viz.</HI>) Civil Government, be abso∣lutely necessary, and the taking of this Oath is the only means allow'd of to qualifie men for it, this seems as evident to me, that taking of this Oath is not only justifiable by Law, but by Reason, and good Consci∣ence; since it is done for the highest and noblest end; (<HI>viz.</HI>) the pub∣lick

good of the whole Nation, or Common wealth; which you grant can∣not subsist without some kind of Civil Government amongst us.</P>

<P>I will say something in answer to what you have now alledged con∣cerning the necessity of taking of the Oath, in order to the maintenance of some Civil Government, without which I grant the Kings good Subjects cannot subsist till his return; since I confess this is the strongest Argument you have yet brought; all I can say to it at present, it, that if all your Country Gentlemen, and all the Lawyers in <HI>England,</HI> would be so firm in their Loyalty to his Majesty, as unanimously to declare that they cannot take this Oath with a safe Conscience, the consequence then would be, that either the present Usurped Power must be forced to give up the Go∣vernment to the right owner, or else they must at least desist from pres∣sing this Oath upon you.</P>

<P>You know well enough this is altogether a vain supposition, since you cannot but be sensible that their Majesties have not only a sufficient force both of Native Englishmen, and Foreigners on their side, who can force those that should make any opposition to the taking it; and that there are also many Fanaticks, and Common-wealths Men, who not looking upon them∣selves as at all oblig'd by your notions of Natural Allegiance, and the obli∣gations of any former Oath of Allegiance, will get into all the Offices and Imployments of the Kingdom, to the great prejudice and destruction, not only of the Church, but the Monarchy it self, which is as yet preserv'd, tho the Person that administred it is alter'd; so that it would conduce nothing to King <HI>Iames</HI>'s Affairs, if all the Gentry and Lawyers of the Kingdom should go about to refuse this Oath, which, as I have already proved, they are also obliged to take by the Law of the Land, and also that greater Law of prosecuting the publick good of the Nation, to the utmost of their power-</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, since I cannot expect so great firmness of mind and courage from your Country Gentlemen, and especially the Lawyers, who have been always but too forward to comply with all Governments, how unlawful so∣ever, and since you, who think that you may lawfully take this Oath, not only by the Law of the Land, which you have interpreted to countenance your Opinion, but also from a higher and nobler Law <HI>(viz.)</HI> that of the common good of the Nation, or Civil Society, which I grant must be main∣tain'd during the Kings absence, since you say there is a necessity for it, though I am not fully satisfied of the lawfulness of it, so far as to take it my self, yet will I not absolutely condemn you or any other sincerely and ho∣nest men, who do only take it out of a good intent, to maintain some Civil Government amongst us, and also to keeping out the Phanaticks from having any share in it; so I hope the Government will excuse me, if my Conscience will not give me leave to take it my self, since there are enough of you who are free to do it without us; so that if I cannot keep that small Imployment I have without taking this new Oath, I will freely give it up, since as long as I am not satisfied in my Conscience of the lawfulness of it, and whatsoever is not of Faith, is Sin, as the Apostle has truly defin'd it.</P>

<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you speak very honestly, and charitably in this matter, and I could wish all those of your Opinion had the like moderation, and that they would not condemn of wilful Perjury so many good Bishops, Noble-Men, Gentlemen, and others, both of the Clergy, and Laity, who have been perswaded that they might take this Oath with a safe Conscience, and therefore pray, however we differ in Opinion about these matters, let us maintain the same Friendship for each other as we had before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I readily embrace so fair and kind an offer, and as I hope you will do me what kind offices you can whilst you continue to act under this Government, so I will promise to do the same for you, when ever the King shall come to be restor'd to his Throne again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I willingly and thankfully accept the proposal of the continuance of your Friendship, since I look upon your dissenting from me, not to pro∣ceed from any wilfulness or obstinacy, but out of a tender Conscience, and too great and high a sence of your duty, which I must still confess are er∣rours on the right hand; and therefore now taking my leave of you, shall only desire you to believe me your real Friend, and humble Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you think I have the same esteem for you, and therefore must always own my self yours.</P>

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX, Containing some Authorities sit to be added, for farther confirmation of some things laid down in the foregoing Dialogues.</HEAD>
<P>TO be added to Dialogue the Fourth, p. 290. at the end of <HI>F—s</HI> Speech, [after these words] no parti∣cular Church can, read thus,</P>
<P>And that divers of the most Eminent Divines of our Church have used the same freedom with several other Doctrines contained in these Homilies, may appear from Dr. <HI>Hammonds,</HI> Dr. <HI>Heylins,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Taylors,</HI> with seve∣ral other Eminent Writers, expresly denying, that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> is guilty of Idolatry, or, that the <HI>Pope</HI> is <HI>Antichrist</HI>; tho' both these Doctrines are as plainly laid down in the <NOTE N="(*)" PLACE="marg">Vide 2d <HI>Vol. of Homil.</HI> 1st, 2d, <HI>and</HI> 3d <HI>part of the Sermons a∣gainst Ido∣latry, espe∣cially the last,</HI> p. 156.162, 163.</NOTE> Homilies, as the Doctrine of <HI>Non-Resist∣ance.</HI> And yet none of these Men are ever taxed by those of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for quitting her Ancient Ortho∣dox Doctrines; and I desire you to give me a good Rea∣son (if you can) why it is more lawful and excusable to part with the former of these Doctrines, than the latter?</P>
<P>The like I may say also for the Doctrine of Predestina∣tion; which tho expresly asserted in the 36 Articles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as interpreted by all the Bishops, and Writers, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and King <HI>Iames,</HI> as also the Bishops and Divines sent as Delegates from our Church, to the Synod of <HI>Dort,</HI> who joyned in the inter∣pretation
<PB REF="535"/>
of that Article, in the strict <HI>Calvinistical</HI> sense; you find in all the determinations of that Synod against the Doctrines of the <HI>Arminians,</HI> which then began to prevail; yet since the time that Arch-Bishop <HI>Laud</HI> had the nominating of what Persons he thought fit to be made Bishops, Deans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not one in ten of them but have been <HI>Arminians</HI> in all those Points, wherein they wholly differ from the Do∣ctrine of <HI>Calvin,</HI> which is but the same with that of our 36 Articles so interpreted; yet none of the Divines of our present Church, who hold these Opinions, are bran∣ded with Apostacy from its Ancient Doctrine; but if any well meaning Divine, out of love to his Country, and to prevent Popery and Slavery from breaking in upon us, have but Preach'd or Publish'd any thing in derogation to these Darling Doctrines of Passive Obedience, and Non-Resistance, he is straight branded with Apostacy from the Church, in quitting its main distinguishing Character; and we have lately seen Degrading, nay, the most cruel Whip∣ping, and Imprisonment thought too little for such a Man; but one may say of some Men with truth enough,
<Q><L>Dat veniam Corvis, vexat censura Columbis.</L></Q></P>
<P>So Dialogue the Sixth, <HI>p.</HI> 397. at the bottom, [after these words] in those times, read this,</P>
<P>But that the House of Commons were anciently often comprehended under the stile of <HI>Grantz</HI> (which is the same with <HI>Magnates</HI> in Latine) pray consult the Parliament Rolls of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>N.</HI> 6.</NOTE> where you will find in the 4<HI>th</HI> of that King, this passage; <HI>&amp; est assentu, &amp; accorde per nostre &amp; Seigneur le Roy, &amp; tous les Grantz in pleyn Parliament</HI>; (that is, in full Parliament, where both Lords and Com∣mons were present) that the Proceedings of the Lords a∣gainst those that were no Peers should not be drawn into
<PB REF="535"/>
Example, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now pray see the Commentaries of the most Learned and Reverend Author of the Grand Question,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 115.</NOTE> upon these words in this Record;
<Q>This hath all the for∣mality of an Act of Parliament, and therefore all the E∣states were present, so likewise in the same year; in the next Roll but one;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>N.</HI> 8.</NOTE> <HI>Accorde est per nostre Seigneur le Roy, &amp; son Counsell in Plein Parliament</HI>; which was an Act of Parliament, concerning those that had followed the Earl of <HI>Lancaster.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>N.</HI> 10.</NOTE> So in the 5<HI>th</HI> of this King, we have the par∣ticular mention of the Bishops, as some of those who make a full Parliament; <HI>Accorde est per nostre Seigneur le Roy,</HI> Prelates, Counts, Barons, <HI>&amp; autres Grands de Roi∣a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me in pleyn Parliament.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>N.</HI> 5.</NOTE> So in the 6<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> the Ill<HI>d,</HI> the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> made his Oration in <HI>pleyn Parliament,</HI> which is thus explained, <HI>en le presence nostre Seigneur le Roy, &amp; tous les Prelats, &amp; autres Grantz.</HI> And in another Roll, <HI>si est accorde &amp; assentu per tous in pleyn Parliament</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>N.</HI> 9.</NOTE> and who these were, we are told in the same Roll; <HI>viz. les Prelats, Counts, Barons, &amp; tous les autres Summons à misme Parliament.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now this is the clearest explication of these words in full Parliament, <HI>viz.</HI> in the presence of all those who were Summon'd; so that if the Commons were then Summon'd to this Parliament, (as certainly they were) they must have given their Assents under the Title of Grantz; since the Prelats, Earls, and Barons were particularly mention'd before.</P>
<P>To <HI>Dialogue</HI> the 10<HI>th, p.</HI> 706. after these words, <HI>be Re∣formed by them,</HI> or not, read thus,</P>
<P>And that King <HI>Iames</HI> the First, himself was satisfied of this Original Contract, may appear by his own words, in a Speech to both Houses of Parliament, <HI>1609.</HI> where he ex∣presly tells them, that the King binds himself by a double Oath to the observation of the fundamental Laws of his Kingdom, <HI>Tacitly,</HI> as being a King, and so bound to Pro∣tect, as well the People, as the Laws of his Kingdom; and
<PB REF="536"/>
expresly by his Oath at his Coronation; so as every King in a setled Kingdom, is bound to observe that paction made to his People by his Laws, in framing the Government as agreeable thereunto, according to that paction which God made with <HI>Noah</HI> after the Deluge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>Dialogue</HI> 12. <HI>p.</HI> 874. <HI>after their Successors,</HI> add this.</P>
<P>So that all the Modern Acts of Parliament for intailing the Crown, being made and ordained by the Counsel and Assent of the Lords, and Commons, are so many plain de∣clarations, and evident Recognitions, what the Fundamen∣tal Constitution of the English Government was in that grand Point.</P>
<P>To <HI>Dialogue</HI> the 12<HI>th, p.</HI> 898. <HI>after the words of the said Parish,</HI> read thus; and that not only all the Private Acts of that Parliament, but some Publick ones also, tho' never confirmed in the following Parliament of the 13th of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, are yet held good in Law, appears by these that follow, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">12. Car. 2. c. 3.</NOTE>1. <HI>An Act for Continuance of Process, and Iudicial Pro∣ceedings, Continu'd.</HI></P>
<P>By which, all Writs, Pleas, Indictments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then de∣pending, were ordered to stand, and proceeded on, not∣withstanding want of Authority in the late Usurpers; and therein it was farther ordained, that Process and Proceed∣ings in Courts of Justice, should be in the English Tongue, and the generall Issue be Pleaded, till <HI>August</HI> 1. 1660. as if the Acts made during the Usurpation, for that purpose, had been good and effectual Laws.</P>
<P>And upon this foot only, stand many Fines, Recoveries, Judgments, and other Proceedings at Law had and passed between <HI>April</HI> 25, 1660, and <HI>August</HI> 1. 1660.</P>
<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg">12. Car. 2. c. 17.</NOTE>2. <HI>An Act for Conforming and Restoring of Ministers.</HI></P>
<P>This Act is usually to this day, set forth and pleaded in <HI>Quare impedits,</HI> tho' it was said to be refused upon debate to be confirmed in the House of Commons, 13th of <HI>Car.</HI> II. when divers other Acts of the same time were confirmed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">13. Car. 2. c. 17. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>
<PB REF="536"/>
yet both these Acts having no other Authority but from that Convention (as you call it) have been Judged and Con∣stantly allowed to be good Laws, for above these 30 years.</P>
<P>To <HI>Dialogue</HI> the 13<HI>th, p.</HI> 966. after these words, <HI>were still alive,</HI> read this,</P>
<P>And to shew you that the King and Parliament have de∣prived even Bishops of their own Communion, and that such deprivations have been held good, and that the King hath nominated new Bishops upon the vacancy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">148. P. 123.</NOTE> you may see in Dr. <HI>Burnets</HI> History of the Reformation, and in the Ap∣pendix to it, where you will find a memorable Act of Par∣liament of the 25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII, (before his departure from his obedience to the See of <HI>Rome</HI>) whereby Cardinal <HI>Campegio,</HI> and <HI>Hieronimo de Ghinicci</HI> were deprived of the Bishopricks of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and <HI>Worcester,</HI> which they had held for near 20 years, and <HI>Campegio</HI> had without doubt been in∣stalled in it when he was in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><Q>The Act it self being so remarkable, I shall give you some passages out of it verbatim; first the Preamble sets forth, that whereas before this time the Church of <HI>England</HI> by the Kings most Noble Progenitors, and the Nobles of the same, hath been founded, ordained, and establish'd in the Estate and degree of Prelacy, Dignities, and other Promotions Spiritual, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
(which sufficiently confirms what I but now asserted, that all the Bishopricks were founded by our Kings, with the consent of their Grand Councils, or Parliaments) and then it proceeds to recite, that whereas all Persons promoted to Ecclesiastical Benefices, ought to reside within the Realm, for Preaching the Laws of Almighty God, and keeping hospitality;
<Q>and since these Prelates had not ob∣served these things, but lived at <HI>Rome,</HI> and carried the Re∣venues of their Bishopricks out of the Kingdom, contrary to the intention of the Founders, and to the great prejudice of the Realm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in consideration whereof, it is Enacted by the Authority of this present Parliament, that the said two Sees, and Bishopricks of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and <HI>Worcester,</HI> and
<PB REF="537"/>
either of them, henceforth shall be taken, reputed, and accounted in the Law to be void, vacant, and utterly de∣stitute of any Incumbent, or Prelate, and then follows a Clause enabling the King, his Heirs, and Successors, to no∣minate and appoint Successors (being the Natives of this Realm) to the said Sees, and the King did nominate Suc∣cessors according to the said Act.</Q></P>
