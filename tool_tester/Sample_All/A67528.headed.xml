<HEAD>A
TRIP
TO
New-England, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BISHOPS, Bailiffs, and Bastards, were the three Terrible Persecu∣tions
which chiefly drove our unhappy Brethren to seek their For∣tunes
in our Forreign Colonies. One of these Bug-bears, I confess,
frighted me from the Blessings of my own dear Native Country; and
forc'd me to the Fatigue of a long Voyage, to escape a Scouring.</P>
<P>But whether <HI>Zeal, Debt,</HI> or the sweet Sin of <HI>Procreation,</HI> begot in my
Conscience those Fears, which hurried me a great many Leages be∣yond
my <HI>Senses,</HI> I am as unwilling to declare to the World, as a <HI>Romish</HI>
Damsel that has lost her <HI>Maiden-head,</HI> is to confess her Frailty to the Priest.</P>
<P>For many Years my <HI>Mind</HI> sat as Easie in my <HI>Breast,</HI> as an <HI>Alderman</HI> in
an <HI>Elbow-Chair,</HI> till the Devil envying my Felicity, flung so many <HI>Crosses</HI>
and <HI>Losses</HI> in my way, that every Step I took in my Occupation, I was
timorous of Tumbling.</P>
<P>I thought it then high time to seek for Balm, but finding none in
<HI>Gilead,</HI> I was mov'd by the Spirit of Necessity, to forsake Ungodly <HI>London,</HI>
for Religious <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England;</HI> hoping to <HI>Purifie</HI> my self by the
way in an <HI>Ocean</HI> of <HI>Brine,</HI> That when I got thither, I might find my
<HI>Condition,</HI> as well as my <HI>Conscience,</HI> in a tollerable <HI>Pickle,</HI> fitted for the Con∣versation
of the <HI>Saints</HI> in so <HI>Holy a Land.</HI></P>
<P>I pack'd up my Auls in order for my Voyage; and Embarked the
Ship the <HI>Prudent Sarah,</HI> at <HI>Gravesend,</HI> who was weighing Anchor, with
a fair Wind for the <HI>Downs,</HI> That I had no leasure to step back to <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
to satisfie my <HI>Creditors;</HI> but, like a Girl that's <HI>Ravish'd,</HI> was forc'd,
with a very good will, to do that which I intended.</P>
<P>To entertain this Merry Town, with an exact <HI>Iournal</HI> in <HI>Tarpaulin Ara∣bick,</HI>
is like reading the <HI>Revelations</HI> to an establish'd <HI>Atheist,</HI> or repeating a
<HI>Welsh Commedy</HI> to a <HI>Highlander.</HI> I shall therefore omit all such accustomary
Fustian, and divert you with some Thoughts of my own in the time of
my Passage.</P>
<P>When I first came on Board, I fancy'd a <HI>Ship</HI> to be like a <HI>Country
Village</HI> with two or three <HI>May-poles</HI> in't; and the Fellows running about
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Deck in Red and White-wastcoats, to be the Young Men of the Town
engaged in a match at <HI>Foot-ball.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes I consider'd them as a <HI>Pack</HI> of <HI>Hounds,</HI> and the <HI>Pilot</HI> to be
the <HI>Hunts-man:</HI> For, like Dogs upon a Scent, they keep a heavy <HI>Yelping</HI>
at their Business; but in every interval, were as silent as a <HI>Beagle</HI> at a <HI>Loss.</HI></P>
<P>At other times, I have fancy'd a Ship to be a floating <HI>Hive,</HI> instead
of <HI>Bees,</HI> posses'd by <HI>Drones,</HI> who make more <HI>T—d</HI> than <HI>Honey.</HI></P>
<P>A Vessel, whilst the <HI>Pilot</HI> is on Board, is an Emblem of Feeble <HI>Mo∣narchy;</HI>
where the <HI>King</HI> has a States-man in his Dominions Greater than
himself, That the <HI>Prince</HI> only bears the <HI>Title,</HI> but the other the Command.</P>
<P>A Man on Board cannot but be thoughtful on two Destinies, <HI>viz.</HI>
Hanging and Drowning: For withinside you have <HI>Rope,</HI> and without
<HI>Water</HI> enough to effect either. So that it often put me in mind of the old
Proverb, <HI>The Sea and the Gallows refuses none.</HI></P>
<P>A Commander when at Sea, is a Marine Deity; his <HI>Will</HI> is his
<HI>Law,</HI> and the Power of Punishing soly in his own hands. He has a
Wooden World at his Mercy, wherein there is no way to be Happy,
but by due Obedience: For he that knoweth his Masters Will, and doth
it not, shall be beaten with many Stripes.</P>
<P>When out at Sea, I thought the World was Drown'd, because no
Land was to be seen. The <HI>Captain</HI> and his <HI>Mess,</HI> I compar'd to <HI>Noah</HI>
and his <HI>Family;</HI> but as for the rest, they were the <HI>Beasts</HI> of the <HI>Ark.</HI></P>
<P>We were very good <HI>Christians</HI> when we'd nothing else to do: All
Hands in a <HI>Calme</HI> to <HI>Pray</HI> or Pick <HI>Okum;</HI> but to work in a <HI>Storm,</HI> serve
God serve Devil.</P>
<P><HI>Brandy</HI> and <HI>Tobacco</HI> are the Soul of a <HI>Seaman;</HI> he that wants either, is but
half himself; and he that has neither, wants every thing that's needful;
and must, in his own defence, turn <HI>Thief</HI> or <HI>Beggar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mariners,</HI> like <HI>Parsons,</HI> are much given to look Upwards; but never
consult Heaven beyond the <HI>Pole,</HI> or the <HI>Pointers.</HI> At Sea they are a kind
of <HI>Persians,</HI> trusting to the <HI>Sun, Moon</HI> and <HI>Stars</HI> for Bodily Salvation.</P>
<P>They seldom take notice but of one Miracle since <HI>Adam,</HI> and that is
of <HI>Noah</HI>'s guiding the <HI>Ark</HI> to a safe Harbour, without the help of a <HI>Sail,</HI>
or the use of a <HI>Rudder:</HI> Which (forgetting Providence) they urge to be
Impossible.</P>
<P>A foul Wind makes scanty Messes; for it's a chearful saying among
Seamen, <HI>Large Wind, Large Allowance: Starving</HI> and <HI>Drowning</HI> being to
them equally terrible.</P>
<P><HI>Facetious Ignorance</HI> is an excellent Tallent to win the Captains Favour.
Reason at Sea, without the Rules of Navigation, is as dangerous to be
talk'd as Treason: For nothing galls the Ambition of a Commander more,
Than to hear any Body on Board seem Wiser than himself.</P>
<P>They generally bestow their <HI>Favours,</HI> as Fortune does her <HI>Benefits,</HI> as
if both their Heads were in a Bag; and for want of <HI>Sense</HI> or <HI>Sight,</HI> choose
<HI>Dunces</HI> for their <HI>Minions,</HI> and <HI>Fools</HI> for their <HI>Companions:</HI> Dreading <HI>Ingenuity,</HI>
and slighting <HI>Merit.</HI> Being possitive in <HI>Errors,</HI> hateful to <HI>Instruction,</HI>
proud of their <HI>Ignorance,</HI> and <HI>Wise</HI> in their own conceits.</P>
<P>A Violent <HI>Storm</HI> at Sea, to me, seem'd the Minute resemblance of a
general <HI>Conflagration:</HI> When Jarring Elements for Power contended; and
angry Heavens belch'd out flakes of its consuming Fire on the reflecting
Ocean; follow'd with dreadful Claps of rending Thunder, rattling
from Cloud to Cloud, thro' Rains and Hurricanes, till the Conquering
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>
Wind had blown his Sable Enemies beneath our Horizon, and clear'd
the Skies of his affrightening Rivals.</P>
<P>A <HI>Calm</HI> to me was an Effeminate acquiescence of the <HI>Elements;</HI> and un∣pleasant
to a manly disposition: The World look'd as if Nature was a
Sleep; and, careless of her charge, had suffer'd (thro' Neglect) the whole
Universe to be Idle▪ I could compare our Ship to nothing in so smooth
a Sea, but to an <HI>Egg</HI> upon a <HI>Looking-glass.</HI></P>
<P>Idleness at Sea is the worst of Slavery; and he that has nothing to
do, is Buried Alive in a <HI>Cabbin</HI> instead of a <HI>Coffin.</HI></P>
<P>With these sort of Cogitations I past away my Time, being tost about
by the Waves like a <HI>Dog</HI> in a <HI>Blanket,</HI> till we got Sight of the <HI>Promis'd
Land,</HI> and Arriv'd at our desir'd Port, <HI>Boston.</HI> Of which I shall first pro∣ceed
to give you an Account, free from Prejudice or Partiality.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Boston, and the Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P>On the <HI>South-west</HI> side of <HI>Massachusets-Bay,</HI> is <HI>Boston;</HI> whose Name is
taken from a Town in <HI>Lincoln-shire:</HI> And is the Metropolis of all <HI>New-England.</HI>
The Houses in some parts joyn as in <HI>London.</HI> The <HI>Build∣ings,</HI>
like their <HI>Women,</HI> being <HI>Neat</HI> and <HI>Handsome.</HI> And their <HI>Streets,</HI> like
the <HI>Hearts</HI> of the <HI>Male Inhabitants,</HI> are Paved with <HI>Pebble.</HI></P>
<P>In the Chief, or high Street, there are stately Edifices, some of which
have cost the owners two or three Thousand Pounds the raising; which,
I think, plainly proves Two old <HI>Adages</HI> true, <HI>viz. That a Fool and his
Money is soon parted;</HI> and, <HI>set a Beggar on Horse-back he'll Ride to the Devil,</HI>
for the Fathers of these Men were <HI>Tinkers</HI> and <HI>Peddlers.</HI></P>
<P>To the Glory of Religion, and the Credit of the Town, there are four
<HI>Churches,</HI> Built with <HI>Clap-boards</HI> and <HI>Shingles,</HI> after the Fashion of our <HI>Meet∣ing-houses;</HI>
which are supply'd by four Ministers, to whom some, very
justly, have apply'd these Epithites, one a <HI>Scholar,</HI> the Second a <HI>Gentleman,</HI>
the Third a <HI>Dunce,</HI> and the Fourth a <HI>Clown.</HI></P>
<P>Their Churches are <HI>Independent,</HI> every Congregation, or Assembly, in
<HI>Eclesiastical</HI> Affairs, being distinctly Govern'd by their own <HI>Elders</HI> and
<HI>Deacons,</HI> who in their Turns set the Psalmes; and the former are as busie
on <HI>Sundays,</HI> to excite the People to a Liberal Contribution, as our Church-Wardens
at <HI>Easter</HI> and <HI>Christimas,</HI> are with their Dishes, to make a Col∣lection
for the Poor.</P>
<P>Every Stranger is unavoidably forc'd to take this Notice, That in
<HI>Boston,</HI> there are more <HI>Religious Zealots</HI> than <HI>Honest-men,</HI> more <HI>Parsons</HI>
than <HI>Churches,</HI> and more <HI>Churches</HI> than <HI>Parishes:</HI> For the <HI>Town,</HI> unlike the
<HI>People,</HI> is subject to no <HI>Division.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants seem very Religious, showing many outward and visible
Signs of an inward and Spiritual Grace: But tho' they wear in their
Faces the <HI>Innocence</HI> of <HI>Doves,</HI> you will find them in their Dealings, as
<HI>Subtile</HI> as <HI>Serpents. Interest</HI> is their <HI>Faith, Money</HI> their <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Large Po∣ssessions</HI>
the only <HI>Heaven</HI> they covet.</P>
<P><HI>Election, Commencement,</HI> and <HI>Training-days,</HI> are their only <HI>Holy-days;</HI> they
keep no <HI>Saints-Days,</HI> nor will they allow the <HI>Apostles</HI> to be <HI>Saints,</HI> yet
they assume that Sacred Dignity to themselves; and say, in the Title Page
of their Psalm-Book, <HI>Printed for the Edification of the Saints in</HI> Old <HI>and</HI>
New-England.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
They have been very severe against <HI>Adultery,</HI> which they Punish'd with
Death; yet, notwithstanding the Harshness of their Law, the Women are
of such noble Souls, and undaunted Resolutions, that they will run the
hazard of being Hang'd, rather than not be reveng'd on Matrimony, or
forbear to discover the Corruption of their own Natures.</P>
<P>If you Kiss a Woman in Publick, tho' offer'd as a Curteous Salutation,
if any Information is given to the <HI>Select Members,</HI> both shall be <HI>Whip'd</HI> or
<HI>Fin'd.</HI> It's an excellent Law to make <HI>Lovers</HI> in Privat make much of
their time, since open <HI>Lip-Lechery</HI> is so dearly purchas'd. But the good
humor'd Lasses, to make you amends, will Kiss the kinder in a Corner.</P>
<P>Publick <HI>Kissing,</HI> and single <HI>Fornication</HI> are both of a Price; for which Reason
the Women wisely consider▪ the latter may be done with more safty than
the former; and if they chance to be Detected, and are forc'd to pay the
Fine, they are sure before-hand of something for their Money.</P>
<P>A Captain of a Ship who had been a long Voyage, happen'd to meet
his Wife, and kist her in the Street; for which he was fin'd Ten Shillings,
and forc'd to pay the Money. What a Happiness, thought I, do we en∣joy
in <HI>Old-England,</HI> that can not only Kiss our own Wives, but other
Mens too without the danger of such a penalty.</P>
<P>Another Inhabitant of the Town was fin'd Ten Shillings for Kissing
his own wife in his Garden; and obstinatly refusing to pay the Money, en∣dured
Twenty Lashes at the <HI>Gun:</HI> Who, in Revenge of his Punishment,
Swore he would never Kiss her again, either in Publick or Private. And
at this rate, one of the delightfulest Customs in the World, will in time
be quit thrown out of Fashion, to the Old Folks satisfaction, but to the
Young ones Lamentation, who love it as well in <HI>New-England,</HI> as we do
in the <HI>Old.</HI></P>
<P>A Man and Woman, were sentenc'd to be Whip'd for the like offence▪
he being order'd Thirty Lashes, and she Twenty; but he having extorted
the Kiss from her, was so Generous to Sollicit the Select, that he might
have the Fifty, and the Woman to be excus'd; which was consented to
accordingly.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Tenth</HI> Man is chose as one of the <HI>Select,</HI> who have Power, toge∣ther,
to Regulate and Punish all disorders that happen in their several
Neighbour-hoods. The Penalty for <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> is whiping or a Crown;
<HI>Cursing</HI> or <HI>Swearing,</HI> the same Fine, or to be bor'd thro' the Tongue with
a hot Iron: But get your <HI>Select Member</HI> into your Company and Treat
him, and you may do either without offence; and be as safe as a Parish∣oner
here in a Tavern in the <HI>Church-Wardens</HI> Company in <HI>Sermon-time.</HI></P>
<P>A couple of <HI>Deacons</HI> Marching along the Street, espied a Woman in a
corner relieving Nature from the uneasiness of a Burthen she could
keep no longer, one of them cryed out to tother, pointing to the Stoop∣ing
object, <HI>Brother, Brother, what a Shameful thing, what a Beastly thing is
this? I Vow, Brother, this is a thing that ought to be Peep'd into.</HI> The other
being a more sensible Man, <HI>Prithee Brother</HI> (said he) <HI>do thou Peep into't then,
for I care not to run such a hazard of my Eye-sight. Besides</HI> (said he) <HI>the
thing's to Deep for our inspection; and therefore we shall only be laugh'd at for
meddling with the matter.</HI></P>
<P>They are very busie in detecting one anothers failings; and he is ac∣counted,
by their Church Governers, a Meritorious Christian, that betrays
his Neighbour to a Whipping-Post.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="4"/>
A good Cudgel apply'd in the Dark, is an excellent Medicine for
a <HI>Malignant Spirit.</HI> I knew it once Experienced at <HI>Boston,</HI> with very good
success, upon an Old rigged <HI>Precisian,</HI> one of their <HI>Select,</HI> who used to be
more then ordinary vigilant in discovering every little Irregularity in
the Neighbour-hood; I happening one Night to be pritty Merry
with a Friend, opposite to the <HI>Zealots</HI> dwelling, who got out of his Bed
in his Wast-coat and Drawers, to listen at our Window. My Friend
having oft been serv'd so, had left unbolted his Cellar <HI>Trap-door,</HI> as a <HI>Pit∣fall</HI>
for Mr. <HI>Busie-Body,</HI> who stepping upon it, sunk down with an Out∣cry
like a distressed Mariner in a sinking <HI>Pinnace.</HI> My Friend having
planted a Cudgel ready, run down Stairs, crying <HI>Thieves,</HI> and bela∣bour'd
Old <HI>Troublesome</HI> very sevearly before he would know him. He
crying out <HI>I am your Neighbour. You Lye, you Lye, you Rogue,</HI> says my
Friend, <HI>my Neighbours are Honest Men, you are some Thief come to Rob my House.</HI>
By this time I went down with a Candle, my Friend seeming wonder∣fully
surpriz'd to see 'twas his Neighbour, and one of the <HI>Select</HI> too,
put on a Counterfeit Countenance, and heartily beg'd his Pardon. Away
troop'd the Old <HI>Fox,</HI> Grumbling and Shruging up his Shoulders; and be∣came
afterwards the most Moderate Man in Authority in the whole
Town of <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<Q><L>A little Pains sometimes do good</L>
<L>To such Cross Knotty Sticks of Wood.</L>
<L>Correction is the best Recept,</L>
<L>To set a Crooked Temper Streight.</L>
<L>If such Old Stubborn Boughs can Bend,</L>
<L>And from a just Chastisment mend,</L>
<L>Fond Parents pray asign a Reason,</L>
<L>Why Youth should want it in due Season?</L></Q>
<P>The Women here, are not at all inferiour in Beauty to the Ladies
of <HI>London,</HI> having rather the Advantage of a better Complexion; but
as for the Men, they are generally <HI>Meagre;</HI> and have got the <HI>Hypocritical</HI>
knack, like our <HI>English Iews,</HI> of screwing their Faces, into such <HI>Puritani∣cal</HI>
postures that you would think they were always Praying to them selves,
or running melancholy Mad about some Mistery in the <HI>Revelations:</HI>
So that 'tis rare to see a handsome Man in the Country, for they have
all one Cast, but of what Tribe I know not.</P>
<P>A Woman that has lost her <HI>Reputation,</HI> hath lost her <HI>Portion,</HI> her <HI>Virgi∣nity</HI>
is all her <HI>Treasure:</HI> And yet the Merry Lasses esteem it but a Trifle,
for they had rather, by far, loose <HI>that</HI> then their <HI>Teeming-time.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gravity</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> of their looks, are of great Service to these <HI>Ameri∣can</HI>
Christians▪ It makes strangers that come amongst them, give Credit
to their Words. And it is a Proverb with those that know them, <HI>Who∣soever
believes a</HI> New-England Saint, <HI>shall be sure to be Cheated: And he that
knows how to deal with their Traders, may Deal with the Devil and fear no Craft.</HI></P>
<P>I was mightily pleas'd one Morning with a Contention between two
Boys at a Pump in <HI>Boston,</HI> about who should draw their Water first.
One Jostled the other from the Handle, and he would fill his Bucket first,
because his Master said <HI>Prayers</HI> and sung <HI>Psalms</HI> twice a Day in his Family,
and the others Master did not. To which the Witty Knave made this
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
reply, <HI>Our House stands backward in a Court: if my Master had a Room next
the Street, as your Master has▪ he'd</HI> Pray <HI>twice to your Masters once, that he
wou'd, and therefore I'll fill any Pail first, Marry will I;</HI> and did accordingly.</P>
<P>Some Years Ago, when the Factors at <HI>Boston</HI> were Credited with large
Stocks by our <HI>English</HI> Merchants, and being backward in their Returns,
and more in their Books then they were willing to satisfie, contriv'd this
Stratagem to out-wit their Correspondents. As 'tis said, They set Fire
to their Ware-houses, after the disposal of their Goods, and Burnt them
down to the Ground, pretending in their Letters, they were all undone,
their Cargos and Books all destroy'd; and so at once Ballanc'd their
Accounts, with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>One of their Factors, who had three or four Thousand Pounds worth
of an <HI>English</HI> Merchants Goods in his Hands, sends him an Account of
this Lamentable Mischance, to the purpose he was quite Ruin'd, and had
lost all but a small Cheese of four Pound Weight, which he sent him
for a present. The Merchant having had some Intelligence of the Roguery
of his Factor, invites several Eminent Merchants (that dealt to <HI>New-England</HI>)
to Dinner with him, who came accordingly, he having prepar'd
an Extraordinary Feast to entertain them. They mightily condol'd his
great Loss, (he making slight of it) and blam'd him for the Extrava∣gancy
of his Treat, after he had sustain'd so considerable a Misfortune.
<HI>Ah! Gentlemen,</HI> says he, <HI>this is nothing to what I have provided you:
I have one Dish still to come up, which cost me between three and four Thousand
Pounds; and, notwithstanding its costliness, I think it not Good enough for such
worthy Company.</HI> The Gentlemen look'd one upon another, and thought
he was Frenzical. In the interim, up came his <HI>New-England</HI> Present, under
a cover. <HI>That's the Dish,</HI> says the Master of the Feast, <HI>that stood me
in so many Thousands. 'Tis but a small Morsel, considering the Price.</HI> The
Company all wondering of what delicates the Cook must have compos'd
this Extravagant Kickshaw, lifted up the Cover, and finding nothing but
a <HI>Cheese,</HI> laugh'd as heartily at their Disapointment, as the <HI>Mob</HI> in the
Fable at the <HI>Mountain-mouse.</HI> Then he continued their Mirth by unfol∣ding
the Riddle: And Swore, if ever he trusted a <HI>New-England</HI> Saint again
for three Pence, the Devil shou'd have a Title to him and his Heirs for
half the Money.</P>
<P>The Ground upon which <HI>Boston</HI> (the Metropolis of <HI>New-England</HI>)
stands, was purchas'd from the Natives, by the first <HI>English</HI> Proprietors,

<P><HI>New-England</HI> is computed to begin at 40, and end at 46 <HI>North</HI> Lati∣tude;
Running from <HI>De-la-Ware-Bay</HI> to <HI>New-found-Land.</HI> The Country
is for the most part Wilderness, being generaly <HI>Rocky, Woody</HI> and <HI>Moun∣tainous,</HI>
very rarely Beautified with <HI>Valleys,</HI> but those Large and Rich,
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
wherein are <HI>Lakes</HI> thirty or forty Miles in compass, from whence their
great Rivers have their beginnings, and are chiefly Succour'd.</P>
<P>There are many Plantations by the Sea-side, Situate for the advantage
of the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>South</HI> Winds, which coming from Sea produceth, warm
Weather. The <HI>Nor-west</HI> blowing over Land, causeth extremity of Cold;
and very often strikes both <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Inhabitants with that
terrible Distemper, called, the <HI>Plague</HI> in the <HI>Back.</HI></P>
<P>The Country, by its Climate, is always troubled with an <HI>Ague</HI> and
<HI>Fever;</HI> As soon as ever the Cold fit's over, tis attended with a Hot: And
the <HI>Natives</HI> themselves, whose Bodys are Habituated to the suddain
changes, from one Extream to another, cannot but confess, They <HI>Freez</HI> in
Winter and <HI>Fry</HI> in Summer.</P>
<P>A Ridg of White Mountains run almost thro' the Country, whereon
lies a remembrance of the past Winter, in the warmest of their weather,
An <HI>Indian</HI> at the sight of the Snow, lodg'd upon the Shoulders of these
Hills, will Quake at Midsummer: For they love Cold like a <HI>Cricket.</HI> At
the Top there is a large Plain, ten or twelve Leages over, yielding
nothing but Moss, where a Man may walk with his Mistress, in the height
of his Juvenality, and not entertain one Thought of attempting her <HI>Chas∣tity,</HI>
it being fatally Cold, and above the Clouds; and would have been
a rare place, for the presumptious <HI>Babilonians</HI> to have Built their Tower on.</P>
<P><HI>Plymouth</HI> Plantation was the first <HI>English</HI> Colony that settled in <HI>New-England,</HI>
in the Year 1618. Their Habitations, at their going on Shore,
being empty <HI>Hogs-heads,</HI> which they whelm'd over their Heads to defend
themselves from the cold Damps and falling Mischiefs of the Night. Each
House having but one <HI>Window,</HI> and that's the <HI>Bung-hole,</HI> requiring a <HI>Cooper</HI>
instead of a <HI>Carpenter</HI> to keep their Houses in repair. Their <HI>Provision</HI> (till
better acquainted with the Country) being only <HI>Pumkin,</HI> which they
Cook'd as many several ways, as you may Dress <HI>Venison:</HI> And is continued
to this Day as a great dish amongst the <HI>English. Pumpkin Porrage</HI> being
as much in esteem with <HI>New-England</HI> Saints, as <HI>Ielly Broth</HI> with <HI>Old-Eng∣land</HI>
Sinners.</P>
<P>Ten Years expired, before any other Colonies were Planted; since
which time the Possessions of the <HI>English</HI> are so greatly improv'd, That
in all their Colonies, they have above a Hundred and Twenty Towns,
And is at this Time one of the most Flourishing Plantations belonging
to the <HI>English</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>There is a large Mountain, of a Stupendious height, in an Uninhabita∣ble
part of the Country, which is call'd the <HI>Shining Mountain,</HI> from an
amaizing Light appearing on the Top, visible at many Leages distance,
but only in the Night.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> have been very curious in examining the Reason of it;
and have, in Bodies, with great Pains and Danger, attempted a ratio∣nal
Discovery of this Prodigy to no purpose: For they could not observe
any thing upon it to occasion this unusual brightness. It is very terrible
to the <HI>Indians,</HI> who are of a blind Opinion that it contains great Riches,
and the Devil lives there; and do assert, That when any of them ascend
this place, they are met by something in the figure of an Old <HI>Indian,</HI>
that commands them to return, or if they proceed further they shall
Die, which several have found true, by presuming to climb higher, heedless
of the caution.</P>

<P>Their <HI>Industry,</HI> as well as their <HI>Honesty,</HI> deserves equal Observation; for

<P>One Husband-man in <HI>England,</HI> will do more Labour in a Day, then

<P>They have wonderful <HI>Appetites,</HI> and will Eat like <HI>Plough-men;</HI> tho very

<P>The Women are very <HI>Fruitful,</HI> which shows the Men are <HI>Industrious</HI>

<HI>Honest-men</HI> and <HI>Virgins</HI> as scarce as in other places.</P>
<P>Provisions being Plenty, their Marriage-Feasts are very Sumptious. They
are sure not to want Company to Celebrate their Nuptials; for its Custo∣mary
in every Town, for all the Inhabitants to Dine at a Wedding with∣out
Invitation: For they value their <HI>Pleasure</HI> at such a rate, and bear such
an affection to <HI>Idleness,</HI> that they would run the hazard of <HI>Death</HI> or <HI>Ruin,</HI>
rather then let slip so Merry a <HI>Holy-day.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Women,</HI> like Early <HI>Fruits,</HI> are soon <HI>Ripe</HI> and soon <HI>Rotten.</HI> A <HI>Girl</HI>

<P>An <HI>English</HI> Inhabitant having sold a Bottle of <HI>Rum</HI> to an <HI>Indian</HI> (con∣trary

the <HI>Flog-master</HI> resolving (being a Conscientious Man) to do his Duty
Honestly, rather punish'd the Offender with the greater severity, who
casting a sorrowful look over his Shoulder, Cry'd out, <HI>the Scripture say∣eth,
Blessed is the Merciful Man.</HI> The Scourgineer replying, <HI>and it also says,
Cursed is he that doeth the work of the Lord Negligently:</HI> And for fear of
coming under the <HI>Anathema,</HI> laid him on like an unmerciful <HI>Dog,</HI> till
he had given him a thorough Fellow-feeling of his <HI>Cat of Nine-tailes.</HI></P>
<P>Their Lecture-Days are call'd by some amongst them, <HI>Whore Fair,</HI> from
the Levity and Wanton Frollicks of the Young People, who when their

Roar out against in their Assemblies, with as much bitterness, as a double

with that Reverence and Humility as they ought to do, but tell them
'tis <HI>Popery</HI> to uncover their Heads in the House and Presence of the <HI>Deity;</HI>

when they make their offerings every Sunday, and fling their <HI>Mites</HI> into
their <HI>Teacher<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Treasury.</HI> So that the Haughty <HI>Prelate</HI> exacts more Homage,
as due to his own Transcendency, than he will allow to be paid to Heaven

<P>If you are not a Member in full Communion with one of their Assem∣blies,

<P>All <HI>Handicrafts-Men</HI> may live here very well, except a <HI>Pick-pocket;</HI> of

<P>An Eminent <HI>Planter</HI> came to me for an Ounce of <HI>Venice-treacle,</HI> which

Fifty Years, and never see in the whole Term, Ten Pounds in <HI>Sil∣ver-Money</HI>

<P>They have a <HI>Charter</HI> for a <HI>Fair</HI> at <HI>Salem,</HI> but it Begins, like <HI>Ingerstone</HI>
Market, half an Hour after Eleven a Clock, and Ends half an Hour be∣fore
Twelve: For I never see any thing in it but by great Accident, and
those were <HI>Pumkins,</HI> which were the chief Fruit that supported the <HI>English</HI>

Din'd at <HI>Pontack</HI>'s Ordinary.</P>
<P><HI>Lobsters</HI> and <HI>Cod-fish</HI> are held in such disdain, by reason of their Plenty,
'tis as Scandalous for a poor Man in <HI>Boston</HI> to carry one through the streets,
as 'tis for an Alderman in the City of <HI>London,</HI> to be seen walking with
a Groatsworth of <HI>Fresh-Herrings,</HI> from <HI>Billings-gate</HI> to his own House.</P>
<P>There were formerly amongst them (as they themselves Report) abun∣dance

that comes into the Country, shall find they will Deal by him to this
Day, as if the <HI>Devil</HI> were in 'em.</P>
<P><HI>Witchcraft</HI> they Punish'd with Death, till they had Hang'd the best Peo∣ple
in the Country, and Convicted the <HI>Culprit</HI> upon a single Evidence:
So that any prejudic'd person, who bore Malice against a Neighbour,
had an easie method of removing their Adversary. But since, upon better
consideration, they have Mitigated the severity of that unreasonable Law,
there has not been one accused of <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> in the whole Country.</P>
<P>Many are the Bug-bear storys reported of these suppos'd <HI>Negroman∣cers,</HI>
but few Believ'd, tho' I presume none True, yet all Collected and
already Printed, I shall therefore omit the relating of any.</P>
<P>They have one very wholesome Law, which would do mighty well
to be in force in <HI>Old-England;</HI> which is a Peculiar method they have of
Punishing <HI>Scolds.</HI> If any Turbulent Woman be Troubled with an un∣ruly
Member, and uses it to the Defamation of any Body, or disquiet
of her Neighbours, upon Complaint, she is order'd to be <HI>Gag'd</HI> and set
at her own Door as many Hours as the Magistrates shall think fit, there
<PB N="13" REF="7"/>
to be gaiz'd at by all Passengers till the time's expired. Which, to me▪
seems the most Equitable Law imaginable to Punish more particularly
that Member which committed the Offence.</P>
<P>Whipping is a Punishment so Practicable in this Country, upon every
slight Offence, that at a Town upon the <HI>Sound,</HI> call'd <HI>New-Haven,</HI> the Peo∣ple
do confess, that all the Inhabitants of that Place, above the Age of

<P>Of all the Creatures that inhabit these parts of <HI>America,</HI> the <HI>Moos-deer</HI>
makes the most Noble figure: He is shap'd like an <HI>English</HI> Deer, only
round Footed; but of a stately Stature, seldom so low as the biggest of
our <HI>Oxen.</HI> His Head fortified with Horns proportionable, whose Palms
are very broad, full of indented branches, and are commonly two Fathom
distance from Tip to Tip. His Flesh is not dry, like <HI>Venison,</HI> but moist
and Lushious; extreamly palatable, and very wholesome. The flesh of
their <HI>Fawns,</HI> is also delicious Food; highly commended by all such who
are more than ordinary Nice in obliging their Voluptuous Appetites.
There is much said by the Phisicians of that Country concerning the Ex∣cellent
Virtues of the Horn of this Creature: Being look'd upon as an
incomparable Restorative against all inward weaknesses; and in all Cases
where <HI>Harts-honn</HI> is prescrib'd, the <HI>Moos-horn</HI> they look upon to be a far

<P>The <HI>Bears</HI> that Inhabit this part of <HI>America,</HI> are generally of a blackish
Colour during the Winter season, which is much colder than in <HI>England.</HI>
They defend themselves from the hardship of the weather, by retiring into
Caves, where they continue for about four Months; in which time their
Snows are pretty well dissolv'd, and the severity of their Frost over. They
are commonly very Fat in the fall of the Leaf, by feeding upon Acorns, at
which time the <HI>Indians</HI> destroy a great many; looking upon 'em then to
be incomparable <HI>Venison:</HI> But the Head, I believe, is but a sorry dish,
because they hold the <HI>Brains</HI> to be Venomous. They are very fierce in
<HI>Rutting-time;</HI> and then walk the Country round, thirty or forty in a
Company, making a hedious roaring, which may be heard a Mile or
two before they come near enough to endanger a Traveller. They will
never injure a Man at any other time of the Year, except you attempt
to hurt them first; But if you Shoot at one, and miss him, he will cer∣tainly
destroy you; which makes the <HI>Indians</HI> sure of their Mark be∣fore
ever they discharge their Piece. Their Skins they sell to the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="8"/>
but the Flesh they Cook sundry ways, Salting and Drying some,

from the Branches upon the Back of <HI>Horse, Cow, Deer,</HI> or any Creature
that is feeding under it; clinging close with their Tallons, knawing a great
hole between the Shoulders of the Beast, who runs full speed till he drops

mischievous Darts, as a <HI>Hemp-dressers</HI> Comb with Teeth; which he exer∣cises
with as much Art as an old Soldier does his Pike, charging them
according as you Attack him, to the Right, Left, Front, or Rear, which
they will Shoot at their Enemies a considerable distance; and wherever
they Stick in the Flesh, if you pluck them not out presently, they will
work thro'. The <HI>Indians</HI> use these Quills to adorn their Birchen Dishes.

<P>This is an Amphibeous Creature, rather larger than an <HI>Otter,</HI> Hairy all

Instinct, as is observ'd by their artificial Dam-heads, by which, in dry
Seasons, they raise the Water to their Houses, when the Pond, upon whose
brinks they dwell, is sunk from it's usual Edges. Their Nests or Burrow
which they make, are three Stories high, that in case excessive Rains should
over-flow their first and second Floor, they may mount into their Garrets,
there Sleep in a dry Skin till the Floods abated. They have two pair
of Testacles, one soft and Oily; and the other pair hard or solid. The
Women dry the latter, and grate them into Wine, to further Generation,
remove the causes of Barrenness, prevent Miscarriages, and to strengthen
Nature against, and also moderate the Pains of Delivery. They Eat no
part of this Creature but the Tail, which they flea and boil, accounting
it rare Victuals. It's very Fat, and Eats like Marrow, being an excel∣lent
Supper for a <HI>Bride-groom,</HI> or good Food for that unhappy Man who

<P>Wolves there are abundance, of two sorts, one like a <HI>Mungril,</HI> which

preys upon <HI>Deer.</HI> They are very shy and difficult to be Shot or Trap'd.
Their manner of distroying them, being by four <HI>Maycril-hooks,</HI> which
they bind together, with their Beards revers'd, then hide them with a
Ball of Tallow, and tie it to the Carkass of any thing they have just kill'd,
from which you have scar'd them, and when he comes to make up his
Meale, being a lover of Fat, he certainly takes your Bait, and becomes
your Prisoner.</P>
<P>Besides what I have above mentioned, they have a great deal of good

<P>For these four <HI>Virtues</HI> they are very Eminent, <HI>viz. Loyal</HI> to their <HI>Kings,
Constant</HI> to their <HI>Wives, Indulgent</HI> to their <HI>Children,</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> to their
<HI>Trust.</HI></P>
<P>For nothing will tempt them to offer Violence to their <HI>Sagamore,</HI> to
abuse their <HI>Squawes,</HI> use Soverity with their <HI>Papooses,</HI> or betray a <HI>Secret;</HI>
rather chusing to die then do either.</P>
<P>They call themselves Hunters; and are very dexterous at the use of either Gun
or Bow, by the excercise of which; they maintain themselves and Families.</P>
<P>They acknowledge a God, whom they Worship for his Benefits. They believe a
Devil, whom they Adore thro' Fear. And have a Blind Notion of Futurity, which
appears by their manner of Interring their Dead, with whom they bury his Bow,
Gun, with Provisions for his Journy into a better Country; but where or what it
is they know not.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of a War, or such extraordinary Occasions, as the old
<HI>Romans</HI> consulted their <HI>Oracles,</HI> so do the <HI>Indians</HI> their <HI>Pawaws,</HI> which are a kind of
<HI>Wizards:</HI> And at a General <HI>Pawawing,</HI> the Country a Hundred Miles round assemble
themselves in a Body; and when they are thus met, they kindle a large Fire, round
which the <HI>Pawaw</HI> walks, and beats himself upon his Breast, muttering out a strange
sort of intricate Jargon, till he has Elivated himself into so great an Agony, that he
<PB N="16" REF="9"/>
falls down by the Fire in a Trance; during which time, the <HI>Sagamores</HI> ask him what
they have a mind to know: After which, he is convey'd thro' the Fire, in the same
<HI>posture</HI> that he lies, by a Power invisible, in the sight of the Spectators; then awakes,
and Answers the several Questions ask'd by their <HI>Kings</HI> or <HI>Sachems.</HI></P>
<P>The chiefest Vice amongst them is Drunkenness, which (to the Reputation of
<HI>Christianity</HI>) they learn'd of the <HI>English:</HI> And are so greedy of being <HI>Drunk,</HI>
when they have purchas'd any <HI>Rum,</HI> that if they have not enough to Fuddle their
whole Society, they draw Cuts who shall Drink, till it falls into the hands of so few,
they may be sure to have their Bellies full. When they get <HI>Drunk</HI> they are very
Mischievous one to another: But are never known to offer any Indignity to their
Kings, who are Hail Fellow well met with his Subjects.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Garments</HI> are <HI>Mantles,</HI> about the bigness of a <HI>Cradle-Rug,</HI> made of course <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Cloth, which they call a <HI>Coat.</HI> They also have a piece of the same Cloth, about six
Inches wide, between their Legs, tuck'd under a Deer's-Skin Belt, to hide their <HI>Privi∣ties,</HI>
by them call'd <HI>Breeches.</HI> Adorning themselves with <HI>Beads</HI> of several Colours, of
their own making. Their Heads, Breast, Legs and Thighs being bare. Sometimes,
for their Children, they Weave Coates of <HI>Turky Feathers.</HI></P>
<P>Their Houses they call <HI>Wigwams;</HI> and are built with bended Poles, after the fa∣shion
of our Arbours, cover'd with Bark of Trees, and lin'd with Mats they make of
Rushes, leaving a hole at top for a Smoke-vent, kindling their Fires in the middle of
their <HI>Wigwams.</HI> Their Lodging is upon Hurdles, rais'd from the Ground with
Wooden Stumps.</P>

<HEAD>Of their Women.</HEAD>
<P>Their <HI>Squaws</HI> when Young, are generally round Visage'd, well Feitur'd, Plump,
and Handsome; black-Eyed, with Alabaster Teeth, a Satin Skin, and of excellent pro∣portion;
with tolerable Complections, which they injure much with <HI>Red-lead</HI> and
<HI>Bears-grease,</HI> being so silly to believe it gives an advantage to their Beauty.</P>
<P>They are extreamly <HI>Modest</HI> when <HI>Virgins;</HI> very <HI>Continent</HI> when <HI>Wives, Obedient</HI> to
their <HI>Husbands,</HI> and tender <HI>Mothers</HI> to their <HI>Children.</HI> From whom our <HI>English</HI> Ladies
might learn those Virtues, which would heighthen their <HI>Charms,</HI> and Illusterate
their <HI>Perfection</HI> beyound the Advantages of gaudy Dresses.</P>
<P>They are much in the Condition of our first Parents; having a little more than a
<HI>Fig-leaf</HI> to hide their Nakedness: Yet the <HI>modestty</HI> of their deportment, makes
it not look like <HI>Impudence</HI> but <HI>Necessity.</HI></P>
<P>They carry their Children at their Backs, lac'd to a Board in the form of a <HI>Boot-jack:</HI>
which is said to be the reason their Children are never <HI>Rickety,</HI> or shall you
ever see a Bandy-leg'd or Crooked <HI>Indian.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of their Food.</HEAD>
<P>Their Diet is <HI>Fish, Fowl, Bear, Wild-cat, Raccoon, Deer, Oysters, Lobsters</HI> roasted or
dry'd in Smoke, <HI>Lampres, Moot-tongues</HI> dry'd, which they esteem a dish for a
<HI>Sagamore.</HI> With hard Eggs Pulveriz'd, they thicken their Broth; <HI>Indian-Corn</HI> and
<HI>Kidney-Beans</HI> boil'd, <HI>Earth-Nuts, Chest-Nuts, Lilly-Roots, Pumpkins, Milions,</HI> and di∣vers
sorts of <HI>Berries;</HI> Cook'd after various manners.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Their Distempers are,</HEAD>
<P><HI>Quinsies, Pleurisies, Sciatica, Head-Ach, Palsey, Dropsie, Worms, Cancer, Pestilent
Fever</HI> and <HI>Scurvy;</HI> For all which Diseases, the <HI>Indians</HI> are Incomparable Physicians:
Being well skill'd in the Nature of <HI>Herbs</HI> and <HI>Plants</HI> of that Country. But the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
will not make use of them, because their Ministers have infus'd this Notion into
'em, That what they do, is by the Power of the Devil.</P>
