<P>Indeede SIR, I must acknowledge that vpon the first view of you seeing you in your Countrey ha∣bit, I did much vnder-value you (for which I craue par∣don) fearing that some misfortunes had befallen you, and so povertie had driven you into that meane habite, and attire, but when I vnderstood, after some conference had with you, what course of life you tooke vpon you, and that your habite did suite with your <HI>Countrey</HI> and condition, being much different from our <HI>City</HI>-fashions, I then wisht to my selfe to haue had some opportunity, having knowne you from your Cradle vntill the time that wee shooke hands at the Schoole-dore, and obser∣ved that docile and sweete disposition in you more fit for the Court and Citie, to know the motiues that in∣duced you to apply your selfe wholly to the affayres of the Countrey, which at this time hating I shall desire you to impartit freely vnto me.</P>

<P>I shall in this your request, giue you what sa∣tisfaction I can. The motiues that induced me to take vpon me this Course of life, were many, but chiefly my health, which I preferre before all earthly treasure; for I found that after I left the Grammar-Schoole, that the <HI>smoky fumes, and noysome vapors of the Citie</HI> did much offend me, sometimes driving me into a shaking Ague, sometimes into a Burning-Feaver, and continually di∣stempering me, so that during the whole time I made my abode therein, there was scant a weeke together at any time that I perfectly enjoyed my selfe. Whereupon by the advise of the most learned <HI>Physitians,</HI> I tooke my flight into the Country, being by them perswaded
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
that the <HI>sweete and subtile ayre</HI> would best accord and suite with my Constitution: and this was one of the principall Causes that induced me to take vpon me this Course of life: other motiues there were, amongst the rest this was not the least, that I had often heard, and experience hath since verified vnto me that the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><Q><P><HI>Beatus</HI> ille, qui procul nego∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, Vt prisca gens mortaliū, Paterna rura bobus exercet suis.</P>

<BIBL><HI>Arist.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE> <HI>Country∣mans</HI> life is the most innocent, harmlesse, and most plea∣sing to God of any professiō or state of life in the world. For that he doth not raise himselfe by the ruines of any: he oppresseth no fatherlesse, nor wrongs no widowes: his Commerce is for the most part with the earth, and although he grow rich, shee growes not poore, or if she doe, conceales and buries it in her selfe. He never heares of her cryes at his dores, complaints in the streets, or Petitions in the Courts against him; all his actions are exposed to the eye of the world, he doth nothing in ob∣scuritie or secrecie, the places of his Commerce are ei∣ther the fields or the Markets; the Sunne is his light, and the Standard his measure, false lights and measures are odious and hatefull vnto him: He keepes his course as constantly as the Moone: if riches fall in his way, he stoopes and gathers them vp: if not, he vseth no sleights or tricks, or by-paths to come to them. Gaine he coun∣teth goods when it is well gotten, otherwise wrong and robbery. Ambitious indeede he is, but it is to doe his King and Countrey service; and Covetous he is, recei∣ving more than ten for a hundred, yea a hundred for ten; yet keepes himselfe out of the reach and danger of the Law, so legall is his vsury, so harmelesse his ambition. These were motiues likewise that induced me to take this Course of life vpon me. Others there were many, and this was not the least, for that it was the most vse∣full and most necessary course and condition of life of any life in the world, without which no man can con∣tinue and subsist: for who is he that feeds vs, or who is he that cloths vs? is it not the Countryman? doth Corne
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
grow in the streets, or are sheepe bred in the Markets? Are not the fields our Seminaries? and doth he not play the part of the Alchumist? are they not his labours that produceth and extracteth them? therefore although I attribute as much to the Citie as any man, yet so long as a man may be as honest, as just, as good a Christian, and a better Common-wealths man, I must ever preferre the Countrey. These were motiues likewise that indu∣ced me to take this course of life vpon me: yet these were not all, others there were, for that many <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><Q><L><HI>Haud Moses,</HI> haud ipse Noe∣mus et Abram,</L>

For they wisely foresaw that if there were not a speciall eye and regard had vnto it, that those houses which were vsed to be receptacles of many honest Far∣mers and good livers, would in a short time come to ruine and destruction; that those arable Lands belong∣ing vnto them, which formerly had maintained whole families, would be turned into pasture.

Lawes and Statutes were made to prohibite them from drawing such long tayles after them; but they were not then so forward, but now they are as backward: that which our fore-fathers bestowed vpon the necessary feeding of many bellies in the Country, we bestow vp∣on our backs in the Citie; and that which they bestow∣ed on many blew Coats with Cognisances, we bestow on a Coach and avant-Courrier; yet they kept their e∣states, we spend them, they lived and dyed rich, we mi∣serable.

what he saith at the Table we beleeue, as if we heard him in the Pulpit; so faithfull is he in his words, so honest and just in his conversation, once a yeare he taketh an occasion to performe his filiall rights vnto his Father, and to absent himselfe from vs for the space of some few weekes, during all which time, every houre seemes a day, and every day a moneth to vs his Parishioners, no man enjoying himselfe, because they cannot enjoy him, and at his returne happie is the man that can haue the honour first to entertaine him. And indeede I dare say, there is no loue lost, and that our longing is not so much after him, as his is after vs: so happie are wee in him for our soules health. So that wee finde it verified in him, that it is not the multitude of Shepheards which make the sheepe thriue, but the diligence of the Shep∣heards to whom the flocke are committed, and the more sensible are wee of this our happines in this our Pastor; by reason we see in what <NOTE N="11*" PLACE="marg"><Q><P>Sicat acetum deatibus, et fumus contrarius est ocu∣lis, ita <HI>sacerdos</HI> in Ecclesia <HI>pravus</HI> per acedinem peccati, fidelium sensus obtundere solet.</P>

Whereas we never heare of any such thing, those poore tythes of Mynt and Cummin our Pastor lookes not af∣ter, onely desires an acknowledgement of his right vnto them, which we most willingly condescend vnto, and thereby he looseth nothing, for wheras there is but one often due to him, wee doe requite him for those small curtesies ten for one, and more wee would doe if be

But indeede he hath no other Spouse then the Church, nor other Children then, the poore, for whom hee doth as carefully provide, as if shee lay in his bosome, and were the naturall begotten children of his own bo∣dy. And as for our Church, I dare compare it with your Mother-Church in your Metropolis, that shee is not so beautified without, nor adorned within as our Citie-Parish-Church is; no sooner can a storme deface any part of it, but every one runs as readily to repayre it, as to extinguish a fire: no sooner can age seize vpon it, but every one addes to a pillar to support it: no soo∣ner can a mote come into her glassie eyes, but every man is readie to pull it out: we deferre not the time vn∣till it be too late.

And how such marriages seldome prosper in the world, but as they are begun in treache∣rie and falsehood, so they are continued in strife &amp; con∣tention, and end for the most part in beggery and mise∣ry. I resolved rather to spend all my dayes in penury and povertie, than to raise my selfe by such vnlawfull treacherie and knavery. Then I bent my thoughts to follow some Doctor, Proctor, Atturney, or some Ap∣prentise of the Law: whereby I might gaine so much knowledge, as to make my selfe able to execute the of∣fice of an Vnder-sheriffe, Feodary, Escheator, or some other office of note in the Cōmon-wealth; vnto which course of life I did much encline, especially, when I cast mine eyes about me, and beheld some in that way, <HI>Qui culmen ascenderunt, priusquam gradus inferiores tran∣siluerant</HI>; and from <HI>Dupondij,</HI> to be exalted aboue the <HI>Lytae</HI> and <HI>prolytae.</HI> But when I considered how contemp∣tible those kinde of people haue made themselues by a∣busing

Then I fell vpon divers projects, thinking thereby to raise my selfe, one while the Tipler and Ale-seller came into my thoughts, and how I might share with him in his winnings, was my first project; anone after the Vintner came into my thoughts, and how I might share with him was my se∣cond project. A while after the Coachmaker came into my thoughts, and how I might share with him, who had enhaunsed the prices of bootes and shooes in wa∣sting of much Leather in superfluous moveables, was my third project. Then I fell vpon the Tobacco seller, and how I might share with him in his gaines (who had oftentimes caused the staple Commodities of our Na∣tion to be exported, and in stead of them Drugges and <HI>Indian</HI>▪ weedes to be brought home againe) was my last project; with these and the like fond conceits and ima∣ginations, did I flatter my selfe for a time, and made no doubt to effect what I went about, for that I conceived most of those courses of life to be <HI>ex diametro,</HI> repug∣nant to all honest trades and occupations.

Whereas wee goe no further than the Markets within our walles, and in an instant reape the fruits of those labours, for which you haue taken so great care and paines: againe when I considered that the Citie is the place where all the Nobilitie and Gentrie of the Land receiue their e∣ducation, where the Vniversities are seated, where the Lawes of the Kingdome are read and taught, and in∣deede the proper place in most parts of the Christian

<SPEAKER>Vrban:</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot giue you a more satisfactory answer than by asking you the like question; How commeth it to passe, that the <HI>Neapolitan</HI>-Gentry are so poore and needie, and the <HI>Venetian</HI>-Gentry are so rich &amp; wealthy? The reason is easily given; the <HI>Venetians</HI> follow and af∣fect our course of life, and are industrious and painfull, and the <HI>Neapolitans</HI> contemne it, and are hautie and idle. I must confesse, it hath beene a continued custome a∣mongst the <HI>Neapolitans,</HI> that they will rather marry their daughters to the sonnes of Gentlemen, be they ne∣ver so poore and needy, than to the sole heires of Mar∣chants, be they never so rich and wealthy; for they haue a foolish conceit, and an opinion amongst them, contra∣ry to the opinion of all <NOTE N="(41)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Learned</HI> Armorists <HI>make no doubt, if a Gentleman of a coate-armour, marry with a woman that hath none, and hath issue by her, that the issue is an absolute Gentleman, and may giue his Fathers coate: yea they hold, if a Gentlewo∣mā by birth marry with a man that hath no coate-armour, &amp; hath issue a sonne, by the curte∣sie of armes the sonne may beare her coate-armour during his life with a difference</HI> Cinque∣foyle.</NOTE> <HI>wise men,</HI> that if a Gentle∣man of their Country doe marry with the daughter of a Marchant, or a Plebeian, the issue begotten betweene them, are but Gentlemen of the halfe bloud; but the <HI>Venetians</HI> are of a cleane contrary opinion, &amp; so are the <HI>Genowayes,</HI> who hold it an addirament and encrease of honour, to deale in the way of Marchandise; to liue in <HI>Venice,</HI> and not to doe as the <HI>Venetians</HI> doe, they hold it as dishonourable as it was for the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> to de∣riue themselues from the loynes of <HI>Hercules,</HI> and not en∣devour to be like vnto <HI>Hercules: Valentinian, Agatho∣cles, Telephantes,</HI> and <HI>Hyperbolus,</HI> they haue in perpetu∣all remembrance: who being Petifactors themselues, or the sonnes of them, became to be Emperours and Kings, and to governe the people.

So that in the flourishing state of <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI> there is not a Gentleman of note or qualitie, but hath a stocke going in the trade of Marchandizing. It is true, I must confesse, there was a Law amongst the old <HI>Romanes,</HI> which did prohibit Senators and men in authoritie, to deale by way of Trade; but the reason of that was not because it was a disparagement for a great man to Trade, but because Senators were set apart for another end and purpose; that is, to looke to the affaires of the Common-wealth; and therefore they were not to busie themselues about private matters.

<P>I am glad to heare your Father was of that opinion, he was a learned man, and one that was well seene in Armes and Heraldry. The reason wherefore I desire to be satisfied therein is, because there is a Lady, or a reputed Lady in our Citie, that was the daughter of a meane man, and afterwards married with a Knight, and buried him, and since hath married with a man of meane degree; and because she was sometimes a Lady, there is not a Gentlewoman, be she the wife of the best Gentleman in the Citie, but she will step before her, and take place of her, and why forsooth, marry because the Custome of the Countrey doth giue it her, as shee saith. But when I shall tell our Citie Dames, that the Custome of the Countrey is contrary to the Lawes of Armes, and the Lawes of the Kingdome; I am sure they will not accustome her to doe as she hath done.</P>

Yet if my Conscience would not permit me to obserue the Lawes there read and taught, and the Religion there professed, I would seeke and search out some other Corner abroad where I might enjoy that libertie, which I could not doe at home.

<P>Sir, your question hath beene much Con∣troverted amongst the auncient Academicks of natures Schoole, and the Doctors haue beene much distracted about it; some haue beene so presumptuous as to lay the fault vpon <HI>Iupiter</HI> himselfe, and to say that he hath two Tubs, the one a Cabinet for vertues, the other a cage for vncleannes, and that when it seemes good vn∣to him, he doth distribute vnto one, justice, wisedome, temperance, and fortitude, and to another folly, pusil∣lanimitie and intemperance; but the most wise and dis∣creete among them, haue acccused and condemned this as a fault of high presumption, and haue affirmed, that as well might they maintain that the Lyons might pro∣duce Elephants, Elephants Beares &amp; Wolves; the earth that which is proper to the heavens, and the heavens that which is proper to the earth, as that the fountaine and source of goodnesse should produce any thing, but that which is good. Others haue imputed it to the Constellatiōs &amp; Planets vnder which they were borne, but this hath beene rejected likewise as a paradoxe: for as well might they maintaine that order might produce confusion, as the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, that keepe their constant courses any such effect: others to their na∣turall temper and inclination, but this the whole body of nature hath cōdemned as erroneous, for as it is in the great sublunary world, consisting of reasonable, sensi∣tiue, and vegetative Creatures, the inferior readily sub∣mit themselues to the superior, the vegetative to the sen∣sitive, the sensitive to the rationall, and all to maintaine

<P>In the next place I will shew you what is meant by the word <HI>Sabbath.</HI> Secondly, how many <HI>Sab∣baths</HI> the <HI>Iewes</HI> observed. Thirdly, how they came to be altered and changed. Fourthly, what Lawes haue beene derived out of this Law, for the observation of the <HI>Sab∣bath</HI> of dayes, and what care and provision hath beene taken for the due execution of them. You shall vnder∣stand, that the word <HI>Sabbath,</HI> properly signifieth a Ces∣sation and rest from our labours: so that the <HI>Iewes</HI> na∣med all their festivall dayes by the name of <HI>Sabbath,</HI> be∣cause y<SUP>•</SUP> vpon those dayes they did no manner of labour: yet they ever preferred three <HI>Sabbaths</HI> before the rest: the first whereof was the <HI>Sabbath</HI> of dayes, which is the seaventh day: the second was the <HI>Sabbath</HI> of yeares, which was every <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Levit.</HI> 25.</NOTE> <HI>seaventh yeare, in which there was no planting nor grafting,</HI> no lopping nor topping; all mountaines and vallies, and all the trees of the Forrest from the Cedar to the shrub, being in some sort seque∣stred from the vse of the owner for that yeare; for as the Lord appointed the seaventh day for man to rest, so he appointed the seaventh yeare for the Land to rest. The third was the <HI>Sabbath</HI> of <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Levit.</HI> 25.</NOTE> <HI>seaven times seaven yeares,</HI> which was their great <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and therefore called the <HI>Sabbath of Sabbaths</HI>; in which as there was nothing put in execution, that was prohibited on the <HI>Sabbath</HI> of yeares, all Lands being freed from agriculture as they then were: so there were divers other priviledges and prerogatiues incident to this yeare, which were not to the former. If any man had morgaged or sold his land, it was this yeare to returne home againe, vnlesse they had beene houses within some walled Townes, &amp; they likewise, if they had beene the houses of God, of the Church, and of the Levites. If any had beene bound this yeare, he with his familie were to be free, and to re∣turne to his owne possessions; wherefore this yeare was called the yeare of <HI>Iubile,</HI> or the yeare of mirth and jol∣litie.

<P>I will briefly shew vnto you, and first how the <HI>Sabbath</HI> of dayes was altered.

<P>How came it to passe, that the <HI>Iewes</HI> should be so odious, seeing that among all Natiōs of the world none were more strict than they in the due observation of the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> they would not admit of a bit of meate to be baked or boyled, nor a sparke of fire to be kinled on that day, because they supposed the doing thereof to be a worke repugnant to their Lawes? Nay, they would not in defence of their lives wage any battell on that day, vntill <HI>Matthias</HI> one of their Captaines made a Proclamation that in defence of their lives and liberties it was lawfull for them to fight on the <HI>Sabbath</HI> day. <HI>Antiochus</HI> and <HI>Pompey</HI> could not so easily haue prevai∣led against them, had they not knowne their resolutiōs to haue beene to die rather than to fight vpon that day. How I pray you became the <HI>Iewes</HI> so odious, seeing they were so observant of the <HI>Sabbath</HI> day?</P>

<SPEAKER>Iurisp:</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true; the <HI>Iewes</HI> did forbeare all manner of bodily labour on the Sabbath day; but this forbear∣ance was not to a good end, that is, to glorifie GOD, as they should haue done. If they had beene sensitive Creatures onely, such as had a meere sensitiue being in
<PB N="115" REF="67"/>
the world, as Oxen or Horses, they had done well, and satisfied the Law punctually, but they were reasonable Creatures, God had stamped his owne image in them, and made them little inferior to the Angels in degree; wherefore there was more required at their hands, they were not to sit still and sleepe, but to glorifie him with hymnes, songs, musicke, and melodie. Deeds of Cha∣ritie and necessitie are allowed by God to be done on that day. God that allowed man to leade his Oxe and Asse to water on that day, alloweth him to kindle a fire to dresse his meate on that day. Indeede to kindle a fire to adde furtherance to the building of the Tabernacle was not permitted. God that created all Creatures for the vse of man, alloweth him in case his sheepe or cattell doe fall into a ditch, to pull him forth on that day. God who is abundant in mercie, alloweth vs to relieue our brethren in miserie and necessitie on that day.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Math.</HI> 12.12.</NOTE> <HI>Bonum est benefacere in Sabbatho,</HI> Christ that healed the sicke on the Sabbath day, alloweth the Physitian on that day.

got, they wastfully spent; vnto whom the Holy-dayes answered, Where had you beene, if I had not beene before you, and if I were not, alas, what would you be. Indeede the one without the other could not well be; for as the Working-dayes giue a being to the Holy-dayes, so the Holy-dayes reciprocally yeeld a well-being comfort and solace vnto them. We ought not therefore so to spend our dayes, as if there were no nights, nor yet the nights as if there were no dayes, not so to labour, as if there were no time to rest, nor yet so to rest, as if there were no time to labour; but as the night succeeds the day, and as the seaventh day doth the six dayes of the weeke, so to mingle societie with reti∣rednesse, <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Actio</HI> &amp; <HI>contemplatio</HI> dis∣jungi nolunt; neutra enim sine altera perficitur; sit ergo vnusquis{que} vt <HI>gladius</HI> ille <HI>del∣phieus</HI> vtrin{que} secans, ad a∣gendum &amp; contemplandum paratus.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iurisp:</SPEAKER>
<P>How came <HI>Rome</HI> to be changed, she was some∣times the Mistris of the world, a virgin pure and imma∣culate, vnto whom all Christian Princes did yeeld o∣beysance, and adore her for her innocency and puritie; but afterwards shee became a strumpet, a mercenary strumpet, exposed her selfe for a little profit to all sorts of suitors: which when the Princes saw, they scorned and neglected her. The <HI>Iubile</HI> was sometimes a yeare of mirth and jollitie, of libertie and freedome; and for that purpose was it instituted in the Common-wealth of the <HI>Iewes,</HI> &amp; ordeined to be solemnized every fiftith yeare. For that purpose likewise was it that <HI>Pope</HI> <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Plat.</HI> in vita <HI>Bonif.</HI> 8. <HI>Onuph.</HI> in <HI>Bonif.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Boniface</HI> the eighth instituted the same at <HI>Rome,</HI> and commanded it to be solēnised <HI>every hundred yeare,</HI> in the yeare 1300.

conclude vpon these premisses, that as the olde Comae∣dians were vsed to end all their Comedies in musicke, marriages, mirth and jollitie: so the end and scope in so∣lemnising of this, in these latter times, hath beene pro∣fit and commoditie.

which bindeth the Conscience, is made a meere scarecrow and instrument of delusion, &amp; the handmaid of Tyrannie. Let him in the name of God that desires to gaine sheepe vnto his flocke, vse his best meanes to doe it: but let him doe it as he should doe it, with per∣swasions and intreaties, not with force and violence. O <HI>Rome, Rome,</HI> how art thou fallen, I say, from thy first station! thy Senators in former times caused that Run∣nagate that offered himselfe to kill their enemy <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> to be bound hand and foote, and to be turned out of the Citie. When <HI>Caesar</HI> overcame <HI>Pompey</HI> in the <HI>Pharsa∣lian</HI> fields, and <HI>Pompey</HI> betooke himselfe for refuge vnto the Coasts of <HI>Nilus,</HI> where <HI>Achillas</HI> in stead of prote∣cting him, slew him, and presented his head vnto <HI>Cae∣sar,</HI> thinking thereby to winne <HI>Caesars</HI> loue and favour. But <HI>Caesar</HI> disdaining so base and ignoble an act, would not endure to looke vpon him, or his present. When <HI>A∣pophroditus</HI> had killed <HI>Nero,</HI> though he were the monster of men, a tyrant, and stood condemned according to the Lawes and Customes of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> and though he slew him at the earnest request and sollicitation of <HI>Nero</HI> himselfe, yet as soone as ever the Senate heard he made his vaunts in publicke of what he had done, they caused him to be put to death. Such, such was the goodnesse, vertue, and prowesse of the <HI>Romanes</HI> in times past. But how vnlike are you vnto them: if your forefathers that were Heathens, were so tender of the lives of their ene∣mies; how much more tender ought you to be that fight vnder the banner of Christ, of the liues of your Kings and Princes; it was a merry and golden world in those dayes; but alas the times are now altered; now Simonie beares the bell in the Church; now either fro∣zen ignorance, or ignorant fiery zeale sets the Church at variance in it selfe. It is sufficient now if a man haue a forme of godlinesse, and make a good shew of Religi∣on, let him liue never so vitiously, it is no matter; now

in Court ambition, luxurie, envie, faction, flattery, ly∣ing are the onely things in request, and he that cannot lye or dissemble must forsake that course of life, or not thrive by it. The Nobilitie themselues hunt after pro∣fit, and neglect their honour; for these two, filthy lucre and true honour, are incompatible, and cannot inhabit in one and the selfe same place together; yea the very Courts of Iustice, which should be kept more pure and cleane than other places, are not without spots and ble∣mishes, and the places of judicature bought and sold, and how then can a man expect justice to be duely ad∣ministred; if the egge be rotten, the chicken will stinke and putrifie a great deale more without doubt. Hence it is that suits, debates, and contentions continually a∣rise. Hence it is that the rich man goes to Law with greedines, whilest the poore man faints vnder the bur∣den; the cause of the one being ended with all expedi∣tion, and the cause of the other hanging in suspence: so that the rich man ever prevailes with his money, and the poore man ever goes to the ground. If a man cast his eyes vpon the Citizens &amp; Cities, there he shall finde nothing but fraud, perjurie, vsury, whoredome, trea∣cherie, drunkennesse, luxurie, wantonnesse. Amongst whom to deceiue is accounted the chiefest wisedome, and to be wise the greatest folly. An ill conditioned people, that rellish nothing well but filthy lucre. To conclude, the whole world is nothing els but a meere masse of wickednes: here enemies spoyle, there theeves kill: here the Atheist makes a meere mockery of the sa∣cred Word: here the Father sets snares to entrap the sonne, there the sonne to entrap the Father. So that here we may see the world grows to an end, and every thing worse and worse. Wherefore things standing as they doe, what should I stay here any longer; more content I find in my Stygian houses, wherefore I take my leaue, and bid you farewell, and so the Ghost departed. So

<PB N="140" REF="80"/>
testimonie could be given. But in after times it was manifestly expressed, that not onely they whom <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Britton</HI> make mention of, but all other <HI>Homicides,</HI> who vpon malice fore-thought, doe bereaue any of the Kings Subjects, whether natives or aliens, vnder the Kings protection, of their lives, are said to be murther∣ers. Murther being a wilfull killing of a man in cold bloud, vpon malice forethought. In the setting forth of the divers kindes of <HI>Homicides,</HI> the <HI>Civilians</HI> doe dif∣fer from the professors of the Common Law; for the <HI>Civilians</HI> doe reduce all manner of <HI>Homicides</HI> to one of these three, either to <HI>Homicide</HI> done <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Fulbecks</HI> Parall:</NOTE> <HI>ex casu, ex ne∣cessario,</HI> or <HI>ex destinato:</HI> In the first they doe include all such <HI>Homicides</HI> as are committed accidentally, as if it happen by the throwing of a stone, by the shooting of an Arrow, or by the running of an Horse, or by such like casuall meanes, that one man against his will takes away the life of another: In the second, they doe include all such <HI>Homicides</HI> as happen to be cōmitted in the de∣fence of a mans owne person, or his possessions; as if a Theife happen to assault him vpon the Kings high way, or to breake into his house to rob it; or if vpon any o∣ther occasion, a man is iniuriously assaulted, and in de∣fence of his person, or possessions, death ensue: In the third, they doe include all such <HI>Homicides</HI> as are com∣mitted out of rancor or an inveterate malice, when one man out of a deadly hatred sets vpon another, and pur∣sues him to death. So doe the <HI>Civilians</HI> distinguish the divers kindes of <HI>Homicides</HI>; the professors of the Muni∣cipall Lawes of this Nation doe otherwise distinguish them, that is, by murther man-slaughter without ma∣lice, <HI>felo de se,</HI> or killing of ones selfe, man-slaughter in his owne defence, and man-slaughter <HI>ex casu &amp; acciden∣ti:</HI> So that whereas the <HI>Civilians</HI> doe place <HI>felo de se</HI> in an equall degree with murther, the Common Lawes doe distinguish them, because as it is not an offence of
<PB N="141" REF="80"/>
so high a nature as murther is, vnlesse it be committed by a Malefactor vpon himselfe, to prevent his tryall by the Law, seeing that it extends no further then to the person of himselfe, and is committed oftentimes <HI>ex in∣fortunio,</HI> either by reason of the extremitie of some dis∣ease and sicknesse, or by reason of some agonie and per∣plexitie of minde, yet on the other side, it is not so much favoured in the Law as an act done <HI>ex casu &amp; accidenti</HI>; and therefore aptly and vpon good ground haue the Common Lawes distinguisht this kinde of man-slaugh∣ter from the other three, <HI>ex destinato, ex casu, &amp; necessa∣rio.</HI> Now although the Lawes doe varie as concerning the divers kindes of <HI>Homicide,</HI> yet doe they agree in set∣ting forth the nature of those <HI>Homicides,</HI> for both Lawes doe agree that to be murther which is committed out of an inveterate malice for some supposed offence to be given before; such as was in the beginning of the world, the murther of <HI>Cain</HI> vpon the beloved of God his bro∣ther <HI>Abel. Homicide ex necessario</HI> they doe likewise a∣gree to be then committed, when as the offender having vsed all meanes he can to prevent an vntimely death, is of necessitie at last compelled <HI>to requite</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hester</HI> 7. <HI>v.</HI> 10.</NOTE> <HI>Haman with the reward which he provided for Mordochaeus. Homicide</HI> likewise <HI>ex casu,</HI> they doe likewise agree to be then com∣mitted, when as a man having no evill in his thoughts, doth yet notwithstanding against his will take away the life of another, as it often happeneth in the cases before mentioned, in the shooting of Arrowes, the running of Horses, and the like, so farre doe both Lawes agree: the disagreemēt then consisteth in this, the Civill Lawes doe include all <HI>Homicides</HI> within these, <HI>ex casu, ex neces∣sario, &amp; ex destinato,</HI> the Common Lawes doe not.</P>

So that although in the <HI>Iew∣ish</HI> Common-wealth, Adultery was thought worthy of death, yet in other Common-wealths in after ages, pecuniary and corporall punishment was thought to be a punishment equivalent to the nature of the offence, yet this kinde of punishment is not a punishment so

You shall vnderstand, in the first place, that all those Nationall Lawes, that conjoyne Princes in Leagues and Truces one to another, all the severall municipall Lawes of Nations, that decide Controversies betweene partie and partie, and generally all Lawes that vphold socie∣tie and commerce betweene man and man are hence de∣rived, and are comprehended vnder these titles, <HI>De a∣ctionibus &amp; judicijs, de accusationibus, de calumniatoribus, de pravaricatoribus, de testibus, probationibus &amp; appella∣tionibus.</HI> The excellency of which Lawes is manifested vnto vs by the long vse and continuance of them, it be∣ing

<P>I pray you resolue me this doubt, doe the Statute-Lawes punish all false Witnesses alike, making no difference betweene a Witnesse whose testimonie tends onely to the taking away of the goods or good name of a man, and a Witnesse whose testimony tends as well to the life as liuelihood of him.</P>

<P>Certainely, in both Cases the punishment is but pecuniary &amp; corporall, yet more or lesse according to the nature and qualitie of the offence; for if a <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="marg"><HI>See the Stat. of the fifth yeare of Queene</HI> Elizabeth.</NOTE> <HI>false

<P>Giue me leaue, I pray you, to expostulate a little with you; how can a pecuniary punishmēt be in any de∣gree aequivalent to the nature of the offēce, which tends to the taking away of the life of a man; and how cōmeth it to passe, that the intent in some cases shall be punished with death, when it ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ends no further then to the ta∣king away of the goods of a man; and in other Cases when it extends to the taking away of his life, it shall be punished but with a pecuniary and corporall punish∣ment. As for example; If a man haue an intent to rob a dwelling house, and pursue it so far as to breake downe a wall, though he take nothing away, yet if his feloni∣ous intent doe appeare by the remoovall of goods out of their places, &amp; packing them together, making them fit for portage, he shall vndergoe the same punishment as he should haue done if so be he had taken them away: but if a man shall suborne two Witnesses to depose a

<P>Certainely, if I be Iudge, I must adjudge as all our Countrey doth (notwithstanding any thing you haue said to the contrary) the rich man to be the more happie man, for that every where, both in Countrey and Citie, he is cleped by the name of a good man, and is honored and reverenced, when the poore man is neg∣lected and despised; and for evident demonstration, I will tell you what I saw with mine eyes. Not long since being in the Citie, it was my chaunce to come into a Barbers Shop, where I beheld two men attending the Barber to haue his helpe for the cutting off their haire; the one was rich, and had his purse full of Crownes, the other poore, and had not a penny in his purse; the
<PB N="249" REF="134"/>
Barber entertained them both, but with a great deale of difference, he that had the Crownes, had the finest lin∣nen, the purest water, the sweetest balls, the choycest powders, the sharpest rasor, the keenest sissers, and as much of his art as he could afford him; but he that came for Gods sake, had no other linnen, than what he carri∣ed about him, his owne shirt to wipe his hands; no o∣ther water than what issued out of the Barbers mouth, he spat on his face, and with that water did he shaue his haire, and in stead of a rasor did he vse a kinde of a saw, which did rather <HI>deglubere</HI> than <HI>tondere.</HI> So shaved him that <HI>ad singulos tractus lachrymae exoculis vbertim mana∣bant</HI>; that water issued out of his eyes at every drawing of his hand. In so much, that a little dog that had beene beaten in the streets, comming into the shop for refuge, the poore man thinking that he had shaved the dog as he had done him, because he cryed so, demanded, <HI>O canis num tu rasus es ob dei timorem,</HI> alas poore dog, hast thou beene shaven too? For if he had beene a dog, he could not haue beene vsed worse than he was vsed. So that in my opinion, it is an easie matter to judge which is the more happie man, the rich man or the poore.</P>

looke after every thing is greedie Covetousnesse; so to looke after nothing is carelesse wretchednesse: our de∣sires therefore and affections, should be guided by the rules of reason and discretion; if they be dull, they should be quickned and rowsed vp with the thought of penury and necessitie; if they be too free, they should be curb'd and kept in with the thought of shame and ig∣nominie; for as he cannot be but a poore man, and fall into misery, that having nothing cares for nothing; so he cannot be but a dishonest man, that having all things is contented with nothing: for him that hath but a little to refuse a reward from him that hath more, and can better spare it than he want it, it will be accounted folly or arrogancie in him; but for him that hath enough, to be catching and snatching from him that hath not, it will be accounted base covetousnesse &amp; crueltie in him.

<P>I might answere you as <HI>Ptolemie</HI> answered the Ambassadors touching their Lawes; There being met in <HI>Ptolemies</HI> Court at a supper, where he himselfe was in person, seaven Ambassadors; one from <HI>Rome,</HI> another from <HI>Carthage,</HI> a third from <HI>Sicilie,</HI> a fourth from <HI>Rhodes,</HI> a fifth from <HI>Athens,</HI> a sixth from <HI>Lacedemonie,</HI> a seaventh from<NOTE N="(*)" PLACE="marg"><HI>A Citie of</HI> Peloponesus <HI>neer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vnto</HI> Corinth.</NOTE> <HI>Sicion.

Which question after it had beene
<PB N="272" REF="146"/>
wittily for a time debated, every one standing for the Lawes of his owne Country. <HI>Ptolemie</HI> to determine the Controversie, desired them <HI>vt quilibet tres leges quas in sua quis{que} repub: sciret observari omnium optimas, proserret, eá{que} ratione futurum putabat, vt, quaenam illarum meliùs re∣geretur, facilè perspiceretur,</HI> that every one would propose three of their best Lawes, by which he made no doubt but he should be able to judge which of the Countries had the best Lawes. Whereupon the <HI>Romane</HI>-Ambassa∣dor began thus; <HI>Romaetempla honorari, magistratibus obe∣dientiam praestari, malos Castigari</HI>; at <HI>Rome</HI> God is glori∣fied, Magistrates are obeyed, wicked men are punished. After him the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Ambass: began thus; <HI>Cartha∣gine nobiles viros semper cum suis hostibus decertare, popu∣lum laborare, Philosophos rudiores informare</HI>; at <HI>Carthage</HI> the Noble men alwayes wage warre in person with their enemies, all men are in action, and those that are skilfull instruct those that are ignorant. After him the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Ambass: thus; <HI>Sicilia justitia administratur, veritas ama∣tur, aequalitas laudatur</HI>; in <HI>Sicilie</HI> justice is duely admini∣stred, truth is beloved, and aequalitie preferred. After him the Ambassador from <HI>Rhodes,</HI> thus; <HI>Rhodi honestos esse viros senes, pudicos juvenes, tranquillas et illabefactas matronas</HI>; at <HI>Rhodes</HI> old men are honest, young men are shamefast, matrones are sober and without spot and blemish. After him the <HI>Athenian</HI> Ambass: thus; <HI>Athe∣nis non permittuntur divites factiosi, populus otiosus, guber∣natores imperiti</HI>; in <HI>Athens</HI> it was not permitted that rich men should be factious, poore men idle, and Governors ignorant. After him the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> Ambass: thus; <HI>Lacedaemone nec invidiam, quia omnes ibi erant aequales, nec avaritiam, quia omnia erant communia, nec desidiam, quia omnes laborabant regnari permitti</HI>; In <HI>Lacaedemonie</HI> envie hath no place, because all men are equall, Cove∣tousnesse is thrust out of dores, because all things are in common; idlenesse is banisht, because all men are made

to worke. After him the <HI>Sicion</HI> Ambass: thus, <HI>Sycione nullos extraneos, qui res novas excogitarent, nullos medicos, qui benè valentes enecarent, nullos advocatos, qui lites in in∣finitam protraherent, admitti</HI>; at <HI>Sycion</HI> no new Lords are admitted to make new Lawes: no Physitians to kill men being in perfect health, no Advocates to spinne out and protract causes to the end of the world. All which when <HI>Ptolemie</HI> heard, and seriously pondered them in his thoughts, he affirmed they were all so good that he knew not, <HI>Quaenam illarū sit lex praestantissima.</HI> What <HI>Pto∣lemie</HI> said of the Lawes of those Countries, I may well say of the wayes we haue past through.

To conclude, I would advise him which way so ever he went, to pay for what he called for, to owe nothing to any man but loue, and to carry a good tongue in his head, which if he did obserue, I would pawne my Cre∣dit, that he might walke any way vntill he were weary, without disturbance and molestation.
