<HEAD>TO HIS VVEL∣RESPECTED
GOOD
friend, M. Cutbert Thuresby, VVa∣ter
Bayliffe of London.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Ookes are but poore gifts, yet
<HI>Kings</HI> receiue them: vpō which
I presume, you will not turne
<HI>This</HI> out of doores. Yet cannot
for shame but bid it welcome,
because it bringes to you a great quantitie of
my loue: which, if it be worth litle, (and no
maruell if <HI>Loue</HI> be solde vnder-foote, when the
God of <HI>Loue</HI> himselfe goes naked) yet I hope
you will not say you haue a hard bargaine, Si∣thēce
you may take as much of it as you please
for nothing. I haue clapt the <HI>Cognizance</HI> of your
name, on these scribled papers, it is their liue∣ry:
So that now they are yours: being free frō
any vile imputation, saue only, that they thrust
themselues into your acquaintance. But gene∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all

of other mens names, is the common <HI>Heral∣dry</HI>
which all those laie claime too, whose crest
is a Pen-and-Inckhorne. If you read, you may
happilie laugh; tis my desire you should, be∣cause
mirth is both <HI>Phisicall,</HI> and wholesome
against the <HI>Plague:</HI> with which sicknes, (to tell
truth) this booke is, (though not sorely) yet
somewhat infected. I pray, driue it not out of
your companie for all that; for (assure your
soule) I am so iealous of your health, that if
you did but once imagine, there were gall in
mine Incke, I would cast away the Standish,

<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>ND why to the <HI>Reader?</HI> Oh good Sir!
theres as sound law to make you giue good
words to the <HI>Reader,</HI> as to a <HI>Constable</HI> when
hee carries his watch about him to tell how
the night goes, tho (perhaps) the one (of∣tentimes)
may be serued in for a <HI>Goose,</HI> and
the other very fitly furnish the same messe:
Yet to maintaine the scuruy fashion, and to keepe <HI>Custome</HI> in
reparations, he must be honyed, and come-ouer with <HI>Gentle
Reader, Courteous Reader,</HI> and <HI>Learned Reader,</HI> though he haue
no more <HI>Gentilitie</HI> in him than <HI>Adam</HI> had (that was but a gard∣ner)
no more <HI>Ciuili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie</HI> than a <HI>Tartar,</HI> and no more <HI>Learning</HI>
than the most errand <HI>Stinkard,</HI> that (except his owne name)
could neuer finde any thing in the Horne-booke.</P>
<P>How notoriously therfore do good wits dishonor, not on∣ly
their <HI>Calling,</HI> but euen their <HI>Creation,</HI> that worship <HI>Glow∣wormes</HI>
(in stead of the <HI>Sun)</HI> because of a litle false glistering?
In the name of <HI>Phoebus</HI> what madnesse leades them vnto it?
For he that dares hazard a pressing to death (thats to say, <HI>To
be a man in Print)</HI> must make account that he shall stand (like
the olde Weathercock ouer Powles steeple) to be beaten with
all stormes. Neither the stinking Tabacco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>breath of a <HI>Sattin∣gull,</HI>
the <HI>Aconited</HI> sting of a narrow-eyde <HI>Critick,</HI> the faces of
a phantastick Stage-monkey, nor the <HI>Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ede-la</HI> of a Purita∣nicall
Citizen, must once shake him. No, but desperately re∣solue
(like a French Post) to ride through thick &amp; thin: indure
to see his lines torne pittifully on the rack: suffer his Muse to
take the <HI>Bastoone,</HI> yea the very stab, &amp; himselfe like a new stake
to be a marke for euery <HI>Hagler,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herefore (setting vp all
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese rests) why shuld he regard what fooles bolt is shot at him?
<PB REF="4"/>
Besides, if that which he presents vpon the Stage of the world
be <HI>Good,</HI> why should he basely cry out (with that old poeticall
mad-cap in his <HI>Amphitruo) Iouis summi causa clarè plaudite,</HI>
beg a <HI>Plaudite</HI> for God-sake! If <HI>Bad,</HI> who (but an Asse) would
intreate (as Players do in a cogging <HI>Epilogue</HI> at the end of a
filthie Comedy) that, be it neuer such wicked stuffe, they
would forbeare to hisse, or to dam it perpetually to lye on
a Stationers stall. Eor he that can so cosen himselfe, as to poc∣ket
vp praise in that silly sort, makes his braines fat with his
owne folly.</P>
<P>But <HI>Hinc Pudor!</HI> or rather <HI>Hinc Dolor,</HI> heeres the Diuell!
It is not the ratling of all this former haile-shot, that can terri∣sie
our <HI>Band</HI> of <HI>Castalian Pen-men</HI> from entring into the field:
no, no, the murdring Artillery indeede lyes in the roaring
mouthes of a company that looke big as if they were the sole
and singular <HI>Commanders</HI> ouer the maine Army of <HI>Poesy,</HI> yet
(if <HI>Hermes</HI> muster-booke were searcht ouer) theile be found to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e most pitifull pure fresh-water souldiers: they giue out, that
they are heires-apparent to <HI>Helicon,</HI> but an easy <HI>Herald</HI> may
make them meere yonger brothers, or (to say troth) not so
much. Beare witnes all you whose wits make you able to be
witnesses in this cause, that here I meddle not with your good
Poets, <HI>Nam tales, nusquàm sunt hîc ampliüs,</HI> If you should rake
hell, or (as <HI>Aristophanes</HI> in his Frog sayes) in any Celler deeper
than hell, it is hard to finde Spirits of that <HI>Fashion.</HI> But those
Goblins whom I now am cōiuring vp, haue bladder-cheekes
puft out like a <HI>Swizzers</HI> breeches (yet being prickt, there
comes out nothing but wind) thin-headed fellowes that liue
vpon the scraps of inuention, and trauell with such vagrant
soules, and so like Ghosts in white sheetes of paper, that the
Statute of Rogues may worthily be sued vpon them, because
their wits haue no abiding place, and yet wander without a
passe-port. Alas, poore wenches (the nine Muses!) how much
are you wrongd, to haue such a number of Bastards lying vpō
your hands? But turne them out a begging; or if you cannot
be rid of their Riming company (as I thinke it will be very
hard) then lay your heauie and immortall curse vpon them,
<PB REF="4"/>
that what<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oeuer they weaue (in the motley-loome of their
rustie pates) may like a beggers cloake, be full of stolne pat∣ches,
and yet neuer a patch like one another, that it may be
such true lamentable stuffe, that any honest Christian may be
sory to see it. Banish these <HI>Word-pirates,</HI> (you sacred mistresses
of learning) into the gulfe of <HI>Barbarisme:</HI> doome them euer∣lastingly
to liue among dunces: let them not once lick their
lips at the <HI>Thespian</HI> bowle, but onely be glad (and thanke <HI>A∣Pollo</HI>
for it too) if hereafter (as hitherto they haue alwayes)
they may quench their poeticall thirst with small beere. Or if
they will needes be stealing your <HI>Heliconian Nectar,</HI> let them
(like the dogs of <HI>Nylus,</HI> onely lap and away. For this <HI>Goatish</HI>
swarme are those (that where for these many thousand yeares
you went for pure maides) haue taken away your good
nemes, these are they that de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lowre your beauties. These are
those ranck-riders of Art, that haue so spur-gald your lustie
winged <HI>Pegasus,</HI> that now he begins to be out of flesh, and
(euen only for prouander sake) is glad to shew tricks like
<HI>Bancks</HI> his Curtall. O you Bookes-sellers (that are Factors to
the Liberall Sciences) ouer whose Stalles these Drones do
dayly flye humming; let <HI>Homer, Hesiod, Euripid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and some o∣ther
mad Greekes with a band of the Latines, lye like musket∣shot
in their way, when these Gothes and Getes set vpon you
in your paper fortifications; it is the only Canon, vpon whose
mouth they dare not venture, none but the English will take
their parts, therefore feare them not, for such a strong breath
haue thesee chese-eaters, that if they do but blowvpon a booke
they imagine straight tis blasted: <HI>Quod supra nos, Nihil ad nos,</HI>
(they say) that which is aboue our capacitie, shall not passe vn∣der
our commendation. Yet would I haue these Zoilists (of
all other) to reade me, if euer I should write any thing wor∣thily:
for the blame that knowne-fooles heape vpon a deser∣uing
labour, does not discredit the same, but makes wise men
more perfectly in loue with it. Into such a ones hands there∣fore
if I fortune to fall, I will not shrinke an inch, but euen
when his teeth are sharpest, and most ready to bite, I will stop
his mouth only with this, <HI>Haec mala sunt, sed tu, non meliora facis.</HI></P>

(that beares two faces vnder one hood)

presented vnto this King of the Moneths, all the New-yeares
gifts, which were more in number, and more worth then those
that are giuen to the great Turke, or the Emperour of <HI>Persia:</HI>

Goates leapt too and fro on the Mountaines: Shepheards sat pi∣ping,
country wenches singing: Louers made Sonnets for their
Lasses, whilest they made Garlands for their Louers: And as
the Country was frolike, so was the Citie mery: Oliue Trées
(which grow no where but in the Garden of peace) stood (as com∣mon
as Béech does at Midsomer) at euery mans doore, braun∣ches
of Palme were in euery mans hand: Stréetes were full of
people, people full of ioy: euery house séemde to haue a Lorde of

frighted the silly Countryman at midnight, nor any Drum
the Citizen at noone-day; but all was more calme than a still wa∣ter,
all husht, as if the Spheres had bene playing in Consort:
In conclusion, heauen lookt like a Pallace, and the great hall of
the earth, like a Paradice. But O the short liu'de Felicitie of
man! O world of what slight and thin stuffe is thy happinesse!
Iust in the midst of this iocund Holy-day, a storme rises in the
West:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queenes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icknes.</NOTE> Westward (from the toppe of a <HI>Ritch-mount)</HI> descended
a hidious tempest, that shooke Cedars, terrified the tallest Pines,
and cleft in sunder euen the hardest hearts of Oake: And if such
great trées were shaken, what thinke you became of the tender
Eglantine, and humble Hawthorne; they could not (doubtlesse)
but droope, they could not choose but die with the terror. The Ele∣ment
(taking the Destinies part, who indéed set abroach this mis∣chiefe)
scowled on the earth, and filling her hie forehead full of
blacke wrinckles, tumbling long vp and downe (like a great bel∣lyed
wife) her sighes being whirlewindes, and her grones thun∣der,
at length she fell in labour, and was deliuered of a pale, mea∣gry,
weake child, named <HI>Sicknesse,</HI> whom Death (with a pesti∣lence)
would néedes take vpon him to nurse, and did so. This
starueling being come to his full growth, had an office giuen him
for nothing (and thats a wonder in this age) Death made him his
Herauld: attirde him like a Courtier, and (in his name) chargde
him to goe into the Priuie Chamber of the English Quéene, to
sommon her to appeare in the Star-chamber of heauen.</P>
<P>The sommons made her start, but (hauing an inuincible
<PB REF="6"/>

being (which was most strange) most dutifull to obay, that

Deaths messenger, and yéelded her body to the hands of death
himselfe. She dyed, res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gning her Scepter to posteritie, and her
Soule to immortalitie.</P>
<P>To report of her death (like a thunder-clap) was able to
kill thousands, it tooke away hearts from millions: for hauing
brought vp (euen vnder her wing) a nation that was almost be∣gotten
and borne vnder her; that neuer shouted any other <HI>Aue</HI>
than for her name, neuer sawe the face of any Prince but her
selfe, neuer vnderstoode what that strange out-landish word
<HI>Change</HI> signified: how was it possible, but that her sicknes
should throw abroad an vniuersall feare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

She was the Courtiers treasure, therefore he had
cause to mourne: the Lawyers sword of iustice, he might well
faint: the Merchants patronesse, he had reason to looke pale:
the Citizens mother, he might best lament: the Sepheards
Goddesse, and should not he droope? Onely the Souldier, who
had walkt a long time vpon wodden legs, and was not able to
giue Armes, though he were a Gentleman, had brisseld vp the
quills of his stiffe Porcupine mustachio, and swore by no beggers
that now was the houre come for him to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>irre his stumps:

those that before were the onely cut-throates in <HI>London,</HI> now
stoode in feare of no other death: but my <HI>Signior Soldado</HI> was
deceiued, the Tragedie went not forward.</P>
<P>Neuer did the English Nation behold so much black worne
as there was at her Funerall: It was then but put on, to try if
it were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, for the great day of mourning was set downe (in the

round about it there rayned showers of teares, about her death-bed
none: for her departure was so sudden and so strange, that
men knew not how to wéepe, because they had neuer bin taught
to shed teares of that making. They that durst not speake their
sorrowes, whisperd them: they that durst not whisper, sent them
foorth in sighes. Oh what an Earth-quake is the alteration of
a State! Looke from the Chamber of Presence, to the Farmers
cottage, and you shall finde nothing but distraction: the whole

cast your eyes then on this that followes, which being heretofore
in priuate presented to the King, I thinke may very worthily
shew it selfe before you: And because you shall sée them attirde in

You shall perceiue I lye not, if (with <HI>Peter Bales)</HI> you will take
the paines to drawe the whole volume of it into the compasse of
a pennie. As first, to begin with the Quéenes death, then the
Kingdomes falling into an Ague vpon that. Next, followes the
curing of that feauer by the holesome receipt of a proclaymed
King. That wonder begat more, for in an houre, two mightie
Nations were made one: wilde <HI>Ireland</HI> became tame on the

on the sudden turned wilde: The same Parke which great <HI>Iu∣lius

being now circled (by a second <HI>Caesar</HI>) with stronger pales
to kéepe them from leaping ouer. And last of all (if that wonder

is the abstract, and yet (like <HI>Stowes</HI> Chronicle of <HI>Decimo sexto</HI>

The losse of a Quéene, was paid with the double interest of a

with their iron and Spanish weapons vpon their stalls, then was
there a sharpe law made amongst them, that no workman should
handle any néedle but that which had a pearle in his eye, nor any

they were it séemed, for presently the doores had their woodden

Uiear was strucke dumbe, and could not giue the dead a

he that neuer handled shouell before, got his implements about

stript the colde carcasse, bound his shirt about his téete, pulled
a linnen night cappe ouer his eyes, and so layde him in the rot∣ten

<P>It is plaine therefore by the euidence of these two witnesses,

when their delights are at the highest.</P>
<P>Too ripe a proofe haue we of this, in a paire of Louers; the
maide was in the pride of fresh bloud and beautie: she was that
which to be now is a wonder, yong and yet chaste: the gifts of her
mind were great, yet those which fortune bestowed vpon her (as
being well descended) were not much inferiour: On this louely
creature did a yong man so stedfastly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixe his eye, that her lookes
kindled in his bosome a desire, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ames burnt the more
brightly, because they were fed with swéet and modest thoughts:
<HI>Hymen</HI> was the God to whome he prayed day and night that he
might marry her: his praiers were receiued, at length (after many
tempests of her deniall, and frownes of kinsfolk) the element grew
cléere, &amp; he saw y<SUP>e</SUP> happy landing place, where he had long sought
to ariue: the prize of her youth was made his own, and the solemne
day appointed when it should be deliuered to him. Glad of which
blessednes (for to a louer it is a blessednes) he wrought by all the
possible art he could vse to shorten the expected houre, and bring
it néerer: for, whether he feared the interception of parents,
or that his owne soule, with excesse of ioy, was drowned in
strange passions, he would often, with sighs mingled with kis∣ses,
and kisses halfe sinking in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eares, prophetically tell her, that
sure he should neuer liue to enioy her. To discredit which opi∣nion
of his, behold, the sunne had made hast and wakened the

so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alsly conspire against him: liuely bloud leapeth into his

that there was no roome left for weddings, Coaches are proui∣ded,
and away rides all the traine into the Countrey. On a

before noone are they alighted, entring (insteade of an Inne) for

the Priest fell to his busines, the holy knot was a tying, but

All ceremonies being finished, she was ledde betwéene two, not
like a Bride, but rather like a Coarse, to her bed: <HI>That;</HI> must now
be the table, on which the wedding dinner is to be serued vppe

and Death is chiefe waiter, yet at lenght her weake
heart wrastling with the pangs, gaue them a fall, so that vp shée
stoode againe, and in the fatall funerall▪ Coach that carried her
forth, was she brought back (as vpon a béere) to the Citie: but
sée the malice of her enemy that had her in chase, vpon the wens∣day
following being ouertaken, was her life ouercome, Death
rudely lay with her, and spoild her of a maiden head in spite of her
husband. Oh the sorrow that did round beset him! now was his
diuination true, she was a wife, yet continued a maide: he was a
husband and a widdower, yet neuer knew his wife: she was his
owne, yet he had her not: she had him, yet neuer enioyed him:
héere is a strange alteration, for the rosemary that was washt in
swéete water to set out the Bridall, is now wet in teares to fur∣nish
her buriall: the musike that was heard to sound forth dances,
can not now he heard for the ringing of belles: all the comfort
<PB REF="19"/>
that happened to either side being this, that he lost her, before she
had time to be an ill wife, and she left him, ere he was able to be
a bad husband.</P>
<P>Better fortune had this Bride, to fall into the handes of the
Plague, then one other of that fraile female sex, (whose picture
is next to be drawne) had so scape out of them. An honest cobler
(if at least coblers can be honest, that liue altogether amongest
wicked soales) had a wife, who in the time of health treading her
shooe often away, determined in the agony of a sicknesse (which
this yeare had a saying to her) to fall to mending aswell as her
husband did. The bed that she lay vpon (being as she thought
or rather feared) the last bed that euer should beare her, (for ma∣ny

of sinne tickling▪ her conscience, vp she calls her very innocent
and simple husband out of his vertuous shoppe, where like Iu∣stice
he sat distributing amongst the poore, to some, halfe-penny
peeces, penny péeces to some, and two-penny peeces to others,
so long as they would last, his prouident care being alway, that
euery man and woman should goe vpright. To the beds side of
his plaguy wire approacheth Monsieur Cobler, to vnderstand
what deadly newes she had to tell him, and the rest of his kinde
neighbours that there were assembled: such thicke teares stan∣ding
in both the gutters of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to sée his beloued lie in such a
pickle, that in their salt water, all his vtterance was drownd:
which she perceiuing, wept as fast as he: But by the warme
counsell that sat about the bed, the shower ceast, she wiping her
chéekes with the corner of one of the shéetes: and he, his sullie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
face, with his leatherne apron. At last, two or thrée sighes (like a
<HI>Chorus</HI> to the tragedy ensuing) stepping out first, wringing
her handes (which gaue the better action) shée told the pittifull
<HI>Actaeon</HI> her husband, that she had often done him wrong: hee
onely shooke his head at this, and cried humh! Which humh, she
taking as the watch-word of his true patience, vnraueld the bot∣tome
of her frailetie at length, and concluded, that with such a
man (and named him, but I hope you would not haue me follow
her steppes and name him too) she practised the vniuersall &amp; com∣mon
Art of grafting, and that vpon her good mans head, they
<PB REF="20"/>
two had planted a monstrous paire of inuisible hornes: At the
sound of the hornes, my cobler started vppe like a march Hare,
and began to looke wilde: his awle neuer ranne through the sides
of a boote, as that word did through his heart: but being a polli∣ticke
cobler, and remembring what péece of worke he was to vn∣der-lay,
stroking his beard, like some graue headborough of the
Parish, and giuing a nodde, as who should say, goe on, bade her

<HI>All are sinnes, and we must forgiue, &amp;c.</HI> For hée hoped by such
wholesome Phisicke, (as Shooemakers waxe being laide to a

good heart being tickled vnder gilles, with the finger of these
kind spéeches, turnes vp the white of her eye, and fetches out an
other. An other, O thou that art trained vp in nothing but to

sweate that stoode reaking on his browes, and had made them
supple) entred very easily into his now-parlous-vnderstanding
scull: so that he left wenching, and sate quiet as a Lamb, falling
to his old vomite of councell, which he had cast vp before, and
swearing (because he was in strong hope, this shoo should wring
him no more) to seale her a generall acquittance, prick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forward
with this gentle spur, her tongue mends his pace, so that in her

these blots in his tables, yet the bearing of one man false (whom
she had not yet discouered) stucke more in her stomacke than all
the rest, O valiant Cobler, cries out one of the Auditors, how
art thou set vpon? how are thou tempted? happy arte thou, that
thou art not in thy shop, for in stead of cutting out péeces of lea∣ther,

and so do all thy neighbours here (thy wifes ghostly fathers) sée
that a small matter would now cause thée turne turk, &amp; to meddle
with no more patches: but to liue within the compasse of thy wit:
lift not vp thy collar: be not horne mad: thanke heauen that the

seam-rent sides of thy affection. With this learned Oration the
Cobler was tutord: layd his singer on his mouth, and cried <HI>pau∣cos
palabros:</HI> he had sealed her pardon, and therefore bid her not
feare: héervpon he named the malefactor, I could name him too,
but that he shall liue to giue more Coblers heads the Bastinado.
And told, that on such a night when he supt there (for a Lord may
sup with a clobler, that hath a pretty wench to his wife) when
the cloth, O treachero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s linnen! was taken vp, and <HI>Menelaus</HI>

sir <HI>Paris,</HI> and to <HI>Helenaes</HI> téeth prooued himselfe a true Troian.</P>
<P>This was the creame of her confusion, which being skimd

Oh lamentable! neuer did the olde buskind tragedy beginne till

But the matter was tooke vp in a Tauerne; the case was altered,
and brought to a new reckoning (mary the blood of the <HI>Burdeaux</HI>
grape was first shead about it) but in the end, all anger on euery
side was powred into a pottle pot, &amp; there burnt to death. Now
whether this Recantation was true, or whether the stéeme of
infection, fuming vp (like wine) into her braines, made her talke
thus idlely, I leaue it to the Iury.</P>
<P>And whilst they are canuasing her case, let vs sée what dooings

too honest to break into such cellers. Besides those that were left

for their liues. About twelue of the clock at midnight, when spi∣rites
walke, and not a mowse dare stirre, because cattes goe a

came réeling out of an ale-house, in the shape of a drunkard, who
no sooner smelt the winde, but he thought the ground vnder him
danced the Canaries: houses séemed to turne on the toe, and all
things went round: insomuch, that his legges drew a paire or
Indentures, betwéene his body and the earth, the principal co∣uenant
being, that he for his part would stand to nothing what
euer he saw: euery trée that came in his way, did he iustle, and
yet chalenge it the next day to fight with him. If he had clipt but
a quarter so much of the Kings siluer, as he did of the kings eng∣lish,
his carkas had long ere this bene carrion for Crowes. But,
he liued by gaming, and had excellent casting, yet seldome won,
for he drew reasonable good hands, but had very bad feete, that
were not able to carry it away. This setter vp of Malt-men, be∣ing
troubled with the staggers, fell into the selfe-same graue, that
stood gaping wide open for a breakfast next morning, and imagi∣ning
(when he was in) that he had stumbled into his owne house,
and that all his bedfellowes (as they were indéede) were in their
dead sléepe, he, (neuer complaining of colde, nor calling for more
shéete) soundly takes a nap til he snores again: In the morning
the Sexton comes plodding along, and casting vpon his fingers
ends what he hopes y<SUP>e</SUP> dead pay of that day will come too, by that

that which he receiued the day before, (for Sextons now had bet∣ter
doings than either Tauernes or bawdy-houses) In that sil∣uer
contemplation, shrugging his shoulders together, he steppes
ere he be aware on the brimmes of that pit, into which this wor∣shipper
of <HI>Bacchus</HI> was falne, where finding some dead mens
bones, and a scull or two, that laie scattered here and there; be∣fore
he lookt into this Coffer of wormes, those he takes vp, and
flinges them in: one of the sculls battered the sconce of the sléeper,
whilst the bones plaide with his nose; whose blowes waking
his mustie worship, the first word that he cast vp, was an oath,
and thinking the Cannes had flyen about, cryed zoundes, what
do you meane to cracke my mazer? the Sexton smelling a voice,
(feare being stronger than his heart) beléeued verily some of the

<P>Anon (as it was his fashion) enters my puffing Host, to re∣lieue
with a fresh supply out of his Celler,) the shrinking Can, if
hée perceiued it stoode in daunger to be ouerthrowne. But séeing
the chiefe Leader dropt at his féete, and imagining at first hée
was but wounded a little in the head, held vp his gowty golles
and blest himselfe, that a Londoner (who had wont to be the most
valiant rob-pots) should now be strooke downe only with two
hoopes: and therevpon iogd him, fombling out these comfortable
words of a souldier, If thou be a man stand a thy legges: he stird
not for all this: wherevpon the Maydes being raisde (as it had
bene with a hue and cry) came hobling into the roome, like a
flocke of Géese, and hauing vpon search of the bodie giuen
vp this verdict, that the man was dead, and murthered by the
Plague; Oh daggers to all their hearts that heard it! Away
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>udge the wenches, and one of them hauing had a freckled face
all her life time, was perswaded presently that now they were
<PB REF="22"/>
the tokens, and had liked to haue turned vp her héeles vpon it:
My gorbelly Host, that in many a yeare could not without grun∣ting,
crawle ouer a threshold but two foote broad, leapt halfe a
yarde from the coarse (It was measured by a Carpenters rule)
as nimbly as if his guts had béene taken out by the hangman:
out of the house he wallowed presently, being followed with
two or thrée dozen of napkins to drie vp the larde, that ranne
so fast downe his héeles, that all the way he went, was more
greazie than a kitchin-stuffe-wifes basket: you would haue
sworne, it had béene a barrell of Pitch on fire, if you had loo∣ked
vpon him, for such a smoakie clowde (by reason of his
owne fattie hotte stéeme) compassed him rounde, that but for
his voyce, hée had quite béene lost in that stincking myst: han∣ged
himselfe hée had without all question (in this pittifull ta∣king)
but that hée feared the weight of his in tollerable paunch,
would haue burst the Roape, and so hée should bee put to a
double death. At length the Towne was raised, the Coun∣trey
came downe vpon him, and yet not vpon him neither,
for after they vnderstood the Tragedie, euery man gaue ground,
knowing my pursie Ale-cunner could not follow them: what
is to bée done in this straunge Allarum? The whole Uillage
is in daunger to lye at the mercy of God, and shall bée bound
to curse none, but him for it: they should doe well therefore,
to set fire on his house, before the Plague scape out of it, least
it forrage higher into the Countrey, and knocke them downe,
man, woman, and childe, like Oxen, whose blood (they all
sweare) shall bée required at his handes. At these sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eches my
tender-hearted Hoste, fell downe on his maribones, meaning
indéede to entreat his audience to bée good to him; but they fea∣ring
hée had béene pepperd too, as well as the Londoner, tum∣bled
one vpon another, and were ready to breake their neckes
for haste to be gone: yet some of them (being more valiant then
the rest, because they heard him roare out for some helpe) very
desp: rately stept backe, and with rakes and pitch-forkes lifted the
gulch from the ground: Cōcluding (after they had laid their hogs∣heads
togither, to draw out som holesom counsel) that whosoeuer
would ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter vpon the dead man &amp; bury him, should haue fortie
<PB REF="23"/>
shillings (out of the common towne-purse, though it would bée
a great cut to it) with the loue of the Churchwardens and Side∣men,
during the terme of life. This was proclaimed, but none
durst appeare to vndertake the dread<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull execution: they loued
money well, mary the plague hanging ouer any mans head that
should meddle with it in that sort, they all vowde to dye beggers
before it should be Chronicled they kild themselues for forty shil∣lings:
and in that braue resolution, euery one with bagge &amp; bag∣gage
marcht home, barricadoing their doores &amp; windowes with
f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbushes, ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and bundels of straw to kéepe out the pestilence
at the staues ende.</P>
<P>At last a Tinker came sounding through the Towne, mine
Hosts house being the auncient w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ring place where he did vse
to cast Anchor. You must vnderstand hé was none of those base
rascally Tinkers, that with a ban-dog and a drab at their tayles,
and a pike-staffe on their necks, will take a purse sooner then stop
a kettle: No, this was a deuout Tinker, he did honor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od <HI>Pan:</HI>
a Musicall Tinker, that vpon his kettle-drum could play any
Countrey dance you cald for, and vpon Holly-dayes had earned
money by it, when no Fidler could be heard of. Hee was onely
feared when he stalkt through some townes where Bées were,
for he strucke so swéetely on the bottome of his Copper instru∣ment,
that he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpie whole Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and leade the swarmes
after him only by the sound.</P>
<P>This excellent egregious Tinker calls for his draught (be∣ing
a double Iugge) it was fild for him, but before it came to
his nose, the lamentable tale of the Londoner was tolde, the
Chamber-doore (where hée lay) being thrust open with a long
pole, because none durst touch it with their hands) and the
Tinker bidden (if he had the heart) to goe in and sée if hée knew
him. The Tinker being not to learne what vertue the medi∣cine
had which hée held at his lippes, powred it downe his
throate merily, and crying trillill, he fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es no plagues. In hée
stept, tossing the dead body too and fro, and was sorie hée knew
him not: Mine Hoste that with griefe began to fall away vil∣lanously,
looking very ruthfully on the Tinker, and thinking
him a fit instrument to be playd vpon, offred a crowne out of his
<PB REF="23"/>
owne purse, if he would bury the partie. A crowne was a shrew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
temptation to a Tinker; many a hole might he stop, before hée
could picke a crowne of it, yet being a subtill Tinker (&amp; to make
all Sextons pray for him, because hée would raise their fées) an
Angell he wanted to be his guide, and vnder ten shillings (by his
ten bones) he would not put his finger into the fire. The whole
parish had warning of this presently, thirtie shillings was saued
by the bargaine, and the Towne like to be saued too, therefore
ten shillings was leuyed out of hand, put into a rag, which was
tyed to the ende of a long pole and deliuered (in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of all the
Parish, who stood aloo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e stopping their noses) by the Head∣boroughs
owne selfe in proper person, to the Tinker, who with
one hand receiued the money, and with the other struck the boord,
crying hey, a fresh double pot. Which armor of proofe being fit∣ted
to his body, vp he hoists the Londoner on his backe (like a
Shoole-boy) a Shouell and Pick-axe standing ready for him:
And thus furnished, into a field some good distance from the
Towne he beares his deadly loade, and there throwes it downe,
falling roundly to his tooles, vpon which the strong béere hauing
set an egde, they quickely cut out a lodging in the earth for the
Citizen. But the Tinker knowing that wormes néeded no ap∣parell,
sauing onely shéetes, stript him starke naked, but first
diu'de nimbly into his pocket, to see what liuings they had, assu∣ring
himselfe, that a Londoner would not wander so farre with∣out
siluer: his hopes were of the right stampe, for from out of his
pockets he drew a leatherne bagge with seuen pounds in it: this
musicke made the Tinkers heart dance, he quickely tumbled his
man into the graue, hid him ouer head and eares in dust, bound
vp his cloathes in a bundle, &amp; carying that at the end of his staffe
on his shoulder, with the purse of seuen pounds in his hand,
backe againe comes he through the towne, crying aloud, Haue yée
any more Londoners to bury, hey downe a downe dery, haue ye
any more Londoners to bury: the Hobbinolls running away
from him, as if he had béene the dead Citizens ghost, &amp; he mar∣ching
away from them in all the hast he could, with that song still
in his mouth.</P>
<P>You see therefore how dreadfull a fellow Death is, making
<PB REF="24"/>
fooles euen of wisemen, and cowards of the most valiant; yea, in
such a base flauerie hath it bound mens sences, that they haue no
power to looke higher than their owne roofes, but séeme by their
turkish and barberous actions to belieue that there is no feliciti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
after this life, and that (like beasts) their soules shall perish with
their bodyes. How many vpon sight onely of a Letter (sent from
<HI>London)</HI> haue started backe, and durst haue layd their saluation
vpon it, that the plague might be folded in that empty paper, be∣lieuing
verily, that the arme of Omnipotence could neuer reach
them, vnlesse it were with some weapon drawne out of the infec∣ted
Citie: in so much that euen the Westerne Pugs receiuing
money there, haue tyed it in a bag at the end of their barge, and so
trailed it through the Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, least plague-sores sticking vpon
shillings, they should be naild vp for counterfeits when they were
brought home.</P>
<P>More ventrous than these block-heads was a certaine Iustice
of peace, to whose gate being shut (for you must know that now
there is no open house kept) a company of wilde fellowes being
lead for robbing an Orchyard, the stout<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hearted Constable rapt
most couragiously, and would haue about with none, but the
Iustice himselfe, who at last appeard in his likenesse aboue at a
window, inquiring why they summond a parlée. It was deliue∣red
why: the case was opened to his examining wisedome, and
that the euill doers were onely Londoners: at the name of Lon∣doners,
the Iustice clapping his hand on his brest (as who should
say, Lord haue mercie vpon vs) started backe, and being wise
enough to saue one, held his nose hard betwéene his fore-finger
and his thumbe, and speaking in that wise (like the fellow that de∣scribed
the villainous motion of <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> and the Duke of
<HI>Guize,</HI> who (as he gaue it out) fought a combat together) pul∣ling
the casement close to him, cryed out in that quaile-pipe voice,
that if they were Londoners, away with them to <HI>Limbo:</HI> take
onely their names: they were sore fellowes, and he would deale
with them when time should serue: meaning, when the plague
and they should not be so great together, and so they departed:
the very name of Londoners being worse then ten whetstones to
sharpen the sword of Iustice against them.</P>
<P><PB REF="24"/>
I could fill a large volume, and call it the second part of the
hundred mery tales, onely with such ridiculous stuffe as this of
the Iustice, but <HI>Dij meliora,</HI> I haue better matters to set my wits
about: neither shall you wring out of my pen (though you lay it
on the rack) the villanies of that damnd Kéeper, who kild all she
kéept; it had bene good to haue made her kéeper of the common
Iayle, and the holes of both Counters, for a number lye there,
that wish to be rid out of this motley world, shée would haue
tickled them, and turned them ouer the thumbs. I will likewise
let the Church-warden in Thames stréete sléepe (for hées now
pasi waking) who being requested by one of his neighbors to
suffer his wife or child (that was then dead) to lye in the Church∣yard,
answered in a mocking sort, he kéept that lodging for him∣selfe
and his houshold: and within thrée dayes after was driuen to
hide his head in a hole himselfe. Neither will I speake a word of
a poore boy (seruant to a Chandler) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>welling thereabouts, who
being struck to the heart by sicknes, was first caryed away by
water, to be left any where, but landing being denyed by an army
of browne bill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>men that kept the shore, back againe was he
brought, and left in an out-celler, where lying groueling and
groning on his face (amongst fagots, but not one of them set
on fire to comfort him) there continued all night, and dyed mise∣rably
for want of succor. Nor of another poore wretch in the
Parish of <HI>Saint Mary Oueryes,</HI> who being in the morning
throwne, as the fashion is, into a graue vpon a heape of carca∣ses,
that kayd for their complement, was found in the afternoone,
gasping and gaping for life: but by these tricks, imagining that
many a thousand haue bene turned wrongfully off the ladder of
life, and praying that <HI>Derick</HI> or his executors may liue to
do those a good turne, that haue done so to others:
