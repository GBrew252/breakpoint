<HEAD>To the Worshipful and much Esteemed Mr. <HI>Robert Berry,</HI> Mayor of the Anci∣ent Corporation of <HI>Guilford</HI> in <HI>Surry</HI>▪ And to all my Loving Neighbours and Friends.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THat I might pay a more than Momen∣tary acknowledgment for the many Te∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ies of Love and Honour I have daily receiv'd at your hands ever since Providence brought me amongst You, I humbly lay at your feet this little <HI>Book</HI>: And since Friendship is best preserv'd and cultivated by mutual Obli∣gations, I will (which indeed is all I can do on my part) in Return of Your many good Offices▪ when ever any of You, or your Friends, are pleased to call for my Assistance, make it my sole care and design to Administer proper Me∣dicines, as the Patients necessity shall require.</P>
<P>Another Reason of my Dedication, arises from the knowledge I have of Your Zeal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Godliness, and the Propagation of the true
<PB REF="4"/>
Religion, to which I hope this my little <HI>Book</HI> will in some measure Contribute. I need no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stimulate You to the encouraging of <HI>Virtue,</HI> and curbing of <HI>Vice,</HI> since I know that You, according to the Power God has invested You with, will take care to punish Iniquity, and maintain the Purity of the Christian Religion, which has suffer'd so long by the Remisness of many of its Professors, insomuch that <HI>Athei∣stical</HI> Principles and Practices have strangely gotten ground of Gospel Truths, to the Spiri∣tual Grief of all the Godly.</P>
<P>And now since I consider'd that Spiritual and Corporeal Maladies are the two grand Mis∣fortunes of Mankind, I have in these sheets endeavour'd to Remedy both.</P>
<P>Physick is chiefly what I Profess, nor am I asham'd since it is of such Intrinsick worth, that it even adds honour to the most honour∣able Practitioner: That it is profitable to the Natural Body, and consequently to the Body Politick, since the latter consists of the former as a Whole do's of its Parts, must be acknow∣ledg'd by every one that is <HI>Sanae Mentis,</HI> and
<PB REF="4"/>
needs not <HI>Helebore.</HI> Hence the Wise <HI>Gre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians</HI> did not without Reason highly commend <HI>Hypocrates,</HI> and the <HI>Latines</HI> their <HI>Corne∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius Celsus,</HI> for their Courage in first Ven∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uring, and Wisdom in wading into the Depth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f this Mystery, and for their transmitting in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Works this Noble Art to Posterity.</P>
<P>This Art was anciently Valu'd at so high <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rate, that <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Aesculapius,</HI> steemed by some the first Founders of <HI>Physick,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere adored as Gods for the Excellence of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vention.

<HEAD>David Irish, Practitioner in Physick, His Advice concerning Physick.</HEAD>
<P>PHysicians are called by <HI>Herophilus▪ Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Dei,</HI> the <HI>Hands of God,</HI> and not very im∣properly, since they are the Instruments he often uses in restoring Health, and repair∣ing decayed Nature: they ought with no less Cheer∣fulness and Diligence help the Poor in their Extre∣mity for nothing, or at most, for a very small Re∣ward, as the Rich for great Sums, since it is not the <HI>Physician,</HI> but <HI>GOD</HI> that cures; for in <HI>Exod.</HI> 15.26. God saith, <HI>He will put away their Diseases, and heal th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, if they keep his Commandments, it should go well with them, and they should be free from Diseases.</HI> In other places God hath stiled Himself <HI>Iehovah Rophe,</HI> the <HI>Lord the Physician,</HI> and worthily, for from Him comes the <HI>Gift of Healing</HI>; therefore, as I said be∣fore, Physicians and Chirurgeons also are but God's Inst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uments, who act under Him. 'Tis He only that can command Health; all the Medicinal means Physicians use are but the order in which he is pleased
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o work such effects on our Bodies as he sees <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittest for us. And no doubt but the Science of Physick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de a part of the great Wisdom wherewith <HI>God</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>spired <HI>Adam</HI>; for, questionless, thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enabled him to perform the Office of a Midwife, and to assist <HI>Eve</HI> in her Extremity; for, as may be gathered from Scripture, her Travail-Pains were as great as those of her Posterity and Sex are at this day.</P>
<P>Here it may not be imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtinent to observe, That Children, as soon as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y are born, (a good Argu∣ment of their Original) call out upon the two first Letters of our first Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts Names; the Males cry∣ing A E, A E; and the Females, E A, E A, as a Token of the miserable Condition <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI>▪ by their Disobedience, ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il'd upon their Pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rity; for indeed, by their breaking God's first Command∣ment, we had all for ever perished, were not God's Mercy great and wonderful towards his People, in working a means for their Redemption, as well as for their Recovery of Health, which is very ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie to be understood by the Angels Salutation, in his using the aforesaid Letters <HI>E V A,</HI> the Name of the Wo∣man, (who at first ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> us Bondsmen) to make us free, when the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> inverted their Order, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pronounced them <HI>A V E</HI> to the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>Since, as is said, God is the great Physician, when∣soever we are Sick, or any ways Infirm, let us call upon Him for Help, and He will hear us, <HI>being alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eadier to give than we to ask,</HI> 2 King. 20.5, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> consider then what <HI>God</HI> said to <HI>Hezekiah; Behold,</HI> (said he) <HI>I will heal thee.</HI> And <HI>Isaiah</HI> said, <HI>Take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lump of Figs, and they took them, and laid them on the Boile, and Hezekiah recovered, and lived</HI> 15 <HI>years after,</HI> Isa. 38. and <HI>Iohn</HI> 9.6. which Examples teach us, that without God the Prescriptions of Doctors
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
signifie nothing, but where God pleases, even ordinary means have great power to procure Health, which once obtain'd, Men ought to give Praise to God in perpetual Gratitude for their Recovery; but Men are in this, as well as in other Duties, too remiss, as appears by the Ten Lepers which Christ cured, of whom there was but one that return'd Him Thanks▪ tho' He expects the same return from all, (<HI>Rom.</HI> 12▪ <HI>Tit.</HI> 2.) especially those He heal'd and cured of trou∣blesome and dangerous Diseases.</P>
<P>We have his Word to ground our hopes and bold∣ness upon in asking, where He tells us, That <HI>He that heareth his Word, and believeth on Him, shall obtain Eternal Life.</HI> Now, if upon such Conditions He will give us Eternal Life, we need not doubt but that He will give us a temporary Health, if He sees that it be good for us, or condusive to that Life which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Everlasting. Therefore let us, as those that are not without Hope, <HI>be stedfast, unmoveable, always abound∣ing in the Works of the Lord, forasmuch as we know our Labour is not in vain in the Lord,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.58.</P>
<P><HI>Ex libris nemo evasit artifex,</HI> No Man becomes an Artist by Books, only this, as in most Arts, so in Physick, is undoubtedly true. Believe me, a greater insight is required to the making of a Physician▪ than what the best Books in the World can furnish a Man with; one must have Time and Experience to gain an acquaintance with the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owledge of Man's Body, and the Use of Instruments belonging to the Art; 'tis Practice that best teaches us the Virtues of Simples, and which alone can make Medicines call'd <HI>Experienced</HI> truly so.</P>
<P>He that is only Book-learn'd, his Skill at best is but Skin deep; <HI>Galen</HI> discreetly compares such to those Pilots, who by Books only will undertake to
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
steer a Ship into any part of the World, tho' they were never at Sea before; but the End of such a Man's Undertaking would doubtless be as dangerous to himself, as the Attempts of a Book-learn'd unex∣perienced Physician are to those he first practises on. Yet we have store of young Doctors, some of which not over-learned, who, as soon as ever they come out of the University, will undertake to write Prescripti∣ons to the Apothecaries for Medicines to cure the Sick even of the most obstinate and intricate Dis∣eases, when they are void of all manner of Experi∣ence and full of nothing at best but Noise and spe∣culative Notions: But since these two contribute little to the Recovery of the Sick, they are not by wise Men to be relied on, except when no others c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n be had; of this I will say no more, but tell you what an Emperor did on the like Occasion, when a young Doctor was brought to him. <HI>Doctor,</HI> said the Emperor, <HI>How many hast thou kill'd in the time of thy Practice?</HI> The young Graduate answer'd, <HI>May it please your Highness, Not one.</HI> To him the Emperor gave his Fee, and bid him be gone; for, said he, <HI>I'll take nothing from such a Doctor that has not kill'd any one in his Practice; he may try Experience upon me, and so kill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e first: Fetch me an old experienced Physician; for I've no mind to give beginning to any Man's Art by my End or D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath.</HI> Then they brought to the Em∣peror an ancient, grey, old Doctor, of whom the Emperor, as of the former, demanded, <HI>How many he had killed in his time of Practice?</HI> The Doctor an∣swered, stroaking his Beard with his Hand, <HI>If your H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghness can number these grey Hairs on my Chin, then I can tell you the Number of those to whom my Practice prov'd fatal; but by my then Killing, I have now well in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm'd my self of the way of Curing.</HI> <Q>God have

Mercy, old Doctor, reply'd the Emperor, I find by your Confession that you are an experienc'd Man, I'll venture to take something from you, or by your Directions, for I know, continued the Emperor, that by the Divine Decree of God Almighty, all Metals, Minerals, Herbs and Plants, enrich'd with various Scents, Tasts, Colours and Forms, grow and spring forth of the Earth, possest with many and great Virtues, insomuch, that I hold it a great Offence to attribute to any other than to the Deity the Benefit of a Blessing adapted for so many Uses; besides, the Knowledge of the Virtues of these things is no less than Divine in its Original; for cer∣tainly no Man's Capacity could ever attain to the Knowledge of these things at first, without the Assistance of a Supernatural Power and Inspiration; this being so, 'twill be easily granted, that when in the beginning God breathed into <HI>Adam</HI> the Breath of Life, he then also taught him the Knowledge of Nature in all her intricate Operations, Faculties and Virtues, that is, discovered to him, the secret Energy of all things contained in the Circuit of this Universe; and at this day we see the same God preserves by means all those Beings he at first made without means. In fine, said the Emperor, I will not adventure to be preserv'd by unexperienced Men, lest I should Shipwrack my self upon the Rocks of horrid Ignorance; but will look for the Con∣tinuance of my Life from those whose Experience, under God, has furnish'd them with the Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns and Methods of preserving Nature.</Q> You see, Reader, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Example of a wise Emperor, to teach thee a Les∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of necessary Caution</P>
<P>Since the Lord has endow'd the Earth and its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umerous Product with many Medicinal Virtues, 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well irreligious, as 'tis foolish in any, to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own

their Being, or to abhor their Use. <HI>From the Lord,</HI> as we have elsewhere said, <HI>cometh the Gift of Healing</HI>▪ which also appears from Scripture, seeing God is therein stiled, the <HI>Only Physician.</HI> God was the first Operator, as you will confess upon calling to mind his taking out one of our Grand-Father <HI>Adam</HI>'s Ribs whereof to make a Woman, which thing was so wonderful, that it may well be counted the greatest as well as the first Operation. Our Blessed Saviour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook his Name from his healing Nature, and to coun∣tenance our Practice made use of ordinary means, as <HI>Clay</HI> and <HI>Spittle,</HI> in Restoring Sight to the Blind; not but that he was able to have alone perfected the Cure by his powerful Word, without such means, were it not that he meant to show us, by his Exam∣ple, that with Means, and God's Blessing thereon, much may be done in Restoring Health to the Sick, and Ease to those in Pain. 'Tis above 5700 Years since God first taught our great Grand-Father <HI>Adam</HI> the Virtues of all things, and consequently furnish'd him with the main Materials fit for a Physician and Surgeon; but as to the practick part, by what I have already said, the latter is more ancient.</P>
<P>Let us be moderate in our desire after Knowledge, lest by a too hot pursuit, we, with <HI>Adam,</HI> not only lose what we seek for, but our primitive Science and Happiness into▪ the Bargain; therefore let us take our Saviour's Advice along with us, <HI>First to seek after the Kingdom of Heaven, and then all other things shall be added unto us.</HI> Let us then take heed, that we set not our Affections too much upon the things of this World, but rather let us seek after the true Knowledge of God; but we have no means to know God to purpose but by his Word; therefore let us study his Word, that we may have Eternal Life, which Word will in the next World bring us to it▪
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
and then we shall know the great Creator of the World, and us: and since even now all our little Knowledge, Arts and Sciences, come from God, let us then wholly rely upon Him; for <HI>except we abide in Him we can do no good thing,</HI> John 15.16.</P>
<P>Next, I will give you to understand what manner of Men <HI>Physicians</HI> and <HI>Surgeons</HI> ought to be; <HI>Omnibus aliis Medicus praestantior unus.</HI> They ought to excel others in fearing God, and eschewing Evil, as much as Divines themselves; for truly the Divine and Physician <HI>conveniunt in uno tertio</HI>; they are both for Curing; the Divine heals <HI>Corpus per Animam</HI>; the Physician, <HI>Animam per Corpus.</HI> Every Divine is a Spiritual Physician, and every Physician ought to be a Spiritual Divine, tho' not by Profession, yet by Practice; for into their Hands God has put the Lives of those he lov'd so well, that he Redeem'd them by the Blood of his only begotten Son. St. <HI>Luke,</HI> the beloved Physician, was a Divine Evange∣list, and commends the Study of those great Books of God, the Book of his Scripture, and that of his Creatures, since the glory of God, and the good of his Creatures, ought to be the Mark to which all the En∣deavours of Physicians ought to be directed.</P>
<P>Physicians should by no means give the least En∣tertainment to such a Monster as Covetousness within their Breasts; nor ought they to have any respect to Persons, but go as freely to the Poor for a little Money▪ or for nothing, when Need requires, as to the Rich for ample Rewards; for <HI>those that give to the Poor, lend to the Lord, and</HI> may be sure <HI>God will reward them double-fold.</HI> On the other hand, a Physician is not bound to behave himself in this manner to the Rich, but may take his Fee lawfully and cheerfully when it is offer'd; but there are too many who are willing
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
to have the Physicians Help, but slow in Paying him. Hence 'tis observ'd, that a Doctor appears to his Patient in three different Forms: <HI>First,</HI> when he tells the Patient there is hopes; O then he appears as an Angel. Next, when the Cure is perform'd, the Patient looks upon his Physician as a God. But lastly, when the Physician demands his Reward, then his Patient takes him for a Devil. Thus different Circumstances beget different Opinions in those hate∣ful Minds that are corrupted by Avarice and Igno∣rance. Therefore it▪ is the Physicians and Surgeons Rule, <HI>Accipere dum dolet,</HI> to take the Sound Fee whilst the Sick Hand gives it.</P>
<P>Life is short, Art long, Occasion sudden, Expe∣rience dangerous, Judgment difficult: Hence we may conclude, there are but few good Physicians; and yet it is not sufficient, tho' the Physician or Sur∣geon do their Parts or Office, unless the Patient and his Attendance do their Duty also, whereby outward things may be as well order'd as those that are given inwardly; this is the main Hinge upon which all the rest turn; and therefore ought earnestly to be prest, and all too little to make Servants diligent: The Physician ought to be faithful and cautious in Practice; for Life hangs as it were but by a slender Thread, and is at best but short, yet is apt to be made much shorter by many Accidents, and those very small ones too. Art is long, if Theory and Practice are consider'd. Diseases are sudden, and if not suddenly removed, may quickly ruine. Past Ex∣periments, if not well understood, may lead the Physician into Errour; besides, Judgment is very difficult, through the Variety of Diseases and their Causes, which, by the Fault of the Sick and his Atten∣dance, are many times not perceived even by Phy∣sicians of greatest Abilities.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10"/><HI>Astrology,</HI> tho' in many of its parts is accounted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idiculous, yet is greatly (if not only) useful for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose that study Physick; for without it the pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended Physician can never have the true Knowledge of the Crisis, or Critical and Judicial Days. It is most certain, that <HI>Hippocrates</HI> and <HI>Galen,</HI> the two Pillars of the Art of Physick, found out the Use of Vegetables and their Natures, as also many other Physical things, by the Influence of the Stars. But God is the Governour and Disposer of all their seve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Virtues; and when they are transplanted out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f their natural Soil, they lose their Planetary Vir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ues in a great measure, yet they continue with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame Colours and Smells, tho' not so strong; there∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore the Chymical Extractions made from them, where they naturally grow, are the best of Medicines, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f administred according to Astrological Rules, the want of knowing which, is the cause of great Errors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n many Physicians; but for finding out any Disease, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> say with <HI>Mepardus, Potius lotium inspiciendum quam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astra,</HI> That <HI>the Vrin is rather to be look'd into than the Stars.</HI></P>
<P>We read in Holy Writ, That <HI>the Physician is ho∣nourable</HI>; understand this of him that is expert; for one ignorant in his Art renders himself despicable and ridiculous. Now the way to make him perfect, is to know Nature, and her secret Operations. It is not the Physician's feeling the Pulse of the Party, or questioning with him how he feels himself, and in what part of his Body he is most afflicted, that can give a Man a thorough understanding of his Malady.

<P>It was the Opinion of the ancient Physicians, That the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Spleen</HI> contained a <HI>Ferment,</HI> which hindred them from performing rightly what they were intended for, because the abundance of <HI>fixt Salt</HI> falling upon the <HI>Stomach</HI> causeth <HI>soure</HI> and <HI>unsavoury Belchings,</HI> from which also proceeds <HI>melan∣cholick, tenacious, gross</HI> and <HI>crude Humours,</HI> which mixing with the <HI>Mass of Blood</HI> causeth a <HI>Cachexy,</HI> which obstructs the <HI>Liver,</HI> and finally ends in <HI>Scor∣butick</HI> Distempers. Now my <HI>Pills</HI> and <HI>Tincture</HI> are the most excellent means yet known for their Cure and Prevention, by cleansing and sweetning the whole <HI>Mass of Blood</HI> and <HI>nervous Iuyce,</HI> rectifying all the Defects and Injuries that putrifie the <HI>Blood,</HI> which being corrupt, defileth the whole Habit of Body, and is the Cause of <HI>Eruptions,</HI> or all sorts of <HI>Breakings out</HI>; as <HI>Itch, Leprosie, Spots, Ring-worms, Kings-Evil,</HI> and all sorts of <HI>Swellings</HI> in the Joynts, or other parts, which sometimes turns into <HI>Fistula's,</HI> or such fretting <HI>Vlcers</HI> or <HI>Sores</HI> that will hardly ad∣mit of Cure till the <HI>Scorbutick Humours</HI> be carried off, and the <HI>Mass of Blood</HI> cleansed from the afore∣said Humours, the primary Cause thereof; there∣fore you must first remove their Cause, before you can effect a Cure. Sometimes these Humours break out principally in the <HI>Head,</HI> and then it turns to the <HI>Scurff</HI> or <HI>Scald-Head.</HI> Sometimes they fall on

the <HI>Eyes,</HI> and produce <HI>Lachrymarious Humours,</HI> which endanger the <HI>Sight,</HI> by breeding <HI>Cataracts</HI> and <HI>Glau∣coma's,</HI> and if they obstruct the <HI>Optick Nerves,</HI> in∣curable <HI>Cataracts</HI> follow.

<P>And thus much I thought fit to say of the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> such as would know more may consult my little Pamphlet I formerly set out, for the <HI>Cure of the Sick and Diseased, through God's Blessing, by my Famous Medicines,</HI> therein mentioned.

That was only to be taken Spring and Fall; this may be taken at all Times and Seasons of the Year; when Necessity requires take it as follows: A strong Body may take all the <HI>Three Pills</HI> in a Morning alone in the pap of an Apple, Treacle, or Honey.

and then betwixt their workings, a little Posset-Drink, warm Beer, or Water-gruel, for the space of two hours, then eat some little fresh Meat for Din∣ner, or what is agreeable to the Stomach, that is to say, easie of Digestion.

<P>Such as are afflicted with any kind of <HI>Fits,</HI> must take it in the Morning, and at other times when the Fit is upon them, give it them in fair Water; but remember, that all such as take this <HI>Tincture,</HI> should first take a dose of <HI>Pills</HI> to prepare and cleanse the Body, and then the <HI>Tincture</HI> will effectually purifie the Mass of Blood, and cure them much sooner.</P>

<P>It is also an excellent Remedy for the <HI>Tooth-Ach</HI>; for it seldom fails of giving Ease in two or three minutes, if a little of the <HI>Powder</HI> be snuft up each Nostril, and some of the remaining Powder wet with a little of their own Water, and apply'd Plasterwise outwardly upon the pained part. This will give immediate Ease, as Thousands can testifie. <HI>The Pric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of each is One Shilling.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="20"/>I have also a rare and wonderful <HI>Water</HI> that has cured many of <HI>Cankers, Cancers,</HI> and such like <HI>Vlcers</HI> as eat away the Flesh.

<P>I likewise have Medicines which cure those Di∣stempers only incident to the Female Sex, which, tho' for Modesty not here mentioned, yet touching them any Woman may have private Instruction▪ and certain Cure from me or my Wife.

<P>I have many other rare Medicines, which have been much admired for their powerful Op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rations in relieving such as were afflicted with strange and most deplorable Distempers; but 'tis too tedious here to particularize either the Infirmities or Per∣sons; besides, many are not willing to have their Names and Distempers put in Print; yet there are few that know me, but know this to be true. I cure all that are curable, whether they be afflicted with

any sort of <HI>Sickness,</HI> or <HI>Melancholly, Madness,</HI> or any strange <HI>Convulsion-Fits</HI>; also <HI>Blindness, Deafness, Swellings</HI> of all sorts, <HI>Pains</HI> or <HI>Lameness, Ioint-Gout</HI> or <HI>Evil, Vlcers, Fistula's, Cankers</HI> or <HI>Cancers</HI> in any place. All sorts of <HI>Wens,</HI> or any <HI>Excrescences</HI> that any way deform or incommode the Body. I have cured these, and many other Infirmities, nay, when thought incurable by others.</P>
<P>I cut <HI>Hare-Lips,</HI> and in a Weeks time perfectly cure them. Likewise I cut <HI>Wry-Necks,</HI> and put them to no Pain, setting the <HI>Head</HI> upright in less than half a quarter of an hour, and in an hours time they may go about their Business, without any Danger or Trouble.</P>
<P>I have also rare <HI>Oils</HI> and <HI>Waters,</HI> famous for the Cure of most Distempers of the <HI>Eyes,</HI> without Pain or Smart. I couch <HI>Cataracts</HI> as dexterously as any Man whatsoever, restoring the Sight thereby in less than half an hours time, so as they may see to tell Money. No Sight, no Money is requir'd of them.

<P>So likewise for <HI>Deafness,</HI> if I see the Party, I will inform him where the Defect lies, and what it is that obstructs or hinders their Hearing, and also cure them if curable.</P>
<P>I dexterously perform all Chirurgical Operations; as <HI>Amputations</HI> of all sorts, as cutting off <HI>Mortified Limbs, Wens,</HI> or <HI>Cancerated Breasts,</HI> performing the Operation with Ease, Safety and Speed.

<P>I set broken <HI>Bones,</HI> or dislocated <HI>Ioynts. Limbs</HI> sprain'd or out of Joynt, I restore to their perfect Use and Strength, in a short time. I let <HI>Blood,</HI> and in all Cases inform People which Vein is most pro∣per

<P>Also, by Virtue of the <HI>Magnetick Stone,</HI> I draw <HI>Teeth,</HI> nay, even stumps of <HI>Teeth,</HI> with little or no Pain.</P>
<P>As for my Medicines in general, did I not know them to be good, I would never commend them as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do, since I send them no further than I am known or whither I often go: I am able to justifie thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> goodness and safety, knowing there can be no mi∣stake in their Preparations, being honestly and care∣fully prepar'd according to Art, not by the hands o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Servants, but by my own, who have often experienc'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them with good success, by reason whereof, many mistakes and dangers are avoided, and for that I do prepare them my self, I can afford them more reason∣able than others.

Never was the World more pester'd with these Impostors, for they creep now adays into small Villages, telling a Thousand Lies to thrust off their Trash and Trumpery, making the poor ignorant people believe they are the only Men in the World for curing all Distempers incident to Man∣kind: They commonly take half the Money in hand they agree for, which is more many times than an understanding Phisician would really have for per∣forming the Cure; nay, they often leave the Patient in a worse Condition than when they first undertook them. On their Stages they give a large account of their great performances in Remote Parts, which, if but throughly known, would be found for the most part as false as the Narration is loud and vociferous. And if at any time they by chance perform a Cure, they are so ignorant, that they cannot give the Rea∣son for such benigne Effects.</P>

<HEAD>David Irish, Practitioner in Physick, His Advice concerning Melancholy, <HI>Phrensie,</HI> and <HI>Madness.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Purpose, dear Countrymen, in this Discourse, to shew the difference betwixt <HI>Phrensie, Mad∣ness, Melancholy,</HI> and a <HI>Distressed Conscience op∣prest with the Sense of Sin,</HI> with many other things not unprofitable for thee to <HI>Read,</HI> nor unbe∣coming me to <HI>Write.</HI></P>
<P>Before I define <HI>Melancholy,</HI> for the clearer under∣standing of that wherein I mean to Instruct you, it will be necessary to set forth the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erse acceptations of the word <HI>Melancholy,</HI> which therefore is very equivocal, for that under one name it is so different∣ly apply'd, that it requires several Definitions accor∣ding to its diversity of Significations. Sometimes it signifies a certain fearful disposition of the Mind de∣viated from Reason, and sometimes an humour of the Body commonly taken to be the Cause that the Rea∣son is depraved through fear.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="27"/>This <HI>Humour</HI> is of two sorts, <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>Vnnatural, Natural</HI> is either the grosser part of the <HI>Blood</HI> or∣dained for <HI>Nourishment,</HI> which through too great Plenty or immoderate Heat, overchargeth the <HI>Body,</HI> and yieldeth up to the <HI>Brain</HI> certain <HI>Vapours,</HI> whereby the <HI>Vnderstanding</HI> is obscured, or else is an Excrement ordained to be Emitted out of the Body through so many alterations of Natural Heat and variety of con∣coctions, having not a drop of nourishing Juice re∣maining, whereby the Body, either in Power or Sub∣stance, may be Relieved.</P>
<P>If this Excrement keepeth within Bounds, it pro∣duceth less inconvenience or trouble to the Body or Mind; but if it corrupt or degenerate further from it self and the quality of the Body, then Perturbations and Passions are more Vehement, and do so out∣ragiously oppress and disturb the sedateness of the Mind, that all the organical Actions thereof are mix∣ed and affected, (I had like to have said infected) with <HI>Melancholy-Madness,</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> thereby is con∣verted in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a vain fear, or becomes a down-right <HI>Desperation</HI>; and now the <HI>Brain</HI> is quite alter'd in its Complection, being as it were transported into an Instrument of a different nature from what it was at first; and I have observed, that these Humours do according to the diversity of their setling, fill the Patient with diversity of Passions, and no wonder since thereby they diversly affect the understanding. In a word, they strangly alter the▪ natural Inclination and Affection, especially if by corruption of Nature, Education or Custom, the Party be rash and hasty.</P>
<P>The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnatural</HI> is an humour arising of the <HI>Melan∣choly</HI> before-mentioned, or else from <HI>Blood</HI> or <HI>Choler,</HI> totally changed as it were into another Nature by an unkindly heat, which violently turneth these humours
<PB N="40" REF="28"/>
that before were obedient to Natures Government, and by her kept in good order and <HI>decorum,</HI> into a quality wholly repugnant, whose substance and va∣pours gives such annoyance to all parts where it passes or is seated, that it makes strange alterations in Mens Actions, whether they be <HI>Animal, Voluntary,</HI> or <HI>Natural,</HI> not depending on our Will.</P>
<P>And here observe, that all Actions proceed from some faculty, and that Man being composed of Body and Soul, has two sorts of Faculties, <HI>viz. Corporeal</HI> and <HI>Spiritual,</HI> the Corporeal faculties are such as be∣long to Man, as he is a living Creature, and are com∣mon to him and even to Plants, or else are such as belong to him as he is a sensitive Creature, and are common to him and Beasts.</P>
<P>The faculties common to Man and Plants are three, <HI>First,</HI> The <HI>Nutritive,</HI> by which he is nourished, and converts Aliments into his own Substance. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Auctritive</HI> faculty, by which he grows bigger. And <HI>lastly,</HI> The faculty of continuing his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pecies,</HI> by which in his Off-spring his Nature as Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is preser∣ved or continued.</P>
<P>The faculties common to Man and Beast are three, that is, <HI>Sense, Appetite,</HI> and <HI>Power to Move. Sense</HI> is twofold, <HI>External</HI> and <HI>Internal.</HI> The Spiritual facul∣ties of Man, which are peculiarly proper to him as Man, are three, <HI>Vnderstanding, Will, Memory.</HI> Now, the Humours before mentioned, make strange alte∣rations in Mens actions, from what faculty soever they proceed.</P>
<P>As to the Definition, or what <HI>Melancholy</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, as was hinted before, the things being divers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ough the word be the same, yet the Definition must be diverse also; Therefore <HI>Melancholy</HI> is of the <HI>Humour,</HI> or of the <HI>Passion</HI>: The Humour is either a <HI>Nutritive Iuice</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="28"/>
or an <HI>Excrement</HI>; at this time then I will define the Humour to be no other than that part of the Blood which naturally is more gross than all the rest; and the <HI>Excrement</HI> to be the superfluity of the same, which if it putrifie, assumes a far different Name, Temper, and Nature, commonly called <HI>Black Cholar.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Melancholy Passion</HI> is a doating of <HI>Reason,</HI> occa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ioned by vain fear, procured by the prevalency of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Melancholy Humour:</HI> We divide this Disease into <HI>Melancholy Cephalick,</HI> and <HI>Hypocondriack.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Cephalick</HI> is when the disorder has its Residence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bout the lower part of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> the <HI>Brain</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hiefly affected, which being disturbed, Men frame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trange Fancies, and monstrous Idea's of things; all <HI>Melancholy</HI> people are extraordinary fearful, sad, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nactive.</P>
<P>According to the order I have observed in divi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing <HI>Melancholy,</HI> it remains that I now speak of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich is called <HI>Hypocondriack,</HI> which, for the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art, renders those Afflicted therewith, more stupid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han any other sort doth, insomuch that they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any times depriv'd of all Sense and Motion: This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort proceeds from <HI>Flegm</HI> obstructing the <HI>Hypocondria</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <HI>Spleen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Conclusion of this Treatise.</HEAD>
<P>I shall not here give you an Account, <HI>dear Country∣men,</HI> how to go through with the Cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Melanchol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> by Medicines and other Means, which I daily experi∣ence to be successful, because I have no other Main∣tenance but my Practice, therefore I shall conceal th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Secrets, and will not impart them to any Per∣son whatsoever save only to my Posterity, to whom▪ if God send Life, I intend to make expert in the Cure, not only of this, but of all other Diseases▪ But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to you, my intention was not to make you a Phisician, or to give you a Warrant to adventure upon Practise, as those do, who attempt to Cure di∣seases▪ by taking Medicines upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> trust out of any Book they meet with, many of which Medicines are really insignificant or hurtful in most cases, and many of them tho' good, yet are not so to all; for Medi∣cines are like a Tool or Instrument of the sharpes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Edge, which if not wisely guided or handled wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the knowledge, dexterity, and judgment thereto belong∣ing, they may bring Death instead of Health; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wisely Administred, they will either restore or pre∣serve Health; therefore Men are not to be admitted to administer Physick who have no lawful Call there∣unto, no, the Phisicians hands should be washed pure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd clean in the waters of Understanding and Wis∣dom,

<P>God created two great Lights to give light to the Earth, and made Stars without Number to adorn as it were the out-works of Heaven, all which, in pur∣suance to God's command, run the course he at first appointed them. In short, all Creatures which (if I may so speak) people the Elements, are the handy works of God: Man, tho' the chief, yet, perhaps to teach him Humility, was made of the mould of the Earth, and as some think, <HI>Adam,</HI> the first Man, was made on a <HI>Friday</HI> about 3 of the Clock in the After∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon, and out of him <HI>Eve</HI> his Wife, who bare seve∣ral Children; and here I cannot but observe, that the first War was about Religion, for <HI>Cain</HI> slew his Bro∣ther <HI>Abel</HI> by reason of his more acceptable Sacrifice: Thus we may see, that in the Worlds Infancy, as well as now, <HI>Goodness</HI> the Mark that <HI>Envy</HI> aim'd at, and <HI>Innocence</HI> Persecuted by the greatest <HI>Guilt,</HI> and <HI>Religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> suffer by the hand of <HI>Hypocrisie</HI> and <HI>Cruelty</HI>; from which, <HI>Good Lord deliver Vs.</HI></P>

<P>Here it will not be amiss to give an Idea or Notion of God, as far as the weakness of our understanding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> able to perform; for none can say what the Essence of God is, or which is the same, give a true and ade∣quate Definition of this infinitely perfect Essen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, because he is in all his Perfections In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inite; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spiri∣tual Entity, whose Exis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence is Eternally of him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf▪ independent of all other Beings, dwelling in Orbs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inaccessable Light, hence the Message which we have heard of God in the first Epistle of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ohn, Chap.</HI> 1. <HI>v.</HI> 5. tells us, That he is of a most Pure, Simple, Holy, Per∣fect, and glorious Nature, resembled by no Creature

He is Incomprehen∣sible, therefore none but himself can give an Account <HI>what he is.</HI> He had no Beginning, nor can he ever have an End, all times and things, whether past or to come, are ever present to him, so that as I often in∣culcate, it is impossible to speak him fully, yet so far as it hath pleased his Divine Majesty, out of his un∣speakable Goodness, to Reveal himself in his Word to us, we may to the utmost of our capacity express, as that he is a glorious Spirit, full of Truth, and must therefore be Worshipped in Spirit and in Truth▪ Now, there is no way but by consulting his Written Word, to know in what particular manner we ought to Honour and Serve him.</P>
<P>Though, as is said, whatsoever we can say or con∣ceive of God, comes far short of his Excellency, yet it is lawful (as far as our weakness can reach) to say, or rather lisp what he is, still regulating our discourse by the Line of his Word; therefore, I say, he is an Independent Being existing of himself, <HI>Ego sum qui sum,</HI> Exod. <HI>I am that I am,</HI> saith the Lord, that is, he is alone of himself, for all other things are not, but by him, nay, <HI>in him we live, move, and have our Being,</HI> saith St. <HI>Paul.</HI></P>

<P><HI>He is Omniscient,</HI> as appears from that of the <HI>Psalmist, Thou hast understood my Cogitations afar off, and hast foreseen all my ways, and knowest all things before they are done.</HI></P>

<P>And 8 years after <HI>Symmachus,</HI> the Bible was Tran∣slated by one whose Name I have not, but this Tran∣slation was call'd the Fifth Translation.</P>

<P>We ought not to measure and censure the Scrip∣tures according to our Sense and Reason, as being byass'd by Passions and Errors, but by diligent Prayer and Humility search after the Truth, and by often putting this in Practice, the Spirit of God will direct our Understanding to their true sense and meaning; 'tis the Holy Ghost that alone can Teach us here▪ As well the Divi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as the Disciple may without shame learn of such a Tutor, if they intend to confound Heresies, reduce Schisms, and root out Errors; <HI>observe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Scriptures</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>and thou shalt live,</HI> Luk. 10.

<P>'Tis observ'd, that in the Books of <HI>Moses,</HI> nothing is so oft.

<P>In the Apostles time the Gospel was Preached, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Believers were but a little Flock, but now it is further spread abroad: Christ himself said to his Disciples, <HI>Ye shall do greater things or works than I.</HI> As if be should have said, <HI>I have Preached in the Corn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs in the Land of</HI> Judea, <HI>but ye shall Preach openly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the house Tops,</HI> that is, <HI>Through the whole Vniversal World, and shall make the Gospel known to all Men in all Nations.</HI></P>

<P>The Holy Scripture makes mention of sundry things done at certain hours of the day not agreeing with the hours of our Account, as in <HI>Iohn</HI> 'tis said, <HI>The Rulers Son being healed of his Sickness at the Seventh hour, his Ague le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t him.</HI> And the Labourers that came into the Vineyard, <HI>came at the Eleventh hour.</HI> And in the Passion of Christ 'tis Recorded, <HI>That at the Sixth hour there was darkness over all the whole Earth.</HI> And <HI>about the Ninth hour he cried with a loud Voice, and so gave up the Ghost:</HI> In which is couch'd, some think, a Mystery, for <HI>Adam</HI> was Created (as 'tis supposed) on a <HI>Friday,</HI> about the same hour of the day as our Saviour Suffer'd: Now, to understand what hours these were, know that the <HI>Iews</HI> divided their Arti∣fici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l days into four quarters, allowing to every quar∣ter 3 hours, and so began the first hour of the first quarter at the rising of the Sun, and as they followed in order, they call each hour of each quarter the first, second, or third hour; so that the third hour of the first quarter they ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led the third hour, and the third hour of the second quarter they called the sixth hour, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h was Mid-day, called by us Twelve a Clock; and the third hour of the third quarter they called the Ninth hour; and the second hour of the fourth quarter they called the Eleventh hour; and they cal∣led the Twelfth and last hour Eventide: So that the Rulers Son healed at the Seventh hour, with us called One of the Clock in the Afternoon; and the Sixth hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when Darkness was over the whole Earth, was Mid-day, called by us Twelve a Clock; and their

Ninth hour, when Christ yielded up the Ghost, is called with us Three a Clock in the Afternoon: The Labourers that came into the Vineyard, came at the Elenth hour, about five a Clock in the Afternoon, or an hour before Sun-set.</P>
<P>Likewise they divided each Night into four quar∣ters, called by them the four Watches of the Night, the first three hours was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst Watch, during which time, all the Soldiers (both Young and Old) of any fortified Town or Garrison were us'd to Watch.

<P>I will now give you, after this Digression, some Examples which fully prove the Omnipotence, the Wisdom, and Mercy, and some other Attributes of God: The first shall be an Instance of three most famous Conjunctions which the Scripture relate, and which are all worthily wonderfully wondred at, the like shall never happen again, all being occasioned by the second Person of the Blessed Trinity his assu∣ming Humanity, which is a mystery wonderfully singular▪ and singularly wonderful, even to that de∣gree that the very Angels saw it with Amazement.

<P>There are four Duties incumbent upon Man, which above others, he ought diligently to perform, that is to say, To God Fear; To his Country Love; To his Parents Honour; and to his Neighbours favour: If we duly consider these Duties, we shall look to∣wards Heaven, despise the World, and prepare a Mansion for our selves in Heaven.</P>

Thou madest him lower than the Angels, to Crown him with Glory and Worship; Thou madest him to have Dominion over the works of thy hands, and thou hast put all things in Subjection under his Feet,</HI> Psal. 8.4. <HI>Moses</HI> sets forth

plainly that this glorious Universe, bespangled with sparkling Fires, every where adorn'd with wonderful objects, Proclaming the Wisdom and Omnipotence of its great Workman or Creator, was in Six days made out of an Eternal Privation of Matter by the Omnipotent <HI>Fiat</HI> of God: Hence, because that in Six days, the World, and all that therein is was Created, and because God rested the Seventh day, it is pro∣bably Collected, that in Six Thousand years, which are but as Six days in God's Account, the World shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gain be Dissolved. When (as is said) <HI>God had Created all things,</HI> he gave a real Blessing unto them, willing and decreeing by an Everlasting Law, that Animals should naturally multiply themselves by Generation. At the making of Man, as is hinted before, God, after a Divine manner, consulted with himself, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, concer∣ning the Creation of his chief Creature Man, as it were to this Effect, We have made our several Sub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unary Creatures in great Variety, having given to them Being, Life, Sense, and Motion, but now let us make the Creature for whose sake the rest have been Created, consisting of a natural Body, wherein he shall partake with other Creatures in Being, Life, Sense, and Motion, and of a Spiritual Nature and Substance, wherein he shall be like to us; he shall be endu'd with all the faculties of a reasonable Soul, with perfect Knowledge and Righteousness: Thus in respect of his spiritual Soul, was Man Created after the Image of God, whom he likewise resembled in Integrity, Ju∣stice, and Holiness, wherewith he was plentifully in∣spir'd; his Soul is Immortal, Immaterial, seperable from the Body, and so Man consisting of Body and Soul, became a perfect Creature, being endu'd with all things necessary to accomplish both. God saw it

not convenient for Man to be alone, Therefore, out of Man, who was made of Earth, he made Woman, and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve a Spiritual Blessing to them, and said, <HI>Be ye</HI> (through that power of Propagation which I give you) <HI>Fruitful, Multiply, and replenish the Earth, and be ye Possessors and Rulers of the same</HI>; and God to show his care to preserve what he had thus made, gave them leave to Eat freely of every Tree in the Garden, only with this limitation, <HI>That of the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee of the Know∣ledge of Good and Evil, they should not Eat.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, God finished the whole Creation by his mighty Power in the space of Six days, and on the Seventh day rested, rejoycing in the view of his glo∣rious Workmanship: Hence God gave a special Bles∣sing to the Seventh day, and Honoured it with this Priviledge, That it should be set apart for Rest and Holiness, that by this means Men might be put in mind of the wonderful work of the Creation, and might celebrate with holy Zeal the celebrated Rest of their Creator. Thus I have given an account of the Creation, wherein the Lord God, (who hath Eternal Being of himself) gave a Being to the Heavens▪ Earth, and all things therein, which will continue as long as God pleaseth, and is kept a Secret in the Mind of God, though, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s I said before, it is probably Collected, that in 6000 years (which are but as Six days in God's Account as some suppose) the World will be Dissolved▪ Then cometh Christs Thousand Years Reign, who bringeth with him an Everlasting Sabbath of Rest; of this Opinion were many of the Fathers, and also other more modern Writers▪ who Calculated for the End of the World thus: They allowed 2000 years before the Law: 2000 years un∣der the Law: and lastly, 2000 years to be accom∣plished under the Gospel, the end of which 6000

<P>I May call the following Meditations Divine, pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly because they are of Divine matters, and concern the Glory of God, and partly because they are taken out of the pure Fountain of Divine Truth the Scrip∣tures, and partly because they are collected (in part) out of the Writings of several Eminent Divines, whose Volumes are too big, and of too great a price to be in the hands of many Pious people: They are in a word, such as are not to be found in common Authors.</P>
<P>As to the necessity of the Duty of Prayer, Read 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.1. where you will find that the chosen Ves∣sel of God, St. <HI>Paul,</HI> doth exhort, <HI>That first of all, Deprecations, Supplications, Intercessions, and giving of Thanks, be made for all Men, for Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godliness and Honesty.</HI> Again, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.6. he says, <HI>Be careful for nothing, but in all things, let your Petitions be manifest unto God in Prayer and Supplications, with giving of Thanks</HI>; by which places of Scripture, we are not only pricked forward to the holy Exercise of Prayer, but taught also, that there are four kinds thereof, all necessary to be used every day.</P>
<P>First <HI>Deprecation,</HI> whereby we beg at the hands of Almighty God, either altogether to turn away his heavy displeasure conceiv'd against us, through our Sins, or at least to mittigate the Punishment due for our Offences.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Supplications,</HI> are Prayers, whereby we crave such things as are necessary, either for the Su∣stentation
<PB N="88" REF="55"/>
of this present Life, or for our everlasting Comfort in the World to come.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Intercessions,</HI> are Prayers made in the be∣half of others.</P>
<P>And lastly, <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> is when we Praise God, and celebrate his holy Name for all the Benefits con∣fer'd both upon our Souls and Bodies.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="prayer">
<HEAD>Some short <HI>Ejaculations</HI> and <HI>Prayers,</HI> according to Scripture Rules.</HEAD>
<P>I Give thee most hearty thanks, O Eternal God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for that it hath pleased thee of thy unspeakable Mercy and Goodness, in all Ages succesfully to send into the world Men wonderfully endow'd with thy Gifts, and adorn'd with the knowledge of thy Will, to be Revivers and Preachers of thy Word of Truth, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.34. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4.2.1, 2.</P>
<P>I likewise render most hearty thanks unto thy most Sacred Majesty, for sending thy only Son, that great Shepherd of thy Church, to make known thy Word to such as thou thinkest fit to teach thy People the Truth of thy Written Word, for the gathering to∣gether thy Church out of all Mankind, to the build∣ing up of the Body of Christ.</P>
<P>I humbly beseech Thee, most gracious God, to con∣tinue always amongst us thy pure Word, and through thy Ministers, gather to thy self an infinite and ever∣lasting Congregation, and so instruct my heart with thy Spirit of Truth, that I may unfeignedly assent to thy wholesome Word, whereby I may prove a lively Member of thy Body, and be incorporated into that Society which doth in this World sincerely con∣fess

thee, and in the next World for ever enjoy thee, evermore extolling the holiness of thy Name; pre∣serve in safety the Ministers and Teachers of thy Word, and give them the certain knowledge of thy Blessed will, that by thy Word they may from time to time open unto us thine intent concerning the repairing of Mankind, to the Saving and Redeeming of our Souls thro' thy free Mercy; and also teach us here to live in new obedience, and to withstand the violence and allurements of our carnal desires which fight against the Soul, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.12.</P>
<P>Inspire the Preachers of thy Word with the Divine Breathings of thy holy Spirit, that they may utter thy Will with the Purity they receive from thy Mouth, retaining the form of wholesome Words, and sound∣ing none but the Doctrine manifested by thy Son out of thy Bosom, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.13. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 1.18. for by departing from the order of the Faith and Rule of thy Word, they will greatly obscure the light of thy Doctrine, and obtrude upon us the Vanity of their own Inventions for thy holy Inspirations; therefore let them speak thy Word not deceitfully but sincere∣ly, as from thee and in thy sight, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.2.</P>
<P>Grant also that by transforming thy Divine Mini∣stry into Earthly Policy, they Lord it not over thine Elect, neither proudly contend about Superiority and Primacy in thy Church, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5▪ 3. But only seek the Glory of thy Name, and the Salvation of them∣selves and us committed by thy Providence to their Charge; give them liberty of Speech, boldly without fear, to blame and rebuke all false Doctrine, Blas∣phemous Superstitions, and abuses in thy Church, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 6.19. Open unto them the door of utterance, that they may speak the Mysteries of Christ, and ma∣nifest them as they ought to do, so shall their doings

Assist them also with thy especial Grace, that they disgrace not the Doctrine which they Teach and Preach by impurity of Life, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.2, 4. but especially assist the Shep∣herd under thee whom I hear for the good of my Soul, from whose Mouth I learn thy Blessed Will: keep him, O Lord, I heartily Pray, in Religion sincere and pure, from enormous Offences in his outward Conversation, endow him with a long and healthful Life, (if it be thy Will) that he may live to Convert many by Preaching thy Word of wholesome Do∣ctrine, and then we shall be Converted, because thou art our God, and being Converted, we will do Pe∣nance; shew us our Offences, that we may have a true sense and hearty sorrow for our Sins▪</P>
<P>O Son of God, who art the Lord and head Shep∣herd of all thy Flock, work thou effectually by thy Preachers, and speak thou also within us to our hearts, the blessed Will of thy Eternal Father, and confirm thy Doctrine in our Minds by thy holy Spirit; and grant, I beseech thee, that we may truly know and discern the same from the howling of Wolves, and from the Inchanting Songs of Hirelings, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 10.12. and 17.15. and grant that we may know thee, even as thou knowest thy Heavenly Father, and walk Religiously and Righteously in thy Sight, showing our selves to be that holy Seed which praiseth thy Name for evermore.</P>
<P>Come Holy Spirit, open my Heart and Ears, that I may conceive the profit of thy wholesome Doctrine, and the sweet Comfort revealed in thy Holy Words by the Preaching of the Gospel.</P>

<P>How excellent a thing it is for Man to converse with God! this joyns Man in Society with Angels, thro' ascribing with them due Praise and Glory unto the Almighty: Let nothing dismay a Christian from Praying unto God, for the Prayer of the Righteous is the Key of Heaven; the Prayer of the Godly doth ascend, and the Mercy of God doth thereby come down; therefore we will Sing Praise unto Thee, O Lord, for as thou hast been our Defence in the day of our trouble, even so I beseech Thee to protect and save us everlastingly. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Let us with St. <HI>Paul, Heb.</HI> 4.16. come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy: That is, let us in confident assurance of God's readi∣ness to help us, make our Addresses boldly and chear∣fully to the Throne of his Grace upon all occasions, suing to our bountiful God for the Relief of all our Necessities; and let us consider when we are about to offer up our Petitions to God by Prayer, what ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> necessities and wants are before we ask, least throug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> temerity we ask amiss. His freeness to give, ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well make us bold to ask; his power to supply us, may give us hopes to obtain what is necessary for us, and his greatness ought to make us temper our Ad∣dresses with Humility; as for choice of Words, and Elegant long Harangues, let us not be too solicitous, for God regards not Eloquence, and long Harangues so much as the sincerity of those that invocate his Majesty. Men chiefly mind the neatness of expression▪ God the Truth and fervency of what is exprest: We are commanded to Pray without ceasing, which is best done according to Scripture Rules, because no Method is comparable to that which God has laid down for us, and Christ taught us.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="57"/>When we groan under the weight of any Affliction, we shall ever find help, by calling upon God, desiring the assistance of the Righteous to be joyned with us in Prayer, <HI>For the Prayers of the Faithful availeth much</HI>▪ their help we are admonish'd to desire by the Exam∣ple of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who said to the <HI>Romans, I beseech you Brethren, for the Lord Iesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h me in your Endeavours and Prayers to God for me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the light of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Countenance, and for assisting in every Duty,</HI> Rom. 15.20.</P>
<P>Some define Prayer thus: An humble lifting up of the Heart, or a pouring out of the Soul to God in the Name of Christ; it is crying <HI>Abba, Father.</HI>. As Scrip∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure is God's Letter wherein he openeth his Mind to Man, so Prayer is Man's Letter, wherein he expresses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Mind to God: A thought can fly speedily to the utmost part of the Earth, but Prayer in a Moment as∣cends to the highest Heavens, 'tis as it were a speaking Trumpet, one end of which being fastened to Man's mouth, it carryeth the Petitioning voice to God's Ear, tho' spoken near so softly.</P>
<P>Prayer hath a twofold advantage of some other Duties, in regard its Influence is Universal, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts Exercise an opportunity is never wanting. A Christian cannot always hear or read God's Word, out he may Pray continually.

A good Chri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tian need not be very nice in chusing a place for De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otion, since to him every house is a house of Prayer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd every place he comes to an Altar, whereon he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay offer up to God a Sacrifice of Prayer; yet De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ency is not to be forgotten, (as far as circumstance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill allow) since even by it we express a kind of De∣votion
<PB N="94" REF="58"/>
to our God; but many alass are so far from being curious in this point, that they forget to pay at all this Duty, tho' most necessary to the obtaining their Eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>If we are in doubts about our Spiritual Estate, let us in Prayer go to God, who is marvellous in Council? are we in Affliction, let us call upon him for help, and he will not only hear us, but also in his good time deliver us? Do's any affliction seize our Bodies, which endangers our lives or disturb our tranquility, let us by Prayer call upon him at Midnight, and he will make hast to help us; tho' we are troubled ex∣ceedingly, in a Moment he can give us quiet and rest; nay, tho' we should be encompassed with Enemies, driven to the greatest of Necessities, perplex'd with Doubts, threatned with Dangers, or like <HI>Peter,</HI> falsly Imprisoned, and watched narrowly Night and Day, lest we should make an Escape; yet Prayer, as another <HI>Moses,</HI> will go before us, and so engage God on our side, that he will vanquish our Enemies, relieve ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Necessities, unfold our Doubts, prevent our Dangers▪ convert our Bondage into Liberty, and guide us all the way thro' the Wilderness of this World, 'till we arrive at the Spiritual Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and be En∣roled Citizens of the Heavenly Jerusalem, where Christ is, infinitely exceeding that <HI>Ierusalem</HI> where Christ was, and whither the Devout <HI>Iews</HI> went once a year to Worship.</P>

If we consider, the Siege of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> began at the time of the Passover, when in a manner all <HI>Judea</HI> was inclosed in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> all private Synago∣gues doing their Duties to the Mother Temple, so that the City then had more guests than Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Thus the Passover which was at first Instituted by God in Mercy, to save the <HI>Israelites</HI> from Death, was then used by him in Justice to hasten their Destru∣ction, and to gather the Nations into a bundle to be cast into the fire of his Anger, as our Saviour had foretold them; besides, those who had bought our Saviour for Thirty Pence, were themselves sold Thirty for a Penny; whilst this Storm fell among the Unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> it was calm among the Believ∣ing <HI>Jews</HI>; that is, those that were become Christians, who forewarn'd by Christs Predicti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, fled betimes out of the City to <HI>Pella,</HI> (a private place beyond <HI>Jordan</HI>) which serv'd them instead of a little <HI>Zore</HI> to save them from the eminent Destruction of <HI>Sodom.</HI></P>

<P>And now the chief Head of the scattered unbeliev∣ing <HI>Jews</HI> keep the meaner sort, as well as themselves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the use of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> nay, they will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oone: Curse it, than look into it, the which thing is the hindrance of their Conversion and Salvation: And thus we leave them in a state most lamentable, and much to be pitied.</P>
<P>Lastly, It may justly seem admirable, how senseless religions should gain so much ground on Christianity, such having neither substance in their Doctrine, nor winning Behaviour in their Ceremonies to allure Professors; for what are many Here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies but the Scum of <HI>Judaism</HI> and <HI>Paganism,</HI> yet like in growth to the River <HI>Nilus,</HI> which is famous and well known for its overflowing Streams, though hidden and obscure as to its Fountain. It's the Justice of God to deliver them over to believe Lies, who will not obey the Truth. You are here put to understand, what diffe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of days there is betwixt the <HI>Christians, Jewish,</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI> Sabbaths; The Christians keep theirs the first day of the Week, call'd <HI>Sunday</HI>; The Jews on <HI>Saturday</HI>; and the Turks on <HI>Friday,</HI> in Scorn of Christ, who was on that day Crucified.</P>
<P>The true Church is an Assembly, or such a congre∣gation as Believes things which do not appear, neither may be comprehended in the Mind, that is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t depends only on God's Word, what the same saith, the true Church Believes without any addition, giv∣ing honour to God, and taking that to be true which in the Word is delivered unto them, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5.3. As to the place where this true Church is, I answer, 'Tis wheresoever God's Word is purely taught; and the head Shepheard of this Church is Christ Jesus.</P>

<P>He also has a spiritual and invisible Coming into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he secret recesses of our Souls by Grace, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he power of his Holy Spirit, which doth raise us from the Grave of Sin, and Spiritual Death; This Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing is <HI>in Misericordia,</HI> in Mercy.</P>
<P>But his last Coming is in Justice, in Majesty, and in Glory, to Judge the Quick and the Dead, and to render to every one according to his Works, whether they be Good or Evil; and to Transform the Church Militant into the Church Triumphant: And this C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ming is called by St. <HI>Paul</HI> the Glorious Appearance of our great God, and only Saviour Jesus Christ: and himself has foretold, that he the Son of Man shall come Cloathed with a Triple Glory, that is, in his own Glory, in his Fathers, and in that of the Holy Angels.</P>

<P>As to the Place where this great Assize will be hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the common Opinion is, that it will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>salem,</HI> in the Valley of <HI>Iehoshaphat,</HI> which <HI>Cos∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aphers</HI> assign for the middle of the Earth's super∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies; for if the <HI>termini à quibus,</HI> be the four Parts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the World, then the <HI>terminus ad quem</HI> must be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bout the Centre. Another Reason is, because the Angel told the Disciples, That as they saw Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d from Mount <HI>Olive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which is over the Valley of <HI>Iehoshapha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> so He should in like manner descend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom Heaven. Now that the said Valley, or some Place adjacent to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> should be the place of Judgment, 'tis most probable; because that as Christ was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hereabouts Crucified, and put to open shame; so it is likely that thereabouts his glorious Throne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall be exalted in the Air, when he shall appear in Judgment, to manifest his Majesty and Glory; and so He in that place will judge the World with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighteous Judgment, where h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Himself was unjustly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udged and condemned.</P>
