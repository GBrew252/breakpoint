<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, (AND HIS singular good Lord) EDVVARD, Earle of <HI>Dorset,</HI> Lord Chamberlaine to the Queene, Lord Lieutenant of his Majesties Counties, of <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Middlesex:</HI> One of the Lords of his Ma∣jesties most Honourable Privie Councell, and Knight of the most Illustrious Order of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arter.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>RIGHT HONOVRABLE:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His Pilgrime of <HI>Sion,</HI> having beene beaten with the stormes and tempests of a long persecu∣tion beyond the Seas, after hee had learnt the sweetnesse, and tasted the goodnesse and Debonayritie, which makes your Nation and Nobility of <HI>England</HI> honourable, and recommendable to all the foure corners of the Vniverse, hee is at last arrived in your Ports and Harbours, to shelter him∣selfe from the waves and windes, which so
<PB REF="3"/>
cruelly had beaten and assayled him, as they would not permit him, either to feede, or rest. But casting anchor here in your Harbours, I finde that Fame hath infinitely wronged her selfe, in not having sufficiently discoursed, and published the excellencie of your goodnesse and merits: Shee seemes to be sparing of your pray∣ses, which are so justly due to you; For Ex∣perience hath now made mee know a thousand times more therof, thē heretofore I heard or un∣derstood, because I find so much benignity and goodnesse among you, and especially your Ho∣nours house, that I should e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teeme my selfe to be guilty of a base ingr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>titude, if I consecrated not the remaynder of my dayes to the honour of your service and commands; For I confesse, that this small Present, which I now present and proffer you, cannot counter vaile or equa∣lize those sublime favours; whereby you have eternally made me your debter.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Philosophers, which entreat and dis∣course of naturall causes, doe affirme, That the Sunne which makes the Raynebowe in the firmament, by the darting and defusion of his rayes, in a watry clowd disposed to receive it;
<PB REF="3"/>
doth there forme and ingender this diversity of colours so pleasing to our sight. Your Ho∣nour (my good Lord) is the Sunne of my hap∣pinesse, and I am this clowd covered with the rayes of your favours, which makes all the world admire in me, the greatnesse of your Ge∣nerosity, and the excellencie of your goodnes.</P>
<P>But herein (notwithstanding) consists not my satisfaction, but rather your honour and glory, and as I desire to publish that, so I like∣wise desire to finde this; For I cannot live contented, if I made not a publique acknow∣ledgement of those many favours, whereby you have perfectly purchased and made me yours, and this Confession consisteth in the oath of fidelity and obedience, which I have sworne to the honour of your service, and to testifie the the immortality of my vowes, wherein with all possible humility I present you my selfe, and this small Booke to your Honours feete; A worke proportionable to my weakenesse, but meerely disproportionable to your Greatnesse.</P>
<P>If I am any way guilty herein, your good∣nesse is the true cause thereof; in regard it makes me beleeve that you will rather excuse
<PB REF="4"/>
my zeale, then accuse or condemne my pre∣sumption▪ and I doe promise my selfe this hope, and flatter my selfe with this confidence, that your Honour will partly excuse this worke of mine, if it be not accuratly or delicately po∣lished, and that the will remayning where the power wants, is free and current payment with great and generous spirits.</P>
<P>Some perchance may affirme and say, that I have discoursed &amp; treated those Matters with too much simplicity, which indeede is my onely intent and designe. Because my text and mat∣ter do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> necessarily oblige and tye me thereunto, as also in regard I ever finde the easiest way to be the best, for that the thornes of Studie and Schollership, doe but ingage and ingulph our Witts in the labyrinth of insupportable length and languishment, and the which most com∣monly when wee have all done and ranne tho∣rowe, wee in the end finde but a Minotaur of doubts, and a pensive melancholy anxietie which devoures them. My Lord, I have no other designe or ambition in this my Dedicati∣on, but to pay this tribute to your Honour, ho∣ping that your charities will cover my defects,
<PB REF="4"/>
and your goodnesse over-vayle and pardon my weakenesse and imperfections.</P>
<P>And my Lord, it is with all manner of right and reason, that I consecrate and inscribe this small Worke of mine to your Honour, and place your Honourable name in the Frontispice thereof, as a bright Phare and relucent torch, which shall communicate and lend its lustre and light, to make it see and salute the world.</P>
<P>And so my good Lord, I will seeke my de∣lights in the honour of your service; my incli∣nations shall have no other centre, but the exe∣cution of your commaunds. My vowes and prayers shall bee incessantly powred forth for your prosperities; and my Ambition shall ne∣ver flye or soare higher, then to conserue the honour of your favours, and to be both to your Honour, and to the young Noblemen your Sonnes,</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>MATH. 5.7.</BIBL>
<P>Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed are the mercifull, for they shall obtaine mercie.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat which in men chan∣geth Reason, courtesie, and humanitie, into a wilde, fierce, and brutish nature, and which makes them lesse pittifull then Lyons, and more to be feared then Tygers, is crueltie; that terrible vice the mother of cowardize, the spring of disasters, and the death of innocencie.</P>
<P>For after a Coward hath once tasted of blood, he delights in no other spectacle.</P>
<P>It is the cause of mischiefes, and of so ma∣nie fatall and mournefull accidents; for there
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
being a naturall Antipathy betweene that vice, and reason, shee expells reason; and therefore will not hearken unto her, in her furious, vio∣lent, and suddaine counsels.</P>
<P>In a word, it is the death of innocencie, for to satisfie her bloody appetite, shee spareth nei∣ther age, nor sexe, but upon the altar of her fu∣rious and brutish passion, sacrificeth as well the just, as the guilty, and would not spare her selfe, if shee feared not the selfe same paines and tor∣ments, which she inflicts on others.</P>
<P>Now this vice is detested by noble spirits and generous soules, is abhorred by Angels, and in great abomination to God himselfe; so by the law of contraries, mercie must be the sub∣ject▪ and royall field, where we must abundantly reape the honour of men, the love of Angels, the graces and blessings of our heavenly Father, then must mercy be practised by men, admired by Angels, and bee delightfull to God, and therefore we see in our Text, that the beloved Sonne of eternity it selfe Iesus Christ our Savi∣our, to perfect his Apostles in the way of salva∣tion, saith to them in generall, <HI>Blessed are the mercifull, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As if hee had said, I doe much hate and ab∣horre cruelty, that I desire also that you that are my Disciples, should expell and banish it quite from your hearts, and thoughts, and in her roome to admit and entertaine mercy, that heavenly vertue, which I both esteeme deerely, and love, and respect perfectly.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6"/>You must therefore practise this eternally praise-worthy vertue, if you will be blessed; for it is impossible to get into my Fathers fa∣vour, if you be not furnished and armed with mercie.</P>
<P>You cannot ascend to the top of felicity, be∣fore you have left sinne, this heav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and intole∣rable burthen, I say, before you have received pardon, and absolution for your faults, which you can never obtaine, before you have for∣given your brethren their offences; before you have shewed your selves favourable and wil¦ling to assist them; In a word, before you have ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended and practised on them all sorts of mildnesse, clemencie, and meekenesse, which they shall stand in neede of, for I say vnto you, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Blessed are the mercifull, for they shall obtaine mercie.</HI></P>
<P>We reade words like unto these, <HI>Luke</HI> 6.36. <HI>Be yee mercifull, as your Father is mercifull:</HI> And againe after, <HI>forgive and it shall be forgiven unto you; give and it shall be given unto you:</HI> And <HI>Eccl.</HI> 4. <HI>Be mercifull to the Orphans, be unto them a fa∣ther, and to their mothers a husband, and then yee shall be the obedient sonnes of the most high, who will yet more liberally distribute unto you his great mer∣cie:</HI> And <HI>Pro.</HI> 11. <HI>The soule that doth good, shall be exceedingly filled and replenished.</HI></P>
<P>It is a principle flowing from our nature, that we must not doe to another what we would not have done to our selves, from which principle is derived that golden sentence of Christ. <HI>Luk.</HI> 6.
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<HI>With what measure you mete, it shall be againe mea∣sured unto you.</HI> And <HI>Iames</HI> 2. <HI>Condemnation with∣out mercie shall fall on them that have not used mer∣cie, and mercie is glorified against condemnation. Blessed then are the mercifull, for they shall obtaine mercie.</HI></P>
<P>In which words by Gods assistance, which wee to this end implore, wee will consider, 1. Who be these <HI>mercifull.</HI> And 2. The reason why they are termed <HI>blessed.</HI></P>
<P>And first, let us heare the sacred voyce of the eternall Sonne of God, the Redeemer of our soules, saying in the first part of our Text, <HI>Blessed are the mercifull,</HI> as if he had said, O how great and altogether incomparable, and incom∣prehensible are the favours, blessings, and gra∣ces laid up for them that shall practise the works of mercie, they shall be Citizens of heaven, the Angels companions, and shall eternally enjoy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ossesse in heaven, those b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atitudes which eye hath not seene, eare hath not heard, and that are not entred into the heart of man; and this is the recompence that God hath prepared for them which practise mercie.</P>
<P>Now that we may the better know the defi∣nition of this word, <HI>Mercifull,</HI> which is the con∣crete, or conjoyned, we will fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t consider it in its abstract, as the Philosophers speake, to wit, <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cie,</HI> which is commonly defined to be, A hearty griefe▪ or a sorrow, for anothers miserie, whom we assist and helpe with all our power.</P>
<P>The object of it, is, the miserie and affliction
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
of other, which makes her produce these graci∣ous and pittifull effects, because shee is unable to behold the sore, without applying the re∣medie.</P>
<P>God being one, cannot suffer any kinde of division, there be no qualities nor accidents in him, but all things are essentiall in him, the Scripture to represent him unto us, doth de∣scribe him all justice, and all mercie, so by rea∣son of the fore-going maxime, wee cannot say, that mercie is one of his parts, seeing that being one, hee is indivisible; but wee will more pro∣perly say, that he is <HI>Mercie</HI> it selfe, and therefore the faithfull that shall bee mercifull, that shall practise the works of charity, of clemencie, and meekenesse, may undoubtedly beleeve that they are the sonnes of the most high, who hath com∣municated unto them a ray or sparke of his insi∣nite grace, and mercie, that so they may there∣by resplend and shine with the same light with their heavenly Father, tread upon his steps, and be made like him as much as may be, <HI>Be merci∣full (saith Iesus Christ) as your heavenly Father is mercifull,</HI> Luke 6.36.</P>
<P>Mercie, said an ancient Doctor, <HI>est fidei orna∣mentum,</HI> it is the ornament of faith, for faith sheweth her selfe by her fruits, which are pious and charitable works, and as trees are never so faire to behold, as when they are loaden and covered with fruits; so faith never appeareth so glorious, as when she is adorned and crow∣ned with the sweet and delightfull fruites of
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
mercie; Hee called it againe <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lutis domicilium,</HI> the retreate and lodging of salvation, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cause that when sinners shall be called to give account of their actions before God, when God shall aske them, the reason of their administration, as that Lord in the Gospell, then the shortest and safest remedie, is to flye to his mercie, and to aske him forgivenesse.</P>
<P><HI>Salomon</HI> that wise King, counselleth us to make a carcanet of mercie, to put it about our necke, and that in this habit and ornament wee shall make the accesse of heaven free to our selves, finding grace before God, and men: and indeed it is one of the most pretious stones, and that is fit to beautifie and adorne the crowne of perfection it selfe.</P>
<P>Wee will therefore compare it to the Op∣pall stone <HI>Irius,</HI> which represents the same co∣lours that appeare in the Raine-bowe, so the mercifull makes all sorts of graces and blessings to shine upon his forehead, and to appeare in his actions; this Oppall stone <HI>Irius</HI> is greene, red, and white, the greene colour represents unto us that Hope which we have to finde grace before the soveraigne Iudge of our soules and bodies; The red colour represents unto us the pure blood of Christ, shed upon the Crosse, to obtaine this grace for us, she also denoteth unto us the rednesse of our sinnes, according to the Prophets phrase, <HI>Though our sinnes were as red as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snowe, Isa.</HI> 1.18. and the white colour figureth unto us the divine
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
justice, covered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd overcome by the white∣nesse of his mercie, as it is noted in the Raine∣bow▪ that his white colour covereth, and ex∣ceedeth the red if faire weather to be follow; They marke besides that this Oppall easeth the paines and labours of women with childe, so mercie lighteneth much the mise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie and griefe of the afflicted.</P>
<P>We will here make no di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ficulty to u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in this place the fabulous inventions of the Poets, fol∣lowing the example of <HI>Salomon,</HI> who tooke of <HI>Hiram</HI> (though a Pagan) all the wood, and stones needfull for the building of the temple.</P>
<P>They usually describe <HI>Mercury</HI> (the messen∣ger of the imaginary Gods) with a wand in his hand, composed of hornes of plenty, wreathed with serpents, they also give him wings, with which he with incredible celerity, flyes whe∣ther soever he is sent.</P>
<P>In this fable wee see a remarkable morall, which is, that it is a symbole of the Mercifull, who quickly and without delay takes pitie of the miserie of others, according to this axiome, no lesse common then true, <HI>Bis dat, qui cito dat,</HI> he giveth twice, that giveth speedily. Secondly, he lives in all pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nty and abundance, because, that God blesseth him in all his goods, as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> speaketh, <HI>Hee hath given largely to the poore, his righteousnesse remaineth for ever, his horne shall be exalted in glory, and he shall have whereof to lend, all the dayes o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his life.</HI> Psal. 112.9.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> serpent useth once a yeare to cast off his
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
skinne, to assume another, that thereby he may be more healthfull and faire; so those who are mercifull leave, and cast off their wealth and substance, in favour of them that need it, that so they may appeare faire in the eye of the most high, give your almes, and all things shall bee cleane vnto you, putting off the old man.</P>
<P>But that we may walke in the sacred pathes of the holy Scripture, let us compare <HI>Mercie</HI> to the Serpentine rod of <HI>Moses,</HI> that faithfull ser∣vant of God, for if this had done many miracles in <HI>Egypt,</HI> that hath done as many wonders in the world: If this was called the finger of God, that is an excellent vertue, that maketh us come neare to God; but contrarily if the rod hath turned the waters into blood, <HI>Mercie</HI> turneth the blood of wrath into the water of mildnesse, and mansuetude; If that hath caused darknesse, this bringeth light, if that wounds, this cures; In this they agree, that as the one divided the red Sea, to deliver the people from <HI>Pharaohs</HI> slavery, so the other maketh us passe the red waters of Gods divine justice, to shunne the devils seizing of us, and to come to the Sanctuarie of caelesti∣all goodnesse, according to the sense of the bea∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ude described in our Text, <HI>Blessed are the mer∣cifull, for they shall obtain mercie.</HI></P>
<P>O happy and infinitely glorious (therefore) sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll those be, that use mercie towards their af∣flicted brethren, who open the bosome of libe∣rality, and reach out the hands of goodnesse and compassion, to draw them to them, there and
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
thereby to shelter them, from the miseries and calamities that compasse them about; for when the soveraigne Iudge of our soules and bodies, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll come to keepe his Assises, when hee I say shall come accompanied with thousand milli∣ons of Angels, who are the Heraulds and great Officers of his divine Iustice, when heaven and earth shall shake before his face, when all the elements, and all the creatures together shall quake for feare in his presence, when hee shall judge by an eternall decree the living and the dead, among all the most grievous and notable reproaches whereu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to the wicked shall be sub∣ject, that of cruelty shall be the most remark∣able, he will not then so much taxe them of ha∣ving beene theeves, drunkards, murtherers, for∣nicators, as of not having beene pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tifull to the poore and needie; <HI>Math.</HI> 25.42. <HI>Goe</HI> (will he say) <HI>ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the deuill and his angels, for I was hungry, and ye gave me not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate, I was thirstie, and ye gave m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no drinke, I was naked, and you clothed me not, I was in prison, and ye visited me not.</HI></P>
<P>But contrariwise hee will alter his voyce, when speaking to his Elect, with a sweet, smi∣ling, and gracious co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntenance, hee will pro∣nounce this favourable sentence of congratula∣tion, <HI>Math.</HI> 25.34. <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, possesse the inheritance prepared for you before the foundation of the world, for I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ungrie, and ye gave mee to eate: I was thirstie, and you gave mee drinke: I was naked, and you have cloathed
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
mee: I was in prison, and you have visited mee.</HI></P>
<P>The end, and center of the law of God, in the second Table, is this, <HI>Thou shalt love thy neighbours as thy selfe:</HI> in these few words, wee see all the offices, all the duties, and all the ser∣vices which we owe to our neighbour, to wit, to love him as we love our selves, for as no man is so unnaturall (unlesse hee hath lost the use of reason, and be ready to precipitate himselfe in∣to despaire) that would in his neede, for his good, refuse himselfe any thing that sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld be in his power: so likewise, let us represent to our selues, that our neighbour is our other selfe, and that to refuse him any needfull thing, yea, not to prevent him in his wants and incommo∣di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, is a sinne in him that is infected with it, which makes him unworthy to be compared or placed among the Pagans and Infidels, for they helpe one ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her with all their might: but with a great deale of reason and justice we may say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he is farre worse then a brute beast, for we may obserue and marke, that those of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same kinde helpe, and succour one another; As we read in <HI>Plinie,</HI> that when a great and heavie Elephant is fallen, being for his heavinesse not able to rise, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing specially they have no joynts in their legges, his fellowes doe then assemble and raise him up with their snow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>

her paines, according to the proverb, <HI>Quando caput dolet, caetera membra aolent.</HI> If the foot chance to tread upon a thorne, and to be pricked by it, the eye though farre distant seekes pre∣sently the place offended; the backe stoopes, the hands runne to the place, and all the mem∣bers in generall are attentive and carefull of the easing hereof: Alas! let us remember that wee are members of the same body, that wee owe our helpe and assistance one to another; when we see any in affliction among us, let us not stay so much to know the cause of his griefe, but that we may runne to apply the remedy to it, and to helpe him out of his wants and incommodities, and then by these actions w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall testifie, that we are the children of God, who saith, <HI>Math.</HI> 10.42. <HI>That if we give to the poore, a glasse of cold wa∣ter in his name, hee will hold it as done to himselfe,</HI> so much doth hee delight in the holy and pious workes of mercie: <HI>Blessed</HI> (saith hee) <HI>are the mercifull.</HI></P>
<P>Mercie is compared to a tree, planted in the fruitfull ground of the hearts of the faithfull, that is watered by the wholesome waters of blessing and grace, which the holy Ghost con∣tinually distilleth thereon, and upon which the Sunne of righteousnesse continually shineth, that so at all times he may beare abundantly the gra∣cious and delectable fruits of charity, compassi∣on, and meekenesse.</P>
<P>This tree is divided into three branches, which we see is set forth unto us, <HI>Luke</HI> 6. where∣of
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
of the first sheweth us, that wee must not rashly judge of our neighbour, but that wee judge of him charitably.</P>
<P>The second teacheth us, that we must libe∣rally dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibute, and dispose of our faculties in favour of the needy, that thereby wee must par∣take of their miserie, and sigh with them in their afflictions.</P>
<P>The third and last branch, is, to forgive our enemies, and cast away from us all desire of re∣venge.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Luke</HI> in the Chapter before cited, after hee had exhorted us to bee mercifull, as our heavenly Father is mercifull, divideth this mer∣cie into three kindes, as we have already shewed, saying, first,
<LIST>

</LIST></P>
<P>Let us a while attentively consider the three offices and duties of the mercifull, but rather let us practise them heartily, that we may be re∣compensed with the felicity promised unto us.</P>

<P>The corruption of this age is come to that height, that it seemeth that the best discourse that men can finde, is to speake ill of one, to de∣tract <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom another, &amp; to judge so hardly of the best actions, that one might think them voyd of

reason, and of the feare of God, and to be par∣takers with the devill, in vexing and slandering the life of those, who are good examples to all, and the subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ksgiving to all them that feare the Lord; and therefore the holy Ghost admonisheth u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this first kinde of mercie not to be rash in our judgements, least we suffer the paines, and incu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the rigours of <HI>Talions</HI> law.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Iudge not, that ye be not judged.</HI> Math. 7.1.</P>
<P>Wee must then observe these maximes in judging the actions of others, that if they be manifestly good, wee praise and imitate them, that those that did them may be encouraged to continue, and that the wicked leaving their wic∣ked wayes, may follow them, for examples move more then rules or precepts.</P>
<P>If in all likelihood they may bee thought evill, neverthelesse we must practise and con∣ferre on them the works of charity, and construe them favourably, seeing that it is God alone who searcheth the hearts, and who trieth the reynes and thoughts, and who is onely able to judge of our good, or bad intentions, for now Satan transformeth himselfe into an Angell of light, and hypocrites (his imitatours) doe so perfectly counterfeit the just, that it is altoge∣ther impossible to discerne truth from falshood, Satan hath made them so deceiptfully crafty.</P>
<P>On the other side, the just doe sometimes commit actions, which seeme to be evill, and notwithstanding are in themselues very good,

<P>Iesus Christ (take this example more) did of∣ten eat with Publicans and sinners, but it was purposely to convert them, and yet the Scribes and Pharisies that envied him, did not interpret it so, for they called him a glutton, a wine bib∣ber, a friend of Publicans and sinners, <HI>Math.</HI> 11.19.

yellow to them that have the Iaundize, the wic∣ked measure other by themselues, and thinke that all imitate them in doing ill.</P>
<P>The second branch of this divine tree, is, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Give, and it shall be given un∣to you,</HI> that is, that Iesus Christ by these words exhorteth us, to distribute freely, and liberally of our meanes to the poore, assuring us to hold it as done to himselfe, and that he will repay it a thousand fold unto us, by giving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s eternall life. <HI>Make you friends,</HI> saith hee, <HI>Luke</HI> 16.9. <HI>with the riches of iniquity, that when ye shall want, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</HI></P>
<P>Iesus Christ <HI>Math.</HI> 19.21. speakes thus to a young man, that asked him what he should doe to inherite eternall life, after he had bidden him keepe the commandements, he saith moreover unto him, <HI>If thou wilt be perfect, goe sell all that thou hast, and give it to the poore, and then thou shalt have treasure in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>One of the chiefest lawes which God com∣manded and recommended to his people <HI>Israel,</HI> was to be mercifull to the poore, and needy, as we reade <HI>Deut.</HI> 15.7. <HI>If one of thy brethren with thee be poore, within any of the gates of thy land, thou shalt not harden thine heart against him, nor shut thy hand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom thy poore brother, but thou shalt open thine hand unto him, and shalt lend him sufficient to su∣staine his needs and wants, and let it not grieve thine heart to give it unto him, for because of this the Lord thy God shall blesse thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand to.</HI> And <HI>Prou.</HI> 28.27. <HI>Hee

that giveth unto the poore shall not lacke, but hee that hideth and shutteth his eyes from him, shall have ma∣ny cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses.</HI></P>
<P>It is a wonder to see and behold the admi∣rable effects, and workes of the Almighty, that which commonly makes those to abound in wealth, that bestowe largely upon the poore, like a good spring or fountaine, which the more it is emptied, the more it overflowes in the excellencie of her waters; so the more the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithfull gives to the poore, the more God sendeth his graces and blessings upon his wealth, so that the almes which hee gives are like seede fallen into good ground, which yeeldeth a hun∣dred for one.</P>
<P>It is like a little piece of leaven among a great deale of dowe, which raiseth, and maketh it to encrease, and therefore the Wiseman exhorteth us, to give the first of our fruits to the poore, and that the rest will make our Barnes to overflow with plenty and abundance.</P>

<P>Mercifull effects are commonly followed by those which are miraculous; as we have already shewed, and as we could yet more largely shew, if wee did not feare to be too tedious; but let us see how God delighteth so much in mercie, that besides that hee rewardeth it in this world with many temporall blessings, hee doth also showre downe on the mercifull, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ternall and spirituall graces.</P>

<P>But because many seeke precautions, going about to practise the workes of charity, I will give my opinion upon this matter, that is, that we must not be like <HI>Martha,</HI> curious to bee in∣formed of so many things, but as Iesus Christ, before whom there is no regard of persons, but maketh his Sun equally to shine both on the just, and on the unjust, and maketh his raine to fall upon the good and bad, the Sunne shineth as well upon mud and dirt as upon Roses on the valleyes, as on the mountaines; the raine fal∣leth as well upon the rocks and sands, as upon the good and fertile ground: so the mercifull wheresoever he seeth any calamity, he partaketh of it, and applieth the beft remedie to it that possibly he can.</P>
<P>Intention is the levell and square wherewith all our actions are measured. It is the rule to measure them; the touchstone to know their value: Havens and Harbours receive as well the broken and torne pieces of a shipwrack, as a great and rich lading in a good vessell; the earth which is the mother and cradle of all mortall men, receiveth equally <HI>Lazarus,</HI> and <HI>Dives, Irus,</HI> and <HI>Cyrus, Diogenes,</HI> and <HI>Alexander.</HI></P>
<P>So the mercifull must alwayes propose this object to himselfe, to obey Gods Commande∣ment, in assisting the poore, and in comforting and consolating the afflicted, without searching

further if he be worthy or not of your compassi∣ons, if it be his lazinesse, or his folly that have made him miserable; these things are not to be examined by you, it belongeth to God to judge of it, and to you to obey Gods holy ordi∣nances.</P>
<P>Iesus Christ being here on earth, exercised his charity on all those that asked it of him: He fed severall times great multitudes: Hee healed the sicke: He made the lame walke, the blinde see, and that at the first request, without further enquiring.</P>
<P>Mercie is the banke and haven of miserie, if thou receive the unworthy, after thou shalt en∣tertaine the worthy: <HI>Abraham</HI> making an Hos∣pitall of his tent, received therein all Strangers indifferently that came to him; and in practising this courteous and bountifull hospitality, hee received Angels into his house: S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Paul, Heb.</HI> 13. biddeth us forget not hospitality, for some have lodged Angels, not knowing it. <HI>When thine ene∣mie is hungry, give him to eate, and to him that asketh give,</HI> saith Christ.</P>

The devill seeing that Christ was hungry, asked him if hee were the Sonne of God: you likewise when you see the poore languishing and starving at your doores, succour him quickly, and aske him not if he be the child of God, if he be an honest man and worthy of your almes, because that Christ saith, <HI>Math.</HI> 10.41. <HI>He that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophets reward.</HI></P>

<P>From all these examples we must draw this wholesome doctrine, That there is no vertue that makes us so conformable and delightfull to our heavenly Father, as <HI>Mercie,</HI> and therefore that wee beare not wrongfully the title of the sonnes of God, let us extend our liberalities to the poore; Let us give them cheerefully, and without grudging or enquiring, the first and best of our almes deedes, let us not stay to bee troubled with their cries.</P>

<P>Having sufficiently confidered the two first branches of mercie, let us now behold the third branch of this divine plant which Saint <HI>Luke</HI> hath perfectly taught us, saying, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Love your enemies, and ye shall be the children of the most high, Math.</HI> 5.44. <HI>Luk.</HI> 6.27. <HI>Luk.</HI> 3.24. for hee is kinde unto the unkinde, and to the evill. And indeed this part of mercie doth greatly beautifie, and make glo∣rious her body; for her two sisters, Pitie in gi∣ving, and Compassion in condoling, are actions which humanity cannot refuse, to the lamentable cries of the languishing, to the sad and sorrow∣full objects of poore and miserable men, but must move your hearts were they of steele, and draw teares from your eyes, though they were of marble.</P>
<P>But to forgive our enemies, is to vanquish and overcome our selues, it is a nearer approach∣ing to the divine nature, then to the humane.</P>
<P>All Histories are full of charitable actions of men towards their neighbours, and without taking them out of Scripture, the examples are
<PB N="25" REF="17"/>
(thankes be to God) usually to be seene, but to forgive our enemies, not to annoy them when it is in our power, is to be enlightned by the sa∣cred presence of the holy Ghost, to be regene∣rated by his grace, to bee fully possessed of mercy.</P>
<P><HI>Moses</HI> (that great servant of God) who had beheld him face to face, that had seene him practise this rare and excellent vertue, towards the people of <HI>Israel,</HI> falling into Idolatry; Hee that had mediated for them, speaking to God after this manner: O Lord what will thy ene∣mies say, that thou hast brought thy people out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> by a strong hand and stretched out arme, to kill them in the wildernesse, seeing that thou couldest not bring them into the land which thou diddest promise them, and himselfe notwithstanding is carried away by this passion of revenge, when hee made the earth open and swallow vp alive <HI>Core, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> with their families, though it bee not mentio∣ned that they had participated in the murmu∣ring of their heads; yea, he did not spare <HI>Mary</HI> his owne sister, whom he covered with lepro∣sie. Neither is it to the purpose to say that it was in Gods cause that hee used this revenge, that is vallable in putting <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu</HI> to death, because they had violated the divine or∣dinance; God forbid that I should excuse their fault, but I desire onely to shew, that though <HI>Moses</HI> were so holy a man, yet hee had some touch of humane weakenesse.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="18"/>But in this circumstance what shall wee say of <HI>David,</HI> a man after Gods owne heart, that so often curseth his enemies, that giveth charge to <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omon</HI> his sonne, to revenge him of the inju∣ries, and curses which <HI>Shimhi</HI> had spoken against him, as he fled from before <HI>Absalom.</HI></P>

<P>And the Apostles themselues having not beene well received in a certaine place, said to Christ, <HI>Wilt thou that we make fire fall from heauen, upon that Citie? but Iesus diverted and hindered them.</HI></P>
<P>Wee produce all these examples not to imi∣tate, but to shunne them, and thereby to make it appeare that wee must not revenge our selues when wee can doe it, but rather to doe good to our enemies, when they have done us hurt, is to make our selues perfect in this excellent ver∣tue of Mercy.

<P><PB N="27" REF="18"/>That which made Saint <HI>Stephens</HI> martirdome the more honourable, is that in the middest of his torments, among a fearefull shower of haile of stones cast against him, hee desireth not God to punish his tormentours, but rather being pos∣ses<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with the spirit of mercie, and meekenesse, he prayeth to God for them, herein imitating his good and blessed Master Iesus Christ, say∣ing, <HI>Lord impute not this sinne unto them,</HI> As wee read <HI>Acts</HI> 7.60.</P>
<P>If <HI>Moses</HI> in the precedent examples hath bin seene something too much desirous of revenge, we may also reade, that many times he hath for given those that had offended him, yea and hath mediated and prayed to God for them, least hee should have revenged them.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> having received innumerable offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces and wrongs of <HI>Saul,</HI> notwithstanding finding him wearie in the Cave, having him in his bed at his discretion, he forgave him all the injuries and harmes he had made him suffer, saying on∣ly, <HI>The Lord is a just Iudge, that will avenge mee o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mine enemies, and will render unto me after the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣grity of my heart.</HI></P>
<P>The Apostles indeed suffered themselues to be carried away by this sweet desire and appe∣tite of revenge, when they would make fire fall from heaven upon that Towne, that had offen∣ded them, but it was because they were fraile and weake men, like us when they fell i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to their faults and errours, but they we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e soone rectified and raised up againe by the grace of the holy

Ghost; so that at length when any gave them injuries, they rendered none againe, they were whipped and stoned, they were cast into prison, and yet they blessed, and prayed for them that did it, and sought by all meanes to Preach the Gospell unto them, and to shew them the way of salvation: these second examples wee must follow, that we may appeare to be the children of God, Disciples of Christ, and imitatours of his Apostles.</P>
<P>This noble and godly action of forgivi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g our enemies; we must practise, first if we desire that God shall acknowledge us for his children, we must strive to be like him who is the foun∣taine of forgivenesse, who is meekenesse and curtesie it selfe, and nothing but mercie: Se∣condly, wee must pardon others, if wee desire that God shall forgive us, since that is conditio∣nall, which wee aske him, <HI>Lord forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespasse against us</HI>; Now if we doe not forgive men their trespasses, no more will our heavenly Father forgive us. <HI>Math.</HI> 6.15. <HI>For with the same measure that we mete, it shall be also measured unto us againe.</HI></P>
<P>And that which must the more oblige us to put off the infected and poysonsome coate of cruelty and revenge, since it is an abomination to God, which he hath prohibited us in so ma∣ny places of Scripture; as <HI>Proverb.</HI> 20.22. <HI>Say not thou, I will recompence evill, but waite upon the Lord, and hee shall save thee.</HI> And <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.19. <HI>Dearely beloved avenge not your selues, but give

<P>It is a common saying and proverb, There is nothing so sweet as revenge; but for my part I cannot perceive this sweetnesse, unlesse it bee compared to a well scowred blade of a sword, that pierceth and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sseth through easily, but at the same time taketh away our lives, as the Bees that leave their sting where they strike, and with it their life, <HI>Animas{que} in vulnere ponunt,</HI> so when we revenge our selues, we leave the sting of our wrath in the wounds of our enemie; but wee doe not consider (so blinde are we) that withall we thereby wound our soules to death.</P>
<P><HI>Heliodorus</HI> tells us of one that said, That death would be sweet and welcome to him, if he knew that his enemie should also die, and of another iealous woman that cryed out, O how delightfull would death be to mee, if I could

fall dead upon the dead bodie of my rivall.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> saith very well, That of all the wild beasts, there is none so savage and cruell, as a man that hath the liberty and power to execute his revenge. But if wee consider it diligently, we shall see, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t this impatience, and not to be able to beare an injurie, is a great infirmitie and weakenesse; but as noble hearts, and generous, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d magnanimous soules, doe scorne and de∣spise wrongs, so doe they also forgive, and for∣get all kindes of revenge.</P>
<P><HI>Pericles</HI> of all the actions of his life, esteemed this the most remarkable, that hee had never revenged himselfe, for any wrong done unto him.</P>
<P>And <HI>Phocion</HI> being pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to death unjustly, feeling the eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts of that mortall Hemlock, to bring him neare to the last period of his life, re∣commended nothing so much to his sonne as this, that he should forget the memorie of this offence, and that he should never seeke to be re∣venged for it, that in medling with it, he would stay the gods from taking in hand the justice of his cause, who would questionlesse revenge him of this offence.</P>
<P>Let us use the same Doctrine, though com∣ming from the prophane mouth of a Pagan, they are neverthelesse of infallible truth, as a Dia∣mond looseth nothing of his value, though it be in the dirt: let us then practise it, and let us remember, that whilest we desire to punish our enemies, wee doe them a great favour, and are
<PB N="31" REF="20"/>
reveng'd of our selues, for the offence which they have done unto us, which would deserue a farre more rigorous labour if wee left it to God; but hee seeing that wee will neither re∣ferre it to his justic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, nor to his commaunde∣ments, nor to his promises, being unwilling to endure a companion in any of his works, hee suffereth us to try our uttermost, which is most commonly the cause of our ruine.</P>
<P>Let us then breake off this discourse, which would never end, if wee should punctually fol∣low it; and let us remember that revenge is our Masters owne dish, which none can touch with∣out incurring his indignation: And let us (imi∣tating our heavenly Father) forgive our ene∣mies, for if hee should take revenge of all the offences which wee at every moment commit against his sacred Majestie, hee would then re∣duce us to that nothing from whence we came, or would inflict upon us eternall paines and pu∣nishments, since the least offence committed against an infinite goodnesse, deserveth an infi∣nite paine and torment. Let us then follow Saint <HI>Lukes</HI> admonition, <HI>Be mercifull, as your heavenly Father is mercifull</HI>; and presently after wee shall heare that blessed recompence, which we shall receive for it, to wit, <HI>Blessed are the mer∣cifull, for they shall obtaine mercie.</HI></P>
<P>Wee have already shewed how God recom∣penseth the mercifull, yea in this life, with bles∣sings, favours, and graces, spirituall, and tem∣porall, giving unto them a hundred times more

then they have given to the poore, and giving them consolation in their distresse, as they also have suffered with their neighbour in his affli∣ction: But let us consider the third fruit of cha∣ritable workes, which is the highest degree of honour, unto which the mercifull shall ascend, to wit, eternall blessednesse, and withall we will also examine the cause, wherefore the faithfull receive graces spirituall, temporall, and eternall, which doeth clearely enough appeare in our Text, <HI>Blessed are the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cifull, for they shall obtaine mercie.</HI></P>
<P>The onely and perfect felicity of man both in this life and in that to come, consisteth sim∣ply and soly in the possession of the favour of God, which the wicked, cruell, and impious shall never be partakers of; but only the Saints, the bountifull, and mercifull shall pitch their te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts there; the reason why the one are put backe from this infinite good, and that the others shall bee received and cheri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed therein for ever is, because the first have lived in cruel∣tie, rigour, and tyrannie, and shall therefore be thus punished; but the second having beene gracious, bountifu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, and meeke, they shall ob∣taine mercy, according to that saying of Christ, <HI>With what measure you mete, it shall bee measured unto you againe.</HI></P>
<P>In these words to obtaine mercie, wee have many very remarkable circumstances, for God will shew himselfe such unto us, as wee shall shew our selues to our neighbours, if wee give
<PB N="33" REF="21"/>
a crumme of bread to the poore languishing at our doores, hee will call us into his royall Pal∣lace; hee will make us sit downe at his Table, he will fill us with the dainties of his house, and will make us drinke abundantly in the riv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of his delights, if wee beare with griefe our neigh∣bours affliction, if wee dresse his wounds, and powre oyle on them; hee will comfort u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in our sorrowes, hee will wipe off the teares from our eyes, and will fill our hearts with joy and gladnesse, if wee forgive our brethren their of∣fences, when either maliciously, or through infirmity they have offended us, hee promiseth and assureth us, to be so bountifull and merci∣full to us, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e will drive our sinnes away from before his face; hee will scatter our mis∣deedes like a cloud dispersed by the parching beames of the Sunne, and in this part shall wee finde the center where the fulnesse of our felici∣tie resteth and resideth.</P>
<P>This forgivenesse of our sinnes is, that which covereth us from the divine justice, that giveth into our hands the shield of assurance, which is impenetrable by the revenging shot of his just judgements, that maketh us walke voyd of feare towards the throne of grace, and that without the least doubting, for since God is with us, who shall be against us? shall the world, why it is vanquished? shall hell, why it is fettered and shackled? Shall death, why it is dead? shall sinne, why it is prevented and pardoned▪ Fi∣nally, shall the flesh, why it is crucified? Wee
<PB N="34" REF="22"/>
may therefore say and conclude with the Apo∣stle Saint <HI>Paul, O death where is thy sting, O hell where is thy victory? now thanks be to God that hath given us victory through his Sonne Iesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>From this word <HI>obtaine,</HI> wee will also derive and draw this remarkable doctrine, for he pre∣supposeth asking, seeing wee cannot obtaine a thing before wee have demaunded it, which teacheth us our duties towards God, acknow∣ledging our selues poore, weake, and miserable, both in body and soule, subject in body to thou∣sands of sicknesses, weaknesses, and necessities, troubled in minde with a world of businesse, crosses, and afflictions, and so laden in soule with sinnes, misdeedes, and iniquities, that they are more in number then the sand that is on the Sea shore; But the onely remedy to these sick∣nesses is, to have our recourse to Gods mercie, which is the sac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed anchor of our hopes, the haven of our salvation, and the eternall residence of our incomparable, and incomprehensible fe∣licities.</P>
<P>And let us hold for certaine and infallible, that wee shall never bee refused by his sacred goodnesse, which calleth out aloud unto us, <HI>Math.</HI> 11.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. <HI>come unto me all ye that are troubled, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vie laden, and I will ease you: take my yoake upon you, for it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight, and ye shall finde rest to your soules</HI>; his yoake is nothing else, but the afflicti∣on, weakenesse, and necessity of the poore, that is the yoake he commandeth us to beare, that is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust take off the loade of misery and

<P>As a King findeth the waight of a crowne but small, when it is upon his head, by reason of the wealth, honour, and power that follow the heavinesse of this burthen, as hee would ne¦ver leave his Kingdome, his power, and his Empire, for the waight of a S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epter, seeing they make him honourable to his Subjects, and fea∣red of Strangers, so that faithfull man which hath compassed and environed his forehead with the crowne of love to his neighbour, that hath adorned his hand with the Scepter of cha∣rity, to the needy, and miserable, hee without doubt shall finde rest in his soule, which is the fulnesse of all felicity.</P>
<P>Now since such great and admirable effects, since so excellent profits and advantages, pro∣ceede from our mercie, charity, and bounty to our neighbour, since in the practise of it, wee finde our felicity, which consisteth in the love which God beareth unto us, in the confirmati∣on of the pardon for our offences; since againe God assureth us, that the charity which we give and exercise to our neighbours, hee will accept as done to himselfe: alas, who would be so sa∣vage, and hardened with rigour; who would be so defiled with ingratitude, that having re∣ceived

favours from a King, would yet refuse to obey him, and to serue him with all his pow∣er, should not hee be worthy of the greatest torments, of the most cruell punishments, that have ever beene imagined; would not the hea∣ven, the elements, and all the creatures together rise up in judgement, to aske punishment for so grievous a crime; since it is most true, that in∣gratitude is the basest and damnablest vice, that can infect the soule of man.</P>
<P>Let us remember that we have nothing but what we haue received of our heavenly Father; and if wee have received it from his favourable and fatherly hand, why should wee be so un∣gratefull, as to refuse him a small portion of it, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee asketh for it: Now, and at all times when we heare and see the poore praying, and crying unto us in the streetes, or at our doores, it is the voyce of God himselfe, tha calleth us to acknowledge his benefits, as often as wee see one afflicted that asketh us helpe, and consola∣tion; let us r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to him, and give him occa∣sion of joy, and gladnesse, for it is Christ him∣selfe which was comforted by an Angell, in the Garden, when praying to God his Father, hee sweated drops of blood, which made him pro∣nounce these lamentable words, so full of griefe; <HI>My soule is full of sorrow even unto death.</HI></P>
<P>When we have bin offended by our neigh∣bour, and that he will cast himselfe at our feete, to aske us forgivenesse, let us not be such ty∣gers, and so unnaturall, as to refuse him his re∣quest,

remembring that it is a condition need∣full to obtaine the pardon for our owne sinnes, which wee shall never obtaine, untill wee have first forgiven our brethren their offences: but let us follow the example of our heavenly Fa∣ther, who saith, <HI>That at what time so ever a sinner repen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth him of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sinnes he will put away his wic∣kednesse out of his remembrance.</HI></P>
<P>And when wee must appeare before the ter∣rible and dreadfull Throne of the Soveraigne Iudge, when wee shall be called to a strict ac∣count for the talents and administration which hath beene committed to our charge by our heavenly Master: let us then I say follow the example of that wise Steward, let us make our selues friends with the riches of iniquity; let us fill the hand of the poore, which is the Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar of God, upon the which hee affectionatly re∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iveth the Incense of our prayers, as a delight∣full and pleasing Sacrifice, to the glory of his holy name.</P>

<P>Words very energeticall, and significant, as if hee had said, Dearely beloved, the onely and perfect way to possesse all happinesse, all plea∣sures, and all the advantages that you can wish; and in a word, to enjoy eternall felicity, to con∣template face to face Gods divine Majestie, wherein consisteth the fulnesse of happinesse, and all contentment, following the serpents ex∣ample, to cast off the olde skinne, that is, to pull off the olde coate of sinne, infected with the le∣prosie of iniquity, to fly and eschew evill, to embrace good, to hate vice, and perfectly to love vertue, which is the true way to heaven, to the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>session of heavenly graces; and in a word, to the fulnesse and perfection of all true happinesse.</P>

<P>This is a very faire, true, and ample descrip∣tion of the Righteous man, who hath a pure heart, that is, who hath his conscience pure and just, and who lives in integrity, justice, and in∣nocencie.</P>
<P>For this word <HI>heart,</HI> is not here to be under∣stood or taken for the materiall &amp; carnall heart, placed in our breasts, which is the fountaine and beginning of life, the first living, the last dying i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man, but for the soule that keepeth there her ordinary Sessions, as we commonly say that is corne, by showing onely the sacks that hold it; there is the Kings Treasure, by shewing onely the Exchequer Chamber where it is kept, the place containing being called and taken by the name of the thing contained: so must we under∣stand a pure heart to bee taken for the consci∣ence, which therein makes her residence.</P>

<P>The clearest waters are alwayes the best, and therefore commonly see that the excellentest springs are derived from the rockes, and fetch'd from the highest hills, because that the water distilling through many narrow passages, and strait places, the farther it goes the more it is purified, &amp; the most subtill and clearest springs seeke the highest places, as approaching nea∣rer to the nature of the ayre, whose nature and propriety is still to ascend.

<P>These cleare and pure waters doe lively prefigure and set forth unto us, the faithfull ser∣vant of the Lord, who hath purified, and as it were distilled himselfe at the fire of the love of God, thereby to leave off what was earthly

ponderous, and troublesome in him, as hatred, ambition, sensuality, and vaine glory purposely to soare aloft, and to elevate himselfe to the holy mountaine of <HI>Syon</HI> towards heaven, which is the center whither the circumference of his desires, designes, and thoughts tendeth.</P>
<P>These black and muddy waters may expresse and set forth hell unto us, where there is no∣thing but horrible darknesse and fearefull ob∣scurity, where that old serpent is iustly banished for his deserts, and where the damned, gastly, and frightfull soules doe nothing else but vexe themselves and curse.</P>
<P>But to apply it to the subject of our text, these stinking and corrupted waters, may very fitly be compared to the wicked, and to the men of this world, who have Woolfes or Lyons hearts un∣der the shape and forme of men, who wallowe like Hogges in the mire, and dirt of carnall se∣curity, who runne not after pietie and vertue, but remaine fast chained and bound to sensuali∣tie, and vice; casting all their affections on the earth, whereof their body is made and compo∣sed, never ayming nor levelling their thoughts at heaven, whence their soule had their origi∣nall; True serpents in malice, hatred, and en∣vie, that with mortall venome infect the Lil∣lies and Roses of the best consciences, Frogges in prating and slandering, that never open their mouthes, but to utter unsufferable blasphemies, oathes, lyes, and detractions.</P>
<P>Take yet this farther conceit upon the purity
<PB N="51" REF="30"/>
of the heart, to wit, that as the eyes ore-vayled with clowds, or with carracts and webbs, can∣not clearely discerne the objects, or colours, which are exposed before them, because their faculty is prevented and hindered, by the inter∣position of these obstacles, which are placed be∣tweene the object and the sight; whereas contrariwise good sound and well disposed eyes as are these of Eagles, who though soaring in the highest clowds, doe neverthelesse see very plainely in the thickest bushes, in the remotest furrowes of the farre distant field, and which is most admirable, is, that her sight is so strong and powerfull, that contrary to the nature and practise of other living creatures, she can steddily behold and contemplate the Sunne, without winking at all; yea, when shee is nearest him, and standing on the highest branch of a tree, planted on the top of the loftiest mountaine.</P>
<P>Now to appropriate this to our matter, wee say, That hee whose heart is incombred with the things of this world, whose soule is ore-vayled with ambition, with the clowds of va∣nity, and vaine glory, whose conscience is ob∣scured, and darkned with hatred, envie, and ma∣lice, can never contemplate God, nor see his face, which is all the consolation, all the joy, and in a word, the true center of our happinesse, the fulnesse of all our felicity, and the greatest delights which the faithfull can wish or desire.

of sinne, those like Eagles indeede al∣wayes soaring in heavenly and godly actions, shall be perched and placed in the highest place of mount <HI>Syon,</HI> from thence-forth ever to view the heavenly Sinne rising, that beareth health in his rayes and wings, to behold steddily, and without winking, the glistering, and bright shi∣ning beames of the Sunne of righteousnesse, without any feare of hurt, being assured of his wonderfull favour, manifested by his inviolable promises, for he saith in our Text,</P>
<P><HI>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see GOD.</HI></P>
<P>By this purity of heart, we may understand the simplicity of our lives and actions, and so this sentence, <HI>Blessed are the pure in heart,</HI> may be thus interpreted, Blessed are those that walke simple in their actions, whose heart is voyd of fraud, and of any thoughts of iniquity, whose tongue speakes nothing but the hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s meaning, that shunnes vanity, and the glory of this world, that so they may be perfectly glorious in that which is to come. S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Augustine lib.</HI> 1. <HI>de Serm Dom.</HI> is of this opinion, because that as S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Iohn</HI> saith, 1. <HI>Epist. chap.</HI> 5. <HI>ver.</HI> 19. <HI>The whole worldly∣eth in wickedness, and that the Apostles were to take men, and to bring them to the way of salvation, nei∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her by craft, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by force, but by meekenesse and sim∣plicitie.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore Christ sending through all the world, to publish the Gospell of the King∣dome of heaven, the redemption of captive sin∣ners,

from the chaines and torments of hell, and to preach openly the acceptable yeare of the Lord, saith unto them; <HI>Behold I send you forth as sheepe in the midst of Woolves, be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmelesse and innocent as Doves</HI>; as we read in the 10. Chap. of S. <HI>Math.</HI> ver, 16. And in the same Gospell, Chap. 6. ver. 22. <HI>The light of the body is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ye, if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</HI></P>
<P>This so excellent vertue of meekenesse and simplicity, hath alwayes beene hated of the world, as being contrary to the vanity and fol∣ly of it, and the high way to mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> there to see God face to face as <HI>Moses,</HI> who preferred the simplicity of a Shepheards crooke, to the honours, riches, and preferments which hee might justly have expected in <HI>Pharaohs</HI> Court, as being reputed his daughters sonne.</P>
<P>This vertue cannot but be very pleasing to God, since he himselfe hath put it in practise, in appearing to <HI>Moses</HI> in a bush, which is a base and abject plant, despising the lofty Pine trees, and C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dars of <HI>Libanus,</HI> which in height and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>auty exceed all other trees of the earth.</P>
<P>The Angels also have practised it, when ha∣ving left the heavens to appeare unto men, they have not taken the forme and majestie of Kings, to be respected of all, but rather the habit of Pilgrimes, and men of base quality, to teach us to shunne pride and vaine glory, and to shew us by their cloathes that we are Strangers and Pil∣grimes in this world, that our houses are but
<PB N="54" REF="32"/>
Innes, where we should stay onely as posts doe under a tree till the storme be past, and so to continue our way as long as the day of our life shineth, that the night envelloping and wrap∣ping us up in her darke cloake, wee may arrive at the heavenly <HI>Canaan,</HI> which is our native Country from whence we first departed.</P>
<P>We read in the 18. Chap. <HI>of Genes.</HI> That <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> sitting at his tent doore, saw three men pas∣sing that way, whom he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> called, and desired to come and sit under a tree with him, to eate a morsell of bread, to comfort their hearts. Now if it were god himselfe in the forme of three men, to represent the three persons of the bles∣sed Trinity, or if they were Angels sent by him, is a question out of the subject of our Text; but because many Fathers of the Church are of the second opinion, we also will hold it, ground∣ed on the 13. Chap. to the <HI>Heb. Be not forgetfull to entertaine Strangers, for thereby some have enter∣tained Angels unawares, which is commonly refer∣red to this action of the Father of the faithfull, and of</HI> Lot <HI>his brothers sonne, who also entertained in So∣dome two Angels, in the shape of Strangers, and of men that were travelling further.</HI></P>
<P>In the 5. Chap. of <HI>Tobit</HI> wee reade, that the Angell <HI>Raphael</HI> appeared to the young <HI>Tobit,</HI> and offered to bring him into <HI>Media,</HI> which hee did afterwards performe.</P>
<P>But leaving many other examples, which we could alledge of the humility, and simplicity of Angels; let us briefly runne over the lives of the
<PB N="55" REF="32"/>
Patriarks &amp; Prophets, where the simplicity and innocent purity of their actions doe most lively appeare. <HI>Abraham</HI> at Gods command, without any further information, goeth to the place ap∣pointed him, to sacrifice on an Altar his onely sonne.</P>
<P><HI>Isaack</HI> following the steps of his Fathers obe∣dience to God, runnes to his death, never fearing the great torment that he was ready to endure, layeth the wood on his shoulders, and carrieth in his hand that fire that was appointed to burne him to ashes; yea, hee encourageth his poore old Father to execute Gods divine command, restores unto him by his exhortation, his strength already lost, by reason of the extreame griefe which he endured, to be the executioner of his owne sonne, and to kill him to whome hee had lately given life.</P>
<P>But least we should be too tedious, this ex∣ample of simplicity shall serve us for all the Pro∣phe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, as being the most remarkable that can be ever rehearsed by man; and indeed was it not a great and lofty mys<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erie, that God should give so resolute a courage, so great a constancie, to the Father of the faithfull, and so admirable boldnesse to this obedient sonne; for <HI>Abraham</HI> representeth unto us God the Father, who to execute the irrevocable decree of his divine ju∣stice, hath seised the sword of his terrible judge∣ments, to dip it in the blood of the spotlesse Lambe, that bare the sinnes of the world on the Altar of the Crosse.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="33"/>This sweet Iesus, whose simplicity, and meekenesse are both peerelesse &amp; inexplicable, this good Saviour, following the example of <HI>Isaack,</HI> by whom during the shadowes of the law hee was figured, goeth freely to his death, bearing the wood, which was to bereave him of l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe upon him, and within him the burning fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of love, that inflamed him with an infinite affection to save the Elect: Hee was brought saith the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> as a Lamb to the slaugh∣ter; so opened he not his mouth to complain: he is conducted as a dumbe Sheepe before her Shearer; but in that we see nothing but part of his simplicity, appearing in the catastrophe of his actions, when he was neare his death; but if we should curiously view the acts of his life, beginning from his birth, we should be ravished in admiration of these infinite wonders; but let us consider only in generall, that he is borne of a pure virgin, espoused to a Carpenter: was that befitting his excellent Majestie, who was the King of the world?</P>
<P>Hee was borne in a Stable amongst beasts, judge if that were the Royall Pallaces, and ho∣nourable company, which hee had in heaven among the Angels.</P>
<P>He was swadled in clowts, and laid in a Man∣ger, for want of a Cradle to keepe him from the injuries of the weather: were those the de∣lights of his Paradise?</P>
<P>He was fugitive here and there, to shunne the envie and furious rage of <HI>Herod,</HI> who fought to kill him.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="33"/>In a word, considering diligently all the course of his life, from the moment of his birth, to the last period of his death, wee shall finde all his actions framed in humility, and gui∣ded by meekenesse and simplicity.</P>
<P>This example and no more, he did not goe chuse within the Pallaces of Kings, the good∣liest and gallantest Courtiers; hee did not elect the sonnes of Princes to be his Apostles, but went to the receipt of custome, to the Cottages and Boats of Fishermen, to call that honourable company of his twelue Apostles, who like well instructed Disciples followed the steps of their loving Lord and Master; so well did they imi∣tate and follow his examples and especially that of his simplicity, that they may be patterns of it themselues, as the History of their life suf∣ficiently sheweth, and as the duty of their place required, for men and being deepely plunged in ma∣lice, pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umption, and arrogancie, there was no way to vanquish them, but wholy by contrary weapons to them unknowne, that they might the more easily be subdued and vanquished.</P>
<P>To their arrogancie, they opposed meeke∣nesse, to their pompe and vaine glory, humility, and simplicity, ever remembring the command of their good Master, <HI>Be ye simple as Doves.</HI></P>
<P>Now it is remarkable, that the faithfull, and such as walke uprightly before God, are called by the wicked, and by the children of the God of this world, <HI>Poore and simple people,</HI> because they addict not themselves to fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and deceit,
<PB N="58" REF="34"/>
so spake <HI>Iobs</HI> wife to her husband, being yet in affliction upon his dunghill, <HI>Doest thou still re∣taine thine integrity?</HI></P>
<P>But Iesus Chris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to shew us that hee approo∣veth those whom the world rejecteth, speakes as if he had said, <HI>See you those simple and base people, they shall see God</HI>: So Christ gives them hopes of the blessed vision of God, as if hee had pro∣mised light to the blinde, knowledge to the ig∣norant, and wisedome to fooles, for so this wic∣ked world calleth those that will not drinke the cup of his malice, nor tread in his pathes full of sinne and iniquity.</P>
<P><HI>Blessed then are the pure in heart, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He doeth not onely say, they shall be blessed, but he speaketh in the present tense, saying, they are already blessed: for God having given them that holinesse which they possesse, and upon all occasions practise, hath also given them two strong and well feathered wings, to soare and flie aloft to heaven: whereof she one is faith, by the which the just trusting and reposing him∣selfe wholy in the promises of Christ, takes his flight towards Paradise, to have a tast of them; for it is the nature of faith (as appeareth by her definition) to know how to assure it s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lfe, how to aske the grace of God promised in his word, how to embrace salvation offered by Iesus Christ, and during this life, how to possesse in part that eternall and blessed life.</P>
<P>And because faith beginneth here to tast the delights of the vision of God, she is yet upheld
<PB N="59" REF="34"/>
and fortified by <HI>Hope,</HI> which is the second wing, that makes her expect heaven, and promiseth her absolutely to fill her abundantly with those swee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pleasures whereof the hath, shee yet had but a tast, and to make her perfectly know, that which now she seeth but obscurely, and like a shadow.</P>
<P><HI>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Vpon these words there is an objection to be resolved, why Christ saith here <HI>the pure in heart,</HI> seeing the Scripture in many places is di∣rectly opposite to this justice, to this purity, to this cleanenesse, as we read <HI>Prou.</HI> 20.9. <HI>Who can say I have made my heart cleane, I am pure from my sinne?</HI> And in the first booke of <HI>Kings,</HI> the 8. Chap. <HI>There is no man that sinneth not.</HI> And in the 1. Epist. of Saint <HI>Iohn,</HI> 1. Chap. <HI>If we say that we have no sinne, we deceive our selues, and the truth is not in us.</HI> And in the 25. Chap. of <HI>Iob, How can man be justified with God: or how can he be cleane that is borne of a woman?</HI></P>
<P>Although these places, and many more (that we purposely leave to avoyd prolixity) seeme to be opposite to our Text, notwithstanding we will reconcile them together.</P>
<P>For when the Spirit of God calleth heere those that live justly and holily pure in heart, we must not understand it so, as if they were to∣tally and absolutely cleane from the filthinesse of sinne: for in that sence the royall Prophet <HI>David</HI> saith, <HI>There is none just, no not one.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="35"/>But we must understand here those that strive to walke in the sacred pathes of Gods com∣mandements, that live holily before God, and without reproach before men, that have beene purified, like gold tried seaven times in the fire, and that fire is the word of God, that enters and penetrates to the most secret thoughts, there to consume the wood and chaffe of our wicked in∣clinations.</P>
<P>This cleansing and purification is clearely set forth unto us in the 15. Chap. of Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> in these words of Christ, <HI>Now ye are cleane through the word which I have spoken.</HI> And in the 13. Chap. ver. 10. of the same Gospell, <HI>Hee that is washed, needeth not save to wash his feete, but is cleane every whit: and ye are cleane, but not all.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, the faithfull that live holily, may be called just, and pure in heart, <HI>Secundum quid, non-simpliciter,</HI> Iust in that degree of Iustice that may fall on man whilest he is here below figh∣ting against flesh and blood his domesticall ene∣mies, that often overcome him, and would quite keepe him downe if hee were not upheld and fortified by the spirit of grace, and by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Almighty hand of God that raiseth and deli∣vereth him.</P>
<P>The faithfull servant of the Lord is againe called pure in heart, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee is such in part already, and that besides the great disposition that is in him to tend to his perfection, hee al∣ready here begins to tast the excellent sweetnes of that delicate fruit whereof he shall hereafter
<PB N="61" REF="35"/>
be fully and perfectly satisfied and satiated in Gods Paradise.</P>
<P><HI>Blessed then are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</HI></P>
<P>Wee have another circumstance here very pregnant and remarkable, to wit, that Christ exhorteth us here to be pure in heart, and not of our head, or hands, because that the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t being the seate of the soule, sinne is most busie to viti∣ate and infect it with his foule and filty cor∣ruption, which it doth not in the other parts of the body, and therefore you see that God doth so strictly command us to keepe our hearts for his part and behoofe, saying, <HI>My sonne give mee thy heart.</HI></P>
<P>Now to omit or let passe nothing worthy consideration like the inhabitants of <HI>Nilus,</HI> wee will draw water in running.</P>
<P>We say then that this word heart, is diversly taken in the Scripture, First, it is taken for faith, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. <HI>For with the heart man beleeveth unto right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ousnesse, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</HI></P>

<P>And in this last signification it is taken in our Text, to wit, for the <HI>Conscience,</HI> as if Christ had said, <HI>Blessed are those that possesse a holy, pure, and just soule, a good, cleane, and spotlesse conscience.</HI></P>
<P><HI>David</HI> desirous to raise himselfe from his fall, and to restore the temple of his body pol∣luted by wicked adultery, desired of God a new Altar, <HI>praying him to create in him a cleane heart, and to renew a right spirit within him. Psal.</HI> 51.12.</P>
<P><HI>Iudas Maccabeus</HI> having seene the Temple of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> prophaned by <HI>Antiochus</HI> his sacrilegi∣ous hands, he purifieth it, destroyes all the Al∣tars where that Pagan had sacrificed to his Idols, and called that the renewing of the Temple: Our bodies are the living temples of the holy Ghost, our hearts the Altars, on the which ha∣ving wickedly sacrificed to the Idols of our pas∣sions, we must breake them and destroy them, by our true repentance and conversion to God, <HI>who despiseth not a broken and a contrite heart:</HI> And af∣terward we must build new ones pure and clean, on the which wee must offer to God Heca∣tombes of Iustice, and solemne burnt offe∣rings
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>
and sacrifices wherein hee delighteth.</P>
<P>The Etymologists hold, that this word <HI>Cor</HI> is derived of <HI>Cura,</HI> that is, care, because that part communicateth, sendeth, and doth distri∣bute blood and life to the rest of the body: Even so all our study, all our exercise, and occupation should be to seeke the meanes fit for the con∣servation of our soules: <HI>for what will it profit a man if hee gaine the whole world, and loose his soule. Math.</HI> 16.26.</P>
<P>As soone as the Embrion is conceived, the first part which is formed in the heart, being as it were the center whence the severall lines are drawne to the circumference of our bodies, it is also the first member living, and when the paines of death have compassed a man, the blood from all parts retires to the heart, as to a citadell, so that it is also the last part that dieth in us, ac∣cording to that common saying, <HI>Cor est primum vivens, &amp; ultimum moriens.</HI></P>
<P>So when the faithfull of the Lord resolveth to live piously, he must cast for a sure and unmove∣able foundation, the righteousnesse of a pure and cleane conscience, which must be the Ocean where all the rivers of hisaffections must runne and tend, the corner and fundamentall stone, on the which must be edified this his Pilgrimage: All the building of this mortall and transitorie life, must begin with the just mans beginning, and never end till his death, when it shall bee augmented and perfected in heaven.</P>
<P>It was Gods commandement under the law,
<PB N="64" REF="37"/>
that all Israelites, all the seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> should offer and consecrate to him the first borne, both of man and beast; now if wee unvayle the let∣ter, and consider what it therein figured unto us, we may note among other things, that God desired by this Decree, whose letter and figure is abrogated, though the truth and sence of it be eternall, that wee should offer and consecrate unto him our hearts, which are the first borne of our selues.</P>
<P>The greatest part of Physitians hold, that the soule being generally all over the body, hath her principall seat in the heart, as the King hath in his Court, although his power reach tho∣row all his Kingdome; so that the soule being that very man which God requireth, it is then not without reason, that God demandeth our heart, which is her throne: <HI>My sonne give me thy heart.</HI></P>
<P>The heart is knowne to bee the originall of naturall heat; now God being a burning fire of love, and affection towards his children, wee ought to consecrate that part to him for his Ta∣bernacle.</P>
<P>The heart is red and bloody, to shew us the fervencie and zeale that should be in us to Gods service and glory, and that our thoughts should alwayes burne with love to him, and with cha∣rity to our neighbours.</P>
<P>It is little; whence wee may learne not to puffe, or swell it with pride, but to keepe it al∣wayes humble and modest. Vertues that seeke

<P>His beating and panting is upwards; so all our desires and thoughts should tend towards the end of our supernaturall vocation, accor∣ding to the Apostles advice, <HI>Seek the things that are above.</HI></P>
<P>The heart is agitated by a continuall motion, by reason of his vitall spirits, that animate and nourish it: So our thoughts should beare and conduct us to the actions of Iustice, innocencie, and godlinesse, and to follow the steps of the Scripture, Charity alwayes worketh, and is ne∣ver idle, by reason of the spirit of grace dwel∣ling in our soules, who inspires continually in us holy and religious thoughts.</P>
<P>There is but one heart in man, and yet his shape and forme is triangular, a figure bearing proportion to his object, that is God, one in Essence, and three in persons: So our soules should be adorned with these three beautiful vertues, Faith, hope and Charity.</P>
<P>He is open at the top, and that way he recei∣veth his nourishment: Which teacheth us, that our soules should alwayes be open, to proclaime the praises of our Creator and Redeemer, that nourisheth them with the holy and wholso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e meat of his sacred word, sent dow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from heaven.</P>

<P><PB N="66" REF="38"/>It is againe not hayrie, to teach us that our soule which is hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hostesse, must be voyd of the foolish and light imaginations, of the weake and unconstant considerations of this world, that so she may hope and ayme at nothing but heaven, her blessed Countrey, wherein it is impossible to enter, before our heart (after <HI>Moses</HI> his ex∣ample) have pulled off the Shooes of our cor∣ruption and worldly affection, that so wee may come neare this burning bush, this fearefull fire, Gods divine justice.</P>
<P>The Oracle of <HI>Apollo,</HI> being once enquired, what was the most pleasingst thing of God; af∣ter his ordinary manner hee answered ambigu∣ously, and obscurely:</P>
<P><HI>Dimidium sphaerae, sphaeram cum principe Romae.</HI></P>
<P>An answer most true, though it came from the father of lies, for a <HI>C</HI> is the halfe of a Sphere, and <HI>O</HI> is a Sphere, and the beginning of the word <HI>Rome</HI> is an <HI>R,</HI> which letters put together make <HI>COR,</HI> that is, the heart, and questionlesse it is the most pleasingst gift that can bee offered unto God, and which no man can justly refuse him.

<P>Let us remember th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> how charitable so ever our actions be, if our hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doe not goe before

to enlighten them, all of them will tumble downe together into the obscure darkness of the deepe.</P>
<P>Our actions are of no value without the heart, but the heart may bee good without the actions; God had respect to <HI>Abel,</HI> and afterwards to his offering; the good Thiefe to obtaine mercy gave nothing but his heart; <HI>Marie Mag∣dalene</HI> but her teares, and Saint <HI>Peter</HI> but sighes and lamentations, proceeding from the depth of his soule.</P>
<P>Now that this heart may be pleasing and ac∣ceptable to God, it must be cleare, bright, and shining, to the end that as in a glasse God may see his owne image and likenesse after which he at the first created it, and when it is once cleane and pure, then right so, and in that manner, we must keepe it in the same glorious estate, for
<Q><L>Non minor est virtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> quam quaerere, parta tueri.</L></Q>
And to that end we must imitate the Bees, which to hinder the drones and spiders from comming into their Hives, to corrupt or devoure their ho∣ney stop the entries of them with bitter and stinging hearbs, as good Husbandmen who en∣close their grounds, lest passengers or the wild beasts should spoile them. Even so should wee alwayes keepe the passages of our senses, of our hearts, and of our thoughts, fenced with the feare of God, which is a bitter Rue, and Worm-wood, that the devill cannot endure to tast or relish.</P>
<P>Marke and observe with me the care and di∣ligence
<PB N="68" REF="39"/>
which is used to conserve Christall, and <HI>China</HI> Dishes, what paines are taken to keepe them cleane, bright, and shining, because they are deare and rare.

<P>When a vessell is cleft or crackt, it is unfit to containe any liquid thing; <HI>Now the wicked heart is a crackt vessell,</HI> saith <HI>Eccles. chap.</HI> 21.</P>
<P>A broken heart threatneth death to a living creature, as a Ship split and torne with the vio∣lence of the waves, threatneth undoubted death, ruine and shipwrack; so that heart that is not well united to God, that is broken and shattered by the force of worldly affections, threatneth and fore-telleth an infallible ruine and destru∣ction.</P>
<P>To fill a vessell in a Well or in a Fountaine, we must needs bend it downwards; so must we humble our heart, to fill it with heavenly gra∣ces, <HI>I have inclined my care, and I have received wisedome,</HI> saith the wise man, <HI>Sap.</HI> 61.</P>

<P><HI>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see GOD.</HI></P>
<P>In this second part wee have demonstrated unto us the reason, why Christ calleth the pure in heart <HI>Blessed,</HI> it is saith he, <HI>because they shall see GOD.</HI></P>
<P>This conjunction, for, joyning those two sen∣tences, sheweth and marketh out unto us the reason of this felicity, and happinesse, that can∣not receive a name enough emphaticall, and sig∣nificant to represent to our senses, and to our understandings, the least beame, the least spark, the least drop of that inexhaustible Ocean of that devouring fire, of that Sunne of righteous∣nesse, whose brightnesse if we should undertake to contemplate, it would strike us blinde, whose immense depth if wee should search, it would swallow us up, whose burning heat if wee ap∣proach, it would convert us to ashes, and would make us pay deere for our curiosity.</P>

<P>Wee with one consent said, <HI>That God is in∣visible</HI>; which seemeth to be opposite, and con∣trary to the promise made unto us in our Text, <HI>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</HI></P>
<P>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verthelesse, to reconcile them together, for the holy Ghost is never contrary to him∣selfe; wee say that the places before alledged a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e so to bee understood, that whilest man is in this mortall prison, in this valley of teares so obscure, and darke, whilest like an Owle he de∣lighteth in the night of sinne, his eyes can no way endure the least beames of the Sunne of righteousnesse, for God being an infinite Spirit, cannot be seene by a finite body; but when we shall leave off this mortall prison of our bodies, our soules then perfectly enlightened by the heavenly grace, shall be endued with that know∣ledge, and faculty, that they shall openly con∣template their Creator, and their God, as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> saith, 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. <HI>Chap. Now wee see through a glasse darkely, but then wee shall see hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> face to face.</HI></P>
<P>This word <HI>See God,</HI> is much controverted among Divines, which be of two severall opi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions; whereof the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e holdeth, That soules delivered of this corporall vayle, cannot see Gods face, for two reasons; the first is, that God being a spirituall Essence, infinite, incom∣prehensible, ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>not bee see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e by a finite crea∣ture,
<PB N="73" REF="41"/>
without implying contradiction, for then the containing, to wit, the blessed soule should bee greater then the contained, that is, God, which is absurd, by this axiome, that the object is contained by the visuall faculty: As if a man placed in the midst of the earth, or of the sea, looking round about a great distance off, as farre as his sight could reach, could not for all that say, That hee saw all the earth, or all the sea.</P>
<P>Those of the second opinion answere to this first reason, saying, That the Creator may not be compared with the creatures, that God is all in all, and all, and whole in every part, that hee is one, and consequently indivisible; that all things in him are Essentiall, and is not subject to division, that whosoever seeth him, seeth him totally.</P>
<P>The second reason of the first, is, that wee measure our soules by our bodies, imagining that they shall have eyes, with the which they shall be able to discerne and distinguish the pre∣sent objects.</P>
<P>To which the others answere, that indeede the soules in heaven shall have no corporall eyes like ours; but that notwithstanding God will give them a seeing faculty, by the which they shall perceive the present objects: 2. When these soules shall be rejoyned, and revnited to their bodies, God having purified them from all vncleanenesse, will make them like unto the glorious body of his Sonne Iesus Christ our
<PB N="74" REF="42"/>
Lord, who saith, <HI>Math.</HI> 22. <HI>That our bodies shall be as the Angels of God in heaven, who alwayes be∣hold the face of God, Math.</HI> 18. that is, <HI>that are al∣wayes in his presence, and that see him perfectly,</HI> in respect of themselues, as much as it pleased God to permit, but not perfectly in respect of God, as he that seeth the Sunne, may say, that hee seeth it perfectly, in respect of himselfe, if his faculty be good, and notwithstanding he ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>not see him as he is, because of the weakenesse of his eyes.</P>
<P>The second opinion which is more generally received, holdeth, that this word <HI>See,</HI> is taken simply, and absolutely, for to <HI>Know,</HI> and those that hold it, say, That Iesus Christ in our Text promiseth to the pure in heart, a perfect know∣ledge of the divine goodnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; wherein consist∣eth the fulnesse of our felicity, of our delights, and content, which they doe well proove by the 14. Chap. of Saint <HI>Iohn,</HI> ver. 7. <HI>If ye had knowne me, ye should have knowne my Father also, and from henceforth ye know him, and have seene him</HI>; where Christ sheweth to his Disciples, that they have seene his Father, because they have knowne him by so many miracles done before their eyes. And in the 17. Chap. of the same Gospell, <HI>This is life eternall, that they might know thee the onely true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent:</HI> where it plainely appeareth, that this word to <HI>know God,</HI> is as much as to possesse life eternall.</P>
<P>And so from those two places joyned to our Text, this conclusion followeth, that, <HI>To see God, know God, and have ete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nall life, are the same thing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="42"/>As the Angels then see the face of God, even so shall we also see it, for that blessed sight is re∣served for a recompence of our faith, as Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> in his 1. Epist. 3. Chap. <HI>When he shall appeare we shall be like him, for we shall see him face to face.</HI></P>
<P>Not that we must imagine, that God hath any members, although it be said, that man is made in the image of God, for that is thus to be understood, that man hath beene created in per∣fect justice, and innocencie, after the example of God.</P>
<P>But by this face of God, we must vnderstand with the Scripture, the Church, and the Fa∣thers, and namely Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> in his booke <HI>Decivit. Dei,</HI> the manifestation of his glory, and a perfect knowledge of his wonderfull mercie, which he will communicate unto vs.</P>
<P>It is a hard question, and difficult to handle, Whether the Saints after the Resurr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction shall see God with their corporall eyes, after they be glorified; so <HI>Iob</HI> saith, <HI>In my flesh shall I see God:</HI> there <HI>Iob</HI> prophesieth the Resurrection of his body: but hee doth not say, I will see him by my flesh; and if he had, it might have beene understood of Christ, that shall come at the last judgement in the sight of all; but his meaning was, that when hee should see God, hee should be in his flesh, though the wormes and corrup∣tion had devoured it.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> is excellent upon this sub∣ject, saying, We shall see God with our corpo∣rall glorified eyes, as we see the life of a man by
<PB N="76" REF="43"/>
his living actions, not seeing life it selfe; so is it likely, that being enlightened by a heavenly and divine light, we shall be able to see the Creator of all things both in them, and himselfe, so doubtfully the learnedst speak of it.</P>
<P>In the 5. Chap. of the 2. booke of <HI>Kings,</HI> we reade, that <HI>Elisha</HI> after that he had healed <HI>Naa∣man</HI> the Syrian, saw <HI>Gehazi</HI> his servant take Pre∣sents from him, although hee were beyond the common reach of the sight; and when <HI>Gehazi</HI> was returned, he said unto him, <HI>Went not my heart with thee, when the man turned againe from his Chare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to meet thee.</HI> Now if this Prophet hath bin able to see the actions of his servant, although absent from him, how much more shall our glo∣rified bodies see all, when God shall be all in all.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Elisha</HI> saw this action of his servant, ei∣ther by a speciall revelation from God, or by the sight of a spirituall imagination of the Pro∣phet, that shewed him the thing, after which manner he knew the most secret counsells of the King of <HI>Syria.</HI></P>
<P>We speake of these things, as blind men doe of colours, wee finde no certainty of them any where, the Fathers themselues speake so ob∣scurely of them, they goe as softly on, in the handling of this question, as if they trod on thornes, they grope along, as if they went in the obscure darknes of the blackest night, hard∣ly can you finde two agreeing together, and which is more strange, not one that is agreed with himselfe; and indeed how should a worme
<PB N="77" REF="43"/>
of the earth, the dwelling of errours, the subject of ignorance, know or comprehend that great God, which is the fountaine of all knowledge, and the bottomlesse and shorelesse Ocean of wisedome, and prudence.</P>

<P>Those that sayle in the maine Sea, which way soever they looke, finde no other object but the heaven, or the waves, their sight being too weake to penetrate to the bottome, or to view the shores; Even so shall we see God, and know him as farre as it shall please him to en∣able us, but so farre shall wee be from compre∣he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding him, that he doth comprehend us, and wee should then be no more seene there then a drop of wine in the Ocean.</P>

<P><HI>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then purifie our hearts, and cleanse our soules, from the filthinesse of sinne, and from the spots of iniquity; let our consciences bee white as snow, and cleane as washed wooll; let us take the firme and inviolable oath of Allea∣geance to our God, and let us not suffer Satan our mortall enemie to take possession of the fort of our soules, of the hill of <HI>Syo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that is of our consciences: let us not suffer him to make a breach in that vow, that we vowed to his obe∣dience at our first reception into the Church by Baptisme, and so wee shall be washed seaven times in the Iordan of repentance, and of con∣trition for our faults; when we have put on the white roabes of holinesse, justice, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nocen∣cie, we shall be invited to the Lambs wedding, we shall sit downe at table with the Kings sonne, wee shall be abundan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly filled with the dainties

<P>In a word, when like the high Priest we have left off the habits of our naturall corruption, and put on the white and cleane garment of san∣ctification for our selues, of love for our God, of charity for our neighbour; then, even then, the gate of the most holy place, which is heaven shall be opened unto u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, wee shall see Gods Ma∣jestie, not darkly, and as in a clowd, as it hath long appeared to our fore fathers, but rather as a bright shining Sunne, whose vertue shall en∣lighten us, whose love shall warme us, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose compassions shall animate us, at whose sight wee shall be vivified, consolated, and glo∣rified.</P>
<P>For hee will enrowle us among his Angels, will make us Citizens of heaven, and impatriate us to be absolute possessors of the rich treasures of eternall life, where it is farre easier to know what is not there, then to discourse what is.</P>
<P>There, there is no death, no wearinesse, no infirmity, no hunger, no thirst, no hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, no cold, no corruption, no want, no mourning, nor sorrow.</P>

<P>Here let us burne with zeale to ascend to those faire places; let us be enflamed with ex∣treame desire of possessing so goodly an inheri∣tance, and if our bodies cannot as yet goe thi∣ther, yet let our hearts ascend up, if our soule be as yet bound and fastned within this mortall prison; at the least, let our faith flie up to those delicious places, and there rest and stay untill our soules be perfectly pure, cleane, and white, that one day both in body and soule, wee may contemplate Gods divine Majestie, and sing eternally with the holy Angels, <HI>Holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts for evermore.</HI> AMEN.</P>
<P>O Most bountifull God, and most mercifull King, wee thy servants and children here prostrate and humbled before the high and ho∣ly tribunall of thy sacred and soveraigne Ma∣jestie, doe ingenuously confesse, that we are not worthy to lift up our eyes, or our hands to∣wards heaven, to call upon thee in our necessi∣ties, for our sinnes are raised over our heads like terrible mountaines, which seeme to threaten and defie thy judgements, from the top of their

the <HI>Peacemakers,</HI> and their felicity: the reason of this beatitude, is, <HI>to be called the children of God.</HI></P>
<P>Now for our better understanding of these words, let us handle them all severally, and let us for a while leave this concrete word <HI>Peace∣maker,</HI> and so come to his abstract, to wit, <HI>peace,</HI> the which is diversly defined according to the severall sorts and degrees of it.</P>
<P>For there is the peace of the body, which is a just temperature of the parts.</P>
<P>There is a peace of the irreasonable soule, which is an inordinate rest of the appetite.</P>
<P>There is a peace of the reasonable soule, which is a moderated consent of the action, and understanding.</P>

<P>There is a peace of mortall man, which is a well ordered obedience in faith, under the go∣vernment of the eternall, and divine law.</P>
<P>There is a peace of the house, which con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isteth in a just concord of the dome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ticall, both in commanding, and obeying.</P>

<P>There is a peace of the heavenly Citie, which is a well governed Societie, wholly and eter∣nally to enjoy God.</P>
<P>There is a peace of men, which is a mutuall concord. And againe, there is a peace of all
<PB N="86" REF="48"/>
things, which is a perfect tranquillity of order: now order is nothing else but a true disposition, giving to every thing his true ranke and place.</P>
<P>The Hebrew word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>shalom,</HI> representeth unto us exceeding well her Essence; for it sig∣nifieth a happy successe of all things in God.</P>
<P>Where we may note that every word hath his weight, and inestimable value.</P>
<P>For first it is a successe, and not a hazard, which is happy and not unlucky, of all, and not of something onely, in God, and not in the world.</P>
<P>The Grecians call it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, quiet, sweet, gracious, as deserving that name <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, by excellencie, because there is nothing in the world to bee compared to the excellencie of a publick and particular rest, and tranquillity.</P>
<P>The Latines call it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>quasi paecata,</HI> because it is peaceable, and no way mooved by the windes of seditions, nor of desperate passions; Shee is like the Sea when it is calme and quiet, there is nothing fairer to behold, then the hu∣mid and serene plaines of it, all seeming to be an entire piece of Christall.</P>
<P>And to prove that peace is nothing else but gentlenesse, and courtesie, let us heare the Apo∣stle S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Paul, Heb.</HI> 11.31.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>By faith <HI>Rahab</HI> the harlot perished not, with them that beleeved not, when she had received the spies with peace, which is gently, and cour∣teously,
<PB N="87" REF="48"/>
so that she did them no harme, nor suf∣fered any to be done unto them, any way at all.</P>
<P>So we read that Christ after his resurrection came among his Disciples, saying unto them, <HI>Peace be unto you.</HI></P>
<P>We reade also in the 2. Chap. of Saint <HI>Luke,</HI> ver. 29. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word,</HI> that is, thou sufferest him to depart with happinesse, and felicity, since he hath seene thy face.</P>
<P>And in the 10. Chap. of Saint <HI>Math.</HI> ver. 13. <HI>If the house be worthy to receive you, let your peace come upon it: but if the house be not worthy, let your peace returne to you.</HI> Where all interpreters agree, that by this word <HI>peace,</HI> christ understandeth all things good and favourable, all blessings, and all graces.</P>
<P>Now that wee may the more delight in the description of this garden of peace, let us there∣in imitate these Painters, who intending to re∣present unto us some very excellent beauty, use to draw and place close by it some black, and ghastly picture, that by the opposition of that deformity, our eyes may take the more plea∣sure and delight, in beholding that faire and beautifull face opposite to it, according to the truth of the Latine Proverb, <HI>Contraria contrarijs opposita magis elucescunt.</HI> One contrary appeareth better by the opposition of his contrary: so the darknesse of the night makes us find the Sunnes light more pleasant, the thornes embellish the
<PB N="88" REF="49"/>
Roses, and the roughnesse of the black briers seeme to adde excellencie to the soft whitenesse of the Lillies: Even so if wee speake a little of the mischiefes of warre, we shall find the sweet∣nesse of peace farre the more excellent, and with∣out staying, let us here say with <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the life of <HI>Fabius Maximus,</HI> That warre is a time when neither right nor reason can finde place: <HI>Caesar</HI> said, that the time of warre, and that of lawes were two; It is a time when Iustice is trodden under feete, when the time of ill doing is in season, when unfaithfulnesse is taken for vertue: O time pitifully miserable, since force trampleth Iustice under foote, when nothing is to be seene but fire, slaughters, treasons, rob∣beries, cruelties, tortures; in a word, all that fearefulnesse which hell can afford, there you may see virgins ravished, children hanging on their mothers breast slaine, honest women moc∣ked and abused by the insolent souldier, Chur∣ches robbed, houses pillaged; there is nothing to be seene but burning, but slaughtered bodies, but blood; nothing is to be heard but lamen∣table sighes, cries, and groanes; in a word, all humanity is banished from thence, so that wee say, that warre <HI>est bonorum mors, omnium vero malorum fons &amp; scaturigo:</HI> Warre is the death of goodnesse, and the life and beginning of all evill.</P>
<P>Now is not this face at the first sight capable to make us abhorre it, even before we perceive the least lineament, or the least draught or sha∣dow
<PB N="89" REF="49"/>
of beauty, which appeares in the face of his contrary, that is of peace.</P>
<P>But let us see the effects of warre in the hearts where it is praedominant, certainly <HI>ex malo cor∣uo, malum ovum, ex malo ovo, malum omen,</HI> Of an ill Raven, an ill egge, of an ill egge, an ill pre∣sage; for as the Philosophers say, <HI>Qualis ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sa talis effectus,</HI> as is the cause, so is the effect, Eagles doe not bring forth Doves, nor warre this hor∣rible and fearefull monster, any thing else bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cruelty, rigour, and fiercenesse.</P>
<P>When man is possessed by any of these foo∣lish passions, (daughters of disaster, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mo∣thers of misfortune) then his reason is all dis∣figured by it, the use of it is lost, <HI>Denigrata est super carbones faci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s ejus,</HI> The functions of his minde are turned upside downe, they are like a broken clock, wherein all is in disorder, and to which there is no trusting: The royall Prophet <HI>David</HI> sheweth us the effects of it, in few words, <HI>In mine anger</HI> (saith he) <HI>mine eye was troubled, my soule, and my belly were moved.</HI></P>
<P>and indeed in that case man is quite perver∣ted, his functions depraved, hee foames at the mouth, his eyes glister, he shaketh, and sweateth all over his body,

the world, even so in the <HI>microcosme,</HI> or little world, wrath confoundeth all, and overthrow∣eth all order.</P>
<P>But when that powerfull planet, the sunne of reason hath dispell'd and scattered the mists of those confusions, the clowds of so many disor∣ders, then his light pierceth and passeth through all those obscure darknesses, to shine on the acti∣ons, and to put the minde in her first station and temper.</P>
<P>A cholerick man maketh me remember the Bee, that being troubled, stingeth him that an∣gereth her, but in stinging, leaveth her sting in the wound, and with it her life, <HI>Animas{que} in vul∣nere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onunt:</HI> So the cholerick man thinking to wound others, killeth his owne soule, and mur∣thereth it with his owne weapons, <HI>patitur teli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lnera facta suis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Salomon</HI> that wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e King saith, <HI>That the Kings wrath is like the roaring of a Lyon, and against which who can subsist, and that his mildnesse is like the mor∣ning dewe.</HI></P>
<P>When the Sunne passeth through the Zodi∣ack, and is entered into the signe of <HI>Leo,</HI> we en∣dure unsufferable heat, so when wrath is joyned with power, and some likelihood of reason, it produceth strange effects.</P>
<P>The Lyon is a beast of an exceeding hot complexion, which causeth in his mouth so strong an infection, and stinke, that when hee hath devoured the halfe of his prey, that which he leaveth is suddenly putrified, and corrupted,
<PB N="91" REF="50"/>
this eternall fire is so violent in this beast, that it is commonly the cause of his death, happe∣ning by the corruption of his bowels.</P>
<P>Is not this a lively Embleme and representa∣tion of the cholerick man, whose slandering tongue is so venomous, and stinking, that it cor∣rupteth, and infecteth his neighbours good name, if he touch it never so little, in a word, wrath is a black and burned humour, that not onely corrupteth the body, but also killeth the soule.</P>
<P>In the law of <HI>Moses</HI>▪ those birds that had crooked clawes, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lived by prey, were not to be eaten, nor sacrificed; under the shadow of this figure let us light this torch of truth, that all that suffer themselues to be carried away by wrath, that gape after revenge and hatred, are uncleane before god, and unworthy to be offe∣red to him in sacrifice: If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembrest that thy bro∣ther hath ought against thee: <HI>Leave there thy gift before the Altar, and goe thy way, be reconciled to thy brother,</HI> saith our Saviour, <HI>Math.</HI> 5.23. And the royall Prophet sayes, <HI>Bloodie men are abomination to the Lord,</HI> Psal. 5.7.</P>
<P>Hitherto wee have seene the horrour, and mischiefes of warre, with some of the fruits she commonly beareth, to wit, cruelty, eldest daugh∣ter of this terrible monster: now let us con∣template a while the picture of peace her con∣trary, and let us tast with delectation the sweet∣nesse, and excellencie of the inestimable fruites
<PB N="92" REF="51"/>
which she beareth, &amp; propagates in the hearts of peacemakers, which are so great, that S<SUP>t</SUP>.<HI>August.</HI> saith, <HI>Tantum est pacis bonū, ut in rebus terrenis nihil gratius soleat audiri, nihil desiderabilius concupisci, nihil postremo possit melius inveniri.</HI> Peace is so great a good upon the earth, that no pleasanter thing can be heard, nothing more delightfull desired, and nothing better found.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Bernard</HI> in the 9. <HI>Serm.</HI> on the Lords Supper speaketh thus of it, The peace of this world is in the which whilest we dwell, we van∣quish our enemies, wee love one another, and judge not of those things that are hidden from us, that peace which shall bee in the world to come, shall be when wee shall raigne without enemies, where one shall not be of contrary ad∣uice to the other; in a word, where all things shall bee knowne, and open to every one, and endeth thus, Iesus Christ is this true peace, be∣cause hee hath reconciled us to God his Father, by the inestimable price of his blood.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> in the Sermon of the word of the Lord speaketh thus of it, <HI>Pax est serenitas mentis, tranquillitas animi, simplicitas cordis, vincu∣lum amoris, consortium charitatis, baec est quae simul∣tates tollit, bella compes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, iras comprimit, superbos calcat, humiles amat, discordes cedat, inimicos con∣cordat, cunctis est placida, nescit extolli, nescit in∣flari, hanc qui acceperit teneat, qui perdiderit repe∣tat, qui amiserit exquirat, quoniam qui in cadem non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rit inventus, a patre abdicatur, a Filio exhaer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>datur, à Spiritu Sancto alienus efficitur, necad haereditatem.
<PB N="93" REF="51"/>
Domini poterit venire, qui testimonium pacis noluerit observare.</HI> These be golden words deserving well to be knowne, and to be exactly obserued.</P>
<P><HI>Peace,</HI> saith hee, is a calmenesse of the under∣standing, a tranquillity of the minde, simpli∣city of the heart, the bond of peace, the practise of charity; it is peace that taketh away qua∣rels, endeth warres, appeaseth wrath, treadeth the proud under foote, loves the humble, paci fieth the quarelsome, agreeth the enemies, which is gracious to all, which is not high minded, nor proud, which whosoever hath received, let him conserue it, who so hath lost it, let him seeke and recover it, for hee that shall not be found in it, is disclaimed by the Father, disinherited by the Sonne, alienated from the Holy Ghost, nor shall hee ever attaine to the Lords inheritance, that would not obserue the bonds and testimo∣nie of peace.</P>
<P>Now we haue heard these two pillars of the Church of God; let us hearken to himself<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, speaking by the mouth of his chosen vessell, <HI>Co∣loss.</HI> 3.15. <HI>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called, in one body, and be ye thankfull.</HI> And <HI>Philip.</HI> 4.7. <HI>The peace of God which passeth all understanding, keepe your hearts and mindes, through Iesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And that which should most bind us to love this <HI>Peace,</HI> is the soring or head foun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aine from whence it sloweth; for as the warre of sinne proceedeth from the wicked one, so the peace of our consciences commeth from the Father of

<P>This word <HI>peacemaker</HI> is diversly interpreted by Author<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for some hold that those are they which live justly, and who by their actions ne∣ver provoke the divine Iustice.</P>
<P>Others as <HI>August.</HI> hold, that those are meant, which possesse a very peaceable conscience, that is, that are not agitated by the troubles of sinne.</P>
<P>Others beleeve, that those are they that are not Authors of quarrels, and dissentions.</P>
<P>Others understand it of those that forgive freely the injuries, and wrongs done unto them, as <HI>Hilarius.</HI></P>
<P>The last, and most likely to be the best opi∣nion, of the which number are <HI>Chrysostome, Eu∣thymius,</HI> and <HI>Theophylacte,</HI> is, that the true peace∣makers
<PB N="95" REF="52"/>
are those that are themselues, and in themselues peaceable, and pacified, and that be∣sides, that try their uttermost endevours and po∣wer, to compound differences, and to intro∣duce peace where dessention &amp; disorder raigne: And this interpretation commeth nearer to the Greeke word of our Text, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Quasi pa∣cemfacientes, aut conciliantes,</HI> Those that com∣pound quarrels; and this interpretation is also very convenient to the charge and duty which was enjoyned the Apostles, to whom Iesus Christ spake these words, who were to keepe maximes altogether contrary to those which the world practiseth, who doth esteeme farre more those that fight valiantly, and that con∣tinue obstinately in co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bat, then those that make peace, and pacifie all things; now this maxime was to be practised by the Apostles, as being to fight and overcome the world, not by force of Armes, but by gentlen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse and mild∣nesse, as we read Saint <HI>Luke</HI> 10. <HI>chap. ver.</HI> 5. <HI>Into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, the Apostles were to imitate the Prince of the Apostles, <HI>Iesus Christ</HI>▪ the true and perfect representation of meekenesse, humility, and mildnesse, as we may understand and know, if we runne over all the actions of his life, untill his ascension up to heaven: now this meeke∣nesse proceeded from him, both by inclination, for he was the Lamb of God, and by imitation, for he was like his Father, that is not a God of

<P>O what praise deserue those soules, that see∣ing so many dissentions and quarrells kindled, runne presently, and make hast, to bring the wholesome water of peace and quietnesse, least the continuation should cause a totall ruine, or some irreparable hurt; those, I say, are doubt∣lesse, and without comparison to be preferred to the valiantest Champions; that come into the field, for those overcome the bodies, these vanquish and tame the mindes, those fight for a crowne that will wither, these eternally carrie away a greene crowne of benedictions and bles∣sings; those teare and breake their bodies, these

<P>Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> is very witty in these points, <HI>Sicut spiritus humanus nunquam vivisicat membra nisi fuerint unita: sic spiritus sanctus nunquam nos vivificat nisi paece unitos.</HI> As (saith hee) the soule of man doth not quicken or vivifie our mem∣bers unlesse they be joyned together: so the holy Ghost doth never vivifie or quicken us, but when we are united by the bond of peace.</P>

<P>Let us say with an ancient Author, that peace is the salt of this life, without which it is unsa∣vorie, and without relish.</P>

therein as in his owne element, out of the which hee cannot subsist, but when either by chance, or misfortune, he findes himselfe in the midst of noyse, in the fire of disorder, and among the flames of contentions &amp; riots, then he crieth, runneth, and tormenteth himselfe, untill by his agitation and diligence, hee have quenched and repressed all, holdi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g this indubi∣table maxime, that
<Q><L>Candida pax homines, trux decet ira seras.</L></Q>
In a word, to end this discourse of politique peace, we say, that if warre be a thorne, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace is a Rose; if that be bitternesse, this is sweet∣nesse; if that be a storme, this is a calme wea∣ther; if that be full of mifchiefes, this is full of goodnesse; if that causeth poverty, this brings and gives riches; In a word, if that killeth, this giveth life; and to end with the Poet, let us say,

<P>But let us after the example of the high Priest, enter into the most holy place of the Temple of <HI>Salomon,</HI> and there visite that sac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed arke of our consciences, within the which God will keepe his sessions: let us contemplate that inestimable peace, immediatly proceeding from the remission of our sinnes, and most particular and perfect assistance of the holy Ghost, dwel∣ling in our soules; for it is impossible that any other, but the just should possesse that peace of conscience, seeing that betweene sinne (the de∣vils child, and the father of trouble) and peace, and quietnesse, there is so great an antipathy,
<PB N="102" REF="56"/>
that if sinne can set the least footing in any place, hee driveth away presently from thence peace and rest, and in their roome introduceth and breedeth therein quarrells and contentions, which like tormentors, doe miserably torture, and cruelly handle the miserable hearts where they lodge; and therefore the ancient Fathers of the Church openly pronounce, that the grea∣test felicity wherein <HI>Adam</HI> the first modell of mankinde was created, was peace of the heart, that rest of conscience, which hee possessed ab∣solutely within Paradise, having no other care or thought, but to love his Creator, to honour his Conseruator, and to adore his God.</P>
<P>But after that hee was fallen from that state of innocencie, by the greatnesse of his fault, af∣ter that sinne by disobedience had driven away pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce from his heart, then you see him in trou∣ble, he flieth, he hideth himselfe, he is afraid of himselfe, he covereth his nakednesse with figge leaves, he trembleth, and dareth not answere to that terrible and fearefull voyce, which hee heard walking in the Garden, behold the first effects which his sinne brought forth.</P>
<P>The Royall Prophet <HI>David, Psalm.</HI> 85.10. saith, <HI>Righteousnesse and peace have kissed each other,</HI> vpon which Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> discourseth thus;</P>
<P><HI>Duae sunt amicae, justitia &amp; pax, tu forte unam vis, &amp; alteram nonfacis, nemo enim est qui non ve∣lit pacem, sed non omnes volunt operari justitiam, si amicam pacis non amaveris, neque te amabit pax ipsa.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="56"/>Righteousnesse and Peace bee two friends, thou it may bee desirest the one, and wilt not practise the other; there bee none but wish for peace, but all will not doe righteousnesse; if thou love not the friend of peace, peace also will not loue thee.</P>
<P>Iustice with reason is called the mother of peace, because it goeth alwayes before, and is immediatly followed by it, <HI>Peace is the worke of justice,</HI> saith the Prophet <HI>Isaiah, chap.</HI> 32.17 And the <HI>Psalmist</HI> in the 72. <HI>Psalm. ver.</HI> 7. <HI>In those dayes righteousnesse shall flourish, and abundance of peace.</HI> And <HI>Psalm.</HI> 119. <HI>ver.</HI> 165. <HI>Great peac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have they which love thy law.</HI></P>
<P>From which propositions, wee draw this conclusion, that to have this peace of consci∣ence it is needfull for us to be just, to feare God, and to walke exactly in the obseruation of his sacred commandements.</P>
<P>So contrarily the wicked can have no peace, because of the worme of sinne, that gnaweth continually their soules, as we read <HI>Psalm.</HI> 28.3. <HI>Ill lucke and unhappinesse is in their wayes, and the way of peace have they not knowne. There is no peace for the wicked,</HI> saith the Lord; they thinke ne∣verthelesse that they have this peace, when they enjoy their pleasures; but this peace lasteth but a moment, and like their pleasure is presently followed by an extreame griefe, it is lethargick sleepe, very dangerous; it is a security, but it is carnall, it is a sleepe, but that representeth unto them a thousand apparitions, and a thousand
<PB N="104" REF="57"/>
strange visions. The wicked mans peace is like those fires which by night appeare burning in hills and medowes, the which if a man follow, they will insensibly leade him into terrible downefalls, but the true peace of a good con∣science, as saith an ancient Author, is the title of Religion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Temple of <HI>Salomon,</HI> the field of blessing, the garden of delights, the Angels joy, the Arke of the covenant, the treasure of the great King, the Court of God, the Tabernacle of his Sonne, the tent of his Spirit, the tower of <HI>Sion,</HI> the booke with seaven seales, which is to be opened upon that great and fearefull day of judgement.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> (in his Citie of God) speaketh thus of it, <HI>Pax nostra propria, hic est, cum Deo per fidem, &amp; in aeternum erit cum illo per speciem, talis est paxut solatium miseriae sit potius quam beatitudi∣nis gaudium.</HI> Our owne peace (that is the peace of our hearts) is here with God by faith, and in eternall life shall it be with him by vision: that peace which now we enjoy, is but a sparke in respect of that great fire, here it su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sisteth but by faith, then it shall be effected.</P>
<P>In a word let us say, that the peace of con∣science is a particular feeling and knowledge that God is pacified with us, that he hath blot∣ted out our misdeedes, that hee hath cast away our iniquities from before his face, like a clowd, that wee are no longer under the Kingdome of Satan, nor of the flesh, but are received in our heavenly Fathers favour, like the prodigall

child, that wee shall dwell in his house all the dayes of our life, and there receive those goods, joyes, and delights which he hath reseru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for his children.</P>
<P>Hitherto wee have spoken of peace in gene∣rall, and in particular of politique peace, and of the care must bee used to bring it to passe, of peace of conscience, or with God, of the worlds, or wicked mans peace, that troubleth all them that live not like him: now let us speake of that peace which is in our selues, and of the vertue of it.</P>
<P>Among all the perfections wherewith our first Father <HI>Adam</HI> was adorned, during the state of his innocencie, mildnesse was one, at the sent whereof all living creatures ranne to him, to doe him homage, and yeeld him obedience.</P>
<P><HI>Moses</HI> in the booke of <HI>Numbers,</HI> is called the <HI>debonnaire, or gracious,</HI> for which quality, God loved him dearely, and for a testimoniall of his love, called him to that honourable charge of deliverer, Prince and law giver of his people.</P>
<P>The King and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ophet <HI>David</HI> had this ver∣tue in great measure in him, for which cause God changing his Sheepheards crooke into a Royall Scepter, gave him victory over a world of enemies, that rose up continually against him, which maketh him to cry out in one of his Psalmes, <HI>Lord remember David and his mansuetude or clemencie.</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the booke of <HI>Leviticus,</HI> God commandeth the Priests to offer him a Lam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e without blemish for a peace offering; a Lambe

<P>The Lambe in the <HI>Revelation</HI> of all living creatures, was onely found worthy to open the booke sealed with seaven seales; so among all men the faithfull onely, and among the faithfull the meeke, shall bee able to open the booke of life, there to behold his name written before the foundation of the world.</P>
<P>The Bridegroome in the <HI>Canticles,</HI> calleth thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his beloved, <HI>Come my Dove, that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in the clef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the rocke, thy eyes are like Doves eyes, and thy cheekes like Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les, my Dove is alone, and per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect.</HI></P>
<P>Now it is familiar and common enough, that of all creatures Doves ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the symbols of mild∣nesse, and meekenesse, for it is noted that they have no gall. And here to apply these places to our design<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, let us know that the Bridegroome in this <HI>epithalamium</HI> or marriage song, is Iesus Christ himselfe, speaking to his Church, setting her forth by her lively colours, by the pensill of his love, shewing us in this comparison of the Dove, the perfections wherewith shee is adorned, where if wee waigh and consider dili∣gently the force of every word, wee shall finde them all emphaticall, and deseruing a more par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icular search and obseruation.</P>

<P>When that sweet IESVS was baptized by <HI>Iohn</HI> in <HI>Iordane,</HI> the three divine persons of the glorious Trinity were clearely manifested, for the majestuous voyce of the Father was heard speaking from heaven thus, <HI>This is my well be∣loved Sonne, in whom I am well pleased.</HI> Mathew 3.17.</P>
<P>Iesus Christ was in <HI>Iordane,</HI> and the holy Ghost descended from heaven like a Dove, and lighted upon him, from which place wee may draw this instruction, that if wee desire to bee called the children of God, if we wish to heare from heaven that gracious voyce, speaking to our soules, <HI>Thou art my well beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleased.</HI></P>
<P>If wee aspire to that great happinesse to re∣ceive the spirit of grace, mildnesse, and meeke∣nesse in our consciences.</P>
<P>Let us remember that wee must be like unto sweet IESVS our example, hee was naked, so must we put off cruelty, malice, and hatred: he was in the water, even so to enjoy so great a fa∣vour, we must plunge our selues in the riv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of our teares, in the Iordane of a holy and true re∣pentance, which may open our hearts, and con∣tinually

<P>It was Gods ordinance under the law of <HI>Mo∣ses,</HI> that when a man was uncleane, hee should for his purification resort to the Temple, and there offer two Turtle Doves.</P>

<P>When <HI>Noah</HI> would know if the waters were withdrawne from upon the face of the earth, he sent forth a Dove, which came to him in the evening with an Olive branch in her mouth; also he sent forth a Raven, which returned not, because hee stayd on the dead bodies, and stinking carcasses of those which died in this inundation.</P>
<P>God (in this example) is represented unto us by <HI>Noah,</HI> our soule by the Dove, peace by the Olive branch, it is God that staying in the Arke of heaven, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th our soules to visite the in∣undations of this world, which mess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge faith∣fully to performe, they do not sit on the highest and loftiest tops of Cedars, and Pinetrees, for they love not vanity, nor the glory of this

<P>But the Ravens that stayed upon the carcasses drowned by the flood, are those blacke and in∣fected soules, that delight in nothing but quar∣rels and contentions, and who so excessively love the corrupt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons of this world, that they never returne to heaven, from whence they tooke their first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light.</P>

<P>Let us then strive to imitate him as much as wee can possible, in our youth, being very humble: in our viril age, peaceable, and in our old age pitifull; and in all the course of our life milde, bountifull, and loving, following <HI>Davids</HI> counsell, <HI>Love peace and seeke it, for God with a fa∣vourable and gracious eye, beholds him that is stu∣dious of peace, and he heareth his most humble pray∣ers, in the ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of his affliction, Psalm.</HI> 34.16.

<P>Let us now heare that gracious and favou∣rable voyce, shewing unto us the profit and re∣compence which wee must without doubt ex∣pect, for having beene peacemakers, it is Iesus Christ himselfe, who is not a man, that hee should lye, nor the Sonne of man, that he should repent, when he saith in our text,</P>
<P><HI>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be cal∣led <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> children of God.</HI></P>

<P>But the tree must be first good, before it can beare good fruit, so wee must first be the chil∣dren of God, before wee can be true peacema∣kers, for those that are peacemakers not being the children of God, have already received their reward, that is, they have received the praise and applause of the world, which they were peacemakers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o obtaine, but all that is no∣thing but a maske and false apparition of that true peace, which God recommendeth unto us.</P>
<P>In this reason of Christs, why the peacema∣kers shall be called the children of God, wee must note and obserue a double Hebraisme, the one in the word <HI>Children,</HI> the other in the verbe, they shall be called, <HI>vocabuntur.</HI></P>
<P>The first Hebraisme is in the word <HI>Filij, Children,</HI> which in the holy tongue signifieth <HI>comform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> and <HI>like,</HI> as <HI>Math.</HI> 5.44.45. <HI>Love your enemies, blesse them that curse you, doe good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you, that ye may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the chil∣dren that is like to your Father which is in heaven.</HI></P>

<P>This word <HI>childe of God,</HI> is diversly taken in Scripture, and according to the Hebrew phrase, this word <HI>Sonne</HI> signifieth him that is vowed and ordained to any thing: so we reade Saint <HI>Math.</HI> 9.15. <HI>The children of the Bridechamber,</HI> that is, those that are ordained for the wedding, can∣not mourne as long as the Bridegroome is with them.

<P>The Father and the Sonne <HI>sunt relata,</HI> say the Philosophers, are relatives, that is, are referred the one to the other; for there is no Father, but there must likewise be a Sonne, whence I draw this conclusion, That God the Father being such, that is, having that title and quality be∣fore the Creation of the world, consequently Iesus Christ was before it, also his generation then is immediatly from the Father, as being begotten of him from all eternity, by a way in∣comprehensible to us; for, <HI>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as God, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same was in the beginning with God, Iohn</HI> 1.1.

our silence, then by our obscure representations. Neverthelesse for satisfaction to our curiosity, which is never contented with reason, and that will not be contained within the limits of civi∣lity, and modesty; let us bring one onely com∣parison, to give us some sparke of knowledge of this ineffable generation of the Sonne of God. When a man seeth himselfe in a well polished glasse, he presently seeth his image, and the fi∣gure of himselfe, having the same markes, and motions with his, which is caused by the re∣flection of the species within the eye, and there is so great a relation betweene the species, and the image, that one cannot be taken away with∣out annihilating the other; and although both the sight and reason make us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee, that they are sever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll things, truth also and experience makes us know that those two things subsist by one onely Essence, and that both have but one and the same subsistance, to wit, that of the species opposite to the glasse.</P>
<P>So God from all Eternity, contemplating his divine Essence, made such a reflection upon his person, that of this reflection hee produced and begot that eternall Wisedome, which is the Saviour and Redeemer of our soules; the soo∣ner we can goe from this matter is our best, for wee should be like them that will paint and re∣present the Sunne with a coale.</P>

<P>Since then that we cannot ascend so high, let us stop and stay our contemplation upon our selues, where we shall have a more free accesse; and continuing our first discourse, let us remem∣ber, that we may be called the children of God three wayes, 1.

<PB N="122" REF="67"/>
to warre against God by disobedience to his divine commaundements, and by the same sinne he made God his enemie, so that his re∣venging justice instantly tooke from him that faire Robe of Iustice, holinesse, and innocencie, in which he was created.</P>
<P>But his mercie being not able to suffer that man, that maister-piece of his hands, should be for ever banished &amp; confined within the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aines and torments of hell, to satisfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Iustice, hath left some in their Reprobation, to endure and suffer the punishment due to their faults, and hath chosen and elected some to testifie in them the effect of his compassions, br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aking the chaines wherewith Satan kept them bound, and that by sending into the world his onely and well beloved Sonne, who hath paid their ran∣some by the inestimable price of his pretious blood; and moreover, having given them li∣berty, hee hath besides bestowed on them the gift to be made the children of God, and co∣heires with his Sonne of eternall and most bles∣sed life: And thus it is, that wee are called the children of God in our text, children by adop∣tion, by favour and by grace.

Chapter of S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Mathew,</HI> where wee see him disputing against a Doctor of the Law, who de∣manded of him which was the first and greatest Commaundement; and Iesus answered him, <HI>Thou shalt love God with all thy heart, with all thy soule, and with all thy minde,</HI> which is the first and greatest commandement; and the second is like unto it; which is, <HI>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy selfe</HI>; and of these two Commaundements depend the whole Law and the Prophets, as our Apostle Saint <HI>Peter</HI> (in the imitation of his bles∣sed Master Christ) after hee had instructed and admonished his faithfull flocke, in all their du∣ties, in the precedent verses of our Text; hee drawes an abridgement of all which concerned their saluation, when he said,

<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q></P>
<P>In these words, we have all the instructions which we must practise in our soules and bodies concerning those divine and humane duties; which wee must convert, and reduce into practise; which wordes (naturally divide them∣selues) into two severall branches, or heads, (to wit) 1. the <HI>feare</HI> which wee ought to beare unto God: and 2. The <HI>honour</HI> which wee must obserue and give to the King.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="70"/>The sweetest, and most pleasingst sacrifice which we can offer up unto the Lord Almigh∣ty, is a heart replenished and fraughted with the feare of his holy name, a minde trembling be∣fore his sacred Majestie, and a soule terrified with the sublimity and greatnesse of his feare∣full judgements, as the royall Prophet affirmeth in <HI>Psal.</HI> 2.11. <HI>Serue the Lord with feare, and reioyce with trembling</HI>; And againe <HI>Psal.</HI> 2.7. <HI>I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy, and in thy feare will I worship towards thy holy Temple.</HI></P>
<P>We can offer up no sacrifice so pleasing, nor performe no action or duty so acceptable to God, as when wee adore him in all feare, and reverence him in all astonishment &amp; trembling, which lively depaynteth and prefigureth his Greatnesse and Magnificence, perfectly demon∣strateth us our Duties, and witnesseth our humi∣lity and obedience, which is exceeding delight∣full, and pleasing to him.</P>
<P>That Romane Emperour perspicuously ex∣pressed and deciphered the excellent power and effects of this feare, when he caried for his Motto and Devise, <HI>Oderint dum metuant,</HI> Let those hate me that will, so they feare me; shew∣ing thereby what small account and esteeme hee made of the hatred, and how dearely he prised and respected the feare which hee would have given and borne to him.</P>
<P>Morall Philosophers affirme and say, That Love and feare are two sister germanes, because the one is conjoyned to the other, and both
<PB N="129" REF="70"/>
linked together produce one &amp; the same effects; for still the Lover is in care and feare of the thing beloved; whereas wee never feare to lose that which wee hate, but that which wee love dearely, and cherish tenderly, and both of these together produce the conseruation of their ob∣ject. But this distinction takes no place, but here on earth among crea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures, and doth nei∣ther regard nor looke up towards Heaven to God the Creator; For God is all Love, but he can never be capable of alteration or defect, as is that feare which he hath left and given un∣to man for his portion and inheritance.</P>
<P>So he which is possessed with a perfect feare, to offend his God, or to lose his favour, he is linked and joyned to God with the Gordian knots of his love, which are then wholly made indivi∣sible and inseparable; and the Love of God conjoyned with the feare of man, cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the con∣servation of the soule; and this it is, where the Apostle Saint <HI>Peter</HI> tells us in our text, <HI>Feare God,</HI> By which word <HI>feare</HI> wee must not understand, a cowardize, a pusillanimity, or any irregular passion, which freezeth our blood in our veines, which causeth our hearts to pant and beat with an incessant motion, which calls and attract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our blood from all parts of our bodies; to come to assist and succour our heart, which shutts and hood winkes our eyes against reason, and ima∣gineth, that all objects whatsoever presented to us, have all together conjured and conspired our ruine; as those who fly from a battaile, feare

every bush which they see or meete with to be their enemies, who purposely pursue them, and runne every where to kill them: Or else as those who are led to their executions and deathes, whom feare doth so powerfully seize and sur∣prise, that by these passions and effects, it in a manner deprives them of life, before they think thereof, the which wee can testifie and approve by many irrevocable precedents and examples.</P>
<P>No, no: It is not of this defect of judgement, or of this cowardly apprehension and feare, which our Apostle tells us of; but it a holy, just, and commendable feare, which we ought to have and retaine, in bearing a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> admirable re∣spect, and honour to the Creator and conseruer of our bodies and soules; As to feare and trem∣ble before the terrible throne of his divine Iu∣stice, and by not rashly abusing of his favours and mercies, so liberally, so bountifully exten∣ded to us, because his presence is a consuming fire, which devoures and consumes to ashes, all those who unrevere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly approach his sacred Throne, his most holy hill; as heretofore hee forbad the children of <HI>Israel,</HI> not to approach mouth <HI>Sinay,</HI> because hee was there purpos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly to sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake with his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvant <HI>Moses:</HI> But not to stay any longer on this point, let us say with the Philosophers and Theologians, that there is ge∣nerally two sorts of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are (that is to say) Divine and Humane, which againe subdivide them∣selues every one into three severall parts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd branches;</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="71"/>The Humane feare compriseth and com∣prehendeth:</P>
<P N="1">1. The Naturall, which hath wholly buried in her, the senses, all Philosophy, and the strong∣est and most assured courage cannot hinder him from shutting his eyes at the suddaine surprise of a flash of lightning, or at the feignednesse of a hand, which unexpectedly approacheth our face; or that we withdraw not, or turne not our head from the sight of a fearefull precipice; or that a suddaine crack or noyse doe not at first hearing terrifie or astonish us:
<Q><P><HI>Primi illi motus non sunt hominis,</HI></P>
<P>The first motions (or terrours) are not in our power.</P></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. Corporall, whereby wee naturally ab∣horre Death, and feare to expose and cast our selues into danger.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mundane, (or worldly) whereby we feare to lose our wealth, honours, and dignities, but it is of neither of these sorts of feares, which our Apostles speakes unto us, but onely of <HI>Di∣vine feare,</HI> which likewise streames foorth in three rivolets:</P>
<P N="1">1. Servile; whereby we feare God, for the apprehension we have of the infernall tortures and torments of Hell, and this degree and sort of feare is not good of it selfe, because it hath no good object, nor is made or formed to a good end; neverthelesse, it is held and termed good, because it conduceth to good.</P>
<P N="2">2. Initiant, which lookes two wayes: 1. to∣wards
<PB REF="72"/>
the torments wee feare: 2. towards the glory we desire, and it is also termed, enter∣woven, or mixt, because it is composed both of a good and bad feare.</P>
<P N="3">3. Filiall, which is the last and best sort of divine feare, whereby we love God not only for our owne glory, or for the apprehension of tor∣men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, but for his goodnes, excell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncy, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rfecti∣on, and in a word, for and in regard of himselfe.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Bernard</HI> lively describes, and pertinent∣ly represents those three sorts of feare: 1. <HI>Ne cruciemur à gehenna:</HI> 2. <HI>Ne exclusi à visione tam inestimabili gloria privem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r:</HI> 3. <HI>Replet animum sol∣licitudine ne deseratur à gratia.</HI></P>
<P>Which is to say: The first feare apprehends torments; The second, the privation of glory; and the third wholly possesseth our hearts and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>indes with care and anxiety, as fearing not to lose Gods grace and favour.</P>
<P>The servile feare is attributed to the wicked.</P>
<P>The filiall, to the good, I meane to those who are the children of God.</P>
<P>The Initiant (or intermixed) is proper as well to the good, as the bad, and also it is the most frequent and generall.</P>
<P>Those three sorts of feare are so many wing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which conduct, elevate, &amp; soare us up to heaven; The Servile begins first, which denounceth to sinners eternall death and damnation, and that sharpe and sensible apprehension to be devou∣red with the flames of hell fire. It opens him the gate to be sorrowfull for his offences, which
<PB REF="72"/>
threaten to precipitate him in that unquench∣able fire, and afterwards entering into a firme and lively <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epentance for his former sinnes, hee begins to conceive the future felicity and glory of Heaven, for the love whereof hee partly re∣sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es to forsake and abandon sinne: as <HI>Salomon</HI> saith, <HI>By the feare of the Lord men depart from evill, Prov.</HI> 16.6. Although neverthelesse that he doe it, partly for feare of punishment which will in∣fallibly follow him; and af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er that, it againe leades him into this perfect filiall feare, where∣by he so infinitely loves God, that hee had ra∣ther dye, then offend him in the least thing of the world; so neerely he loves him, so deerely he honoureth and adores him.</P>
<P>S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Augustine</HI> makes onely two sorts of feare, (to wit) <HI>Filiall,</HI> and <HI>Servile,</HI> and makes them dif∣ferent in this, That the <HI>Servile</HI> hath for object <HI>malum poenae,</HI> the evill of punishment, and the filiall <HI>malum culpae,</HI> the evill of guiltinesse; <HI>Illo timet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r ne incid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tur in tormentum s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pplicij, isto ne amittatur gratia beneficij:</HI> By the first, wee feare the torments of hell fire; By the second, wee feare to lose the grace and favour of God.</P>
<P>It is this faire, this sweet spirituall vertue, which gives us admittance and entrance into the closet of God; which openeth unto us the treasures of his favour and mercy, and which makes us enter into the possession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f life eternall; <HI>For those who feare the Lord shall behold his face, shall have prosperity, and see good dayes,</HI> saith the royall Prophet King <HI>David, Psalm.</HI> 34.11. It is
<PB N="134" REF="73"/>
this feare of the Lord, which makes men pro∣sper on earth, as saith <HI>Salomon</HI> the Prince of wise men, and the wisest of Princes, <HI>The feare of the Lord prolongeth dayes, but the yeares of the wicked sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be shortned, Prov.</HI> 10.27.

Chap. of <HI>Proverbs, In the fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re of the Lord is strong confidence, and his children shall have a place of refuge, The feare of the Lord is a fountaine of life to depart from the snares of death:</HI> He againe teacheth us, that wealth is unprofitable, yea prejudiciall to us without this salubrious, this sacred feare of God, &amp; that poverty is to be preferred before fading and pe∣rishable riches: <HI>Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then great treasure and trouble therewith.</HI></P>
<P>This feare of the Lord, is (as it were) <HI>Iacobs</HI> Ladder, whereby the Angels (of divine conso∣lations) descend upon us on earth, and our ho∣ly prayers, and religious thoughts and medita∣tions ascend unto Heaven. This Ladder hath three principall steps; <HI>As the feare of the Lord makes us ascend unto Iesus Christ, which is our wise∣dome: for through and by God he hath made us wise∣dome,</HI> 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. Ies<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Christ leades us to God his Father, and God receives and lodgeth us in Heaven, and therefore we first feare him, if ever we hope or thinke to enter into his favour.</P>
<P>This feare of God, is the head spring and fountaine, from whence we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> draw and exhaust
<PB N="135" REF="73"/>
the sacred mysteries of our salvation; and <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vid</HI> tells us in formall and expresse termes, <HI>That the feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisedome, Psal.</HI> III. 10. Thereby to teach us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat all this knowledge and learning whereof men vaunt and glory, is nothing else but pure folly, if it derive not his Origen, or beginning from the feare of the Lord. This feare is here taken for the prin∣ciple of wisedome, and Ie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Christ himselfe (in many places of Scripture) hath assumed and ta∣ken the title of <HI>Wisedome,</HI> because he is the wis∣dome of the Father, as wee reade in the former alledged Chapter of 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30.

<P>The auncient Pagans have perfectly and truly depaynted feare, when they said it was all environed with fire and flames, as Love; and so they understood of corporall and Mundane (or worldly feare) and likewise of divine feare, concerning their false imaginary Gods. Here we will doe as <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h</HI> did; Wee will make use of sinners to build the Arke of our salvation, or as <HI>Salom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> did of the timber &amp; stones of King <HI>Hi∣ram,</HI> to build the temple of the Eternall, 1. <HI>Reg.</HI> 5. That which Pagans have spoken without know∣ledge, wee will speake with reason and know∣ledge, That all sorts of feare, is a fire in our soules, which scorcheth and consumes us as long as it remaines there: B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t let us h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re ende∣vour particularly, to consider the Analogies and resemblances, that there is betweene fire, and the feare of God▪ which is the subject of our text.</P>
<P>Fire is a furious, hastie, and active Element, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kewise are the points of apprehension and feare; Fire is the cleanest, the purest, the wholsomest of all Elements; I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cleanseth, it pu∣rifieth, it drives out all filthinesse and corrupti∣on; as being neither able no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apable to suffer in it selfe any impurity, for it either consumes, or expells it; And all this agrees well with the feare of God, which is the most wholsomest Physick that we can take to purge our selues of sinne, and to purifie our heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of all vncleane∣nesse; for there is no vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e but it will purge and

<P>To make straight a crooked peece of wood or timber, wee use fire, thereby to make it be∣come more soft and flexible. So to replace soules in the way of life, when they are either crooked, or gone astray, in the by pathes of vice, then the feare of God, of all other reme∣dies i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he best and most soveraigne.</P>
<P>Fire (by <HI>Antiperistase</HI>) as it heate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those who are cold, so it refresheth and comforteth those who are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot; The feare of God heates and en∣flames those soules to doe well, who are most frozen in piety; and contrariwise, it cooleth those who are most enflamed with their bur∣ning sensualities and concupiscences.</P>
<P>To venemous Apostumes, mortal Gangreens and desperate diseases, wee for the last remedy apply Irons and fire to cure it.</P>
<P>To sinners inveterated in their wickednesse, and as it were despairing of their salvation, wee must apply the Iron and fire of the feare of God, to make them apprehend and know his divine judgements if they remaine impenitent, and vn∣repentant.</P>

<P>In a word, (and so to draw to the conclu¦sion) of this part of the Text, the two prin∣cipall pillars of Christian Doctrine, and the two firme and vnremoveable foundations there∣of,

<P>The two noblest and most excellent offices, which the Angels, and blessed soules enjoy above in the triumphant Church, are the vision of God, and the ordinary action of glorifying and honouring God, about the which they are eternally imployed, and therefore the holy Ghost to fashion and dispose us here belowe in the militant Church, to glorifie in time his sa∣cred Majestie in heaven, commandeth us in our text likewise, to <HI>Honour the King,</HI> as being the true Image and lively representation of that great King of glory, of the Father of Eterni∣tie, of the mighty God of Hoasts, <HI>Feare God,</HI>

<P>Divine, and altogether admirable words, as be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the summe and abridgement of all the duties which we ought to practise in this world, both in body and soule, both for the morall and spirituall life, the performance whereof brings us to absolute perfection; for if we feare God, wee serve him, and never offend him; and in honouring the King, besides the performa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of our duty, wee obey the Commaundement of God.</P>
<P>So these 2. commandements are so straight∣ly link'd and joyned together, that the breach of the one, is the violation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he other; for we ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>not displ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase the King, without offending God, nor offend God, without violating the Kings lawes.</P>
<P>Let us see what that chosen vessell saith, in very earnest and pressing words, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.1. <HI>Let every soule be subject to the higher powers, for there is no power but from God, and all authority is given from the Lord</HI>; which is the reason of the com∣mandement, followed presently with a threat∣ning; wherefore who so resist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and therefore incurres condemnation, for the Prince beares not the sword in vaine, seeing he is the servant and minister of God, to punish evill doers, ther∣fore must ye be subject not onely for feare, but also for conscience s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke; and therefore pay ye tribute, because they are the ministers of God ordain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to that end, <HI>Give then unto every one
<PB N="151" REF="80"/>
his due, tribute to whom tribute, custome to whom custome, feare to whom feare, and honour to whom honour.</HI></P>
<P>Before we ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r into an exact and particular exposition of the words of our Text, wee will examine the consequence of this commaunde∣ment, and as those who desire to know the sweetnesse and goodnesse of water, ascend to fetch it from the spring, that wee may esteeme the more the excellencie and greatnesse of this commandement; we must observe, that this or∣dinance is not made by men, either to flatter King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for feare of their soveraigne authority, but that it is Gods owne ordinance, dictated unto our Apostle by the holy Ghost.</P>
<P>Which brings great matter of consolation, to those who with zeale undertake the execu∣tion of it, knowing that God loves those that feare him, and blesseth those that are obedient to him.</P>
<P>And contrarily, it must greatly terrifie the disobedient, when they remember the infalli∣ble threatnings, and the irrevocable sentence, pronounced by Gods owne sacred mouth, say¦ing, <HI>Cursed is hee that break<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the least of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se com∣mandements,</HI> Math. 5.19. <HI>Cursed is hee that shall not be perman<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt in all the things written in the book of the Law, to doe them,</HI> Deut. 27.26.</P>
<P>We must againe note, that the Commande∣ment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God, are like the Sciences which are more or lesse esteemed, according to the no∣bility and excellencie of their object, for as
<PB N="152" REF="81"/>
that affection and charity which we owe to our neighbour, without comparison gives place to that extreame and infinite love which wee owe to our God, and heavenly Father; so the ho∣nour we are to beare to all men in generall, is so much inferiour to that we owe the King, as his dignity is elevated above that of other men; and therefore you see, that as soone as our Apostle commandeth us to feare God, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e addeth pre∣sently, <HI>Honour the King.</HI></P>
<P>Shewing by that order, that the honour and service due to the King, immediatly followes that which wee owe to God, and therefore a great servant of God of our times, expounding these words, saith after <HI>Tertullian,</HI> That in the performance of these two precepts, the Chri∣stian makes himselfe perfect, both for the reli∣gious and mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all life, for in fearing God, hee walkes through the pathes of justice, holinesse, and innocencie, which leades in the end to eter∣nall felicity.</P>
<P>And in honouring the King, he observes his lawes, and by those meanes buildeth up for himselfe a delightfull rest, and an incomparable felicity.</P>
<P>But because it is to undertake to sayle over a boundlesse and bottomlesse Ocean, if we should goe about to alledge here all the places which we might cite out of the Fathers, and many others; let us hearken to the holy Ghost, in the most common places of Scripture, and imita∣ting the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sraelites, we will onely take some few

<P>Wee very easily learne the definition, or de∣scription of this word to <HI>Honour,</HI> in the 6. Chap of <HI>Esther,</HI> when <HI>Ahashuerosh</HI> asked <HI>Haman</HI> what should be done unto the man whom the King would honour; <HI>Haman</HI> thinking the King spake so for him, invented all the wayes and meanes hee could, to enjoy and encrease this honour; therefore he answered the King thus, As for the man whom the King will honour, let them bring for him royall apparell, which the King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>seth to weare, and the horse that the King ri∣deth upon, and that the crowne royall may be set upon his head, and that one of the greatest Princes should goe before him, and proclaime, <HI>Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the King will honour.</HI></P>
<P>In this ample description of <HI>Honour,</HI> we note the definition of it; to wit, to give glory, to doe homage to any one, to seeke all the meanes that may be to advance his credit, and encrease his reputation through all the world, and thus that cursed <HI>Haman</HI> thought to be honoured.</P>
<P>But this word to <HI>Honour the King,</HI> in that
<PB N="154" REF="82"/>
sense that our Apostle takes it, is like to that honour mentioned in the first Commandement of the second table, <HI>Honour thy Father and thy mother,</HI> which signifieth in generall, to serve, re∣verence, obey, assist those whom wee honour, and of that reverence, obedience, and assistance, Saint <HI>Paul</HI> speaketh expresly, 1. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im.</HI> 5.17. <HI>The Elders that rule well, are worthy of a double honour,</HI> where observe and note, that by the first ho∣nour, hee understandeth a civill and common honour, like that which is due to other honou∣rable men; but by the second honour hee un∣derstandeth a subvention, and reward of his la∣bours, as it appeareth by the following words, <HI>Thou shalt not musle the mouth of the Oxe that tread∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th out the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, and the labourer i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worthy of his wages,</HI> Luk. 10.7.</P>
<P>And of all these foure duties which wee are to pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tise, to <HI>honour the King,</HI> is spoken at large, 1. <HI>Sam. Chap.</HI> 8.

<P>But because commonly among good corne there be tares, or some other bad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, we will shew by expresse words of Scripture, and by invincible reasons, <HI>That hee that obeyeth not to the higher powers, offendeth directly God himselfe, who will destroy him.</HI></P>

the History of whose destruction and confusion is so well knowne, that wee neede not insist upon it.</P>
<P>But here are yet very expresse words. <HI>Exod.</HI> 22.28. <HI>Thou shalt not rayle upon the Iudges, neither speake evill of the ruler of thy people.</HI> And <HI>Acts</HI> 23. <HI>Thou shalt not speake ill of thy Prince, of him that go∣verneth thee.</HI></P>
<P>But because these lawes and examples like waves of the Sea follow one another, wee will insist on the consideration of the horror of this crime, which cannot take place in a soule never so little endued with heavenly graces; for that heart must be desperately wicked, and that soule possessed with a thousand furies, that suf∣fereth the least thought of it to harbour in his will; that soule, I say, must not onely be voyd of reason, but worse then bruit beasts, who without contradiction follow and obey their Kings: The birds yeeld to the Eagle, the fishes follow the Dolphin, and the beasts are pliant and humble before the Lyon; and should man that is made after Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s image, be worse then all other living creatures? This is to be neither man nor beast, but the off-spring of those abo∣minable spirits, which rebelled in heaven against God, and therefore received the punishment due to their foolish ambition in hell; but wee will no longer stay our contemplation about these de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estable men, hoping that our age is not so unhappy as to be corr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pted by them.</P>
<P>But we will now speake of the reward, profit,
<PB N="157" REF="83"/>
and recompence, which those shall certainely receive that obey this commandement of God, in <HI>honouring the King.</HI></P>
<P>All the Interpreters of the law of God, with one consent agree, that the first commandement of the second table, to wit, <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</HI> is to be understood of all them that have any power or dominion over us, and chiefely of Kings, and Princes, to whom wee are subject, and to whom wee owe both our lives and goods; and besides, that all the Fa∣thers are of that opinion, yet we also see it pro∣ved in the 13. Chap. to the <HI>Romanes,</HI> where the Apostle teaching the faithfull all the lawes which they must observe; hee runnes over all the Commandements of God, and yet speakes not of this word <HI>Father,</HI> because hee compre∣hendeth it sufficiently under that of <HI>King,</HI> be∣cause the Father is King in his Family, and the King is the Father of his people.</P>
<P>As for that objection, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re is no men∣tion made of a King in the Decalogue, the rea∣son is cleare and manifest; first, the Israelites had no neede of it, because God did every day appeare visibly unto them, spake to them at all times, and wrought co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinually so many mira∣cles among them, that they could not be doubt∣full of his presence: secondly, there is no men∣tion made neither of Governour, nor of Prince, and yet it is unlikely that God had forgotten <HI>Moses,</HI> who had delivered them, before God wrote the Law with his owne finger on the
<PB N="158" REF="84"/>
mountaine of <HI>Sinai</HI>; but the reason is, that by the word <HI>Father,</HI> God understandeth, as well Kings and Princes, as those that have begotten us; all the curses made against the rebellious, and disobedient to this commandement, are common both to the rebellious to their Prince, and to the disobedient to their Father; as on the contrary, those that are obedient to both, shall bee equally rewarded with the same bles∣sing, and the promise made to them by God, who doe honour their parents, is also to be ex∣tended to those who honour their Kings, and Princes, which promise is happinesse, and length of dayes upon the land.</P>
<P>Which promise (though it often seeme other∣wise) is alwayes fulfilled, for when an obedient sonne to his father, or a faithfull subject to his Prince dieth young, and in the flower of his age, God neverthelesse accomplisheth his word, and fulfilleth truely his promise; for if it bee good for the faithfull to remaine in the land, GOD will make him abundantly to prosper therein; but if his admirable and incomprehen∣sible providence, see that hee should be sundry wayes grievously afflicted, he of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en times put∣teth him in safety, and calleth him unto him in his mercy, and yet hee is still as good as his word, as if a man promised mee a hundred pounds, and should give me three hundred, hee thereby breakes not his promise; so God ha∣ving promised us here belowe the possession of this world, and seeing that our dwelling in it is
<PB N="159" REF="84"/>
not for our profit, bereaving us of this, hee ad∣mitteth us into the incorruptible Kingdome of glory, more excellent without comparison then the first, and so whether hee let us dwell here belowe, or whether hee call us above to him∣selfe, we shall alwayes be in a most happy con∣dition, if we obey his commandement, in <HI>Ho∣nouring the King.</HI></P>
<P>This word, and dignity of a King is so knowne, and familiar to all kinde of nations, that we should seeme to light a candle at noone day▪ to see the light of the Sunne, if wee should exactly seeke out the definitions, and Ethymolo∣gies of it.</P>
<P>We will onely say with Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> in the Citie of God, that the name of <HI>King</HI> is the auncientest title, given to the Governours, and Rul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of peoples, yea, when the earth devoyd of all ambition, enjoyed the sweetnesse and fe∣licity of an inestimable peace.</P>
<P>For as <HI>Non minor est virtus, quàm quaerere, par∣ta t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eri,</HI> There is no lesse vertue in conserving then in purchasing; so you see that the peace∣ablest of the Auncients, have provided for their conservation in chusing Kings and Princes, un∣der whose shadowe they enjoyed quiet rest, for the Kingdome being as a body, the King must alwayes be the head, which being seated on the top, and elevated over the rest of the mem∣bers, hee fore-seeth the dangers to avoyd them, and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idereth the advantages to embrace them.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="85"/>Now as in the head is seene the glory, and beauty of man, according to these auncient verses.

<P>All living creatures alwayes behold the earth, but God hath made and erected mans face, that he might behold the heaven, and the starres; even so must we consider the beauty of the sub∣jects, in the Kings face and Majestie, as being the head thereof.</P>
<P>As you see that all the senses both internall and externall are seated, and take their begin∣ning from the head; so all the counsells, all the resolutions, justice, the lawes, in a word, all that is necessary for the Kingdomes conservation, is all to be found in the <HI>King,</HI> as in his center, and in the place whence they take their beginning.</P>
<P>Let us then examine particularly, since wee have a Royall subject in hand, all the circum∣stances, by which the King in comparison of his subjects, is just as the head is over the rest of the members, wherein reason holdeth her Assizes and Sessions, the better to governe this <HI>Microcosme,</HI> or little world.</P>
<P>The two chiefest and noblest faculties of the soule, are the Vnderstanding, and the Will▪ the same which we note in the soule, wee may also marke to be in the King, which is as it were the soule of the people, for as from the under∣standing proceede the counsels, resolutions, and
<PB N="161" REF="85"/>
enterprises, needfull for the conservation of mans body; even so from the King proceedes the meanes, and inventions for the right, and just government of his Realme▪ As by the Will, wee see that man accepteth those things which are good, and rejecteth those that are hurt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull; even so the King by his wonderfull prudence, and wisedome seeketh what is good, profitable to his subjects, &amp; contrarily rejecteth and preventeth whatsoever is hurtfull and dan∣gerous to them.</P>
<P>In a word, as all the parts of the body, and all the appetites of the soule, stirre according to the motion of the will; so the people should never have any other desire, thought or inten∣tion, but the desire, thought, and designe of their King, who is the Lords anointed, sent by God to administer Iustice, and so governe his people in Equity, as the Psalmist speaketh. <HI>Psalm.</HI> 46.10.</P>
<P>The hands of Kings are like that divine ri∣ver, which compassed about the Garden of <HI>Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> and being▪ divided into foure branches, communicated to the hearbs, and plants of that inclosure, a continuall moysture, and which was altogether most wonderfull and miracu∣lous, in that those foure brookes, besides the excellent sweetnesse of their water, were well stored, some with fine gold, and others with precious stones.</P>
<P>With infinite right and reason, may we there∣fore compare the hands and actions of Kings,

to this undraynable spring and river of the earthly Paradise, sinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they are imployed about nothing else, but lovingly to cherish and ten∣der their Subjects by liberally distributing, and communicating to them th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meanes of their subsistance and prosperity.</P>
<P>But least wee should be carried away, by the swift streame of the many severall cogitations, which arise from so royall a subject, let us re∣turne to our fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer discou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o wit, that the King being to his people, as the head is to the rest of the body, all the rare and admirable parts contayned therein, as the internall and externall senses, ought justly to bee compared to him.</P>

<P>But rather is it not God himselfe, who by his sacred mouth commanded <HI>Samuel</HI> in the 9. Chapter of his booke, as soone as he had seene <HI>Saul</HI> that went to enquire of him about his Fa∣thers Asses, at the same time God said unto him, <HI>This is the man of whom I spake unto thee, he shall rule over my people.</HI></P>
<P>And in the 16. Chapter of the same booke, God commaunded him to goe to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> to anoint <HI>David,</HI> whom hee chose among all his brethren, the Lord saying unto him, <HI>Arise and anoint him, for this is h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>
<P>In the same booke, God promiseth <HI>Davi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to confirme his sonne upon his Throne.</P>
<P>And in the 1. of <HI>Kings,</HI> Chap. 3. God appea∣red to <HI>Salomon</HI> in a dreame in <HI>Gabaon,</HI> presently after his Coronation, and said unto him, <HI>Aske what thou wilt, that I give thee</HI>; A sufficient testi∣monie, that God was well pleased with his as∣cending
<PB N="171" REF="90"/>
to the Royall throne, and <HI>Salomon</HI> ask∣ing of him onely wisedome to governe his peo∣ple, God said, <HI>Because thou hast not asked of mee riches, glory, nor power, I will give thee what thou askest me, and other things besides.</HI></P>
<P>Wee reade 2. <HI>Kings,</HI> Chapter 9. that <HI>Heli∣seus</HI> sendeth one of the children of the Prophets to <HI>Iehu,</HI> one of <HI>Ahabs</HI> Captaines, to anoint him from the Lord King over <HI>Israel</HI> And <HI>Psal.</HI> 75.7. <HI>To come to preferment is neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South, but God is the Iudge, he it is that humbleth and exalteth.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>salm.</HI> 113.7 <HI>The Lord raiseth the needie out of the dust, and lifteth up the poore out of the dung, that hee may set him with the Princes, even with the Princes of his people:</HI> Wee might alledge many other examples, and proofes out of Scrip∣ture; but these are sufficient to proove our as∣sertion.</P>
<P>It is an erronious and damnable opinion to hold, that Kings come to the Crowne by fraud, force, or succession, without the Divine provi∣dence and sacred decree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 12.74.</NOTE> for one haire of our head falleth not, without the providence of God, much more a thing of so great a conse∣quence, as the establishing of a King over the Provinces of a Kingdome, and over so many millions of men, that are bound to sweare o∣bedience to him. I say not onely, that his comming to the Crowne is ordered by Gods generall providence; but moreover, that it is his speciall intention and designe, that
<PB N="172" REF="91"/>
made him ascend the Throne.</P>
<P>Let vs hearken to the wisedome of GOD, <HI>Prov.</HI> Chapter 8. &amp;c. after wee shall see if it be fraud, force, or succession, which are the cau∣ses, and wayes, by the which they ascend unto that dignity; <HI>By me</HI> (saith Christ, true God, co∣essentiall with his Father, under the name of that wisedome) <HI>Kings raigne, and Princes decree justice, By me Princes rule, and the Nobles, and all the Iudges of the earth.</HI></P>
<P>The Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> speaketh very pertinent∣ly and manifestly upon this subject, <HI>Chap.</HI> 45.1. <HI>Thus saith the Lord unto</HI> Cyrus <HI>his anointed, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him, therefore will I weaken the loynes of Kings, and open the doores before him, and the gates shall not be shut; I will goe before thee, and make the cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oked wayes streight, I will breake the brasen doores, and burst the iron barres; I girded thee, though thou hast not knowne me.</HI></P>
<P>The Prophet <HI>Ieremiah,</HI> Chap. 27. speaketh so openly, that hee alone is sufficient to stop those prophane and seditious mouthes. Thus saith the Lord of Hostes, <HI>I have given all these lands into the hand of</HI> Nebuchadnezzar, <HI>the King of Babel, my servant, and all nations shall serue him, and his sonne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and his sonnes sonne, and the nation▪ and Kingdome which will not serue the same</HI> Nebu∣chadnezzar <HI>King of Babel, and that put not their necke under the y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake of the King of Babel, the same nation will I visite</HI> (saith the Lord) <HI>with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, there∣fore
<PB N="173" REF="91"/>
heare not your Prophets, nor your Southsayers, nor your dreamers, nor your inchanters, nor your Sorce∣rers, which say unto you thus, Ye shall not serue the King of Babel, for they prophesie a lye unto you, to cause you to goe farre from your land, and that I should cast you out, and you should perish, but the na∣tion that put their necks under the yoake of the King of Babel, and serue him; those will I let remaine still in their owne land, saith the Lord, and they shall oc∣cupie it, and dwell therein.</HI></P>
<P>Words worthy of a great and profound con∣sideration, and which totally desides, and cuts off that question, which we now have in hand, for it is God himselfe that speaketh to his peo∣ple, that strictly chargeth them to obey the King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> into whose hands he had deli∣vered them; and although hee was an Idola∣trous and unfaithfull King, yet they will obey him, on paine of his curse and malediction; what judgements, what punishments should we much more cause to fall upon us, if the least thought of rebellion, or disobedience to the Lords anointed should enter into our mindes, if we were not perfectly obedient to Kings, who are good, faithfull, and zealous to further the glory of God, if our hearts and our mouthes be not alwayes filled with prayers, and vowes d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dicated to their service.</P>
<P>But to the end that imitating <HI>Hercules,</HI> wee may clense &amp; sweepe cleane this Augean stable, wee will answere to that objection propounded touching <HI>Nimrod,</HI> who hath been the first King
<PB N="174" REF="92"/>
of the earth, who (say they) hath attained to the crowne by force, and by violence, words which we finde not in the Scripture; but con∣trarily we read, <HI>Genes.</HI> 10.8. that <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> begat <HI>Nim∣rod,</HI> who began to be mighty in the earth, hee was a mighty Hunter before the Lord. These words will never oblige us to conclude, that hee hath raised himselfe violently; but wee may more truely expound the wordes, <HI>Hee was mighty before the Lord,</HI> that is, he was lifted up to greatnesse by the most High, hee walked in his wayes, and followed his ordinances; and when <HI>Moses</HI> saith, <HI>that he began to be mighty in the earth,</HI> he meaneth, that hee was more feared then his predecessours, who were also Kings, Priests, and soveraigne Princes of their families: For after the generall deluge, which overflowed the whole earth, men lived commonly five or sixe hundred yeares, and so one of his posterity might see aboue a hundred thousand persons, over whom he was Prince, and soveraigne Mo∣narch, because there was then no other forme of government in the earth; so we reade <HI>Genes.</HI> 23. Chap. that the Hittites, of whom <HI>Abraham</HI> asked a Sepulchre to bury <HI>Sara,</HI> these I say cal∣led him a Prince of God, or a most excellent Prince, which hee clearely manifested at the overthrow of the five Kings, which had beaten the King of <HI>Sodome,</HI> had pillaged the Towne, and carried away his Nephew <HI>Lot</HI> prisoner, for at the rumour of these sorrowfull newes, he ar∣med three hundred and eighteene of his ser∣vants
<PB N="175" REF="92"/>
borne in his house, and yet had no chil∣dren, <HI>Gen.</HI> 14.</P>
<P>It is then in vaine to alledge, that violence, craft, and hereditary succession, are the onely meanes to attaine to Crownes; for although some attaine to it by humane meanes, and some∣times by dangerous wayes, as <HI>Absalom,</HI> who caused himselfe to be anointed King by expel∣ling his Father, as <HI>Abimelech</HI> by the death of 70 of his brethren upon the same stone; yet for all these wayes to come to raigne, are never brought to passe, without a manifest fore-sight, and providence of God, permitting it some∣times to punish those peoples, and sometimes for a punishment to the Kings that raigne over them; yet whatsoever they be, God comman∣deth us to obey, and perfectly to honour them: now cursed, cursed be he that shall resist the will of God, and that shall not obey his commaun∣dements.</P>
<P>After we haue heard both Scripture, and rea∣son, manifestly evincing the truth, Let us now heare Saint <HI>Augustines</HI> opinion in this matter, in his booke <HI>De civit. Dei.</HI> The cause (saith he) of the greatnesse of Empires, is neither casuall, nor fatall, it commeth neither by chance, nor by destinie; By chance I understand (saith he) the things that happen; we not being able to know the causes of them, or that happen without any premeditated order of reason, assisting their conception and birth: By fatall things I under∣stand (as Pagans esteeme) what happeneth with∣out
<PB N="176" REF="93"/>
the will of God, and men, by the necessity of some particular order; which opinion is greatly injurious to Gods divine providence, but rather wee must certainely beleeve, that Kingdomes are constituted, and established simply, and absolutely by the divine provi∣dence of God.</P>
<P>And in another place, Let us not attribute the power of giving, or disposing of an Empire, but onely to the true God, that giveth eternall happinesse in heaven to his children onely; but for earthly Kingdomes, he giveth them to good and bad, as it seemeth good to him, as it plea∣seth him, who is delighted in no unjust thing; therefore this true and onely God, that alwayes provideth mankinde, both with ayde and coun∣sell, when he would, and as long as he pleased, hath given the governement, and Empire to the people of <HI>Rome</HI>; hee is the giver of all felicity, that giveth earthly Kingdomes to whom hee pleaseth, and yet alwayes with justice and rea∣son, though the meanes seeme to us oftentimes manifestly contrary to both.</P>
<P>I thinke we have employed too much time, and too many good weapons, to fight against this horrible monster, and monstrous Hydra, and therefore the shortest and surest way, is to follow the example of that valiant <HI>Hercules,</HI> and so to cut off this monster, for hee that will not heare the Scripture, so manifestly shewing unto us our duty to our Kings, that so expresly com∣mandeth us to yeeld unto them all obedience,
<PB N="177" REF="93"/>
hee that stoppeth his eares to those sweet and most gracious invitations of reason, and natu∣rall inclination, to honour and serue him, whom the bounty and will of GOD hath established over us; He who watcheth in labour, to make us sleepe in rest; Hee who sits on the throne to doe us right, that to ease us, beareth the burthen of all ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> affaires; and in a word, Hee whose minde is alwayes in trouble and anxiety, to pre∣serve the quietnesse of his people, and to keepe off the invasion and tyrannie of Strangers; those Subjects, I say, are worthy of all the misfor∣tunes, disasters, and calamities which can hap∣pen, through the privation of so good things.</P>
<P>But wee, who by the grace of GOD are brought up in his Schoole, that together with our mothers milke have sucked the honour, ser∣vice, and obedience which wee owe to our Kings and Princes; Let us not suffer those wic∣ked and dangerous plagues, to infect the purity of our hearts, and let not the whitenesse of our soules be spotted and defiled, by so blacke and venomous a crime, assuring our selves, that the least thought of disobedience and rebellion, which possesseth the minde; besides, that it is an evident token of an ungodly minde, is wor∣thy of the most severe punishments that can be imagined.</P>
<P>But let us shew, that we are begotten among the children of GOD, and regenerated by the Spirit of his grace, let our ambition never flye higher then to the execution of his sacred com∣mandements,
<PB N="178" REF="94"/>
wherein lyeth the fulnesse and centre of all delights, and of all felicity both spirituall and temporall, and since particularly he desireth, that we should feare him, and <HI>honour the King,</HI> which he hath established over us, see∣ing that in the accomplishment, and fulfilling of these two commandements, we have as it were the summe of all his law; let us be carefull to honour &amp; serve him, and to yeeld unto him all sorts of duties, for he is the Lords anointed, as∣suring our selves, that whilest we shall studie to yeeld unto him due ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dience, whilest we pray fervently for his long life, and prosperity, as we are in duty bound, God for his part will make good unto us his promises; to wit, to make us enjoy a delightfull rest, and an admirable con∣tentment, to blesse the land wherein we dwell, to multiply our dayes upon it, in joy and feli∣city, and after we shall have served, obeyed, and and honoured the King, hee will call us unto eternall felicity, to crowne us with the incor∣ruptible Crowne of glory, that seated with the 24 Elders, in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> we may with them cast downe our crownes before him, who is set on the Throne, to sing before him altogether: O Lord, thou art worthy to receive honour, blessing, and glory; to thee therefore, O eter∣nall, immortall, admirable, to thee onely wise God, Creator of all things, be ascribed all ho∣nour, glory, and magnificence, now and for evermore. <HI>Amen, Amen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="94"/>O Almighty God, and soveraigne Monarch of the whole world, who hast by thy in∣comprehensible vertue created all things, both in heaven and earth, that by thy fore-sight and wonderfull providence, doest conduct and go∣verne with so great wisedome, and with so beautifull, good, and just order, all thy crea∣tures, that the contemplation thereof ravisheth us in admiration, and forceth the wicked and Atheists to confesse, that the disposition so ad∣mirable of the starres, the swift motions of the heavens, the constant diversity of the seasons, happen not by chance, nor hazard, but that there must be some first and Soveraigne mover, to turne those great Spheres, some great Cap∣taine, to set in order the whole hoast of heaven, and to make the seasons march in their order; this order I say so exactly observed, openeth thy childrens mouthes, and maketh them say with the Royall Prophet <HI>David, The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy worke.</HI></P>
<P>Of God of peace, that hatest confusion, and disorder, graunt us (if such be thy good plea∣sure) the grace to obey thy lawes, and to follow in all things thy holy and divine ordinances, and since thou shewest here unto us one of the wayes, leading to the mountaine of thy holi∣nesse, to the spirituall <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> to wit, this com∣mandement which thou makest here unto us, to <HI>Honour our King:</HI> give us the grace, O loving
