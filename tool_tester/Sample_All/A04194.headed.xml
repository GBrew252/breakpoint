<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HO∣NOVRABLE
AND TRVLY
noble WILLIAM Earle of Penbrooke,
Lord high Steward of his Majesties
Houshold, Knight of the most noble
Order of the Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, and Chancel∣lor
of the Vniversity
of Oxon;
The blessings of this life, and of the
life to come be multiplied.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Ad the consciousnesse of
my weaknesse left any
place for expectation
that my poore Labours
should have found such
benigne acceptāce with
men of higher place and
judgement, as by the report of Honourable
personages, and mine owne late experience
of your noble favours, some of them I
now perceive have found with your Ho∣nour,
<PB REF="3"/>
these present papers had come to crave
your patronage in a better dresse than now
they doe. Besides the consciousnesse of my
inabilities to please the acurate judgements
of this age, want of opportunities for these
many yeares to give my selfe that content∣ment,
which I was once bold to promise
unto my selfe, had almost deterred me from
publishing any part of my former labours,
which were not popular, and for the Pul∣pit,
of which ranke this present Treatise is
not. The subject or matter of it is Acade∣micall,
and was conceived in that famous
Nurserie of all good literature, which for
these many yeares hath flourished, and ma∣ny
more may it flourish under your Hono∣rable
patronage. If either these, or other of
my Labours of the like argument, which
tooke their first being from the benignity of
that soile, may finde acceptance with your
Lordship, I shall need no other Apologie
for publishing them beside my unfaigned
desire to leave the Christian world a testi∣monie
of that high esteeme which I have
ever made of your Honourable favours to
<PB REF="3"/>
that renowned Vniversity, and of my
thankfulnesse for my particular interest in
your generall goodnesse. If this manifesta∣tion
of my weaknesse may occasion other
Academickes to shew their strength in this
and like Arguments, it shall be a great part
of my joy and comfort to see better fruits of
your Lordships favour brought forth by
others, than I can present unto you. But
if these may finde that acceptance which I
most desire, your Lordship will haply bee
deemed by some, to patronize not my
weaknesse onely, but mine errors. It is not
so unusuall, nor so much for mee to be cen∣sured
for an <HI>Arminian,</HI> as it will be for your
Lordship to be thought to patronize <HI>Armi∣nianisme.</HI>
To give your Lordship that satis∣faction
therefore in this point, which I am
not bound to give unto others; If the man
which most mislikes the <HI>Arminian</HI> or <HI>Luthe∣ran</HI>
doctrine in the points most controver∣ted
through reformed Churches, will but
agree with me in these two, <HI>That the Al∣mighty
Creator hath a true freedome in doing
good; and Adams off-spring a true freedome of</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
<HI>doing evill;</HI> I shall not dissent from him in
any other points controverted, unlesse it be
in this one, that there needs to be no other
controversie at all betweene the <HI>Arminians</HI>
and their opposites in point of Gods Pro∣vidence
and Predestination. In all other
particulars, save onely so farre as they are re∣ducible
to these two, I have not yet the lear∣ning
or understanding to conceive, what
contradiction there is or can bee, betweene
men not willing to contend about words.
But if any in opposition to <HI>Arminius,</HI> will
maintaine that all things were so decreed by
God before the Creation of the world; that
nothing since the Creation could have fal∣len
out otherwise than it hath done, or
that nothing can bee amended what is a∣misse,
I must crave pardon of every good
Christian to oppugne his opinion, not as
an errour onely in Divinity, but as an igno∣rance
which involveth enmity to the
sweet disposition of the All-seeing and un∣erring
Providence; as a forerunner of ruine
to most flourishing States and Kingdomes
where it growes common, or comes to full
<PB REF="4"/>
height. For supplanting or preventing the
growth of such opinions, I make bold to
crave your Lordships patronage. Thus
with my continuall praiers for your Lord∣ships
health, with all increase of honor and
happinesse, I humbly take my leave.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He originall of Atheisme, of
errours, or misperswasions,
concerning the Beeing, or
Attributes of the Divine
Nature, being in a former
Treatise at large discussed;
the next enquiries, which
exact Method would in this
Argument make, are, First,
how this truth of <HI>Gods being,</HI> most certainly known,
by internall experience unto some, may by force of
speculative Argument bee made manifest unto
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
others. Secondly, how his nature and <HI>attributes</HI> may
be fitliest resembled.</P>
<P>My first resolution professed in the beginning of
the discussing of the <HI>originall</HI> of <HI>Atheisme,</HI> as yet re∣straines
me for adventuring too farre in the former.
For whilest I view the progresse which I have pur∣posed;
to debate this point, upon my first entry in∣to
that Paradise of contemplation, (within whose
territories I now encampe) by syllogisticall force
of argument, seemeth to me as great an oversight,
as to entertaine an enemy, more desperate then po∣tent,
with a pitched battaile, when as all his forts
might, by constant prosequution of advantages
gotten, be orderly taken, each after other, without
possibility of any great losse, or apparent danger.
Now the Atheists chiefe strength lying in a pre∣conceived
impossibility of a <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Resurrec∣tion,</HI>
the conquest of the whole truth will easily bee
compassed, after those weake holds bee (as in due
time they shall be) utterly demolished. Or in case,
after their overthrow, he be of force to bid us bat∣taile,
we shall be most willing to try our intended
quarrell with him by dint of argument, in the Ar∣ticle
of the last Iudgement. In the meane time, wee
may, without danger of his checke, proceed upon
those advantages, which the grounds of nature
give us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How far we may seeke to expresse what by light of Na∣ture,
or otherwayes, may be conceived concerning
the incomprehensible Essence, or his Attributes.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Irst, if every particular man, or bodie
generable, have precedent causes of
their beings; their whole generations
must of necessity have some cause: o∣therwise
all should not be of one kinde
or nature. Now this progresse from effects unto
their causes, or betwixt causes subordinate, cannot
be infinite: but as all progressive motion supposeth
some rest or stay, whence it proceedeth, so must
this progresse, whereof I speake, take beginning
from some cause, which hath no cause of its being.
And this is that incomprehensible Essence, which
wee seeke.</P>
<P>2 But whereunto shall wee liken him? Things
compared alwayes agree in some one kind, or have
(at least) a common measure. Is then this cause of
causes contained in any predicamentall <HI>ranck</HI> of be∣ing?
Or can our conceipt of any thing therein con∣tained,
be truly fitted unto him? Or may his infi∣nite
and incomprehensible nature be rightly moul∣ded
within the circumference of mans shallow
braine? One thing it is to represent the infinite Es∣sence,
another to illustrate this truth, that <HI>he</HI> cannot
be represented. Though nothing can exactly re∣semble
<HI>him,</HI> yet some things there be which better
notifie how farre <HI>he</HI> is beyond all resemblance or
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
comparison, then others can doe. By variety of
such resemblances as his works afford, may our ad∣miration
of his incomprehensiblenesse bee raised
higher and higher, and with our admiration thus
raised, will our longing after his presence still be en∣larged.
The nature of things finite and limited, no
Philosopher can so exactly expresse, as Painters
may their outward lineaments. But as some sensible
objects, besides their proper shape or character,
imprint a kinde of dislike or pleasance in creatures
sensitive: so have our purest and most exact con∣ceipts
intellectuall certaine symptomaticall impres∣sions
annexed, which inwardly affect us; though
we cannot outwardly so expresse them, as they may
imprint the like affection in others. Hence it is that
the more right resemblances we make to our selves
of any thing, the greater will be the symptomati∣call
impression of the latent truth; some part or
shadow whereof appeareth in every thing, where∣to
it can truly be compared. And though we can∣not
in this life come to a cleare view of that <HI>nature,</HI>
which we most desire to see; yet is it a worke wor∣thy
our paines, to erect our thoughts, by varietie
of resemblances (made with due observance of <HI>de∣corum)</HI>
unto an horizon more ample then ordinary;
in whose skirts or edges, wee may behold some
scattered rayes of that glorious light, which is ut∣terly
set unto men, whose thoughts soare not with∣out
the circumference of this visible world; for all
we see with ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bodily eyes, is but an hemisphere
of midnight darknesse, to the habitation of Saints,
and seat o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> blisse.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="9"/>
3 The rule of <HI>decorum</HI> in all resemblances of
things amiable or glorious is, that as well the <HI>sim∣ple</HI>
termes of comparison be sightly and handsome,
as the proportion betweene them exact. Supposing
the ods of valorous strength betweene <HI>Aiax</HI> and or∣dinary
<HI>Trojanes,</HI> to have beene as great, as <HI>Homer</HI>
would have us beleeve it was; the manner of this
Champions retreat, being overcharged with the
multitude of his Enemies, could not more exqui∣sitely
be resembled, than by a company of children,
driving an hungry hard-skinned Asse with bats or
staves out of a corne-field or meadow. The Asse
cannot, by such weaklings, be driven so hard, but he
will feed as he goes; nor could <HI>Aiax</HI> be charged so
fiercely by his impotent foes, but that he fought
still as he fled. The proportion is approved, as most
exact, by a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><L>Nec dictis erit ullus bonos, si cum actus ab urbe</L>

<P>4 But wee must allow the Poet (whose chiefe
art is to please his Readers appetite with pleasant
sauces, more then with solid meates,) to bee more
dainty and curious in this kinde, than it is requisite
the School-divine or Philosopher should be: albeit
neither of them need much to feare, lest their dis∣courses
be too comely, so solidity of truth bee the
ground of their comelinesse. No courtly Poet is
more observant of the former rule of <HI>decorum</HI> in
their comparisons, than the holy Prophets are.
<HI>Thus hath the Lord spoken unto mee</HI> (saith <HI>Esaias,
cap. 31. vers. 4.) Like as the Lion, and the young Lion
roring on his prey, when a multitude of shepheards
is called forth against him, hee will not bee afraid of
their voice, nor abase himselfe for the noise of them:
so shall the Lord of hosts come downe to fight for
mount Sion, and for the hill thereof.</HI> Saint<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Et hic quidem omnium morbus est trium gene∣rum quae proposui: &amp; eorum scili∣cet qui se∣cundum corpus de Deo sapi∣unt, &amp; eo∣rum qui se∣cundum spi∣ritualem creaturam sicuti est a∣nima; &amp; eorum qui ne{que} secun∣dum corpus, ne{que} secun∣dū spiritua∣lē creaturā, et tamen de Deo falsa existimant: eo remotiores à vero, quo id quod sapiunt, nec in corpore reperitur, nec in facto &amp; condito spi∣ritu, nec in ipso creatore.

hath noted three sorts of errors in setting forth the
divine nature: of which, two go upon false grounds,
the other is altogether groundlesse. Some (saith he)
there be that seeke to measure things spirituall by
the best knowledge which they have gotten (by
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
sence or art) of things bodily. Others doe fit the
Deity with the nature and properties of the hu∣mane
soule, and from this false ground frame many
deceiptfull and crooked rules, whilest they endea∣vour
to draw the picture or image of the immu∣table
Essence. A third sort there be, which by too
much straining to transcend every mutable crea∣ture,
patch up such conceipts, as cannot possibly
hang together, either upon created or increated na∣tures,
and these rove further from the truth then
doe the former. As (to use his instance) He which
thinkes God to be bright or yellow, is much de∣ceived;
yet his errour wants not a <HI>cloke,</HI> in as much
as these colours have some being (from God) in
bodies. His errour againe is as great, that thinkes
God sometimes forgets, and sometimes cals things
forgotten to minde; yet this vicissitude of memo∣rie
and oblivion, hath place in the humane soule,
which in many things is like the Creator. But hee
which makes the Divine nature so powerfull, as to
produce or beget it selfe, quite misseth not the
marke onely, but the Butt, and shoots (as it were)
out of the field: for nothing possible can possibly
give it selfe being or existence.</P>
<P>5 But though in no wise wee may avouch such
grosse impossibilities of <HI>him,</HI> to whom nothing is
impossible; yet must we often use fictions or suppo∣sitions
of things scarce possible, to last so long till
we have moulded <HI>conceipts</HI> of the Essence and At∣tributes
incomprehensible, more lively and sem∣blable,
then can be taken either from the humane
soule alone, or from bodies naturall. To main∣taine
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
it as a Philosophical truth, that <HI>God is the soule
of this universe,</HI> is an impious errour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In the 5. Book, Sec∣tion 3.</NOTE> before con∣demned,
as a grand seminary of Idolatry. Yet by
imagining the humane soule to be as really existent
in every place, whereto the cogitations of it can
reach, as it is in our bodies, or rather to exercise
the same motive power over the greatest bodily
substance in this world, that it doth over our fin∣gers,
able to weild the Heavens or Elements with
as great facility and speed, as we doe our thoughts
or breath: We may, by this fiction, gaine a more

But whilest we thus, by imagination, transfuse
our conceipts of the best life and motion, which
we know, into this great Sphere, which we see, or
(which sute better to the immutable and infinite
essence) into bodies abstract or mathematicall: we
must make such a compound as <HI>Tacitus</HI> would have
made of two noble Romanes: <HI>Demptis utriusque
vitiis solae virtutes misceantur: The imperfections of
both being sifted from them, their perfections onely
must be ingredients in this compound.</HI> Yet may we
not thinke, that the divine nature, which we seeke
to expresse by them, consists of perfections infinite,
so united or compounded. We must yet use a fur∣ther
extraction of our conceits, ere wee apply
them to his incomprehensible nature.</P>

themselves: which were
they as well opened and drawne, as some others of

caries us to an independant cause; from whose illi∣mited
<HI>essence</HI> and <HI>nature,</HI> the later affords us an ocu∣lar
or visible derivation of those generall attributes,
whereof faith infused giveth us the true taste and

<HI>[Whatsoever hath limits or bounds of being, hath
some distinct cause or author of being.]</HI> As impossible
it is, any thing should take limits of being, as begin∣ning
of being from it selfe. For beginning of being
is one <HI>especiall limit</HI> of being.</P>
<P>2 This Maxime is simply convertible, <HI>[What∣soever
hath cause of being hath also limits of being.]</HI>
because it hath beginning of being: for <HI>[Omnis

Every cause is the active beginning or begin∣ner
of being, and an <HI>active beginning</HI> essentially in∣cludes
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
a beginning passive, as fashionable to it, as
the marke or impression is to the stampe. Or in
plainer English, thus; <HI>Where there is a beginning or

cause is prae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xistent in time, the distinction or li∣mits
of things caused or begun, are as easily seene
as the divers surfaces of bodies severed in place. But
where the cause hath onely precedence of nature
and not of time, (as it falleth out in things caused
by concomitance or resultance,) the limits or con∣fines
of their being seeme confounded, or as hardly
distinguishable as the divers surfaces of two bodies
glued together. Yet as wee rightly gather that if
the bodies be of severall kindes, each hath its pro∣per
surface, though the point of distinction bee in∣visible
to our eyes: so whatsoever we conceive to
have dependance upon another, wee necessarily
conceive it to have proper limits of being, or at least
a distinct beginning of being from the other,
though as it were ingrafted in it. But whether we
conceive effects and causes distinctly as they are in
nature, or in grosse, so long as wee acknowledge
them (this or that way conceived) to be finite and
limited, wee must acknowledge some cause of their
limitation, which (as we suppose) cannot be distinct
from the cause of their being.</P>
<P>3 Why men in these dayes are not Gyants,
why Gyants, in former, were but men, are two
Problems which the meere naturalist could easily
assoyle by this reason, for substance one and the
same. The vigour of causes productive or conser∣vative
of vegetables, of man especially, from which
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
he receiveth nutrition and augmentation, is lesse
now then it hath beene at least before the Flood;
though but finite and limited, when it was greatest.
Why vegetables of greatest vigour, ingrosse not
the properties of others lesse vigorous, but rest
contented with a greater numericall measure of
their owne specificall vertues; is, by the former
reason as plaine. For in that they have not their
being from themselves, they can take no more then
is given; nor can the natures whence they are pro∣pagated,
convey them a better title of <HI>being,</HI> then
themselves have. This as the seale communicates
his fashion to the waxe, so doth the limited force
or vertue of causes, alwayes imprint bounds and li∣mits
upon their effects. If further it be demanded,
why the Elements having the opportunity of mu∣tuall
vicinity, to wreake their naturall enmities or
hostilities, doe not each trespasse more grievously
upon other; as why the restlesse or raging water
swallowes not up the dull earth, which cannot flye
from any wrong or violence offered; or why the
Heavens, having so great a prerogative by height of
place, largenesse of compasse, and indefatigable
motion, do not dispossesse the higher Elements of
their seat? The naturalist would plead the warrant
of Natures Charter, which had set them their
distinct bounds and limits by an everlasting undis∣pensable
law. Yet is nature in his language alwaies
an internall or essentiall part of some bodies, within
which it is necessarily confined. As the <HI>nature</HI> of
the Heavens hath not so much as liberty of egresse
into neighbour Elements, nor the proper <HI>formes</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
of these, (upon what exigence or assaults soever
made against them in their territories,) so much as
right of removall or <HI>flitting</HI> into lower Elements.
Or, in case it be pretended that these particular na∣tures,
have a <HI>nature</HI> more <HI>generall</HI> for their <HI>presi∣dent;</HI>
yet this, whether one above the rest, or an
aggregation onely of all the rest, is still confined to
this visible world, and both so <HI>hidebound</HI> with the
utmost sphere, that they cannot grow greater or
enlarge their strength. So that nature taken in what
sense the Naturalist lists, cannot be said so properly
to set bounds or limits to bodies naturall, as to bee
bounded or limited in them. Or to speake more
properly, Nature her selfe did not make, but is that
very domestique law, by which they are bounded,
and therefore, in no case, can dispense with it. And
in that she is a law, (for the most part, but not abso∣lutely
indispensable) shee necessarily supposeth a
<HI>Lawgiver;</HI> who, if he have no Law set him by any
superiour (as we must of necessity come in <HI>fine</HI> to
some one in this kinde supreame) <HI>hee</HI> can have no
such limits or bounds, as he hath set to nature, and
things naturall. <HI>He</HI> neither is any part of this visible
frame, which we see, nor can he be inclosed within
the utmost sphere. And thus by following the issue
of the former fountaine, we are arived in the latter,
which fully discovered, opens it selfe into a bound∣lesse
Ocean. <HI>Whatsoever hath no cause of being can
have no limits or bounds of being.</HI></P>
<P>4 And Being, may bee <HI>limited</HI> or <HI>illimited</HI> two
wayes: Either for number of kindes and natures
contained in it, or for quantity and intensive per∣fection
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
of every severall kinde. Of things visible,
we see the most perfect are but perfect in some one
kinde, they possesse not the entire perfection of o∣thers;
and that perfection, whereof they have the
just propriety, is not actually infinite, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> finite and
limited. Whatsoever thus is, it was as possible for
it not to have beene, and is as possible for it not to
be, as to be but of this or that kinde, not all <HI>that is,</HI>
or hath <HI>being.</HI> Even those substances which we call
immortall, as the heaven of heavens, with all their
inhabitants, be they Angels or Archangels, Princi∣palities
or Thrones, enjoy the perpetuall tenour
of their actuall existence, not from their <HI>essence,</HI>
but from the decree of their Maker. <HI>Manent cuncta
non quia aeterna sunt, sed quia defenduntur curâ re∣gentis.
Immortalia tutore non egent, haec conservat
artifex, fragilitatem materiae vi sua vincens.</HI> Seneca
Epist. 58. <HI>All things continue in being, not because
they are eternall, but because they are defended by the
providence of their Governour. Things immortall
need no guardian or protector. But the maker of all
things preserveth these things</HI> (which we see conti∣nue
in being) <HI>overmatching the frailty of the matter
by his power.</HI> In this mans philosophy nothing
which is made, can be by nature immortall, though
many things be perpetually preserved from perish∣ing.
Nothing which is immortall, can bee made.

But that things made out of the matter, or
made at all, could be immortall by nature, he rightly
affirmed. For to be immortall in his language, is to
be without beginning, without dependance. And
what so is, hath an eternall necessity of existence.
Absolute necessity of existence, or <HI>impossibility</HI> of
non-existence, or of not being alwayes what it is,
and as it is, implies an absolute necessity of <HI>being</HI> or
of <HI>existence</HI> infinite; which cannot reside save only
in the totality or absolute fulnesse of all <HI>being</HI> pos∣sible.
The greatest fulnesse of finite existence con∣ceiveable,
cannot reach beyond al possibility of non-existence,
nor can possibility of non-existence, and
perpetuall actuall existence, be indissolubly wedded
in any finite nature, save only by his infinite power,
who essentially is, or whose <HI>essence</HI> is to exist, or to
be the inexhaustible fountaine of all <HI>being.</HI> The ne∣cessary
supposall, or acknowledgement of such an
<HI>infinite</HI> or <HI>essentially existent power,</HI> cannot more
strongly or more perspicuously be inferred, than by
the reduction of known effects unto their causes, &amp;
of these causative entities (whose number and ranks
are finite) into one prime essence, whence al of them
are derived; it self being underivable frō any cause,
or essence conceivable. In that <HI>this prime essence</HI> hath
no cause of being, it can have no beginning of be∣ing.
And yet is <HI>beginning</HI> of <HI>being,</HI> the first &amp; prime
limit of being, without whose precedence, other
<HI>bounds</HI> or <HI>limits</HI> of <HI>being,</HI> cannot follow.</P>
<P>5 If that which Philosophers suppose to be the
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
root of incorruption in the heavens, can brooke no
limits of duration, but must bee imagined without
end or beginning; why should it content it selfe
with limits of extension? seeing duration is but a
kinde of extension, seeing motion, magnitude, and
time, by their rules in other cases, hold exact pro∣portion.
Things caused (as induction manifesteth)
are alwayes limited and moulded in their proper
causes. Nor are there two causes (much lesse two
causalities,) one of their being, another of their li∣mitation
or restraint to this or that set kinde of <HI>be∣ing.</HI>
For whatsoever gives being to any thing,
gives it the <HI>beginning</HI> of being. As <HI>Sophroniscus</HI>
was the true cause why <HI>Socrates</HI> was in that age
wherein he lived, not before or after; why he was
a man not a beast, an Athenian, not a Barbarian.
<HI>Quicquid dat formam, dat omnia consequentia for∣mam:
whatsoever gives forme of being to any thing,
gives all the appurtenances to the forme:</HI> is a Physi∣call
Maxime which supposeth another Metaphysi∣call,
<HI>Quicquid dat esse, dat proprietates esse:</HI> That
which gives being unto any thing, gives likewise
the properties of such being as it hath. Now limits
of being, are essentiall properties of that essence or
being, wherin they are found. And distinct bounds
or limits are included in the distinct <HI>forme</HI> of <HI>being,</HI>
which every thing hath from its cause. Actuall
essence or existence it selfe, is distributed to every
thing that hath cause of being, as it were sealed up
in its proper <HI>forme</HI> or <HI>kind</HI> of being. It is as possible
to put a new fashion upon <HI>nothing,</HI> as for any thing
that is, to take limits or set <HI>forme</HI> of being from <HI>no∣thing.</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
That which hath nothing to give it <HI>being,</HI>
can have nothing to give it limits or bounds of be∣ing.
And as no entity can take its <HI>being,</HI> or begin∣ning
of <HI>being</HI> from it selfe; so neither can it take
bounds or limits from it selfe, but must have them
from some other. The prime essence or first cause
of all things that are, as it hath no precedent cause
of <HI>existence,</HI> nor can it be cause of <HI>existence</HI> to it self;
so neither can it have any cause of limits without it
selfe, nor can it be any cause of limits to it selfe. It
remaines then, that it must bee an <HI>essence</HI> illimited,
and thus to be without bounds or limits, is the <HI>for∣mall</HI>
effect or consequence of <HI>being</HI> it <HI>selfe,</HI> or of
<HI>that</HI> which <HI>truly is,</HI> without any cause precedent to
give it <HI>being,</HI> or make it what <HI>it is.</HI></P>
<P>6 So essentially is the <HI>conceipt</HI> of <HI>being without
bounds or limits,</HI> included in our <HI>conceipt</HI> of being
without cause precedent, that if we should, by way
of supposition, give any imaginary entity leave to
take beginning or possession of being from it selfe,
without the warrant of any cause precedent to ap∣point
or measure it out some distinct portion or
<HI>forme</HI> of <HI>being:</HI> thus much being once by imagina∣tion
granted, wee could not (by any imagination
possible) debarre this entity from absolute necessi∣ty
of being for ever after whatsoever it listed to be,
or from being all things, rather than any one thing.</P>
<P>Of the Heathens, many did hold an uncreated
<HI>Chaos</HI> praeexistent to the <HI>frame</HI> of this Vniverse:
and Philosophers, to this day, maintaine an ingene∣rable
matter, which actually is not any body, but
indifferent to be made every body. Let us but sup∣pose;
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
First the one, or other of them to be as <HI>Ho∣mogeneall</HI>
in it selfe, as the ayre or water: Secondly,
to be able to <HI>actuate,</HI> or <HI>Proteus-like</HI> to transforme
it selfe into a better state than now it hath, without
the helpe of any agent or efficient; and then, as it
could have no cause, so can there bee no reason gi∣ven,
to restraine it from taking all bodily perfection
<HI>possible</HI> to it selfe. And if it bee true, which some
teach, that this prime <HI>matter</HI> hath neither proper
quantity nor quality, what should hinder it to take
both without measure, supposing it might bee its
one <HI>carver</HI> of those endowments? Or imagine
there were such a vacuity, where the world now is,
as we Christians beleeve there was before it was
made, and onely one of <HI>Democritus</HI> casuall <HI>Atoms,</HI>
or some meere <HI>possibility</HI> or <HI>appetite</HI> of the <HI>matter,</HI>
left free, <HI>venire in vacuum,</HI> to give it selfe full and
perfect <HI>act</HI> without curbe or restraint of any superi∣our
power or sharer to cry <HI>halfe mine</HI> with it, or
make claime to the nature of any actuall entity lost;
<HI>it</HI> being supposed to be able to take any one nature
upon it, what should either hinder or further it, to
assume the nature of earth, rather than of water, or
of these two, rather than of any other Element, or
of any simple bodies, rather than of mixt or com∣pounded
substances, or of bodily substances, rather
than spirituall, or of all these, rather than of their
metaphysicall <HI>eminences,</HI> and <HI>perfections?</HI> Or whilst
we imagine <HI>it,</HI> without cause of existence or begin∣ning,
no reason imaginable could confine <HI>it</HI> to any
set place of residence or extension: no cause could
bee alledged why it should take possession of the
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
<HI>center,</HI> rather than of the circumference of this V∣niverse,
as now it stands, or of both these rather
than of the whole sphere, or of the whole sphere
rather than of all extensive space imaginable. Only
the very supposition of taking beginning though
without cause, doth put a limit to its duration;
because this kinde of beginning, being but imagi∣nary,
depends upon our imagination, as upon its
true cause. And yet even thus considered, me thinks
it should extend its existence both waies, and draw
a circular duration to the instant where it beginnes.
Or (not imagining the beginning) let us imagine it
only to have true present being without any cause
precedent to push it forward, or superiour guide to
appoint it a set course; and it is not within the
compasse of imagination, why the duration of it
should not reach as farre the one way as the other.
as farre beyond all imagination of time past, as of
time to come, why it should not comprehend all
duration imaginable by way of present possession,
or supereminent permanency, without admission
of any deflux, division, or succession, for continua∣tion
of its existence.</P>
<P>7 If it bee objected, that any thing may follow
from supposition or imagination of impossibilities,
the reply is easie. The objection is either false, or
true in a sense, which no way impeacheth, but ra∣ther
approves that kinde of arguing. True it is,
there is almost nothing in nature so impossible, as
it may not be the possible consequent of some im∣possibility
supposed or granted: but of every par∣ticular
impossibility supposed or imagined, the pos∣sible

that is, they are what they are, by participation of
his Essence, who onely <HI>is,</HI> who alone comprehends
all things.</P>
<P>2 Of the greatest Angell which he hath created,
or of the most noble intelligent Spirit which the
<PB N="23" REF="18"/>
Philosophers imagined, were he present, or did we
know the place of his residence, we might without
wrong say, <HI>This</HI> Angell, or <HI>yonder Intelligence;</HI> or
speake of either, as of a numerable part, though a
principall one of this Vniverse. For though his
<HI>nature</HI> be much more perfect then ours is, and <HI>hee</HI>
according to the perfection of his nature, much
more excellent then his fellow Angels are: his per∣fections
neverthelesse have their bounds and limits,
not uncapable of these demonstrative signes, <HI>This,
Here,</HI> or <HI>Yonder, &amp;c.</HI> He neither containes the spe∣cificall
perfection of our nature, nor the <HI>numericall</HI>
of his Fellowes, within the measure of his perfecti∣on.
In his kind then <HI>he</HI> is most perfect, yet is he not
that <HI>perfection</HI> which he hath in him, but the recep∣tacle
of it; And if he have perfection onely in him,
without being himselfe perfection, <HI>Quid habet quod
non accepit? All</HI> he hath must bee <HI>participated or
borrowed</HI> from perfection it selfe. And of his bor∣rowed
perfections, <HI>one</HI> neither properly is <HI>another,</HI>
nor are all or any of them, what he is. His power is
not the same that his wisedome is; his wisedome is
not his goodness, nor his goodnesse his life. Sathan
and his Angels have life, though they have lost their
goodnesse; and their power to practise, is lesse than
their wit to plot mischiefe and villany. The best,
the wisest, or mightiest of those immortall Spirits,
which kept their stations, is not able, either by his
meere power to give being to things that are not,
or life to livelesse creatures; his wisedome cannot
inspire wisedome into creatures indued with life;
his goodnesse is no fountaine whence grace may
<PB N="24" REF="19"/>
be derived into the heart of man. But when we say
<HI>God is one,</HI> or <HI>God onely is,</HI> in this indivisible unity,
we include all multiplicity. Nor can wee say more
of him in fewer words than <HI>Seneca</HI> hath done; <HI>Est
totum quod vides, &amp; totum quod non vides: Hee is
the absolute totality of all and every part of being or
perfection, which we see in things visible, or conceive
in substances invisible.</HI></P>
<P>3 By the same analogy of speech that wee say a
<HI>statue,</HI> or <HI>picture,</HI> though made after life, is, no true
man; we are bound to say, and thinke, that no crea∣ture
(the best of which is but the image of God;
his being, at the best, but participated) truly is. It is
their chiefe grace to be true shadows of true <HI>being.</HI>
O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as it is usuall with Divines to enstyle Christ, the
<HI>true Samuel, David himselfe,</HI> the <HI>right Salomon,</HI> the
<HI>onely Sampson:</HI> not that they thinke the stories of
those mens lives, were onely faigned legends for
good example, (or that no such persons had ever
truly beene,) but because they did foreshadow one
far more excellent, than themselves, in whom that
was really and fully exhibited, which was only pre∣figured
in them. So we say God <HI>alone</HI> Is, because
the totality and fulnesse of that being is in him,
whose representation is in his creatures. Thus
much is included in all those sacred passages, wher∣in
he saith of himselfe, <HI>I am He, I am God, and there
is none besides.</HI> Thus much many comments yet
extant in the Ancient Philosophy of the Heathens,
being compared with these texts, would fully in∣forme
us.</P>
<P>4 The Stoicks appropriate the name of <HI>essence</HI> unto
<PB N="25" REF="19"/>
God, &amp; unto the <HI>matter,</HI> which they foolishly con∣ceive
to be coeternall with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Sene∣cam Ep. 58. &amp; Muretū in annot.</NOTE> able to overmatch
the benignity of his active power, by its passive un∣towardlinesse.
How ever, they held nothing wor∣thy
the title of Essence, which was not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>in∣dependently
everlastingly. Plotines</HI> Philosophy was
more divine, unlesse perhaps he gave too much to
his <HI>Demoniacall</HI> or Angelicall spirits, as many o∣thers,
not conceiving any creation but out of the
matter praeexistent, seeme to allot a kinde of inde∣pendent
<HI>Being</HI> to immateriall substances. An error
easie to have beene checkt, had the favourers of it
beene put in mind, that these their <HI>demi-gods</HI> by ne∣cessary
consequence of this opinion, must have
beene acknowledged infinite in Being. Whereas
the true notion of such infinitie, by the apparent
grounds of true Philosophy, is onely proper, onely
possible unto One; because it entirely includeth <HI>all</HI>
that can be; and, All, absolutely excludes all plu∣rality.
From this principle rightly sounded, did
<HI>Plato</HI> deny things sensible truly to be, or (as <HI>Seneca</HI>
paraphrases upon his Text) they make a <HI>shew</HI> only,
or put on a countenance of being for a time, being
uncapable of the stability or solidity of true <HI>being.</HI>
So far was this divine Philosopher from their here∣fie,
which acknowledged an independent <HI>being</HI> in
immateriall substances, that (to the Aristotelicall
Christian his shame)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Dijs à se factis pro∣misit Deus non factus immortali∣tatem; quod impossible est, se dixit esse factu∣rum.

many or great soever, the parts of multitude were, in
<PB N="27" REF="20"/>
his opiniō, they <HI>truly were not,</HI> in respect of that uni∣tie,
whence they had their originall. That speech of
this sage Philosopher, <HI>Omnia unum sunt,</HI> which <HI>A∣ristotle,</HI>
in the first entry into his new Philosophy,
stumbles at as a Paradoxe, was an orthodoxall prin∣ciple
of true Divintie. <HI>Parmenides</HI> meant the same
that <HI>Plato</HI> did, (perhaps better) although he exprest
his meaning in a poeticall manner, more apt to bee
mistaken, though rightly taken, more magnificent
and much apter to occasion admiration. The
speech it selfe will naturally beare this construction,
Multitude of things visible, is but the multiplyed
shadow of invisible independent unitie: things
sensible, or by imagination numerable, are but so
many severall representations of his incomprehen∣sible
being, who <HI>is one;</HI> not as one is part of multi∣tude,
<PB N="28" REF="21"/>
yet most truly One, because indivisible and un∣multipliable,
as wanting nothing, as most entirely
possessing <HI>all</HI> that can accrue by multiplication:
most truly One, because He onely is, and unto his
being nought can be added, nought detracted from
it, by the increase or diminution of other beings.
Or in <HI>Parmenides</HI> meaning, He so <HI>is,</HI> that if al things
numerable should lose that being which they have,
or be annihilated, all might be found againe in <HI>him,</HI>
and be restored with <HI>Iobs</HI> restitution, to their won∣ted
estate, without diminution of his soveraigne
<HI>being.</HI> For whatsoever now is, heretofore hath bin,
or can be extant, besides <HI>Him;</HI> hath a more excel∣lent
manner of being, treasured up in his eternall
and infinite Essence, than may with safety be com∣mitted
to its owne charge or custody.</P>
<P>6 Happy had it beene for <HI>Aristotle</HI> himselfe, and
not amisse for us, if <HI>he</HI> had imployed his extraordi∣nary
talent of wit, in setting forth that infinite trea∣sure
of wisdome, whence he received it; or spent his
daies in contēplation of that unity, whēce al things
whereof he wrote, had their beginning, rather thā
in decyphering their severall natures and perfecti∣ons,
altogether omitting the essentiall references,
or dependencies, which they had from him; unlesse
this mirror of nature, had bin of their number, who
infatuated (as the Apostle speakes) by divine wise∣dome,
became vaine in their imaginatiōs; he might
have perceived his owne definition of such infinity
as he imagined in the divisibility of Magnitude or
succession of time, to have beene (as <HI>Plato</HI> speakes
of Time it selfe) but a moveable image of that true
<PB N="29" REF="21"/>
and solid <HI>infinity,</HI> whose definition, being well as∣signed
by others, was censoriously rejected by him;
or such a floating shadow of it swimming in his
braine, as the Sun or Starres imprint in a swift run∣ning
streame. A perfect definition should bee so
fitted to the entire nature of the thing defined, or
to the thing it selfe absolutely considered, as the
barke is to the tree, or other visible surfaces to the
bodies which they environ: To expresse some
particular properties or branches, much lesse some
references or considerations of it, is not enough.
The question then being absolutely proposed
<HI>Quid est infinitum?</HI> What is infinity? or what is it
to be infinite? The definitive and satisfactory an∣swer
must bee such, as shall expresse not the nature
of infinity in succession onely or in division, not in
this or that respect only, or according to some par∣ticular
abstraction or consideration; but the nature
of infinity simply and absolutely considered. That
only is absolutely and properly <HI>infinite,</HI> which is
<HI>infinite</HI> not according to one conceipt or kinde of
<HI>infinity,</HI> but that which is <HI>infinite</HI> in <HI>Being.</HI> This
was that <HI>infinity</HI> which the Ancients well defined,
when they said, <HI>Infinitum est extra quod nihil est:</HI>
Infinity is that without which nothing is, or can be.
For as infinity in longitude, includes all length con∣ceiveable,
and infinity in solid magnitudes, all di∣mensions
imaginable; so must <HI>infinite being</HI> include
all Being possible; and it is impossible for any thing
to be <HI>without</HI> or besides that, wherein all <HI>being</HI> pos∣sible
is contained. Thus did these ancient Heathens
<HI>feele after and seeke,</HI> and in a manner find, <HI>that Lord</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="22"/>
under the notion of <HI>unum</HI> and <HI>infinitum, in whom,</HI>
as S. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>(Act. 17. 28.) we live, and move, and
have our being.</HI> His words will beare or rather pre∣suppose
that improvement, which is necessarily in∣cluded
in the <HI>Ancients</HI> definition of absolute infini∣tie,
<HI>It is impossible that any thing living should have
life, that any thing moveable should move, that life
or motion should have the least degree of being, save
only in Him, who onely is.</HI> For as the same Apostle
there saith, vers. 25. <HI>He giveth to all, life and breath,
and all things.</HI> The very first beginnings, the first
and last degrees of such being as they have. <HI>Ari∣stotle</HI>
then came farre short of the truth in saying,
<HI>Infinitum est extra quod semper aliquid est,</HI> That is
infinite, which never hath so much, but it is alwaies
getting more. The truth is, <HI>Aristotle</HI> did not, could
not deny the definition assigned by the Ancients,
to be a true and perfect definition of absolute infi∣nity,
or of infinity in being. Wherein then, or up∣on
what grounds did he dissent from them? Either
in that he did not acknowledge any such absolute
infinity or infinite being, as the Ancients beleeved;
or else did suppose, that they held this visible world
or some bodily magnitude to be so actually and ab∣solutely
infinite, as the former definition doth im∣port.
Concerning this latter sort of infinity, what∣soever
the ancient Philosophers did, we Christians
doe not dissent from <HI>Aristotle:</HI> for we deny any
bodily magnitude actually infinite. But that there
is an absolute infinity, or an Essence actually and
absolutely infinite, may be necessarily inferred from
those branches of that <HI>infinity</HI> which consists not
<PB N="31" REF="22"/>
in <HI>act,</HI> but in <HI>possibility,</HI> or succession, which <HI>Ari∣stotle</HI>
rightly acknowledged, and well defined. For,
whence should al the parts of this visible world pos∣sibly
get any new portion of time, any succession
or addition to their present being or duration,
which now they have not; save onely from his in∣finite
and inexhaustible store, who, before all times,
had so much of being in every kind, as he could not
possibly either get any more, or lose a dramme of
what he had; albeit through every moment of du∣ration
divisible, he furnished all things, that are (as
hee could doe more) with as much perfection, as
they are capable of, that is, all of them with per∣fection
or being in it selfe finite, but in some of them
without limit of duration. But are all things in <HI>him?</HI>
or such only as include perfection? or shall wee say
perfections are in him, rather than in the things
themselves? And if so, whether shall we say hee is
one perfection, or all perfections?</P>

<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>EE argued like himselfe that said,
We must either allow the Gods to
have bodies, or deny them sense;
because sense is never found with∣out
a body. What was it then in
<PB N="32" REF="23"/>
his Philosophy, which framed the organs of bodily
sense? a body already organized and indued with
sense? or a <HI>spirit (virtus formatrix)</HI> which rather
is in the body, than is a body it selfe? And if this
spirit frame the organs by its owne skill, <HI>Epicurus</HI>
should in reason have afforded it both sense and
reason in greater measure than hee had himselfe;
who, out of the same matter, could not make so
much as one haire white or blacke; much lesse the
most exquisit instruments of sense. But if this <HI>spirit,</HI>
by which, in Philosophers opinions, our bodies are
produced, work not by art, but is only set on work
by the supreame Artificer; seeing <HI>he</HI> can make it to
do more without sense &amp; reason, thā <HI>Epicurus</HI> could
doe, by all his art or philosophicall skill: wee must
needs grant sense (&amp; reason) to be in <HI>Him,</HI> yet such,
or in such a sort, as befits his Majesty, not such as
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide La∣ctant. lib. 1. de ira Dei. Et Betule∣um in com.</NOTE><HI>Epicurus</HI> took delight in. Our argument is groun∣ded
on the Psalmists Philosophy. <HI>Vnderstand yee
bruitish among the people, and yee fooles when will yee
be wise? He that planted the eare shall he not heare?
He that formed the eyes, shall hee not see? Hee that
chastiseth the Heathen, shall not he correct? He that
teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know? Psal. 94.
8, 9, 10.</HI> Yet as wee say that <HI>He</HI> onely <HI>is,</HI> and all
things numerable are but meere shadowes of <HI>His
being;</HI> so wee must hold, that <HI>hearing, sight,</HI> and
<HI>reason</HI> are in him, according to their idaeall patterns
or perfections, not according to those imperfect
pictures, which communicated to men and beasts,
distinguish them from vegetables or livelesse crea∣tures;
whose perfections likewise are in him. But
<PB N="33" REF="23"/>
some things perhaps there be, which have no por∣tion
of perfection, as the prime <HI>matter,</HI> or some
like dead or dull masse. For how shall that, which
is but a body, be in him that hath no body? That
Maxime, <HI>Idem est non esse, &amp; non apparere,</HI> is not so
true in matters of civill proofe or allegation, as the
other stemme of the same root, <HI>Idem est non esse &amp;
non operari,</HI> is in nature. To be without efficacie
or operation, or to serve unto no use, is all one, as
not to be at all. Or, rather, so to be, hath the same
proportion to simple <HI>non-being,</HI> as <HI>nihil agere,</HI> to
<HI>otiosum esse.</HI> To <HI>be</HI> without use or operation is more
remote from true <HI>being,</HI> and worse in nature, than
simply not to be. If any such things there be, how
should we say they are in God, in whom is nothing
but perfection? Yet of things without proper use
or operation, there might be some peculiar end best
knowne to their Maker; if it were but to commend
the perfection which other creatures borrow from
him, and to stirre up our thankfulnesse, that we nei∣ther
are such dull masses our selves, nor are troubled
with harbouring or supporting them. But even
these, if any such there were, could not be existent
or <HI>extra causas,</HI> unlesse they truely were in Him.
What is it then for all things that are, or their per∣fections to be in Him?</P>
<P>2 For all things to be in Him, is no more then
that He alone can produce them without seed or
matter precedent. All things, not extant onely, but
<HI>possible,</HI> are in his wisedome, as the Edifice is in
the Artificers head: all things againe are in his
power, as strength or force to move our limbes, is
<PB N="34" REF="24"/>
in our sinewes or motive faculty. The perfections
of all things are truly said to be in Him, in as much
as whatsoever is, or can bee done by their efficacy
or vertue, Hee alone can doe without them. Hee
could feed all the beasts of the field without grasse,
heale every disease, without herbe, mettall, or other
matter of medicine, by his sole word, not uttered
by breathing, or any other kinde of motion; not
distinct from his life or essence. Hee is life it selfe;
yet is not his life supported by any corporeall
masse, or praeexistent nature, nor clothed with such
sense as ours is: for sense, in as much as it cannot
be without a corporeall organ, is an imperfect kind
of knowledge. Paine hee cannot feele as we doe,
because that tendeth to destruction, which is the
period of imperfection: yet what soever paine any
sensible or materiall object can inflict upon us, He
alone can inflict the same in an higher degree. The
measure of paine, likewise, which we feele by sense,
He knows much better without sense or feeling of
it. But when wee say all things are in <HI>Him,</HI> after a
more excellent manner, than they are or can bee in
themselves: Wee must not conceipt a multitude
or diversity of excellencies in his <HI>Essence,</HI> answering
to the severall natures of things created: We must
not imagine one excellencie sutable to <HI>elementary
bodies,</HI> another to <HI>mixt,</HI> a third to <HI>vegetables,</HI> a
fourth to <HI>sense,</HI> &amp;c. one to the humane nature, ano∣ther

all <HI>perfection:</HI> yet he that should thus say [God is the
<HI>universall</HI> unity or <HI>totality</HI> of perfection] had need
<PB N="36" REF="25"/>
to distinguish acurately of <HI>universality</HI> and totality,
and define <HI>Vniversale ante rem▪</HI> more exquisitely
than the Platonickes doe; that he may acquit his
meaning, from suspition of such <HI>totality,</HI> or <HI>univer∣sality,</HI>
as ariseth not onely by aggregation of parts,
but whose extent is no more than equall to all its
parts. For every other <HI>universall</HI> or <HI>whole,</HI> is fully
equalized by all the parts taken together; whereas
the Divine Nature infinitely exceeds all particular
natures or perfections possible, though in number
they could be infinite. It is then (if any man list so
to speake) such a <HI>totality</HI> or <HI>universality,</HI> as cannot
bee augmented, much lesse made up by multi∣plication
of any other perfection, though prosecu∣ted
<HI>in infinitum;</HI> neither diminishable or exhau∣stible
by multiplicity or division of particulars de∣rived
from it. But whether wee consider this <HI>His</HI>
infinite Essence in it selfe, or, as it eminently con∣taines
all things possible; the incomprehensibility
of it is in both respects more fully intimated (ex∣prest
it cannot be) by indefinite formes of speech;
than by addition of any definite termes, whether
of <HI>singularity, universality,</HI> or <HI>totality.</HI> Hee speakes
more fully and more safely, that saith, <HI>God is being
it selfe, or perfection it selfe;</HI> than he that saith, he is
the onely <HI>being,</HI> or all <HI>being,</HI> the onely <HI>perfection,</HI>
or all <HI>perfection,</HI> the totality of <HI>being</HI> and of <HI>perfecti∣on.</HI>
So all <HI>plurality</HI> be excluded, we expresse his <HI>be∣ing</HI>
and <HI>perfection</HI> best, by leaving them, as they tru∣ly
are, without all quantity.</P>
<P>4 That all <HI>plurality,</HI> not onely of Idaeall per∣fections
answering to the natures of things nume∣rable
<PB N="37" REF="25"/>
or created, but of <HI>internall</HI> perfections, whose
different titles necessarily breed plurality of con∣ceits
in us; must be excluded from the true, ortho∣doxall
intellectuall apprehension of the illimited
Essence, may from the former maine principle be
thus evinced. In that Hee is without beginning,
without end, without all cause of being, without
dependence; we cannot imagine, or at least our un∣derstanding
must correct our imaginations, if they
shall suggest, his <HI>power</HI> to bee as the stemme, <HI>wise∣dome,
goodnesse,</HI> and other like atributes, as bran∣ches
growing from his being or essence, as from the
Root. For if his Being or Essence be absolutely in∣dependent,
it is absolutely illimited; and being such,
what could limit or restraine it from being life,
from being power, from being wisedome, from
being goodnesse, from being infinitely, whatsoever
any thing that hath being is?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Deus verò multiplici∣ter dicitur, magnus, bo∣nus, sapiens, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eatus, ve∣rus, &amp; quic∣quid aliud non indignè Dei vide∣tur.

any of these attributes to bee what another is not,
or divine Essence not to bee identically what all
those are, must grant as well the Attributes, as the
Essence to be finite and limited. If <HI>power</HI> in God
have a <HI>being</HI> distinct from wisedome, and wisedome
another <HI>being</HI> distinct from <HI>goodnesse,</HI> one must
needs want so much of infinite <HI>being,</HI> as another
hath of proper being distinct from it, and, at the
best, they can bee but infinite <HI>secundùm quid,</HI> or in
their ranke. Againe if any of them be, what Essence
<PB N="38" REF="26"/>
identically is not; Essence cannot bee infinite, be∣cause
<HI>wisedome, power</HI> and <HI>being</HI> have their severall
beings distinct from it. And the nearer these come
(whether severally or joyntly considered) to the
nature of true infinity, the more naked and impo∣tent
they leave their mother-Essence, if we once
grant Essence and them to bee distinct, as Parents
and children, or as root and branch, or to what use
should powerlesse Essence serve? to support these
branches of infinity? this it could not doe without
infinite power. And those branches, if they need
a root or supportance, their being must needs bee
dependent, and therefore limited.</P>
<P>5 From the former definition of absolute infi∣nity,
<HI>[Infinitum est extra quod nihil est]</HI> We may
conclude, that unlesse all <HI>power,</HI> unlesse all <HI>wisedome,</HI>
unlesse all <HI>goodnesse,</HI> unlesse <HI>all</HI> that truly is, or can
possibly be supposed to have true being, bee identi∣cally
contained in Gods Essence; He could not be
absolutely infinite or illimited in being. Whatso∣ever
is uncapable of limit, is uncapable of division
or numericall difference: For wheresoever it can
be truly said, This is one, and that another, or <HI>This</HI>
is, and <HI>is</HI> not <HI>That,</HI> each hath distinct limits. But
seeing our imagination or phantasie is divisible, and
our purest intellectuall conceipts of infinity, but
finite; we cannot thinke of God as <HI>infinite</HI> in <HI>power,
infinite</HI> in <HI>wisedome</HI> and in <HI>Essence;</HI> but wee must
frame a conceit of <HI>power</HI> distinct from our conceit
of Essence, and a <HI>conceit</HI> of wisedome distinct from
both. And this plurality of conceipts in us, usu∣ally
brings forth a conceit of plurality betwixt his
<PB N="39" REF="26"/>
Essence, and his Attributes; unlesse our understan∣dings
be vigilant and attentive to correct our phan∣tasies,
by this following, and the like knowne Phi∣losophicall
truth. As we cannot contemplate in∣corporeal
substances without imagination of some
corporeall forme, and yet the understanding con∣stantly
denyes them to bee like their pictures pre∣sented
to it by the phantasie, or to have any such
corporeall forme as it doth paint them in: so in
this case, notwithstanding the plurality of our im∣perfect
conceipts, or multiplicity of <HI>perfections</HI>
imagined by us, in our contemplations of the God∣head;
we must stedfastly beleeve, and acknowledge,
that He <HI>infinitely is,</HI> what all these severall repre∣sentations
intimate: not by composition, or mix∣ture
of <HI>perfections</HI> severally infinite, but by indivisi∣ble
unity of independent and illimited <HI>Being.</HI> And
as it is a maxime most infallible in naturall philoso∣phie
<HI>[Vis unita fortior]</HI> Force, otherwise the same,
is alwaies greater united, than being scattered or
diffused: so is the metaphysicall extract of it, more
eminently true in Divinity. The indivisible unity of
illimited <HI>being</HI> or <HI>perfection,</HI> is, in every respect
imaginable, more excellent and soveraigne than all
infinite <HI>perfections,</HI> by imagination possibly could
be, so they were, though never so strictly, but uni∣ted.
From this fundamentall truth of Gods abso∣lute
infinity by indivisible unity, wee may inferre,
He is <HI>powerfull</HI> above all conceit of infinite power,
rooted in the same Essence with infinite wisedome,
and partaker of all her fruits, but not identically the
same with her. <HI>Wise He is,</HI> beyond all conceit of in∣finite
<PB N="40" REF="27"/>
wisedome, though sworne confederate with
infinite power, or linked with it, or with other per∣fectiōs,
in any other bond, but not in absolute iden∣titie.
<HI>Good</HI> likewise <HI>He is</HI> above all possible conceit
of infinite goodnesse, though indissol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bly match∣ed
with all other perfections that can bee concei∣ved,
unlesse they be conceived (as we must beleeve
in Him they are) different onely in name or mans
conceit, but indivisibly agreeing with it in the inter∣nall
unity and identity of nature and Essence. Last∣ly,
the immensity of his Majesty, and infinity of
duration, common to his Essence and all his Attri∣butes,
infinitely exceed all conceit of <HI>infinite</HI> suc∣cession
or extension, whose parts cannot be actual∣ly
and indivisibly the same, one with another, or
with the whole.</P>
<P>This is the bottomlesse and boundlesse Ocean
of admiration, wherein contemplative wits may
bathe themselves with great delight, but whereinto
they cannot dive, without great danger; That the
totality of every conceiveable excellency and per∣fection,
should be contained, after a manner farre
more excellent in unity indivisible, then if their na∣tures,
which they hold thus in common, were laid
out in severall, without any bounds prescribed, be∣sides
infinities proper to each kinde.</P>
<P>6 But seeing our imaginations have a more sen∣sible
apprehension of greatnesse, exprest under the
notion of totality or divisible <HI>infinity,</HI> then under
the conceipt of indivisible <HI>unity;</HI> and seeing every
whole, seemes much greater, when it is resolved
into parts, (as a mile by land, whose severall quar∣ters
<PB N="41" REF="27"/>
or lesse portions, are distinctly represented to
our eyes, seemes much longer than two miles by
water, whose levell surface affords no distinct repre∣sentation
of parts, or diversity of aspect) it will bee
very behoovefull to unfold some principall
branches of <HI>being</HI> or <HI>perfection,</HI> whose <HI>infinitie</HI> or
totality is eminently contained in the unity of in∣finite
Being. For being thus sorted by imagination
into their severall ranks, like so many numbers in a
table ready for addition, the understanding may
with admiration guesse at the product, like an A∣rithmetician,
which had gone so far in Geometri∣call
progression, that he could not number the last
and compleat summe; yet acknowledgeth that the
progresse in nature, can admit no end or limit. Or
though we could thus proceed by addition or mul∣tiplication
of perfections <HI>in infinitum,</HI> we were still
to allow the understanding to use the improove∣ment
of the former rule, <HI>Vis unita fortior:</HI> Or to
admit the Platonickes conceipt, concerning the
<HI>masculine</HI> force of unity in respect of <HI>pluralities</HI> ef∣feminate
weaknesse, to bee in this point more Or∣thodoxall
than in any.</P>

obvious to our thoughts, that our
imaginations will hardly suffer it
to be severed from those subjects,
which our understandings by light of reason may,
and by the eye of faith, must confesse to bee finite,
to wit, time and place. The cause of this difficultie
in abstraction, was signified<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In the 5. Booke. Section 2.</NOTE> before to be this. No
event there is observed by sense, but is husked in the
circumstance of <HI>place</HI> and <HI>time,</HI> whence it is, that
these two accompany many Phantasmes, after they
<PB N="43" REF="28"/>
bee winnowed from all the rest, into the closet of
the understāding. The conceit of mathematicall or
metaphysicall space, is so naturally annexed to our
imagination of <HI>time</HI> and <HI>place</HI> physicall; that albeit
reason, aswell as Scripture demonstrate the world
to be, for Physicall magnitude, finite; yet our phan∣tasies
cannot be curbed from running into imagina∣ry
locall distance, beyond the utmost surface of this
goodly visible worke of God, yea beyond the hea∣ven
of heavens. The Philosopher, which thought
all place or locall distance to bee contained within
the utmost sphere, it beeing contained in nothing
else (for <HI>extra coelum nihil est,</HI> was his saying) might
in congruity have granted, a like termination, or cir∣cumscription
of succession or time; unto which
notwithstanding our imaginations will not easily
subscribe. For though our understanding oft re∣fute
their errour, which deny the beginning of
Time; yet our senses still nurse an imaginary suc∣cessive
duration much longer before the creation
of this visible world, than the continuation of it
hath beene. And (which is much to bee admired)
some Schoole-braines have beene so puzled in pas∣sing
this unsoundable gulfe, as to suspect that God,
which is now in every place of the world created
by <HI>Him,</HI> was as truly in these imaginary <HI>distances</HI> of
place and time, before the creation was attempted.
Thus have they made <HI>place</HI> commensurable to his
<HI>immensitie,</HI> and succession, or time coequall to his
<HI>eternitie.</HI> But what could they answere us, if we
should demand, whether this duration, or locall
distance, wherein they imagine God to have beene
<PB N="44" REF="29"/>
before the Creation, were created by <HI>Him,</HI> or not?
whether they were truly something, or meerly no∣thing?
If they held them to be meerly <HI>nothing,</HI> they
should have told us, that they had a reall imaginati∣on
of an infinite space, which really was not: and
therefore could not bee truely tearmed imaginary
space before the world was created. For it is one
thing to imagine an <HI>infinite</HI> space, and another to
avouch there was an <HI>infinite</HI> imaginarie space be∣fore
they could have any imagination of it. Hee
that made the world and all that is in it, is not much
beholding to those men, for building him an infi∣nite
Castle, not in the Ayre (which had no being
before the Creation) but in <HI>that</HI> which neither thē
was, nor since hath had any being, save onely in the
vanishing imaginations of men which have perish∣ed.
For if this imaginary space were any more thā
a meere imagination, it was surely created by God.
Had then this imaginary space another space or di∣stance-locall,
or this imaginary <HI>time</HI> or successive
<HI>duration,</HI> another <HI>duration,</HI> wherin to be produced?
or doe they make this imaginary time or place ful∣ly
commensurable to eternity or immensity? If
God from eternity had been in any other <HI>infinity</HI>
besides himselfe, hee could not be said to be incom∣prehensible.
By this imaginary space no realty can
bee truely meant besides God himselfe, whom the

2 But what shall we answer unto these or the
like captious demands of the Atheist: If the world,
if time, if place, which now are, had not been from
everlasting? where was your God when these were
not, some where, or no where? If no where, <HI>Hee</HI>
and <HI>Nothing</HI> might be fellow residents. In respect
of eternity or immensity, no creature, no positive
essence, no numerable part of this Vniverse is so like
unto <HI>Him,</HI> as this negation of all things, which we
describe by the name of <HI>Nothing.</HI> It hath no begin∣ning
or end of dayes. Nothing or the negation of
all things, as it is the object of our positive conceit,
is more like unto <HI>Him</HI> than any <HI>one thing,</HI> in that
no distinct or proper place of residence can bee as∣signed
to nothing, or to the negation of all things:
Yet most <HI>unlike</HI> him, in that it is truly and abso∣lutely
no where, not in it selfe. <HI>Non entis, non est
actio, non est qualitas, non conditio,</HI> That which is
not can have no capacity to accept any condition of
<HI>being,</HI> it can have no right or title to bee termed it
selfe. We may truly say some objective conceipts
are nothing: but we cannot rightly conceive, that
<HI>nothing</HI> should have any degree or kinde of <HI>being;</HI>
and want of <HI>being</HI> is the worst kinde of barrennesse
that can be imagined. We cannot imagine it should
bring forth any degree or ranke of being. It can∣not
be mother to that which possibly may bee; it
cannot be nurse to that which is. But of God wee
cannot absolutely say, He was no where, before the
world was made; we must use this limitation <HI>[Hee
was no where save in Himselfe:]</HI> But such and so in
Himselfe, that He was more than all things, longer
<PB N="46" REF="30"/>
than <HI>time,</HI> greater than <HI>place,</HI> more <HI>infinite</HI> than <HI>ca∣pacity</HI>
it selfe, uncapable of circumscription or com∣mensurability,
able to limit <HI>time</HI> and <HI>place,</HI> (or what∣soever
we conceive to be by succession or addition
infinite,) by his essentiall presence, or coexistence
more than <HI>penetrative;</HI> being so in both, in all things
that are, as nothing possibly could have beginning,
or continuance of being, unlesse He were in them,
as the center of their supportance; yet so as they
cannot environ or encompasse him. The absolute
infinity of his <HI>being</HI> includes an absolute impossibi∣lity
of his <HI>being</HI> onely in things, that are, or may be,
though by his power those may be in number, by
succession, infinite.</P>
<P>3 Had the evaporations of proud phantasticke
melancholy, eclipsed the lustre of his glorious pre∣sence,
in that late prodigious Questionists braine,
which would bring us out of the sunne-shine of the
Gospell into old Aegyptian darknesse: For as some
well conjecture, this error of inclosing God in the
heavens, and excluding his essentiall presence from
this inferiour world, was first brought forth in Ae∣gypt,
but so ill <HI>taken,</HI> as it could not be propagated
to many nations; entertained by few Philosophers
of better sort, <HI>Aristotle</HI> or the Author of the Booke
<HI>de mundo ad Alexandrum,</HI> excepted; from whose
opinion <HI>Verstius</HI> did herein dissent, that hee held
God to be everywhere by his power, and immedi∣ate
providence: His error notwithstanding, is ex∣ceeding
grosse and unsufferable, in that hee makes
his infinite <HI>power, wisedome,</HI> and <HI>goodnesse,</HI> in whose
sweet harmony Divine Providence especially con∣sists,
<PB N="47" REF="30"/>
but as Agents or Ambassadors to his infinite
Majesty: as if his infinite Majesty onely were full
<HI>compere</HI> to his Essence, unfitting to bee imployed
abroad, or to keep residence any where, save in the
Court of Heaven. Or if his power and wisedome
be joynt assessors with his Essence in the heavens,
and yet reach withall unto the earth, unto every
thing within this <HI>Canopy,</HI> which is spred betwixt us
and his glorious presence: His <HI>power,</HI> his <HI>wisedome,</HI>
&amp;c. may in some sort be held more infinite than his
Essence, as being in many places where it is not.
But for God to be everywhere here on earth, or in
the region under the earth, by his wisedome, by his
power, or by his goodnesse, is perhaps in his lan∣guage
no more, than that the effects of these Attri∣butes
are every where, that all things as well in earth
as in heaven, are essentially subject to that eternall
Law, which he hath appointed them; that every
creature doth as constantly fulfill his will, and obey
his power, in his absence, as if it were penetrated
by his presence; that the eye of his knowledge
pierceth every corner of the world, and seeth the
secrets of mens hearts, as clearly, as if it were resi∣dent
in their centers. And in part, unto this pur∣pose,
some great Schoolemen distinguish the man∣ner
of Gods being in all things, by his <HI>essence,</HI> by his
<HI>power,</HI> by his <HI>presence.</HI> Let us take it as possible to
supposition or imagination, (what by the habit of
Christian faith, we are fully perswaded to bee in it
selfe impossible) what by light of reason might be
demonstrated to imply a manifest contradiction to
any well-setled understanding, <HI>viz. [That infinite
<PB N="48" REF="31"/>
Essence or Being it selfe should not be every-where es∣sentially
present, or that infinite power should not bee
able to reach every possible effect:]</HI> yet should al things
that are, be present to him, whose name, whose best
description is <HI>[I am.]</HI> Nothing could be done or
said without his presence, that is, without his per∣fect
notice. And in this sense perhaps it hath beene
rightly avouched by some good Authors, whose
meaning hath beene much mistaken, or wilfully
perverted by others, <HI>That all things as well future
as past, are alike present to Him, who was every where</HI>
(before there was any distinction of times;) because
nothing can bee said or done, without his perfect
knowledge or just notice. Nothing can be begun,
continued, or finished, without his expresse war∣rant
or intuitive permission. He hath a vigilant eye
over all things that are, or possibly can be. Or ta∣king
it againe as not impossible to imagination, that
divine knowledge were not so truly infinite as wee
beleeve it is; yet admitting his power to bee truly
<HI>infinite,</HI> nothing could be done, said, or intended,
without its concourse, operation, or <HI>assistance.</HI> So
that he might be everywhere by his infinite power,
albeit his knowledge were not <HI>infinite;</HI> or every∣where
by his infinite knowledge, albeit his power
were but finite. But by the infallible consequence
of these indemonstrable principles, it will necessa∣rily
follow, That his Essence, being as was shewed
before, truly <HI>infinite,</HI> nor world, nor time, nor place,
nor power, nor wisedome, nor any thing possible
can be where it is not, it must needs be, where any
thing is, or possibly may be. He is in every center
<PB N="49" REF="31"/>
of bodily or materiall substances, in every point
imaginable of this visible Vniverse, as an essentiall
root, whence all and every part of what is besides
him spring, without waste or diffusion of his sub∣stance,
without nutriment or sustentation from a∣ny
other root or element. The conservation of im∣material
or <HI>illocall</HI> substances, is from the benefit of
his essentiall presence. Materialls are daily made
and renewed by the transient efficacy of his crea∣tive
power.</P>
<P>4 Doe we make these collections only, or doth
not the Scripture teach this Philosophy also? <HI>Am
I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God farre
off? Ier. 23. 23.</HI> Nothing is, nothing can be without
the reach of his power, his omnipotency cannot
be confined within the places that are: for his hand
hath made them all, not as Prisons to inclose his
Essence, not as manicles to hinder the exercise of
his mightie arme. <HI>Can any hide himselfe in secret
places, that I shall not see him?</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>Ibid.
vers. 24.</HI> This is a formall demand of our assent
unto the <HI>infinitie</HI> of his knowledge. These are two
speciall, but not the onely wayes of his being eve∣ry
where, which the Scripture teacheth: for there
followes a third, which after the manner of our un∣derstanding,
is the root or foundation of al the rest;
<HI>that</HI> indeed, from which the two former branches
are most necessarily inferred, <HI>Doe not I fill heaven
and earth? saith the Lord.</HI> Doth He fill heaven and
earth by his power, or by his knowledge onely?
Nay, but most properly and in the first place by his
essentiall presence. For his <HI>Essence</HI> is infinitely po∣werfull,
<PB N="50" REF="32"/>
infinitely wise.</P>
<P>His filling the earth as well as heaven, by his es∣sentiall
presence, cannot be denyed but from one of
these two reasons following.</P>
<P>Either, That his <HI>Essence</HI> is altogether uncapable
of intimate coexistence, with such grosse and base
creatures, as the parts of this inferiour world:</P>
<P>Or else, Because it is his will, to abstract or with∣hold
his essentiall presence from them.</P>
<P>To affirme the former part, to wit, That his na∣ture
is uncapable of intimate coexistence with any
nature created by Him, is to deny his <HI>omnipotency;</HI>
as all, by necessary consequence, doe, which grant
not the immensity of his Essence. For what can
withstand or withdraw his Essence from piercing
the earth, as well as heaven? Not the hardnesse of
it, not the loathsomnesse of the vile bodies contai∣ned
in it. If either of these qualitites, or ought be∣sides,
could deny the admission of his essentiall pre∣sence,
he were not omnipotent, because not able to
place his Essence in that locall space, in which, were
it filled with more subtill or more glorious bodies,
it might as well reside, as in the heavens. Suppose
he should (as no doubt hee is able) annihilate the
earth, and create a new heaven in the space where∣in
it now is, or demolish his present heavenly seat,
or turne it into a baser masse then this earth is;
were it not possible for him to bee in this new hea∣ven
by his essentiall presence, or should he be nei∣ther
in it, nor in the new earth? If hee could not
be here, he were in this respect more impotent than
the Angels, who can change their mansions when
they mislike them.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="32"/>
5 Shall wee then take the latter part of the for∣mer
division, and say, It is his will and pleasure to
withdraw his Essence from this lower roome of
his own Edifice, whiles it remaines so ill garnished,
as now it is? If hee have made heaven his habita∣tion
by choice, not by necessity of his immensity,
with which all places, as we contend, must neces∣sarily
be filled; hee might relinquish it by the like
free choice of some other mansion, which he could
make for himselfe as pleasant and beautifull: yea,
Hee might by the like freedome of will, come and
dwell with us here on earth. So that in conclusion,
he which admitteth Gods wil to be free, but denies
the absolute immensity of his Essence, makes him
capable of locall motion or migration from place to
place. And such motion necessarily includeth mu∣tability,
which is altogether incompatible with in∣finity.
Reason grounded on Scripture, will warrant
us to conclude from the former principle, that hee
which hath no cause of being, can have no limits of
being, no bounds beyond which it cannot be. Es∣sence
or <HI>being</HI> illimited cannot possibly bee distin∣guished
by severalties of internall perfections,
though united: much lesse can it be distinguished
or limited by any place, whether reall or imagina∣rie.
In that he is the authorlesse Author of all <HI>being,</HI>
it is altogether as impossible for Him not to bee in
every thing that is, as it is for any thing to be with∣out
Him. The indivisible unity of his infinite <HI>Es∣sence</HI>
is the center and supporter of all things, the
conservation of place, and that which holdeth
things divisible from resolving into nothing.</P>

6 <HI>Dominus ipse est Deus in coelo sursum &amp; in ter∣ra
deorsum: The Lord</HI> (saith <HI>Moses) hee is God in
heaven above, and in the earth below, Deut. 4. 39.</HI> yet
saith <HI>Salomon, 1 King. 8. 27. Behold the heavens, and
the heavens of heavens are not able to containe thee.</HI>
May we say then, Hee is as truely without the hea∣vens,
as he is in them? or that he is where nothing
is with Him? surely, hee was when nothing was,
and then hee was where nothing was besides him∣selfe.
Or peradventure before the creation of all
things numerable, there neither was <HI>whē</HI> nor <HI>where,</HI>
but only an incomprehensible perfection of indivi∣sible
immensity and eternity; which would still be
the same, though neither heaven nor earth, nor any
thing in them should any more <HI>be.</HI> We may not so
place him without the heavens, as to cloath him
with any imaginary space, or give the checke to his
immensity by any parallel distance locall. But hee
is said to be without the heavens, in as much as his
infinite <HI>Essence</HI> cannot bee contained in them, but
necessarily containes them. Hee is so with∣out
them, or if you will, beyond them, that
albeit a thousand more Worlds were stowed by
His powerfull hand each above other, and all
above this; Hee should by vertue of His infi∣nite
<HI>Essence,</HI> not by free choyce of will, or
mutation of place, bee as intimately coexistent
to every part of them, as Hee now is to any
part of this Heaven and Earth which wee see.
This attribute of Divine <HI>immensitie</HI> was ac∣knowledged,
and excellently expressed by ma∣ny
of the Ancient Philosophers, but most pi∣thily
<PB N="53" REF="33"/>
by some of the Ancient Fathers. Before
all things, saith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ante om∣nia enim Deus erat solus, ipse si∣bi &amp; mun∣dus &amp; lo∣cus, &amp; om∣nia. Solus autem, quia nihil aliud extrinsecus praeter il∣lum. Caete∣rum ne tunc quidem so∣lus: habebat enim secum quam habe∣bat in se∣metipso, ra∣tionem suā scilicet. Ter∣tul. adversus Praxean. cap. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Tertullian,</HI> God was alone, and
hee was to himselfe, <HI>world, place,</HI> and all things.
The manner of his coexistence with the world,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">De confu∣sione lin∣guarum.</NOTE><HI>Philo</HI> the Iew well expressed: God filleth all
things, yet is contained in none, containing all. The
vicinity of His Essence preserveth their Essences
more truly than the symbolizing qualities of their
naturall places doe. And even this efficacy of
symbolizing or preserving qualities, flowes as im∣mediately
from his essentiall presence, as the passive
aptitude of bodies preserved by them, doth. The
more the places are through which bodies naturall
swiftly move, the lesse properly they are in them.
In analogy to this condition of naturall bodies, the
more capable man is of all knowledge, the more
lyable his capacity is to distraction, as consisting ra∣ther
in united perfections, than in firme and indivi∣sible
unity of <HI>perfection.</HI> And therefore it is often
said of most pregnant wits, <HI>qui ubi{que} est, nusquam est,</HI>
He that is every where, is no where. Or he that in∣gageth
himselfe to all courses of life, goeth through
with none. But of God, who is perfection it selfe,
not by aggregation, but by absolute unity of Es∣sence;
that of Saint <HI>Bernard</HI> is most admirably
verified, <HI>Nusquam est, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bi{que} est,</HI> Hee is no where,
because no place whether reall or imaginary can
comprehend or containe him: He is every where,
because no body, no space, or spirituall substance
can exclude his presence, or avoid the penetration
of his Essence. But Saint <HI>Gregories</HI> Character of
Gods ubiquitary presence and immensity, is more
<PB N="54" REF="34"/>
lively and full. <HI>Deus est intra omnia non inclusus,
extra omnia non exclusus, supra omnia non elatus;</HI>
God is within all things, yet not shut up, or inclo∣sed
in them; he is without all things, yet not exclu∣ded
from them; hee is above all things, yet not ele∣vated
or exalted by them; hee is below all things,
yet not burdened or depressed by them. <HI>Greg. in
Psal. 139.</HI></P>
<P>7 <HI>Anselmus</HI> notwithstanding (had not long
custome or generall consent prescribed too strōgly
against him) would have reformed this kinde of
speech, <HI>Deus est in omni loco,</HI> God is in every place,
by changing one particle, <HI>Deus est cum omni loco,</HI>
God is with every place. This Criticisme of his,
though well approved by some good writers;
whilest they dispute against such as say God was
every where, before any place was, yet (in my opi∣nion)
the use of it, were it as common as the other,
which he sought by this to correct, would cōceale
much matter of admiration, (which the descripti∣on
of immensity used by Saint <HI>Bernard</HI> and others
promptly suggests) if not occasion or suggest an er∣roneous
imagination of coextension in the Divine
Essence. The bodies which are contained in places,
are truly said to be with the places which containe
them, and the places with them; and wee may di∣stributively
averre, that every body is with every
place, and every bodily substance is with its mathe∣maticall
dimen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions, in the same place with it.
But so to be in every place, in every least part of e∣very
body, as not to bee contained in any or all of
them, though we should multiply them <HI>in infinitū,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="34"/>
doth exclude all conceipt or coextension with thē,
and much better notifie the indivisible unitie of
Gods immensity, &amp; the incōprehensiblenes of his
essentiall presence, than if wee should say he were
with every place. But as no Characters of the in∣comprehensible
Essences ubiquitary presence doe
so well befit it, as these that intimate more to our
cogitations than we can in words expresse: So of
this kinde I have found none, from which I have re∣ceived
so full instruction, or reaped the like fruits of
admiration, as from that of <HI>Trismegist, Deus est
sphaera, cujus Centrum est ubi{que}, cujus peripheria nus∣quam,</HI>
God is a sphere, whose Center is every∣where,
whose circumference is no where. Not the
least particle of this universall Globe or sphere, but
is supported by the indivisible unity of his Essence,
as by an internall Center. And yet neither the ut∣most
circumference of this visible world, nor any
circumference conceiveable, can so circumscribe or
comprehend his essentiall presence, that it might
bee said, thus farre it reacheth and no further. For
albeit hee would crowne the convexity of these
Heavens with others, so much higher and more
spacious, than these Heavens, as these are than the
Earth, and continue this course unto the worlds
end: yet all should bee comprehended in his Es∣sence;
it could not be comprehended in any. Their
circumference should still be somewhere, whereas
his Essence, though still inlarging (by this supposed
daily exercise of his power) the bounds of its actu∣all
coexistence with these new creatures, is in it
selfe altogether boundlesse. Omnipotency it selfe,
<PB N="56" REF="35"/>
cannot pitch a circumference to it, because nothing
can be, but it must be in it, which onely <HI>truly</HI> is, and
cannot bee contained in any thing imaginable. In
that all things are contained in him, he is rightly re∣sembled
by a sphere, which is of al figures the most
capacious. In that all things cannot comprehend
him, He is rightly resembled by a sphere whose cir∣cumference
is no where.</P>
<P>8 Two points notwithstanding in the former
resemblance seeme difficult to mens conceipts; but
more difficult it is fully to expresse what may
rightly be conceived concerning them. The former
difficulty is, how a Center should be conceived to
be every where: The second, how the indivisibi∣lity
of Gods presence in every place, should bee
compared unto a Center. To the former it may be
sayd, That as the divine Essence by reason of its ab∣solute
<HI>infinity,</HI> hath an absolute necessity of coex∣istence
with space or magnitude infinite: so were
it possible there should bee (as some Divines hold
it possible there may be) a magnitude or materiall
sphere actually infinite; this magnitude could have
no set point for its Center, but of every point de∣signable
in it, wee might avouch this is the Center
as well as that. Every point should have the nega∣tive
properties of a sphericall Center; there could
be no inequality betweene the distances of severall
points from the circumference of that which is in∣finite,
and hath no bounds of magnitude. To the
second difficulty it may bee said, The manner of di∣vine
presence or coexistence to every place or par∣cell
of bodies visible, is rightly compared unto a
<PB N="53" REF="35"/>
Center, in that it hath no diversity of parts, but is
indivisibly present to all and every part of things
divisible. His <HI>presence</HI> againe is herein like to mag∣nitude
actually <HI>infinite,</HI> in that it can have no cir∣cumference.
But whether the divine Essence may
have as perfect actuall coexistence to every point
or Center, as it hath to every least portion of mag∣nitudes
divisible, cannot so cleerely bee inferred
from the indivisibility of divine immensity, because
the indivisibility of Centers or points, and of spiri∣tuall
substances are Heterogeneall, and Heteroge∣nealls
are oft-times <HI>assymmetrall,</HI> that is, not exactly
commensurable. Hence the most subtill Schoole-men
or metaphysicall Divines, as well ancient as
moderne, resolve it as a point irresoluble by hu∣mane
wit, whether a mathematicall point or Cen∣ter
can be the compleat and <HI>definitive</HI> place of an
Angell, albeit they hold the Angelicall natures to
bee as truely indivisible, as points or Centers are.
But it is one thing for an immateriall or spirituall
Essence to have true coexistence with every Cen∣ter,
another to be confined to a Center, or to have
a definitive place or coexistence in it. And what∣soever
may bee thought of Angells; of the Divine
Essence we may say, that he is as properly in every
Center as in every place, seting wee acknowledge
<HI>Him</HI> to bee alike incomprehensibly and indivisibly
in both. The manner of his indivisibility we con∣ceive
by his coexistence to a Center. His incom∣prehensiblenesse,
by his coexistence to all spaces or
places imaginable, without coextension to any,
without comprehension in all. We may in no case
<PB N="58" REF="36"/>
imagine, that there is more of God, or that God is
more fully in a great space than in a little; in the
whole world, than in a man or little world. For this
once granted, an Asses head should participate the
essentiall presence of the Deity in greater measure
than a mans heart doth. But in what respects God
is said to bee more specially present in one place
than in another, or to be present with some, and ab∣sent
from others: hereafter.</P>
<P>9 The absolute perfection of this Attribute, in
whose right apprehension or conceipt many other
divine perfections, according to our manner of
conceiving them, are as it were couched or lodged,
may best bee gathered by opposition to the imper∣fections
of bodies or materiall magnitudes. A body
though of Homogeneall nature, suppose a Pole or
stone fixed in the earth, invironed <HI>above</HI> with water
and the ayre, can have no coexistence with these di∣vers
bodies, otherwise than according to the diver∣sity
of its owne parts: that part of it which hath
coexistence with the ayre, can have no coexistence
with the earth or water. Farre otherwise it is in
God, whose absolute infinity in that it is not com∣posed
of parts, but consists in perfect unity, cannot
bee coexistent to any place after any other manner
than <HI>He</HI> is coexistent to all, that is, by indivisible
unity or identity, Wheresoever <HI>He</HI> is (and <HI>Hee</HI> is
every where,) <HI>He</HI> is <HI>unity</HI> it selfe, <HI>infinity</HI> it selfe, <HI>im∣mensity</HI>
it selfe, <HI>perfection</HI> it selfe, <HI>power</HI> it selfe. All
these branches of quantity, in which we seek to in∣grasse
so many sorts of <HI>infinities,</HI> thereby to ex∣presse
or resemble <HI>His</HI> incomprehensible nature,
<PB N="59" REF="36"/>
do flow from participation of his infinite presence.
Vnlesse <HI>He</HI> were <HI>infinitie</HI> or <HI>immensity</HI> it selfe, there
could be no magnitude, no measure quantitative,
by whose multiplication wee could in any sort ga∣ther
or guesse what <HI>immensitie</HI> or <HI>infinitie</HI> meant.
That imaginary <HI>infinitie</HI> which wee conceive by
succession or composition of parts (for their seve∣rall
extensions finite, though in number infinite)
is but a transient raye or beame of that actuall and
stable infinitenesse, which <HI>Hee</HI> possesseth in perfect
unitie, without any imaginary diversity of parts
united. Had his <HI>immensity</HI> any diversity of parts,
there should be more power in many parts, than in
one, or few: unto the full exercise of his whole po∣wer
or force, there should bee a concurrence of all
parts required: &amp; this concurrence of parts in num∣ber
<HI>infinite,</HI> would perhaps be impossible. <HI>Infinitum
transire non potest.</HI> At the least, were divine power so
lodged in divine immensitie, as strēgth or power is
in our bodily faculties, it could not bee so omnipo∣tent,
as we beleeve it is. Our strength or force is al∣waies
increased by unition or cōtraction of severall
parts; His power can receive no increase seeing his
immensity excludes al division, &amp; doth not so pro∣perly
include, but rather properly is, Vnity it selfe.</P>
<P><HI>10 The Prophets and other holy men in their
patheticall expressions sometime speake of God as
farre absent, because his powerfull presence is not
manifested in such sort as they could wish.</HI> Oh that
thou wouldest rend the Heavens <HI>(saith the Prophet</HI>
Esa. c. 64. 1.) that thou wouldest come downe, that the
mountaines might flow down at thy presence: As when
<PB N="56" REF="37"/>
the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to
boile: to make thy name knowne to thine adversaries,
that the Nations may tremble at thy presence. When
thou diddest terrible things which wee looked not for,
thou camest downe, the mountaines flowed downe at
thy presence. <HI>But to indoctrinate us, that this de∣scription
of his powerfull presence did include no
dogmaticall assertion of his locall descent, no deny∣all
of his being everywhere, or filling every place
by his essentiall presence: the same Prophet else∣where
pictures out his</HI> immensity <HI>to us under the
shape of a Gyant able to squeze the whole Globe
of Heaven, Earth &amp; waters;</HI> Who hath measured the
waters in the hollow of his hand? &amp; meted out heaven
with his span, and comprehended the dust of the earth
in his three fingers <HI>(after such a manner as men take
up dust or sand)</HI> and weighed the mountaines in
scales, and the hills in a ballance? <HI>Esay 40. 12.</HI> Be∣hold
the Nations are as a drop of a Bucket, and are
counted as the small dust of the Ballance. Behold, he
taketh up the Isles as a very little thing. All Nations
before him are as nothing, and they are accounted to
him lesse than nothing and vanity, <HI>vers. 15. 17. Thus
hee linketh his essentiall presence with his power
and knowledge.</HI> Why sayest thou O Iacob, and speakest
O Israel; My way is hid from the Lord, and my
Iudgement is passed over from my God? Hast thou
not knowne? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting
God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the Earth
fainteth not, neither is wearie? there is no search∣ing
of his understanding. <HI>vers. 27, 28. Yet</HI> Iob <HI>in
his anguish had almost said as</HI> Iacob <HI>did;</HI> O that
<PB N="61" REF="37"/>
I knew where I might finde him! that I might come e∣ven
to his seat! I would know the words which he would
answer me &amp; understand what he would say unto me.
Behold, I go forward but he is not there, and backward
but I cannot perceive him: On the left hand where he
doth worke, but I cannot behold him: he hideth him∣selfe
on the right hand, that I cannot see him. Iob 23.
3, 5, 8, 9. <HI>But though he might hide himselfe from</HI>
Iob, <HI>yet could not</HI> Iob <HI>hide himselfe or his wayes
from him: for so he confesseth in the next words,</HI>
He knoweth the way which I take, <HI>vers. 10.</HI> Whither
shall I goe <HI>(saith the Psalmist)</HI> from thy Spirit? or
whither shall I flye from thy presence? If I ascend up
into Heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in Hell,
behold thou art there. If I take the wings of the mor∣ning
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the Sea; even
there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall
hold me, &amp;c. Psal. 139. vers. 7, 8, 9, 10. Thou hast
possest my reines; thou hast covered me in my mothers
wombe. <HI>These and the like straines of other godly
men, argue a sympathy of Gods essentiall presence,
not onely invironing their bodies, but penetrating
their soules, and diffused through their hearts. His
coexistence with all, his essentiall presence or inha∣bitation
in all, is the same, although the worldly
minded take no notice of it. And when it is sayd,
that he</HI> beholdeth <HI>or</HI> knoweth <HI>the ungodly</HI> afarre off,
<HI>this language fitly expresseth their conceit of him,
and of his essence. They consider not, that hee is
alwayes neere unto them, alwayes about them, al∣wayes
within them, but in heaven onely, whither
their thoughts seldome ascend. And according to
<PB N="62" REF="38"/>
their misconceit of him, so it happens to them, they
imagine him to be farre distant from them, and his
helpe and succour in their distresse comes slowly to
them, as if it had too farre to goe.</HI></P>

time or duration successive (in what finite substan∣ces
soever they bee seated,) with all their severall

and unto eternity, they have if not the same propor∣tion,

yet the same references, the same dependan∣ces
on it, which finite and created magnitudes have
to Divine immensity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide Ter∣tul. in Apo∣loget. cap. 48▪</NOTE> As there was from all eter∣nity
a possibility for us to bee before wee were; so
our actuall being or existence, whilest it lasteth, is
composed of a <HI>capacity</HI> to be what we are, and of
the <HI>actuation</HI> or filling of this capacity. Life (sensi∣tive
especially) is but the motion or progresse of
this capacity towards that which fills it, or as it
were a continuall sucking in of present existence, or
continuation of actuall being, from somewhat prae∣existent.
Vnlesse the vegetables, by which our life
is continued, had existence before they become
our nutriment, they could not possibly nourish us,
or continue us in that estate of being which we
have. Nor could these Vegetables themselves ex∣ist,
unlesse they did draw their existence or conti∣nuation
of their being, from that which did every
way exist before them; and unto which they doe
by motion or continuation of their being approch.
So that future times, and all things contained in
time it selfe, presuppose a fountaine of life, as truly
praeexistent to their future terminations or moti∣ons,
as it was to their beginnings. That description
of time <HI>[tempus edax rerum,] as if it were the devou∣rer
of all things which are subject to alteration,</HI> did
rellish more of poeticall wit, than of any metaphy∣sicall
truth. For if time did devoure al things which
are brought forth in time, what is it that could pos∣sibly
nourish them, or continue their <HI>being</HI> from
their beginning to their end? whilest the time ap∣pointed
for them lasts, they cannot possibly be con∣sumed

or perish. Nothing there is that doth or can
desire its owne destruction, nor long after the pre∣sence
or fruition of that, which doth devoure or
destroy it. All things naturally desire the continu∣ation
of such being, as they have; which notwith∣standing
things temporall cannot have, but from
the continuation or fruition of time. Time then it is
not, but their owne motions or endeavors to injoy
or entertaine time approching, which doth waste or
consume things temporall. We naturally seeke to
catch time, and it is the nature of time, though con∣tinually
caught, not to be held by us. This nimble∣nesse
of time, is so like unto the swift progresse of
motion, that some acknowledge no difference at
all betweene them. Whereas in true Philosophy,
the length of time passing by us, is onely notified
by motion. Motion in true observation goes one
way, and drives time another, as the streame which
runnes Eastward, turnes the Wheele Westward.
Our actuall being or existence slides from us with
time, and our capacity of being, continuing still the
same, runnes on still, being alwayes internally mo∣ved
with desire of <HI>actuation</HI> or <HI>replenishment.</HI> And
this replenishment cannot otherwise bee gotten,
than by gaining a new coexistence with time ap∣proaching,

that being which is to come, nor can it rest, seeing
it drawes or suckes in that being which it hath by
doing now this and now that, being moved as it

what it is. Nor are we men, or any creatures (spe∣cially
generable) permitted to draw or sucke so
much of our proper being from the fountaine of <HI>E∣ternity,</HI>
at once, or in any one point of time, as we
list. We have our portions of life or selfe-fruition
distributed piece-meale and sparingly unto us, lest
too much put into our hands at once, might make
us prodigall of the whole stock. As may yonglings

whilest their experience is small, overthrow them∣selves

all at once. Whereas fruition of delights and
pleasures should be measured by the capacity of our
estate or condition; as wise men fit their expences
according to the tenour of their revennues.</P>
<P>2 Albeit the constant motion of the <HI>Sunne</HI> and

some whiles it is, the fruition of it could not quite
the paines we are put to in preserving it. And the
worse our estate is, the longer it seemeth to bee
such, because vitall existence or duration, through
distraction of mind, or vehement motion, seemeth
divided into more parts, then without such impul∣sions
it could take notice of. In griefe or paine wee
strive to thrust time present apace from us, that
some other may come better attended. In delight
or pleasure wee seeke to arrest it, and wish to have
our joyfull moments fixed, or to have them still to
returne and goe, so that wee might prolong our
daies by living the same times over and over again,
as men often walke longer in pleasant gardens, then
in vast fields, by often resuming the same short
<PB N="67" REF="40"/>
walkes. Were it possible for us to stay those grate∣full
parcels of time, till new ones come with like
supply; the current of pleasure, thus damnd vp,
would swell; and our fruition of such imperfect
existence as we have, would be much more perfect
and entire. But seeing the pleasure of borrowed
life, is to the identity of being, but as water to the
pipe, through which it runnes; all the remedy wee
have against welcome times departing from us, is
to regain the like, and make up the unity of our ex∣istence
of selfe-fruition by equivalency. The gluts
or gushes of pleasure, may at one time bee much
greater than at another, yet still transient, never
consistent. The fruition of them cannot possibly
be entire: begotten and dying in every moment;
they are, and they are not in a manner, both at
once; so that we lose them as we gaine them.</P>
<P>3 The Angelicall natures, albeit they account
not the continuation of their duration, nor number
the portions of their participation of eternity, by
the motion of the heavens, as being not fed with
expectance of that time or successiō, whose oppor∣tunites
wee watchfully attend: yet their desires
(more fervent by much then we have any) to conti∣nue
what they are, witness they have not all that in
present possession, w<SUP>ch</SUP> is allotted to their compleat
duration. <HI>Nothing,</HI> being the foundation as well of
angelical excellēcies, as of our mediocrities, makes
them uncapable of that entire selfe-fruition, which
is essentiall to him which made thē of <HI>nothing,</HI> be∣ing
made of none. He, as he is of himselfe without
beginning, so is he entirely in himselfe, and can ac∣quire
<PB N="68" REF="41"/>
nothing by succession. He desires not his own
duration, w<SUP>ch</SUP> none can give him, nor needs he to de∣sire
it, because it is alway entirely &amp; indivisibly pre∣sent,
without possility of addition. For how should
<HI>Essence</HI> it selfe, or infinity of <HI>being,</HI> get ought to
morrow, which to day it hath not; or lose ought to
day which yesterday it had. The first branch of im∣possibility
w<SUP>ch</SUP> we can conceive as incident to him,
that is thus truly <HI>infinite,</HI> is, not all times to con∣taine
within himselfe all fulnesse of joy, however
possible. He is life it selfe, &amp; therfore life truly infi∣nite.
And infinite life, being infinitely sweet, con∣taineth
joy truly infinite; altogether uncapable of
any addition or diminution. As in a body infinite
(could any such be) there could be no middle or ex∣treams;
so neither can infinite life admit any parts,
as being indivisible into duration subsequent &amp; pre∣cedent.
Natures, capable of these differences, have
alwayes the one accomplished by the other. Time
comming (as we said before) repaires the losses of
time going, and perfects or supports things natu∣rall
by successive continuance of present being. But
perfection it selfe can no more bee perfected, than
<HI>whitenesse</HI> can be dyed <HI>white.</HI> Life, or Essence <HI>infi∣nite,</HI>
excludes vacuity, or capacity of resumed acts
to fill up the measure of actuall existence, or fruiti∣on
of <HI>being.</HI> In that he is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>All-sufficient,</HI> he
can want nothing; and to him that can want no∣thing,
all must be present. We must then conceive
of the Divine Essence, as infinite, not onely in life,
but in the degrees or acts of life: which in the eter∣nall
cannot be many, but onely take the denomina∣tion
<PB N="69" REF="41"/>
of plurality, from things decreed. As Hee is
said Everlasting with reference to the perpetuity of
succession, which still supposeth his interminate
existence, as present to the whole and every part of
it. Consider <HI>him</HI> in himselfe, and He is every way
indivisibly infinite, and interminable; not onely be∣cause
Hee had no beginning, nor shall have ending:
For so might time or motion be held interminable,
could the Heavens have beene created from Ever∣lasting;
whose revolutions neverthelesse or succes∣sive
parts of motion, should have beene truly nu∣merable,
and therefore terminable; whence what∣soever
had beene contained within their circuit,
should still have gotten somewhat which before it
had not, either addition of duration, or (which is
all one) continuance of their first existence, or
some new Acts of life, of sense, or reason. But un∣to
Essence infinite, none of these can accrue. If
they could, as yet he should not be, nor ever could
Hee bee actually eternall, but everlastingly onely
by succession. For Eternity, as <HI>Boetius</HI> hath well de∣fined
it, <HI>is the entire or totall possession of intermina∣ble
life, all at once or together.</HI> Howbeit these termes
of totall fruition or possession, may seeme to in∣clude
some parts, though not in the life possessed,
yet in the possession of it; which (I take it) was farre
from this good Authors meaning. What meant he
then to use such tearmes? onely to exclude succes∣sion,
which hath a totality of Being, but not alto∣gether,
or all at once. As the next houre, and what∣soever
shall have successive duration in it, shall bee
wholly and fully existent; but so as one part shall
<PB N="70" REF="42"/>
goe before, another come after. So is not that du∣ration
which is interminable. But in what sense <HI>to∣tality</HI>
is attributed to <HI>essence</HI> or <HI>duration infinite,</HI>
will better appeare in the issue of these explicati∣ons.
This definition of <HI>Boetius,</HI> though concei∣ved
in such termes as might minister occasion of
wrangling in subtile disputes; doth notwithstan∣ding
imprint a more lively character or notion of
the Everliving God his infinite happinesse, than
<HI>Aquinas</HI> definition doth, though very artificial:
<HI>[Aeternitas est duratio manens, uniformis, sine prin∣cipio,

uniforme, and permanent, without beginning or
end, uncapable of measure.</HI></P>

or indeficiency of that which is <HI>Eternall;</HI> it breeds
a wandring imagination of plurality or indivisibility
of duration. The best medicine, by his prescripti∣on,
for purging our brains of this erroneous fancy,
were to enstyle <HI>Eternity</HI> onely with the name of
<HI>Entity</HI> or <HI>Being.</HI> But as <HI>being</HI> is a name sufficient to
expresse <HI>Essence,</HI> and <HI>Essence</HI> it selfe, or <HI>essence</HI> inde∣pendent
a full expression of <HI>Eternity:</HI> yet because
some Philosophers comprise generation, or the <HI>be∣ing</HI>
of things generable under the name of Essence,
it was behooveful for our better instruction, to say,
<HI>that is Eternall,</HI> which alwaies is, &amp; cannot cease to
be. Whereas in true Philosophicall contemplation,
it is not one thing, <HI>truly</HI> to bee, and alwayes to <HI>Be.</HI>
There is no greater difference betwixt these two,
than to be a Philosopher, and to be a true Philoso∣pher.
Now there can be no truth in saying, he is a
Philosopher, who is no true Philosopher, for <HI>[ens
&amp; verum convertuntur] The Entity of every thing
necessarily includes the truth of every thing.</HI> Not∣withstanding
because some doe counterfeit Philo∣sophy,
or falsly usurpe the name of Philosophers;
we give the title with an addition to such as wel de∣serve
it, and enstyle them, by way of <HI>difference</HI> from
the others, <HI>true Philosophers.</HI> And in like manner,
when we say, <HI>That is eternall,</HI> which alwayes is; wee
seeke to notifie no more by this universall note,
<HI>Alwaies,</HI> then that it hath a true and no counterfeit,
no second-hand or dependent <HI>Being.</HI></P>
<P>Another secondary and subordinate use of the
universall signe, <HI>alwayes,</HI> added to <HI>entity,</HI> is, to inti∣mate
the interminable, indistinguishable <HI>&amp; indivi∣visible
<PB N="72" REF="43"/>
power,</HI> which needeth nothing besides that
which it actually and for the present hath. Now it
hath <HI>All,</HI> that is or can bee, in that it truly <HI>Is:</HI> for
true <HI>entity</HI> is absolute <HI>totality,</HI> and unto totalitie,
nothing is wanting. But that which is in time com∣prehended,
how perfect or totall soever it may bee
in its kinde, besides other wants, alway needs some∣what
to come, never fully besped of time. On the
contrary, that which so is, as it needs no after <HI>being,</HI>
and cannot be brought within the lists of time, ei∣ther
determinate, or in succession infinite, but now
hath whatsoever is expedient to bee had: this is
that, which our notion of Eternity hunteth after.
That which thus is, hath not its Essence or Being
delivered unto it enwrapt in quantity, but is pre∣cedent
to all quantity or mensuration. Farre
otherwise have things generable their <HI>being,</HI> as it
were spun out from divisibility. The very first be∣ing
which they have supposeth quantity, and as
much as is cut off from the <HI>draught</HI> or extension of
their duration, so much they lose of their being or
perfection.</P>
<P>5 Ignorance of this Plotinicall Philosophie
hath much perplext some Logi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians, questioning
<HI>whether Socrates</HI> in the instant of his dissolution or
corruption, be a man, or corps, or both. To be both
implyes a contradiction; these two negative pro∣positions
being simply convertible, No corps can
be a man, no man can bee a corps. And yet there
is as much reason, that he should in this instant bee
both as either. For true resolution we are to say, He
was a man, and shall be a corps, or he ceaseth to bee
<PB N="73" REF="43"/>
the one, and begins to be the other. But the Being
or existence of both being mensurable by time,
must needs bee divisible, and for this reason, not
comprehensible by an <HI>instant</HI> which is indivisible.
But <HI>Plotins</HI> conclusion is, whilest wee seeke to fit
that which truly is, with any portion of measure or
degree of quantity, the life of it being thus divided
by us, loseth its indivisible nature; We must then
leave it (as it is) <HI>indivisible,</HI> as well in life or opera∣tion,
as in Essence, and yet infinite in both.</P>
<P>Of time, no part truly is, but the present, which
is never the same: and as one questioned (in that
age wherein the Art of Navigation was imperfect)
whether Navigators were to be reckoned amongst
the dead or the living: So it is more doubtfull
then determinable, whether time participate more
of being, or of not being; yet as is time, such is the
nature of things brought forth in time. But <HI>Eternity</HI>
(being the duration of <HI>Him</HI> who onely <HI>Is,</HI> being
made of none, but Maker of all things, and the
dispenser of Time it selfe into its portions) as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ad 7. Plo∣tin. lib. En∣nead. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Fi∣cinus</HI>
describes it, is as a fixed instant or perma∣nent
Center, which needs no succession for sup∣ply;
<HI>all sufficient</HI> to support it selfe, and all things
else. The same Writer not unfitly compares <HI>Eter∣nity</HI>
to a Center in a Circle; and time to the points
or extremities of the lines in the Circumference,
alwayes so moving about the Center, that were it
an <HI>eye,</HI> it might view them all at once. Yet must we
not hold <HI>Eternity</HI> to be indivisible, after the same
manner that points or Centers are. These are indi∣visible,
because they want the perfection of that
<PB N="74" REF="44"/>
quantity, whose parts they couple. <HI>Eternity</HI> is in∣divisible
by positive <HI>infinite,</HI> as containing all the
parts or perfections possible of succession in a
more eminent manner, then they can be contained
in time it selfe, which (as <HI>Plato</HI> wittily observes) is
a moveable image of <HI>Eternity.</HI> This difference be∣twixt
the indivisibility of an instant or moment,
and Eternity, may perhaps make the solution of
that seeming contradiction lesse difficult then it is
to some great Schoolemens apprehensions: <HI>[Pe∣trus
in aeternitate agrotat, Et, Petrus in aeternitate nō
aegrotat.] Peter is sick in eternity, Peter is not sicke in
eternity.</HI> This affirmation &amp; deniall, in one and the
same indivisible instant or limited portion of time,
would inferrean indivisible contradiction, which
in eternity they doe not. And yet is Eternity more
indivisible than an instant, but indivisible after ano∣ther
manner.</P>
<P>6 But I know not how it comes to passe, that
the true shadow of perfection it selfe, is oft-times
more apparant in things most imperfect. Natures
more perfect (by a borrowed perfection) hold the
meane betweene them; Out of both we may spell
more than we can put together, for right expres∣sing
the nature of perfectiō it selfe. The prime mat∣ter,
though of things created most imperfect, is of
creatures sublunary, most like unto the Creator, in
being ingenerable and incorruptible; in that it is the
<HI>Alpha</HI> whence all things generable spring, and the
<HI>Omega</HI> into which they are resolved: Yet is the
prime matter most contrary to its Maker, in that
wherein it doth resemble Him. It is in a sort or
<PB N="75" REF="44"/>
manner, all things generable, but perfectly nothing,
as wanting the true unity of Entity, or determinate
Being. The Creator or Essence it selfe, is the in∣comprehensible
perfection of all things, without
participation of their imperfections. The Earth
againe is like the Eternall Founder in permanency
and immobility, but this it hath from its naturall
dulnesse; whereas the perfection of this shadow is
in Him from the infinite vigour of his vitality. The
swift motions of the Heavens, or motion as swift as
we may imagine, is as a middle terme of proporti∣on
between the Earths immobility, and the super∣motion,
or more then infinite mobility of the Dei∣tie,
which we tearme the infinite vigour of his vi∣tality.
<HI>Instants</HI> in this are most like <HI>Eternity,</HI> in that
an infinite number of them added together, yeelds
no increase of quantity: Nor doth Eternity re∣ceive
addition from succession infinite, which most
unlike it in being divisible, doth yet better expresse
the positive infinity of it, than <HI>instants</HI> can doe. E∣ternity
againe, is like a fixed Center, because indivi∣sibly
immutable; yet withall most like a circle. And
<HI>Trismegists</HI> description of the Deity, <HI>commutatis
commutandis,</HI> as well exemplifies the Eternity, as
the immensity of his nature. Eternity is a circular
duration, whose <HI>instants</HI> are, <HI>alwayes,</HI> whose <HI>termi∣nations</HI>
or <HI>extremities</HI> never <HI>were,</HI> never <HI>shall be:</HI> It is
coexistent to every parcell of time, but not circum∣scriptible
by any: succession infinite cannot be coe∣quall
to it. For albeit the motion of the Heavens,
or other notifications of duration divisible, should
continue the same, without interruption or End:
<PB N="76" REF="45"/>
yet every period and draught of time, we can ima∣gine,
shall still fall within Eternity, now totally ex∣istent;
and which hath beene, is, and ever will be un∣to
every minute or scrupe of time, that hath beene,
is, or shall be, alike everlastingly coexistent, not by
acquisition of any new successive parts, but by in∣divisible
and interminable unity.</P>
<P>7 We cannot perhaps properly say, that God
shall be after all times or durations to come; for du∣ration
must flow from <HI>His Everlasting Being</HI> with∣out
end. And what can be after that which hath no
end? And here we suppose, that albeit time or dura∣tion
successive had their actuall beginning with the
creatures: yet there shal be, or may be, if not a time,
yet some duration successively infinite. And that
onely is after this manner, infinite, unto which
somewhat of the same kinde may still bee added.
Thus, as in the continued and divisible quantities,
<HI>[non datur minimum.]</HI> There is no fraction so little,
but may be lesse; and as in numbers <HI>[non datur max∣imum]</HI>
There is no number so great, but it may be
made greater by addition: so in successive durati∣on
<HI>[non datur ultimum.]</HI> It may be truly said to last
for ever, because it can have no last portion. But
howsoever we cannot properly, or without expo∣sing
our speech to captious exceptions, say, that
<HI>eternity</HI> shal be after all time or duration successive;
(seeing this may seeme to import, that duration or
succession shall finally cease:) yet that <HI>eternity</HI> (be∣ing
<HI>duration,</HI> actually, interminably and indivisibly,
not successively, <HI>infinite)</HI> now is, and ever was, as
infinitely praeexistent or precedent to all ages, or
<PB N="77" REF="45"/>
successions comming towards us, one way; as it is
and was to the worlds nativity, or the first out-go∣ing
of time, the other way. This is a point which
we must beleeve, if we rightly beleeve God to bee
Eternall, or know what Eternity is. A point, which
would to God they had seriously and in heart con∣sidered,
which have had Gods eternall decree and
the awards of it, most frequently in their mouthes
and pens. And he is no Christian that would deny
whatsoever is by God decreed, was so decreed be∣fore
all worlds: So is he no Christian Philosopher,
much lesse a true Christian <HI>Divine,</HI> that shall refer
or retract the tenor of this speech <HI>[Before all worlds]</HI>
to that only which is past, before the world began.
Whatsoever can be more properly said or concei∣ved
to be past, then to be yet to come, or to bee in
every moment of time designable, can have no
property of Eternity. For that onely is Eternall,
which alwayes is, and so alwaies is, that it hath pre∣cedence
or praeexistence infinite to all successions,
which way soever wee looke upon them, or take
their beginning, whether backwards or forwards.
It was a great oversight (or rather want of insight
into the nature of this great Sphere or visible
world) in <HI>Lactantius,</HI> (otherwise a learned Christi∣an)
not onely to deny there were any Antipodes,
but to censure the Philosophers (which had gone
before him) of grosse ignorance or infatuation, for
avouching this truth, now manifested to meaner
Scholars, or more illiterate Christians, than any
which <HI>Lactantius</HI> taught. A greater ignorance it
would be in us which acknowledge this truth, to
<PB N="78" REF="46"/>
say these Antipodes were under the earth, and the
inhabitants of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> onely above it;
or that the Heavens were as farre under our Anti∣podes,
as they are above us. For whosoever walkes
on the earth, whether in this Region or that, whe∣ther
at the halfe or full Antipodes, is above the
earth. And every part of the Heavens unto which
the lookes of men are erected, as well the <HI>Nadir</HI> as
the <HI>Zenith,</HI> as well the <HI>South pole</HI> as the <HI>North-pole</HI>
is above the earth. And as the Heavens are every
way above the Earth, so is <HI>Eternity</HI> every way be∣fore
all worlds, before all times. As we beleeve this
visible world and all things in it, had a beginning;
so we expect it shall have an end: Now the eye of
Eternall Providence lookes through the world,
through all the severall ages, successions, or durati∣ons
in the world; as well from the last end to their
first beginning, as from their first beginning to their
last end. There is no period of time to us imagina∣ble,
which is not so invironed by Eternity, as the
Earth or Center is with the Heavens; save onely
that the Heavens are finite, and Eternity infinite.
So that the Heavens though far every way, are no
way infinitely above the Earth; whereas Eternity
or Gods <HI>eternall</HI> decree, are every way infinitely
before all worlds, before all times. In this sense,
were it possible, the world might have beene crea∣ted,
or motions continued from everlasting; the
<HI>Eternall,</HI> notwithstanding, should have been ever∣lastingly
before them. For that period of motion
which must terminate the next million of yeares,
shall have coexistence with Eternity now existent;
<PB N="79" REF="46"/>
whose <HI>infinity</HI> doth not grow with succession, nor
extend it selfe with motion; but stands immovable
with times present, being eternally before times
future, as wel in respect of any set draught or point,
whence we imagine time future to come towards
us, as in respect of the first revolution of the Hea∣vens,
whence time tooke beginning. Or, to speake
as we thinke, it is impossible to conceive any dura∣tion
to be without beginning and ending; without
conceiving it circular, and altogether void of suc∣cession.
Notwithstanding, if any list to imagine
time both wayes everlasting; the continuity of it
may be best conceived by the uninterrupted fluxe
of an <HI>instant;</HI> and the stability of eternity, by the
retraction of such a perpetuall <HI>fluxe</HI> into one du∣rable
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> permanent instant.</P>
<P>8 O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, not to suffer the remembrance of childish
sports altogether to passe without any use or obser∣vation,
if not for composing some greatest contro∣versies
amongst learned men, yet for facilitating
contemplation in one of the greatest difficulties,
that Philosophy, whether sacred or humane, affords
to the conceit of the most curious. The difficulty
is, how eternity being permanent and indivisible,
should have coexistence with succession or motion.
We have seene a Top turne so swiftly upon the
same center, in a manner, that it seemed rather to
sleepe or rest, than to move. And whilest it thus
swiftly moved, any bright marke or conspicuous
spot, how little soever, seemed to be turned into an
entire and permanent circle. Seeing motion thus
swift, may be procured by a weake arme, it will be
<PB N="80" REF="47"/>
no hard supposal to conceit that a <HI>mover</HI> of strength
and vigour infinite, should be able to move a body
in a moment. Admit then the highest visible sphere
should be moved about in a moment; all the several
parts of successive motion, which now it hath,
would be contracted into perfect unity: which
whether it should be called a cessation from moti∣on,
or a vigorous rest, or a <HI>supermotion,</HI> actually
containing in it parts of motion successively infinit,
were not so easie to determine. If thus it were mo∣ved
about in an instant, the nature of it supposed to
be incorruptible, and the <HI>mover</HI> immortall, remain∣ing
still in the same strength and minde; he would
not move it more slowly this day or yeare, than he
did the former. This supposition admitted, there
should bee not onely parts successively infinite of
one revolution, but revolutions successiuely infinit
in one and the same instant. Or to speake more
properly; As these revolutions should not proper∣ly
be termed motion, but rather the product of mo∣tions
infinitely swift, united or made up into a vi∣gorous
permanency: so should not the duration of
one or of all these revolutions bee accounted as an
instant or portion of time, but a kinde of eternity
or duration indivisibly permanent. The motion of
the eight sphere supposed to be such as hath beene
said, that is motion infinitely swift, or not divisible
by succession; the Sunne moving successively as
now it doth, should have locall coexistence to eve∣rie
starre in the eight Sphere, to every point of the
Eclipticke circle wherein it moves, at one and the
selfe same instant, or in every least parcell of time.
<PB N="81" REF="47"/>
Every Star in the eighth sphere, every point should
be converted into a permanent circle; and so in one
circle there should be circles for number infinite, as
many circles as there bee points or divisibilities in
the Ecliptique circle. Thus in Him that is eternall,
are <HI>Beings</HI> infinite, and in <HI>Eternity</HI> are actually con∣tained
durations in succession infinite. The former
supposition admitted, we could not say that the in∣feriour
Orbes, moving as now they doe, did move
after the eighth Sphere, but that the times of their
motion were eminently contained in it. For the
eighth Sphere being moved in an instant, should
lose the divisibility of time, and the nature of moti∣on,
with all the properties that accompany them,
not by defect, (as if it no way comprised them,)
but by swallowing up time or division successively
or potentially infinite, into an actuall permanency.
By this supposition of passive motion made infinite∣ly
swift, by the strength of the mover, and impro∣ved
into a kinde of actuall indivisible permanency,
we may conceive of the first Movers Eternity, as
Mathematicians conceive the true nature of a
Sphere, by imagining it to be produced by the mo∣tion
of a <HI>semicircle</HI> upon the Axis. For let the <HI>E∣ternall</HI>
be but thus imagined to bee an intellectuall
sphere, capable of momentary motion or revolu∣tion
throughout this world; and the indivisible co∣existence
of his infinity, to every part of time and
place, will be very conceivable. Yet as Mathema∣ticians
perswade not themselves, their figures are
produced by motion, but rightly conceive their
nature to be such without any production, as if they
<PB N="82" REF="48"/>
were so produced: so let eternall duration bee
esteemed more indivisible, than the unity of moti∣on
conceived as infinitely swift, yet not made indi∣visible
by such swiftnesse of motion, but indivisible

contracted into stability hath unto succession, hath
divine Essence to all other Essences, <HI>eminently</HI> con∣taining

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the infinity of Divine Power.</HEAD>
<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He circumstances of time and
place are presupposed, the
one as spectator, the other as
stage to all things, which
wanting place or time, or be∣ing
it self, present themselves
anew in their proper shape
and forme. But of things so presented, operation
or power in their kinde is the native and immedi∣ate
property. Nothing that hath any proper seat
or existence numerable in this spacious <HI>Amphithe∣atre,</HI>
but is fitted for acting some part or other use∣full
for the maintenance of the whole. Now all o∣peration
or power, which (according to the varie∣ty
of things created) is manifold and diverse, doth
give but such a shadow of that infinite power,
which is eminently contained in the union of infi∣nite
Essence, as time and place did of his immensity
and eternity. The force and vertue of some things
may perhaps more properly be termed strength or
power passive, then operation. Howbeit even in
the earth and earthly bodies, by nature most dull,
there is a power or strength to sustaine waights
laid upon them; a power to resist contrary impulsi∣ons,
which perhaps essentially includes an active
force or operation; a power of swaying to the
center, which is no more passive than active, but a
<PB N="84" REF="49"/>
meane betwixt both. Even in the dullest body that
is, there is a secret force or slow activity to assimi∣late
other things to themselves, or to preserve sym∣bolizing
natures. In bodies lesse grosse and more
unapt to resist violence offered, as in the windes,
vapours, or exhalations, or in the spirits or influ∣ences
which guide our bodies, we may perceive an
active force or power motive fully answerable to
the greatest passive strength or resistance. Other E∣lements
or mixt bodies, are indued with an opera∣tive
power of producing the like, or destroying
contraries. Celestiall bodies, the Sunne especially,
have a productive force to bring forth plants out of
their roots, to nourish and continue life in al things.
It is perhaps impossible, for any thing, that hath
not being of it selfe, to receive infinity of being in
any kind from another, though infinite. Impossible
for the fire, because the substance of it is finite, to be
infinitely hot; but were it such, it would be infinite
in operation.</P>
<P>2 As the Author or first setter forth of all things
operative, who alone truly <HI>is,</HI> surpasseth all conceit
of any distinct or numerable branch of <HI>being:</HI> so is
his power more eminently infinite in every kinde,
than all the united powers of severall natures, each
supposed infinitely operative in its owne kinde, and
for number likewise infinite, can bee conceived to
be. Now what was generally observed before, that
things by nature most imperfect, doe oftentimes
best shadow divine perfections, hath place againe
in this particular. Gods infinite power is clearliest
manifested in creatures which seem least powerful.
<PB N="85" REF="49"/>
<HI>Where wast thou</HI> (said God to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Cap. 38. vers. 4, 5, 6.</NOTE> <HI>Iob) when I laid the
foundations of the Earth? declare if thou hast under∣standing.
Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou
knowest? Or who hath stretched the line upon it?
Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or
who laid the corner stone thereof?</HI> The excellent
majesty of this speech, sufficiently testifies it was
uttered by God himselfe, though taken from his
mouth, by the pen of man. But setting aside the ma∣jesticke
phrase or resemblance, farre surmounting
all resemblance all observance of poeticall <HI>decorum;</HI>
What cleerer fountaine of deeper admiration, can
the eye of mans understanding looke into, then
this, that not onely every corner stone in the world
with its full burthen, but all the mighty buildings
or erections, which are seene upon the whole sur∣face
of the earth; yea the whole earth it selfe, with
all the mountaines and rockes upon it, with all the
metalls or massie substance that are within it,
should be borne up by that which is lesse than any
corner stone, by that which indeed is no body or
substance, not so much as a meere angle or corner.
Yet so it hath pleased <HI>Him,</HI> by whose wisedome
the foundations of the earth were layd; to make
that little point or indivisible Center; which is far∣thest
removed from our sight, the most conspicu∣ous
place and seate of that indivisible power
which is infinite. Let Mathematicians imagine
what rules or reasons of equipendence they list,
their last resolution of all supportance into the
Center, must suppose the same truth which
the Aegyptian Magicians confessed, <HI>[Hic digitus
<PB N="86" REF="50"/>
Dei est] The finger of God is here.</HI> Impossible it were
for <HI>that,</HI> which in it selfe is matter of nothing, im∣pregnably
to support all things supportable; unlesse
it were supported by the finger of God. And yet
if we conceive of <HI>Him,</HI> as <HI>Isaias</HI> describes <HI>Him,</HI>
all the strength and power that is manifested in the
supportance of the whole earth, and all therein, is
not the strength of his little finger. Yea though
wee should imagine, that as the waight of solids
amounts according to their masse or quantity: so
the sustentative force, which is chambered up in
the Center, should be multiplyed according to the
severall portions or divisibilities of magnitude
successively immensurable: yet this imagination
of force so multiplyed, it being divisible, could not
equalize that true and reall conceipt of force di∣vine,
which ariseth from consideration, that it is in∣divisibly
seated, throughout immensity. To uphold
earths innumerable much weightier and massier
than this is, which borne by him, beareth all things;
would be no burthen to his power sustentative: (so
from the effects, his power, though in it selfe one,
must receive from us plurality of denominations.)
And yet fully commensurable to this power susten∣tative,
is his active strength or power motive. He
that spans the Heavens with his fist, could tosse this
Vniverse with greater ease, than a Gyant doth a
Tennis Ball, throughout the boundlesse Courts of
immensity. Rocks of Adamant would sooner dis∣solve
with the least fillep of his finger, than bubbles
of water with the breath of Canons.</P>
<P>3 Our admiration of this his active power,
<PB N="87" REF="50"/>
which we conceive as incomprehensible, and alto∣gether
uncapable of increase, may bee raised by cal∣culating
the imaginary degrees of active powers
increase in creatures divisible, as well in quantity,
as operation. Though Powder converted into
smoake, be the common mother of all force, which
issueth from the terrible mouth of the Gunne: yet
the Canon sends forth his bullet (though more apt
to resist externall motion) with greater violence
than the <HI>Sachar:</HI> and every <HI>Ordinance</HI> exceeds o∣ther
in force of battery, according to the quantity
of the charge or length of barrell. But were it pos∣sible
for the same quantity of steele or iron, to bee
as speedily converted into such a fiery vapour, as
gunpowder is; the blow would be ten times more
irresistible then any, that Gunpowder out of the
same close concavity, can make. The reason is
plaine; the more solid or massie the substance to be
dissolved, is, the greater quantity would it yeeld of
fire, or other rarer substance, into which it were dis∣solved.
And the greater the quantity, the more vio∣lent
is the contraction of it into the same narrow
roome: and the more violent the contraction is,
the more vehement is the eruption, and the ejacu∣lation
swifter. Thus from vapours rarified or ge∣nerated
in greater quantity, than the concavities of
the earth, wherein they are imprisoned without
vent, is naturally capable of; doe Earthquakes be∣come
so terrible: These and the like experiments
bring forth this generall rule, <HI>The active strength of
bodies multiplieth, according to the manner of con∣traction
or close unition of parts concurring to the im∣pulsion
<PB N="88" REF="51"/>
or eruption:</HI> So doth the active force or vi∣gour
of motion, alwayes increase, according to the
degrees of celerity which it accumulates. Now
though the most active and powerfull essence can∣not
be encompassed with walls of brass, nor cham∣bred
up in vaults of steele, albeit much wider than
the heavens; yet doth it every where more strictly
gird it selfe with strength then the least or weakest
body can be girt. For what bonds can we prescribe
so strict, so close or firme, as is the bond of indivi∣sible
unity, which cannot possibly burst or admit
eruption, wherein notwithstanding infinite power
doth as intirely and totally encampe it selfe, as in
immensity. How incomparably then doth His
active strength exceed all conceipt or comparison?
The vehemency of his motive power, whose infi∣nite
Essence swallowes up the infinite degrees of
succession in a fixed instant, and of motion in vigo∣rous
rest; cannot bee exprest by motion so swift
and strong, as would beare levell from the Sunne
setting in the West, to the Moon rising in the East.
To cast the fixed Starres downe to the Center, or
hoyse the Earth up to the Heavens, within the
twinkling of an eye, or to send both in a moment
beyond the extremities of this visible world, into
the wombe of vacuity whence they issued, would
not straine his power motive. For, all this we sup∣pose
to be lesse then to bring nothing unto some∣thing,
or something to such perfection, as some
of his creatures enjoy. Howbeit even such as take
the fullest measure of perfection from his immen∣sity,
must derive their pedigree by the mothers
<PB N="89" REF="51"/>
side, from meere nothing or vacuity. <HI>Homo,</HI> saith
S. <HI>Austine, terrae filius, nihili nepos;</HI> Man is the son
of the earth, and the grandchilde of nothing. And
when he shall come unto the height of his glory, he
cannot forget, he must remember, that the worme
was his sister, and the creeping thing the sonne of
his mother. To produce as many worlds out of
nothing, as the Sunne each yeare doth Herbes or
Plants out of the moistned Earth, would breed no
cumbrance to his power or force productive. To
maintaine, repaire, or continue all these in the same
state, whilest he makes as many moe, would neither
exhaust nor hinder his conservative vertue. Multi∣plicity
or variety greater than wee can imagine of
workes most wonderfull, all managed at one and
the same time, could worke no distraction in his
thoughts, no defatigation in his <HI>Essence.</HI> From
the unity of these and the like branches of power,
all in him most eminently infinite, doth the <HI>at∣tribute</HI>
of Omnipotency take its denomination,
whose contents, so farre as they concerne the
strengthning of our faith, shall hereafter be un∣foulded.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the infinity of Divine Wisedome. That it is as im∣possible
for any thing to fall out without Gods know∣ledge,
as to have existence without his power or es∣sentiall
presence.</HEAD>
<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Vt power in every kinde thus
eminently infinite, could not
be so omnipotent, as we must
beleeve it; did it not in this
absolute unity of all variety
possesse other branches of be∣ing,
according to the like emi∣nency
or infinity of perfection. Strength or power,
if meerely naturall or destitute of correspondent
wisedome, to comprehend, manage, and direct it,
might bring forth effects in their kinde truly infi∣nite,
whose <HI>ill</HI> forecast or untowardly combinati∣ons,
neverthelesse, would in the issue argue lamen∣table
impotency, rather then <HI>omnipotency.</HI> And
hard it would be to give instance almost in any sub∣ject,
wherein a double portion of wit matched
with halfe the strength, would not effect more, or
more to the purpose, then a triple portion of
strength, with halfe so much wit. <HI>Archimedes</HI> did
not come so farre short of <HI>Polyphemus</HI> in strength
or bulk of body, as the wonderfull works wrought
by his Mathematicall skill, did exceed any that
the Gyant could attempt.</P>
<P>2 Every choice is better or worse accordingly
as it more or lesse participates of true wisedome:
<PB N="91" REF="52"/>
And most unwise should that choice justly be estee∣med,
which would not give wisedome prehemi∣nence
to power. Knowledge then, might wise men
choose their owne endowments, would be desired
in greater measure then strength. <HI>Wisedome,</HI> saith
the <HI>Wiseman, is the beginning of the wayes of God.</HI>
And shall not that branch of <HI>being,</HI> by which all
things were made, by which every created essence
hath its bounds and limits, be possest by Him, (who
gave them <HI>being</HI> and set them bounds,) without all
bounds or limits! above all measure? Yes, what∣soever
branch of <HI>being</HI> wee could rightly desire or
make choice of before others: the inexhaustible
fountaine of <HI>being</HI> hath not chosen, but is naturally
possest of, as the better. And therefore if we may
so speake, though both be absolutely infinite; his
wisedome is greater then his power, to which it
serves as guide or guardian. And as the excellency
of the Artificers skill often recompences the defect
of stuffe or matter: so the infinity of wisedome or
knowledge seemes, in a manner, to evacuate the ne∣cessity
of power or force distinct from it. Howbe∣it
I will not in this place, or in our native dialect,
enter that nice dispute, which some Schoolemen
have done; <HI>Whether Gods Essence and Knowledge be
formally his Power.</HI> But whilest we conceive <HI>Power</HI>
and <HI>Wisedome</HI> as two attributes formally distinct,
(at least, to ordinary conceipts,) we may conceive
<HI>Wisedome</HI> to be the father, and <HI>Power</HI> the mother of
all his workes of <HI>wonder.</HI> As for <HI>Philo</HI> and other
<HI>Platonicks</HI> that make Knowledge the mother of all
Gods workes, it is probable they dreamed of a crea∣ted
<PB N="92" REF="53"/>
<HI>Knowledge,</HI> or perhaps under these termes, they
cover some transformed <HI>Notion</HI> of the second per∣son
in Trinity, who is the <HI>Wisedome</HI> of the Father,
by whom also he created all things: who as he is
the onely begotten Sonne from eternity, so is hee
likewise a joint <HI>Parent</HI> of all things created in time
by the Father; as <HI>Eve</HI> was in some sort <HI>Adams</HI>
daughter, and yet a true mother of all that call him
father. But here we speake not of that wisedome
of God, which is personall; but of the wisedome
of the Godhead, as it is essentially and indivisibly
infinite in the whole Trinity.</P>
<P>3 Wisedome, as all agree, is the excellency of
knowledge, from which it differs not, save only in
the dignity or usefulnesse of matters knowne, or in
the more perfect maner of knowing them. Though
no man be wise without much knowledge, yet a
man may know many things, and not be very wise.
But if we speake of Knowledge divine, not as re∣strained
in our conceipt to this or that particular,
but simply, as it comprehends all things, the name
of Wisedome in every respect best befits it: for
though many things knowne by him, whilest com∣pared
with others more notable, seeme base and
contemptible; yet not the meanest, but may be an
object of divine contemplation to a Christian, that
considers not the meere matter or forme, or physi∣call
properties, but the Creators power, or skill ma∣nifested
in it. How much more may the vilest
creatures, whilest he lookes upon his owne worke
in it, and the use whereto he appointed it, be right∣ly
reputed excellent? He knowes as much of every
<PB N="93" REF="53"/>
Creature, as can be knowne of it, and much more
than man possibly can know: and thus he knoweth
not onely all things that are, but all that possibly
may bee. This argues wisedome truly infinite;
whose right conceit must be framed by those bro∣ken
conceipts which we have of the modell of it.</P>
<P>4 Of <HI>wisedome</HI> then or usefull knowledge, the
parts or offices are two: The one stedfastly to pro∣pose
a right end: The other, to make and prose∣quute
a right choice of meanes for effecting it. Hu∣mane
wisedome is oft-times blinde in both, and
usually lame in the latter. Neither can we clearly
discerne true good from apparent; nor doe our
consultions alwayes carry eaven, to the mistaken
markes whereat we ayme; but be the end proposed
good or bad, so it be much affected, the lesse choice
of meanes is lest, the more eagerly wee apply our
selves unto their use, and strive as it were, to straine
out successe by close embracing them. And for this
reason, ignorance or want of reason to forecast va∣riety
of meanes for bringing about our much desi∣red
ends, is the mother of selfe-will and impatience.
For what is selfe-will, if a man should define it, but
a stiffe adherence to some one or few particular
meanes, neither onely nor chiefly necessary to the
maine point? And wits conscious of their owne
weakness, for conquering what they eagerly desire,
presently call in power, wrath, or violence, as par∣tiall
or mercenary seconds to assist them. Whereas
hee that out of fertility of invention, can furnish
himselfe beforehand with store of likely meanes for
accomplishing his purpose, cannot much esteeme
<PB N="94" REF="54"/>
the losse or miscariage of some one or two. How∣beit,
as mans wit in this case is but finite, so his pa∣tience
cannot be compleat. Even the wisest will be
moved to wrath or violence, or other foule play, if
the game whereat he shoots be faire and good, and
most of his strings already broken. Nor can he be
absolutely secure of good successe, so long as the
issue is subject to contingency, and may fall with∣out
the Horizon of his foresight and contrivance.
But wisedome infinite doth compleatly arme the
Omnipotent Majesty (if I may so speake) with infi∣nite
patience and long-suffering, towards such as
every minute of their lives violently thwart and
crosse some or other particular meanes, which he
had ordained for his glory and their good. <HI>Hee is
light,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>and in him is no darknesse.</HI>
He distinguisheth the fruits of <HI>light</HI> from fruits of
<HI>darknesse,</HI> before they are, even before he gave them
possibility of <HI>being.</HI> As impossible it is for his will
to decline from that which he discernes to be truly
good, as for his infinite Essence to shrinke in <HI>being.</HI>
Many things may (as every thing that is evill doth)
fall out against his will, but nothing without his
knowledge, or besides his expectation. That which
in its owne nature (as being made such by his unal∣terable
decree) is absolutely contingent, is not ca∣suall
in respect of his providence or eternall wise∣dome.
In that he fully comprehends the number
of all meanes possible, and can mixe the severall
possibilities of their miscariage, in what degree or
proportion he list: he may, and oft-times doth, in∣evitably
forecast the full accomplishment of his
<PB N="95" REF="54"/>
proposed ends, by multiplicity of meanes, in them∣selves
not inevitable, but contingent. So that, suc∣cesse
is onely necessary to the last, yet not absolute∣ly
necessary unto it. All the necessity it hath is oft∣times
gotten by casuall miscariage of the possibili∣ties
bestowed upon the former: as if he ordained
the apprehension of a Traytor, or of a Malefactor,
by an hundred meanes, all by the immutable decree
alike possible, and equally probable; if ninety and
nine doe misse, the hundreth and last, by the rules
of Eternall Wisedome, must of necessity take. But
in that it was possible for the former to have <HI>taken,</HI>
successe falls to this last, not by absolute necessity,
but as it were by lott; for it might have beene pre∣vented
by the former, by supposall onely of whose
miscariage it is now necessary. And yet successe it
selfe, or the accomplishment of the end proposed
by infinite wisedome, was absolutely necessary and
immutable.</P>
<P>5 There is a fallacy, though the simplest one
that ever was set to catch any wise man, wherein
many excellent wits of these latter ages, with some
of the former, have beene pitifully intangled. The
snare, wherein it were not possible for any besides
themselves to catch them, they thus frame or set,
<HI>Whatsoever God hath decreed, must of necessity come
to passe: But God hath decreed every thing that is:
Therefore every thing that is, comes to passe of neces∣sity.
All things are necessary at least in respect of Gods
decree.</HI> The extract or corrallary whereof, in briefe,
is this: <HI>It is impossible for ought, that is not, to bee:
for ought that hath beene, not to have beene, for ought
<PB N="96" REF="55"/>
that is, not to be; impossible for ought to be hereafter,
that shall not be.</HI> But if it be (as here I suppose) ve∣ry
consonant to infinite wisedome; altogether ne∣cessary
to infinite goodnesse; and no way impos∣sible
for infinite power, to decree contingency as
well as necessity; or that some effects should bee as
truly contingent, as others are necessary; a conclu∣sion
quite contradictory to that late inferred, wil be
the onely lawfull issue of the former Maxime, or
major proposition matched with a minor of our
choosing. Let the major proposition stand as it did
before, <HI>[Whatsoever God hath decreed must of ne∣cessity
come to passe]</HI> with this additionall, <HI>Nothing
can come to passe otherwise than God hath decreed it
shall or may come to passe.</HI> The minor proposition,
which (if our choice may stand) shall be consort to
the major, is this, <HI>But God hath decreed contingency
as well as necessity,</HI> or, <HI>that some effects should bee as
truly contingent, as others are necessary; Therefore of
necessity there must bee contingency, or effects contin∣gent.</HI>
The immediate consequence whereof is
this, <HI>There is an absolute necessity, that some things
which have not beene, might have beene; That some
things which have beene, might not have beene. That
some things which are not, might be; That some things
which are, might not be: That some things which
shall not be hereafter, might bee; That some things
which shall be hereafter, might not be.</HI> But as ill weeds
grow apace, so the late mentioned errour once con∣ceived,
was quickly delivered of a second, which
derived the infallible certainty of Gods foreknow∣ing
things future, from an infallible necessity (as
<PB N="97" REF="55"/>
they conceived it) laid upon them (before they had
being) by his immutable decree. But every wise
decree presupposeth wisedome, and wisedome es∣sentially
includeth knowledge: shall we then grant
that Gods Knowledge is antecedent, and his fore∣knowledge
consequent to his decrees? or shall we
say he did inevitably decree the obliquity of Iewish
blasphemy against his Sonne, because he did most
certainly foreknow it, or, that hee did therefore
certainly foreknow it, because hee had irresistibly
decreed it? Most certaine it is, that he did as per∣fectly
foresee or foreknow all the obliquities of
their malice &amp; blasphemy against Christ, as he did
their very acts or doings: if those could be distin∣guished
from their acts or doings. Briefly, to ad∣mit
the former conclusion; <HI>That the Eternall fore∣knowes
all things, because he decrees them; or, that
they are absolutely necessary in respect of his decree;</HI>
were to imprison his infinite wisedome, in his selfe-fettered
<HI>power;</HI> to restraine the Eternall Majestie
from using such liberty in his everlasting decrees,
as some earthly Monarchs usurpe in causes tempo∣rall
or civill: For, <HI>Papae nunquam ligat sibi manus;
The Pope</HI> (as they say) <HI>never tyeth his owne hands,
by any Grant or Patents:</HI> which is a fault in him;
onely because he is otherwise very faulty, and un∣sufficient
to support or weild so high a prerogative
with upright constancy. But, in that <HI>Holy</HI> and
mighty <HI>One,</HI> the reservation of such liberty (as a∣non
we intimate) is a point of high perfection.</P>
<P>6 That to be able to decree an absolute contin∣gency
as well as necessity, is an essentiall branch of
<PB N="98" REF="56"/>
<HI>Omnipotency</HI> or power infinite, shall (by the assi∣stance
of this Power) be clearly demonstrated in
the Article of Creation. That God did omnipo∣tently
decree a contingency in humane actions, that
the execution of this decree is a necessary conse∣quent
of his communicative goodnesse, (a conse∣quent
so necessary, that unlesse this be granted, we
cannot acknowledge him to be truly good, much
lesse infinitely good,) shall (by the favour of this his
Goodness) be fully declared in the Treatise of mans
fall, and of sinnes entrance into the World by it.
That which in this place wee take as granted, is,
<Q>That Gods wisedome is no lesse infinite than his
power; that he perfectly foreknowes, whatsoe∣ver
by his <HI>omnipotency</HI> can be done; that his po∣wer
and wisedome are fully commensurable to
his immensity and eternity; that all these rules
following, are exactly parallell in true Divinity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Gods Presence is not circumscriptible by the
coexistence of his creatures; He is in every one
of them as a Center, and all of them are in Him as
in a circumference capable not of them only but
of all that possibly can bee; onely uncapable of
Circumscription or Equality.</Q></P>
<P><Q>His Eternity is more than commensurable to
time or any duration of created Entities: It is in
every duration as a permanent instant; and all
durations are contained in it, as a fluent instant
in a set time, or as noonetide in the whole day.</Q></P>
<P><Q>His Power likewise may not be confined to ef∣fects
that are, have beene, or shall bee: the pro∣duction
of every thing out of nothing, argues it
<PB N="99" REF="56"/>
to be truly infinite; and yet the production of all,
is to the infinity of it, not so much as a beame of
light which is strained through a needles eye, is
to the body of the Sunne, or to all the light dif∣fused
throughout the world.</Q></P>
<P>Least of all may his infinite <HI>wisedome</HI> be compre∣hended
within those effects which by his power
have been produced, or which it now doth or here∣after
shall produce. But looke how farre his <HI>immen∣sity</HI>
exceeds all reall or compleat space, or his <HI>E∣ternity</HI>
succession, or the duration of things created,
or his <HI>Power</HI> all things already reduced from possi∣bility
to actuall existence; so farre doth his infinite
<HI>Wisedome</HI> surmount the most exact knowledge that
can bee imagined of all things already ereated and
their actions. Nothing that is, could have borne
any part in the world, without the light or directi∣on
of his Knowledge: and yet that measure of his
Knowledge which can bee gathered from the full
harmony of this Vniverse, is lesse in respect of it ab∣solutely
considered, then skill to number digits, is to
the entire or exact knowledge of all proportions or
other arithmeticall rules or affections, that can arise
from their multiplications or divisions. The causes,
properties, &amp; hidden vertues of each thing created,
are better knowne to <HI>Him,</HI> than so much of them as
we see or perceive by any other sense, is to us: and
yet He knowes whatsoever by infinite power pos∣sibly
might have beene, but now is not, whatsoever
hereafter may be, though it never shall be; as per∣fectly
as he doth the things which at this instant are,
heretofore have beene, or hereafter must be.</P>

<HI>wisedome</HI> exhibits the most liuely and surest appre∣hensions,
for drawing our hearts after it in admira∣tion;
is the harmony or mixture of contingency
with necessity. And this, most conspicuous in mo∣derating
the free thoughts of Men or Angells, and
ordaining them to the certaine and necessary ac∣complishment
of his glory. The contingent means
which by his permission and donation, these crea∣tures
may use for attaining their severall ends, or
private good, may be successively infinite. And
yet, albeit the utmost possibilities of their varieties
and incōstancies, were reduced to act, the <HI>ends</HI> not∣withstanding,
which his infinite wisedome hath
forecast in their creation, should by any course of
many thousands, which they may take, be as inevi∣tably
brought to passe, as if no choice or freedome
had beene left them; or as if every succeeding
thought had been drawne on by the former, and al
linked to that which hee first inspired, or by his ir∣resistible
power produced, with indissoluble chains
of Adamantine Fate. We would esteeme it great
wisdome or cunning (to use S. <HI>Austines</HI> illustratiō)
in a <HI>Fowler</HI> to be able to catch againe all the Birds,
w<SUP>ch</SUP> he had formerly caught, after he had permitted
every one of them to take wings and flye which
way they listed. God hath nets every where spred,
for catching such as his wisedome suffers to flye
farthest from him, or most to decline the wayes
which in his goodnesse he had appointed for thē:
and (which is most of all to be admired) the very
freedome or variety of mens thoughts, so they be
<PB N="101" REF="57"/>
permitted to imploy them according to their owne
liking, becomes their most inevitable, and most in∣extricable
snare. For all their thoughts are actually
numbred in his infinite wisedome, and the award
of every thought determinately measured, or defi∣ned
by his Eternall Decree. So farre is freedome
of choice or contingency from being incompati∣ble
with the immutability of Gods will, that with∣out
this infinite variety of choice or freedome of
thought in man and Angels, wee cannot rightly
conceive him to be as infinitely wise, as his decree
is immutable.</P>
<P>8 Free it was for mee to have thought or done
somewhat in every minute of the last yeare, where∣by
the whole frame of my cogitations or actions
for this yeare following might have beene altered:
and yet should God have beene as true and princi∣pall
a cause of this alteration, and of every thought
and deed thus altered; as he is of those that <HI>de facto</HI>
are past, or of that which I now thinke or doe.
Nor should his will or pleasure (as some object)
depend on mine, but mine though contingently
free, necessarily subject unto his. For unto every
cogitation possible to man or Angell, he hath ever∣lastingly
decreed a proportionate end: to every
antecedent possible, a correspondent consequent;
which needs no other cause or meanes to produce
it, but onely the reducing of <HI>possibility</HI> (granted by
his decree) into Act. For what way soever (of ma∣ny
equally possible) mans will doth encline, Gods
decree is a like necessary cause of all the good or
evill that befalls him for it. Did we that which we
<PB N="102" REF="58"/>
doe not, but might doe; many things would inevi∣tably
follow, which now doe not. Nor doe the
things, which at this instant befall me, come to
passe, because <HI>he</HI> absolutely decreed them, and none
but them (as we say) in the first place; But because
<HI>hee</HI> decreed them as the inevitable consequents of
some things, which <HI>hee</HI> knew I would doe, which
notwithstanding <HI>hee</HI> both knew and had decreed,
that I might not have done. For whatsoever I
should have done and have let undone, there was
a reall possibility to have done it; though not inhae∣rent
in me, yet <HI>intituled</HI> unto mee in particular by
Gods Decree; untill some demerit of mine or my
forefathers, did cut off the <HI>entaile,</HI> and interrupt the
successefull influence. For here I will not dispute,
how farre the sinnes of Parents may prejudice their
Children; but these termes <HI>should,</HI> or <HI>might,</HI> being
referred to matters of duty; are as infallible signes
in Divinity, as in Grammar, of a <HI>potentiall,</HI> what we
<HI>should</HI> have done or <HI>might</HI> have done, was possible
for us to have done, by that decree whence all po∣wer
and possibility, not meerely logicall, is deri∣ved.
So then, both that which might befall me if I
did otherwise, and that which now befals mee do∣ing
as I doe, flow alike immediately from the ab∣solute
necessity of his eternall decree: whose in∣comprehensible
wisedome herein appeares most
admirable; that though the variety in this kinde
were infinite, yet should it comprehend all; not
one thing could fall without the actuall circumfe∣rence
of it.</P>
<P>9 The generall reason, why most Christian
<PB N="103" REF="58"/>
writers are more able and apt both to conceive
right, and to speake more consequently to what
they rightly conceive, concerning other branches
of divine absolute <HI>infinitenesse,</HI> than concerning his
infinite knowledge, is, because all creatures without
exception, are true participants of Gods other At∣tributes,
besides his wisedome or knowledge. For
even the meanest creature, the worme or gnat, hath
a portion of that being, of that power, of that dura∣tion,
which in him are infinite: and that portion of
these attributes which they have, or that quantity
of being which they have, is a participation of his
immensity. But of his knowledge or wisedome,
men and Angels (the manner of whose knowledge
is to men for the most part unknowne) are of all his
creatures the onely participants. And (as hath been
observed before) those rules are alwayes the most
cleare and certaine, and most easily gathered; which
are gathered from an uniforme identity of particu∣lars,
in variety of subjects. Those universall rules (on
the contrary) are hardly gathered, or (without ac∣curate
observation) are lesse certaine, which can be
experienced onely in some one or fewer subjects.
Another speciall reason why we doe not conceive
so magnificently or so orthodoxally of Gods
knowledge, as were fitting; is, because we want fit
tearmes to expresse them in. For seeing words are
taken as the proper vesture of our thoughts &amp; con∣ceipts;
and seeing most men are apt to conceive or
judge rather according to the vesture or outward
appearance of things, than according to the inward
truth: it is almost impossible for us not to trans∣forme
<PB N="104" REF="59"/>
the manner of Gods knowledge or decrees,
into the similitude of our owne conceipts, conjec∣tures,
or resolutions; so long as we put no other ve∣sture
or expressions upon Gods decree or know∣ledge,
than were fitted for our owne. To salve this
inconvenience, or to prevent the occasion of this
errour,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Quomodo est praescius, dum nulla nisi quae fu∣tura sunt, praesciātur? Et scimus quia Deo futurum nihil est, ante cujus oculos prae∣terita nulla sunt, prae∣sentia non transeunt, futura non veniunt: quippe quia omne quod nobis fuit &amp; erit, in ejus prospec∣tu praesto est, &amp; omne quod prae∣sens est, scire potest potius quam prae∣scire. <HI>Greg.</HI> lib. 20. in <HI>Iob.</HI> cap. 24. <HI>Et paulo post,</HI> In illo, nec praeterita, nec futura reperiri quaeunt, sed cuncta mutabilia immutabiliter durant; &amp; quae in seipsis simul existere non possunt, illi simul omnia assistunt, nihil{que} in illo praeterit quod transit: quia in aeternitate ejus modo quodam in∣comprehensibili, cuncta volumina saeculorum transeuntia manent, currentia stant. <HI>Vide Pe∣trum Damianum in ep. 4. de omnipotentia, &amp; Ludovicum Ballaster Hierologiae, cap. 3.</HI></NOTE> Saint <HI>Gregory</HI> moves this doubt: How
we can say there is any praescience or foreknow∣ledge
in God, seeing onely those things can be pro∣perly
said to be foreknowne, which are to come:
whereas we know, that nothing is future unto God,
before whose eye, no things are past; things present
doe not passe by <HI>Him,</HI> things future doe not come,
upon <HI>Him.</HI> Whatsoever hath beene to us, is yet in
his view; and whatsoever is present, may rather be
said to be <HI>knowne</HI> than <HI>foreknowne.</HI> To the same
purpose Saint <HI>Austine</HI> would have Gods know∣ledge
of things which are to come, to bee tearmed
rather <HI>science</HI> than <HI>praescience</HI> or foresight; seeing all
things are present to God. But these two great
lights of the Latine Church, with some others that
follow these for their guides, have not in this argu∣ment
exprest themselves so clearly or so accurately
as that their expressions can passe without question
or exception in the Schooles. We may not say (nor
did Saint <HI>Austine</HI> or Saint <HI>Gregory,</HI> as I presume,
thinke) that God doth not see or know a distincti∣on
betweene times past, present, or to come, more
<PB N="105" REF="59"/>
cleerely than we doe. If then he distinguish times
present from times past or future, how is it said by
St. <HI>Gregory;</HI> that nothing to him is future, nothing
past? If these differences of time or of succession
be reall; the <HI>Eternall</HI> knowes these differences much
better than we doe. And if he know a difference
between things present, past, and to come; <HI>to be pre∣sent,
past, or to come,</HI> is not all one in respect of his
<HI>Eternall knowledge.</HI> If God, as all grant, be before
all worlds; his knowledge being coeternall to his
being, must needs be before all worlds. And Saint
<HI>Austine</HI> himselfe grants a <HI>scientia</HI> a <HI>science</HI> or <HI>know∣ledge</HI>
in God most infallible, of all things that have
beene, are, or shall be; before they are, were, or
could be; for they could not be coeternall to him,
who is before all worlds, the <HI>beginning</HI> of the
world it selfe, and of all things in it. Now all know∣ledge
of things not yet present, but to come, is fore∣knowledge:
to determine or decree things fu∣ture,
is to predetermine or foredecree them. And
seeing God from Eternity hath both knowne and
decreed the things that then were not; he is said to
have foreknowne and foredecreed them. So then
God foreknowes, and man foreknowes; God hath
decreed, and man hath decreed. But the difference
between the manner of their foreknowing and de∣creeing,
being not oft-times wel expressed by lear∣ned
writers or teachers, and seldome duely consi∣dered
by their Readers or hearers; the identity of
words wherewith we expresse our own foreknow∣ledge
&amp; Gods foreknowledge, begets a similitude
of conceipt, or will hardly suffer us rightly to con∣ceive
<PB N="106" REF="60"/>
the true difference betweene the nature and
manner of <HI>humane wisedome,</HI> and <HI>wisedome divine.</HI>
And this hath beene the fertile nursery of many
errours in this Argument, which now and hereaf∣ter
we shall endeavour to displant: imitating the
Heralds, who are often enforced to give the same
Coat to divers parties; but alwayes with some dif∣ference,
remarkeable to such as are conversant in
the mysteries of their Art.</P>
<P>10 Our knowledge of things to come is many
wayes imperfect; (and foreknowledge onely) be∣cause
the duration neither of our knowledge, nor
of our selves, as yet can reach unto that point of
time, wherein things so knowne, get first existence.
We looke on them as on things afarre off, which
we expected to meet; for as things past resemble
moueables going from us, so things future seem to
come upon us. And whiles they get being, which
before they had not; we get continuance of being,
and of knowledge, which before we had not; that
is, we gaine a reall coexistence with them: For if
the daies, or thred of our life should be cut off before
the things foreknowne by us come to passe, or get
actuall being; wee could not possibly haue coex∣istence
with them. Such being or duration as they
have, is too short the one way, &amp; our existence too
short the other way, to make up this knot or bond
of mutuall relation, which wee call <HI>coexistence:</HI>
There must be on our part, a continuatiō or length∣ning
of that existence which we have; and on their
part, a growth into that actuall being, which
whilest they are meerely future, they have not; be∣fore
<PB N="107" REF="60"/>
wee and they can bee truely said to exist toge∣ther.
Now if we shall <HI>mold</HI> the manner of Gods
foreknowledge of things future in our owne <HI>con∣ceipt</HI>
or <HI>foreknowledge</HI> of them, we shall erroneous∣ly
collect; that, seeing wee cannot infallibly fore∣know
future <HI>Contingents,</HI> so neither could they be
infallibly fore-knowne by God; if to him or in re∣spect
of his decree, they were contingents, and
not necessarily predetermined.</P>
<P>And some there be, which push our pronenesse
to this errour forward, by another; not distin∣guishing
betweene contingency and uncertainty,
they argue thus;</P>
<Q><P>That which is in it selfe uncertaine, cannot certain∣ly
be knowne:</P>
<P>Every future contingent is in it selfe uncertaine:
<HI>Ergo,</HI> it is not possible, that a future contingent
should certainly be knowne.</P></Q>
<P>But they consider not that there is a twofold un∣certainty:
one formally relative: another onely
denominative or fundamentall. That which is re∣latively
uncertaine, cannot be certainly knowne;
for so it should bee certaine to him, to whom it is
uncertaine. But a future contingent, as it is contin∣gent,
doth not necessarily or formally include this
relative uncertainty; although it usually be in part
the foundatiō or Cofounder of it. For relative un∣certainty,
or that uncertainty which is so termed
with relation unto knowledge, results partly from
the nature of the object, suppose a future Contin∣gent
or Event mutable; partly and more principal∣ly,
from the imperfection of the knowledge, in re∣spect
<PB N="108" REF="61"/>
of which it is said uncertaine. But the same
effect or event, which is in part the <HI>foundation of
uncertaintie,</HI> with respect to finite or unperfect
knowledge, may bee the distinct and proper object
of knowledge in it selfe infallible, or of knowledge
infinite. Now if we grant, that there is any know∣ledge
in it selfe infallible, we cannot imagine that
any thing possible (yet is every future Contingent,
though we consider it as contingently future, pos∣sible)
should bee uncertaine unto such knowledge.
We should againe consider, that the <HI>Eternall Pro∣vidence,</HI>
doth neither know or foreknow Contin∣gents
future, by interposed or expiring Acts; but
by interminable and Eternall Knowledge, in which
there is no succession, nothing future, nothing past.
And without the interposition of some determi∣ning
or expiring Acts, there can bee no errour in
men; no man erres while hee is in the search of
truth, or whilest he suspends his Iudgement. Take
then away the imperfection of our knowledge or
iudgement, whilest it is in suspense; which is igno∣rance,
rather than errour; and it better resembles
divine knowledge, than our actuall resolutions or
determinations doe.</P>
<P>11 The best knowledge which we can have of
things contingent, is but conjecturall: and of
things meerly casuall, we cannot have so much as a
true conjecturall knowledge; for, those things we
tearme casuall, w<SUP>ch</SUP> are without the reach or sphere
of our forecast or conjecture. And hence it is, that
the actuall exhibition of any event, whether casuall
or contingent, doth alwaies <HI>actuate, increase,</HI> or <HI>per∣fect</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="61"/>
our knowledge. The true reason why we can∣not
certainly foreknow events contingent, is be∣cause
our <HI>Essence</HI> &amp; <HI>Knowledge</HI> are but finite: so that
things contingent are not so contained in us, that
if we could perfectly know our selves, wee might
perfectly know them. But in the Divine Essence
all reall effects, all events possible, whether ne∣cessary,
casuall, or contingent, are <HI>eminently</HI> con∣tained,
the perfect knowledge of his owne Es∣sence,
necessarily includes the perfect knowledge
not onely of all things that have beene, are, or
shall bee, but of all things that might have beene,
or possibly may be. For as Gods Essence is pre∣sent
in every place, as it were an ubiquitary cen∣ter;
so is his Eternity or infinite duration indivi∣sibly
coexistent to every part of succession; and
yet withall is round about it. Hee it is, that drives
things future upon us, being from Eternity as
well beyond them, as on this side of them. Though
hee should create other creatures without the
circumference of this world, they should be all
within his presence, without which, it is impos∣sible
ought besides him, should have any existence:
yet should he not properly gaine any new existence
in them, but onely take a denomination of coexi∣stence
with them; because they have existence in
Him, which before they had not. Thus, admitting
the branches of Contingency or indifferent possi∣bilities
never reduced to act, to be in our apprehen∣sion
numberlesse; yet whensoever any thing comes
to passe, which might not have beene, it cannot
fall without the sphere of Gods actuall knowledge,
<PB N="110" REF="62"/>
which is fully commensurable to <HI>Eternity</HI> and <HI>Im∣mensity;</HI>
and therefore is not onely coexistent to
every successive act, but doth environ whole succes∣sion.
And whether of such things as possibly may
be, more or fewer bee reduced to act; nothing ac∣crewes
to Eternall Knowledge, no new act can bee
produced in it, by the casuall event; but only that
which was eternally knowne, having now gotten
actuall coexistence with Eternity, bestowes this ex∣trinsecall
denomination upon the Eternall Crea∣tor,
<HI>It was foreknowne from eternity;</HI> that is, in plaine
language, knowne, when it was not, by Him that
more properly alwayes indivisibly, <HI>is,</HI> then <HI>was</HI> be∣fore
it. And being such, his knowledge of things,
which, in respect of us are onely future and fore∣knowne,
doth as truly resemble, or rather containe
our knowledge of things past or presēt, as of things
to come. Now for us to apprehend a thing past,
under the nature of a thing contingent, is not im∣possible.
And though we certainly know it to bee
already past, yet this certainty of our knowledge,
doth not perswade us, that it came to passe certain∣ly,
or inevitably; but is very compatible with our
conceipt of its contingency or casuall production,
whilest it was present. Our knowledge of such
things past or present, is necessary; but the event it
selfe is not therefore necessary, nor to bee termed
necessary in respect of our knowledge. Much lesse
may we say, either that contingent effects are neces∣sary,
or that no effects are not necessary, in respect
of Gods decree or foreknowledge of them. For if
we beleeve that Gods foreknowledge of all events
<PB N="111" REF="62"/>
to come, be they of what kinde they possibly may
bee, is more cleare and more infallible than our
best knowledge of things past or present; the ne∣cessary
infallibility of his knowledge, can neither
adde any degree of necessity to the nature of the
events foreknowne, nor take one jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of contingen∣cy
from them. God should not be absolutely infi∣nite
either in Essence or in Knowledge, if the abso∣lute
<HI>infallibility</HI> of his foreknowledge, or the im∣possibility
of his not erring in his predictions, were
in it selfe grounded upon, or to be inferred by us,
from the absolute necessity of the event, rather than
from the absolute <HI>infinity</HI> of his wisedome. For
those effects which being otherwise in their nature
<HI>contingent,</HI> it is in our power (by Gods permission,
by circumspection and forecast) to alter by laying
a necessity upon them, which before they had not;
we are able (after this necessity laid upon them by
our selves) infallibly to foreknow and foretell, al∣beit
our knowledge still remaine but finite. Now,
that some events, which are to day, in themselves
and by Gods decree, truly contingent, may by our
industry and circumspection, become to morrow
truly necessary, no intelligent Christian Divine
will (I hope) deny; or if any doe deny it, we shall
be able (by Gods assistance) positively to demon∣strate
the truth of this our assertion, and withall
demonstrate the dangerous inconveniences of the
contradictory opinion, in the Treatise of <HI>Divine
providence.</HI> In the meane time, to finish this prin∣cipall
stemme of <HI>Divine providence,</HI> to wit, his in∣finite
<HI>Wisedome;</HI> and the dependance which things
<PB N="112" REF="63"/>
temporall have upon his eternall knowledge: Suc∣cession
we imagine as a scrole containing severall
<HI>columnes</HI> of <HI>contingency</HI> or indifferent possibilities;
of which onely so many, or so much of any, as in
revolution of time, take inke, and are unfoulded,
become visible to Men and Angels. But the Al∣mighty
looketh on all things, as well from that end
of time which is to come, as from that which is
past: his infinite and eternall wisedome, doth not
onely encompasse all things that come to passe, as
the Circumference doth the Center; but penetrates
the whole scrole of succession from end to end and
from corner to corner, more clearly then the Suns
brightnesse doth the perspicuous or purified Ayre.
Those Columnes of meere possibilities never actu∣ated,
which his finger from Eternity hath drawne
in Characters secret and invisible to his Creatures,
are alike distinct and legible to his glorious eye, as
those others whose first draught, being as secretly
and invisibly fashioned by him, man or other se∣cond
causes by his concourse, fill with actuall or
sensible existence; as the Embroyderer doth the
Drawers obscure patterne, with conspicuous bran∣ches
of silke, gold, or silver.</P>
<P>12 But lest we may be thought to reade the An∣cients
with no greater reverence, than we do some
moderne Writers from whom wee freely dissent,
without any impulsion of envy or vainglory, let us
for conclusion of this long discourse, a little reflect
upon the testimonies before avouched out of S.
<HI>Austine,</HI> and out of S. <HI>Gregory.</HI> The truth then at
which these two learned Fathers aimed, &amp; which,
<PB N="113" REF="63"/>
in the charitable construction of such as read them
with reverence, they did not misse, may bee fully
comprised in these observations following, which
are but necessary extracts of what hath hitherto
beene delivered. Whereas S. <HI>Gregory</HI> saith, <HI>Vnto
God nothing is past, nothing to come;</HI> the true con∣struction
of his meaning is, that in Gods knowledge
of things past, present, or to come, there is <HI>nihil fu∣turum,
nihil praeteritum,</HI> no such difference of time
or duration, as we expresse by these words, <HI>future</HI>
or <HI>past:</HI> for it alwayes is, and so perfectly alwayes
is, that nothing can be added to it by succession or
variety of events, be they necessary, casuall, or con∣tingent.
But as his Eternal knowledge of all things,
doth not make all things, which he knowes, to be e∣ternall
(no not in respect of his Eternall Decree or
Knowledge, for he eternally decrees and knowes
things temporall and mutable:) so neither doth the
immutable or absolute certainty of his knowledge,
make all things so known by him, to be immutable
or absolutely necessary, either in themselves or in
respect of his Eternall Knowledge. Onely this we
are bound to beleeve, and this is all that we may in
this argument safely say: [Gods Knowledge of
things mutable &amp; unnecessary, is absolutely neces∣sary,
because absolutely infinite.] Againe, it is most
true which S. <HI>Gregory</HI> saith; that things future doe
not come upon God as they doe upon us; that
things present do not passe him, or from him, as
they do from us. Whilest things <HI>present</HI> passe from
us, we likewise passe from them: for we continually
lose that portion of duration or coexistence which
<PB N="114" REF="64"/>
wee had with them; alwayes gaining, whilest our
glasse is in running, a new <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rit</HI> or link of coexistēce
with that which is next to come. Nothing, in this
sense, can passe by God or from God, because He
alwayes is, and the manner of his duration is indi∣visible:
He cannot lose any existence by antiquity,
nor gaine any new portion of duration, by everla∣sting
continuance. Times passing exonerate them∣selves
into the Ocean of his infinite duration, with∣out
inlarging it; times comming incessantly flow
from it, without diminution of it. Times <HI>future</HI> a∣gaine,
are said to come upon us, or to meet us; be∣cause
our duration or existence cannot reach to fu∣ture
things, whilest they are future: the very An∣gels
are not of so long standing or duration to day,
as they shall bee to morrow: unlesse things future
did come towards them, and as it were meet them,
they should have no coexistence with them. In this
sense, times future cannot be said to come upon
God, because he alwayes is, and exists every way
before them. His <HI>duration</HI> is <HI>yesterday, to day, to
morrow,</HI> the same for ever; and every way the same
without addition of quantity, without alteration of
nature or quality: and in it are all things that are.
So much of being as things <HI>future</HI> can bee said to
have, they have it in <HI>him</HI> and from <HI>him:</HI> so much
of being as there remaines of things <HI>past,</HI> remaineth
in Him, and things <HI>present,</HI> even <HI>presence</HI> it selfe,
cannot for a moment subsist, without Him.</P>

speake properly, the Knowledge of it, is the Off-spring
of our right knowledge of the former. The
attribute it selfe, whose truth in former disputes
hath beene supposed, is <HI>Divine Immutability;</HI>
which may be thus demonstrated.</P>
<P>2 All mutation supposeth a defect or imperfec∣tion,
either in respect of the <HI>terme,</HI> whence, or into
which, the change is made; and therefore can have
no place in absolute or abstract perfection, or in
Essence infinite. More particularly, all mutation or
change, is either in essence, in quantity, in place, or
in quality; under which we comprehend all vitall
endeavors, all acts of the Will or Vnderstanding.
In essence or nature, it is impossible the totality and
fountaine of Essence should admit any change, as
impossible for him which hath no author of being,
<PB N="116" REF="65"/>
not to bee alwayes what hee is; as for that which
now is not, to take his being to it selfe: unto infinit
perfection (for such he is) what can accrew? On
the other side, nothing can fall from it, but must
fall into him; seeing, He is in being infinite. And
in that he filleth every place by his essentiall pre∣sence,
it is impossible hee should move from place
to place, or be carryed by any circular motion, be∣ing
indivisibly and totally in every space that can
be imagined. And as his <HI>Immensitie</HI> could not be
entended or contracted by extension of new mag∣nitudes,
or by diminution or annihilation of the
<HI>old;</HI> so neither can his <HI>Eternity,</HI> bee shortned or
lenghtned by continuation of succession, or expi∣ration
of time or motion. <HI>Power,</HI> in like sort, truly
infinite, can admit no intension or remission, in en∣deavors;
but moveth all things without motion,
and worketh all things without labour or toyle in∣herent:
For all things are made, and brought to no∣thing,
by his sole will or word. Nor speakes hee
ought, which from Eternity hee hath not spoken;
albeit succeding ages have still new messengers of
his eternall will and Word, <HI>All flesh is as grasse, and
all the glory of man as the power of the grasse; the grass
withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away. But
the word of the Lord endureth for ever.</HI> And yet this
was that word of the Gospell, which seemed then
first to be preached unto them.</P>
<P>3 All the difficulty wherewith flesh and blood in
this article are usually assaulted, or seeme to them∣selves
to be beset, is, how his <HI>will</HI> or <HI>counsaile</HI> should
be eternally immutable, and yet everlastingly free:
<PB N="117" REF="65"/>
but supposing, what we often promise, and once for
all (by his assistance) shall undoubtedly prove; that
absolute contingency or <HI>possibilities aequipendent</HI>
betwixt many effects, may as truly be the object of
his Eternall decree, as necessity in other workes of
nature: I see not what appearance of difficulty
can present it selfe, to such, as beare the two for∣mer
principles before mentioned <HI>levell</HI> in their
mindes and thoughts; the one, that God <HI>is absolute
infinite in Being:</HI> the other, that <HI>Hee is absolutely
perfect,</HI> according to all the branches of <HI>Beeing</HI>
or perfection by us conceiveable; or, more than
all these, <HI>Perfection it selfe.</HI> Now in things that
have any better portion of Being, wherein they
can truly delight; it is, to our apprehension, a degree
or portion of perfection to have an immutable
state of such <HI>Being;</HI> an imperfection, to be subject
to alteration or change. But, whether their estate
bee mutable or immutable, it is a greater perfecti∣on
to be free in their operations, than to be restrai∣ned
to some one or few particulars, without any
choice or variety of subjects, wherein they may
exercise their operative faculties. Bruitish, or meer∣ly
sensitive creatures have a delectable kinde of <HI>Be∣ing,</HI>
whose continuance they desire; but without
all variety of choice, or desire of any better being,
although the best being they have be subject to al∣teration
or change. Men are free in their operati∣ons;
but mutable and subject to alteration, as well
in their nature, as in their operations, or in the ob∣jects
of their freedome; and yet are more excellent
than the visible Heavens, which are not obnoxious
<PB N="118" REF="66"/>
to alteration or corruption. So that, if the Heavens,
or other incorruptible substances, had their free∣dome
of choice, which men have; they would bee
more perfect and excellent creatures than man is:
Or, if man were as immortall as they are, he would
be incomparably more perfect than they can bee,
without the <HI>freedome</HI> of choyce or will, which (as
we now suppose) is the inseparable consequent, or
companion of <HI>reason</HI> or <HI>intellectuall knowledge.</HI> But,
though freedome be in it selfe a great perfection;
yet to be free to do evil, is a branch of imperfection,
which springs from the mutability of the creatures
freedome. And this their mutability, though in it
selfe an imperfection, yet is an imperfection neces∣sarily
praerequired, or praesupposed to the perfecti∣on
of the creature. For no creature can bee truly
perfect by nature, but by the will and pleasure of
the Creator. And it is his will and pleasure, to make
them mutable, before they be immutably happy.
But the Creator of all things, in that <HI>He</HI> is absolute∣ly
perfect, even Perfection it selfe, is essentially im∣mutable,
essentially free, and immutably happy; be∣cause
infinitely good. Yet if we compare these at∣tributes
amongst themselves, <HI>immutability</HI> is the
ground or supporter, not the Crowne or perfection
of <HI>freedome,</HI> but freedome rather the perfection of
immutabilitie. Yet were freedome in it selfe, how
perfect and complete soever it were, no absolute
perfection, unlesse it were immutably wedded unto
goodnesse. Absolute <HI>immutability</HI> and absolute
<HI>freedome,</HI> may very well stand together, even in our
conceipts; so they be rightly joyned, or sorted. To
<PB N="119" REF="66"/>
be freely immutable, implyes a contradiction; if
not unto the nature of immutability, yet unto the
nature of absolute perfection, or to our true con∣ceipt
of infinite Being. To be freely immutable, is
a branch of imperfection or impotency; which
might put al those perfections, which are contained
in that nature which is no otherwise than freely im¦mutable,
upon the hazard. If the divine Essence
were freely immutable, or free in respect of his im∣mutability,
whether of nature or goodnesse; it were
possible for him to put off these two attributes, and
to eloath himselfe with mutability, which is al∣wayes
charged with possibility of doing amisse.
But to be immutably free, is no point of imperfec∣tion;
but rather the period of perfection; and ne∣cessarily
inferres this perfection (which wee call
freedome) to be as unchangeable as the Attributes
of power, of wisedome, of eternity, or goodnesse
are. The excellency of his nature and Essence ne∣cessarily
includes an Eternall liberty or freedome
in the exercise of his omnipotent power, and in the
influence or communication of his goodnesse; Free
it is for him, from Everlasting to Everlasting, om∣nipotently
to decree as well a mutability in the ac∣tions
of some things created, as a necessity or im∣mutability
in the course or operation of nature in∣animate:
That the course of mans life, or the finall
doome awarded to every man (though that must
be awarded unto all according to the diversity of
their courses,) should be immutable; because they
are foreset by an immutable omnipotent Decree;
hath no more colour of truth, than to say the Om∣nipotent
<PB N="120" REF="67"/>
Creator, must needs be <HI>blacke</HI> because he
made the Crowes and Ebony blacke; or white, be∣cause
he made the Snow and Swannes white; or
greene and yellow, because hee made the Gold
yellow, and the Popinjayes greene: Or that hee
should be of all colours, because the Rainbow is
his creature. Let us beleeve then, that <HI>He</HI> is ever∣lastingly
and immutably free, to make creatures of
what kinde it pleaseth <HI>Him,</HI> that he hath printed
a resemblance of his freedome in the mutability
of this inferiour world, and hath left a modell of
his immutability in the celestiall and immortall
substances. But the more immutable <HI>Hee</HI> is, the
more irresistible we conceive his power to bee:
or the greater his wisedome is, the lesse preventa∣ble
the contrivances of it are: the worse it would
be with such as have to deale with <HI>Him,</HI> were not
his goodnesse (which is the rule of his Eternall
Decree) immutably as great, as <HI>He</HI> himselfe, or his
other Attributes are.</P>

A point, though in all ages most difficult, yet
in this age become so common, and so farre exten∣ded,
that no Divine can adventure upon any other
service profitable for the present estate of Christs
Militant Church, but he shall be enforced either to
make his passage through it, or come so nigh unto
it, that hee must, in good manners, doe homage un∣to
it. That this Decree is for its tenour, immutable,
(if wee take it in the abstract, or as it is in God) is
cleare from the attribute last handled; that the
same Decree, is irresistible in its executions, or that
the things decreed are inevitable, is evident from
the attribute of Gods infinite Power or Omnipo∣tency.
That this immutable irresistible Decree, is
Eternall, or before all Times, no man questions.
Yet is it not agreed upon by all, either what a <HI>De∣cree</HI>

of an <HI>Eternall Decree.</HI> To this purpose

by the incogitant use of these and the like Scrip∣ture

creepe upon the unvigilant or unattentive Reader;
with whose dreames many deceived, have thought

of things to come, as of Acts already <HI>irrevocably</HI>

which conceipt, though they doe not expressely

much [That God by his Eternall and powerfull

an irresistable and unretractible <HI>swingde;</HI> and since
onely lookes upon it, with an awfull eye, as Masters
sometimes watch their servants, whether they goe

Divinity, not contradicted, (for ought I know) by
any Christian, that there is altogether as great
need and use of <HI>power</HI> and <HI>wisedome</HI> infinite, to ma∣nage
the world, as there was at first to make it, <HI>Pa∣ter

things according to the counsell of his Will.</HI> So that al∣beit
the Counsell of his Will, by which hee work∣eth,
be Eternall; yet all things are not yet wrought
by it. Shall we say then, he hath not decreed what∣soever
doth or shall befall us? Yes, in this sense we
may, [He doth not now first begin to decree thē:]
but in as much as his Decrees have no end, wee
should remember withall, that hee now decrees
them. And it were much safer for every man in
particular to looke on Gods Decree concerning
himselfe, as present or coexistent to his whole
course of life; rather than on it, as it was before
the world, or in <HI>Adam:</HI> for so we shall thinke of
it, as of an Act past and finished, which hath de∣nounced
sentence upon us, more irrevocable
<PB N="123" REF="68"/>
than the Lawes of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians.</HI> How∣beit
even these lawes, whiles they were in making,
suppose that Liberty in their Makers, which they
utterly tooke from them being once enacted.</P>
<P>2 Gods Decrees are like theirs, in that they are
in themselves unalterable: but not in that they
make some evills, which befall others, inevitable;
or some casuall inconveniences, unamendable. No
wisedome, but that which is infinite, and an Eter∣nall
Law in it selfe, foreseeing all things that possi∣bly
can bee, hath just warrant to make Decrees for
men everlastingly immutable. Too strict oblige∣ment
unto Lawes positive, or Decrees unalterable,
deprives both Lawgivers and others of their native
Liberty and opportunity of doing good. Were
the <HI>Popes</HI> wisedome and integrity parallell to that
supereminent dignity, which he challengeth; it
were not amisse for the body whereof hee is the
lawfull head, if he exercised the same power over
his Grants or Acts, that hee doth over his breath:
alwayes reserving a liberty to send them forth, or
call them in, to enlarge, contract, or invert them,
according to exigences or occasions present. To
alter his opinion of men, as they doe theirs in
points of usefull doctrine, or their demeanours in
matters of life; curbing him this yeare, whom hee
priviledged the last yeare; now punishing where
he lately rewarded; and, shortly after, rewarding
where now hee punisheth; would argue no muta∣bility
of mind, or unsetled fickle disposition, but
rather immoveable constancy; if so in all these
changes he truly observed the rule of Iustice, which
<PB N="124" REF="69"/>
because it is alwayes one and the same, and never
varies, must needs afford different measures to dif∣ferent
deserts, and fit contrary dispositions with
contrary recompences. But seeing Princes and
Governours, are made of the same corrupted mold
with those, whom they governe; oft-times expo∣sed
by height of place to greater blasts of mutabili∣tie,
and inconstancy, than their inferiours; Publicke
Lawes have beene sought out by most Nations, to
runne like a straight line, betwixt two distorted and
crooked ones; and to bee as a firme, or barre, be∣tweene
the tumultuous and raging passions of
Princes and subjects, which every foot (as we say)
would fall foule were they not thus <HI>fended</HI> off, one
from the other. Vpon this consideration many
Conquerours have beene content to sheathe up a
great part of their illimited power (retayning some
competent prerogatives to themselves and their
successors) in publicke Edicts or Lawes, not alto∣gether
so unalterable as the Lawes of the <HI>Medes</HI> and
<HI>Persians:</HI> yet lesse subject to change, then Lords
purposes, or Princes pleasures: and every Act wher∣to
they passe their consent, restraines them of some
former liberty, and abates somewhat of their pre∣sent
greatnesse; to whose length or continnance
(as <HI>Theopompus</HI> observed) much by this meanes, is
added; and it were better to live an hundred yeares,
(as hee said) with ingenuous <HI>health</HI> and <HI>strength,</HI>
then to swagger it for twenty, with gyantly force,
or Athleticall constitution. And albeit the Law
(which is a common looking glasse to direct the
Prince in commanding, and the subject in obeying)
<PB N="125" REF="69"/>
may sometimes lay out authority, and sometimes
<HI>obedience,</HI> or inflict punishment one while, and dis∣pense
rewards another while, in measure greater or
lesse, than a wise &amp; just Arbitrator, chosen for these
particular purposes, would allow of; yet hath it
beene thought fittest for all parts, rather to brooke
these interposed mischiefes, then to be perpetually
subject to the former inconveniences of the Papa∣cie;
if the Popes (such as they are) or other Princes
should practise according to the Canonists rule,
<HI>Papa nunquam ligat sibi manus, The Pope never tyes
his owne hands.</HI></P>
<P>3 But the unerrable rule of everlasting Iustice,
who from eternity decrees, whatsoever may bee,
and foresees whatsoever will be, (because Heaven
and Earth may sooner passe than his words or acts)
<HI>passeth</HI> no act to the prejudice of his absolute and
eternall power of Iurisdiction. What grant or pro∣mise
soever he make, cannot binde the exercise of
his everlasting libertie, for a moment of time: they
last no longer than <HI>durante beneplacito:</HI> seeing gra∣cious
<HI>Equity,</HI> and onely it, is his everlasting plea∣sure.
He ever was, ever is, and ever shall be, alike
indifferent and free to recompence every man ac∣cording
to his present wayes. And in that, hee al∣waies
searcheth the very hart and secret thoughts,
and never ceaseth to <HI>decree;</HI> his one and indivisibly
everlasting decree, without any variety or shadow
of change in it selfe; fits all the changes, severall
dispositions, and contingent actions of Men and
Angels, as exactly, as if he did conceive, and shape
a new Law, for every one of them; and they are
<PB N="126" REF="70"/>
conceived and brought forth, as wel befitting them
as the skin doth the body, which nature hath en∣wrapped
in it. No man living (I take it) will a∣vouch
any absolute necessity from all Eternity, that
God should inevitably decree the deposition of
<HI>Elies</HI> line from the Priesthood, or his two sonnes
destructions by the Philistims: For this were to
bereave him of his absolute and eternall liberty. I
demand then, whether within the compass of time,
or in eternity, as praeexistent to <HI>Elies</HI> dayes, he past
any act that could restraine his eternall liberty of
honouring <HI>Elies</HI> families, as well as any others in
their time? To say, He did, were impiety; because
it chargeth the Almighty with impotent immuta∣bility.
What shall we say then? The deposition
of his race, the sudden death and destruction of his
sonnes, were not at all absolutely necessary, but ne∣cessary
onely upon supposed miscariage of the pos∣sible
meanes and opportunities, which hee had gi∣ven
them for honouring him. And that eternall
decree, <HI>[They that dishonour mee, them will I disho∣nour,]</HI>
as coexistent to the full measure of this their
transgression, by it <HI>shapes</HI> their punishment.</P>
<P>4 To thinke of Gods eternall decree with admi∣ration
void of danger; we must conceive it, as the
immediate <HI>Axis</HI> or Center, upon which every suc∣cessive
or contingent act revolves: and yet withall,
<HI>that,</HI> wherein the whole <HI>frame</HI> of <HI>succession</HI> or <HI>con∣tingency</HI>
is fully comprehended, as an unconstant
movable Sphere in a farre greater quiescent, or ra∣ther
in such a one (as in the description of Eternity
was imagined) which hath drawne all the successive
<PB N="127" REF="70"/>
parts of motion, into an indivisible unity of durati∣on
permanent. Every part of the larger Sphere
(this, swallowing up motion, in vigorous rest)
should have coexistence locall with all and every
part of the next moveable Sphere under it, move it
as slowly and swiftly, as the latitude of successive
motion can admit. Whilest we thus conceive of
Gods eternall decree, and of his foreknowledge,
(included in our conceipt of it) according to the
Analogy of what we must beleeve, concerning the
manner of his <HI>ubiquitary presence</HI> or <HI>immensity:</HI>
we shall have no occasion to suspect, that his neces∣sary
foreknowledge of what we doe, should lay a
necessity upon our actions, or take away all possibi∣lity
of doing otherwise. Rather, we may by this
supposall, beleeve that as probable, and perceive in
part the manner how it is so, which shall by Gods
assistance be demonstrated to be <HI>de facto</HI> most true.
As, first, that the Omnipotent doth eternally de∣cree
an absolute contingency in most humane acts:
Secondly, that this eternall act or decree (which
we thus conceive to be throughout the whole suc∣cession
of time, in every place indivisibly coexistent
to each humane thought or action) doth not only
perpetually support our faculties, but withall un∣cessantly
inspire them with contingency in their
choice: that is, it so moves them, as they may with∣out
lett or incumbrance, move themselves more
wayes then one: And yet, even whilest it so moves
them, it withall inevitably effects the proportioned
consequents, which from everlasting were fore∣ordained
to the choices, which we make, be they
<PB N="128" REF="71"/>
good or bad; or according to the severall degrees
of good or evill done by us, or of our affections or
desires to doe them.</P>

there should be no reluctance of contrary or
hostile qualities, unlesse each had a kinde of grate∣full
right or interest in their owne <HI>being,</HI> and were
taught by nature to fight for it, as men doe for their
lives or goods. This is that <HI>goodnesse</HI> which we call
<HI>entitative</HI> or <HI>transcendentall.</HI> A goodnesse equally,
alike truly communicated to al things that are, from
his goodnesse who onely is; but not participated
equally, or according to equality, by all. For as the
<PB N="129" REF="71"/>
least vessell that is filled to the brimme, is as full as
the greatest that can be, and yet the quantity of li∣quor
contained in them equally full, is most une∣quall: So, albeit the entitative being of the Flye,
Ant, or Worme, be unto them as good as mans be∣ing
is to man: (For even the <HI>Ant or Flye being
vext,</HI> or Wormes trod upon, will bewray their
spleene, and labour as it were to right themselves
for the losse or prejudice which they suffer in their
Entitative goodnesse, by doing harmes to their
tormentors) yet is mans <HI>being</HI> simply much better
than the <HI>being</HI> of Ants or Wormes. And much
worse were that Man, than any Beast, that with
<HI>Gryllus</HI> in the Poet, would like to change his hu∣mane
nature, for a bruitish. This excesse of entita∣tive
goodnesse, by which one creature excelleth
another, accreweth partly from the excellency of
the specificall Nature of Entity which it accompa∣nieth;
as there is more Entitative goodnesse is <HI>be∣ing</HI>
a <HI>Man</HI> than in <HI>being</HI> a <HI>Lyon;</HI> and more in being
a <HI>Lyon,</HI> than in being some inferiour ignoble Beast:
it partly accreweth according to the greater or les∣ser
measure, wherein severall creatures enjoy their
specificall Nature. Men though by nature equall,
are not equally happy, either in body or minde.
Bodily life in it selfe is sweet, and is so apprehen∣ded
by most; yet is lothsome to some; who (as
we say) doe not enjoy themselves, as none of us
fully doe. Sensitive appetites may be in some mea∣sure
satisfied by course, not all at once. The com∣pleat
fruition of goodnesse incident to one, defeats
another (though capable of greater pleasure) for

the time, of what it most desires. <HI>Venter non habet

feedes the mind, but pines the body <HI>Of ma∣king
many Bookes</HI> (saith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Eccles. 12 12.</NOTE> <HI>Salomon) there is no end;

Knowledge we get, the greater capacity wee leave

possession of our owne selves: and contempla∣tion
(as the wise King speaketh) were vanity, did we
use the pleasures of it any otherwise, thā as pledges
or earnest of a better life to come. And albeit man,
in this life, could possesse himselfe as intirely as the
Angels doe their Angelicall Natures, yet could
not his entitative goodnesse or felicity, be so great
as theirs is; because the proper patrimony which
he possesseth, is neither so ample nor so fruitfull.
God alone is <HI>infinite,</HI> in being <HI>infinitely</HI> perfect;
and he alone, <HI>infinitely</HI> enjoyes his intire <HI>being,</HI> or
perfection. The tenure of his <HI>infinite</HI> joy or hap∣pinesse,
is infinitely firme, infinitely secured of be∣ing
alway what it is; never wanting so much as a
moment of time, to inlarge or perfect it by conti∣nuance,
uncapable of any inlargement or increase
for the present. But this entitative or transcenden∣tall
goodnesse, is not that which wee now seeke;
whereto notwithstanding it may lead us. For even
amongst visible creatures, the better every one is
<PB N="131" REF="72"/>
in its kind, or according to its entitative perfection,
the more good it doth to others. The truest mea∣sure
of their internall or proper excellencies, is
their beneficial use or service in this great Vniverse,
whereof they are parts. What Creature is there
almost in this whole visible Sphere, but specially in
this inferiour part, which is not beholden to the
Sunne; from whose comfortable heat, <HI>Nothing</HI> (as

livelesse or meere bodies, in it selfe, the best and fai∣rest;
and farre the best to others. And God (as it
seemes) for this purpose, sends forth this his most
conspicuous and goodly messenger, every morning
like a bridegroome bedeckt with light and come∣linesse,
to invite our eyes to looke up unto the Hils
whence commeth our Helpe: upon whose tops he
hath pitched his glorious Throne, at whose right
hand is fulnesse of pleasures everlasting. And from
the boundlesse Ocean of his internall or transcen∣dent
joy and happinesse, sweet streames of perpetu∣all
joy and comfort, more uncessantly issue, than
light from the Sunne, to refresh this vale of misery.
That of men the chiefe inhabitants of this great
Vale, many are not so happy as they might be, the
chiefe causes are; that, either they doe not firmely
beleeve the internall <HI>happinesse</HI> of their Creator, to
be absolutely infinite, as his other attributes are; or
else consider not in their harts, that the absolute <HI>in∣finitie</HI>
of this his internall happinesse, is an essentiall
cause of goodnesse (in it kinde, infinite) unto all o∣thers,
so farre as they are capable of it; and capable
of it all reasonable creatures, by creation, are: none

but themselves can make them uncapable of happi∣nesse,

no God.</HI> The divine nature (saith he) is not pene∣trable
by mercy or pity: Why so? Will you heare
a bruit make <HI>Enthymems?</HI> Because these finde no
entrance into the hearts of men, but through some
breach of defect or indigence. It is well this slow∣bellyed
evill beast, could grant mans nature not to
bee altogether so bad or cruell, as want might not
tame it, and make it gentle and kinde. But would
not bruit qeasts, so they might speake, disclaime his
conclusion; that true felicity, or fulnesse of all con∣tentment
possible, should make the divine nature
worse, than want and misery doth the humane?
Surely, there is somewhat else amisse in that, which
is made better by defect. Nor could wealth and ho∣nour
make the mighty unmindefull of others, but
by making them first forget themselves. The ex∣ternalls
whereon our desires fasten, so captivate the
humane soule, that she cannot doe as she would, or
<PB N="134" REF="74"/>
as nature teacheth her; but these strings being cut,
she followes her native sway. And in a good sense
it was most true, which a Master of a better sect,
than <HI>Epicurus</HI> founded, hath taught; <HI>Nemo sponte

<P><HI>3 Lust in old Age, Pride in Beggars, and shift∣ing
in men overflowing with wealth, seeme to tran∣scend
the nature of sinnes, and are monsters in cor∣rupted
nature; because, not begotten by temptati∣ons,
they in a manner beget themselves: yet scarce
shall we finde an old man so prone to Lust, a rich
man so delighted in shuffling, an Epicure so addic∣ted
to his pleasure, or any at all so ill affected either
in himselfe or towards other; that being askt, wold
not professe his desire to deserve well of others, to
be liberall, to be upright, compassionate, just and
bountifull. For though continuāce in bad custome,
induce in a sort, another nature; yet can it not trans∣port
any man so farre beyond himselfe, or miscarry
his thoughts so much, but he shall feele some secret
impulsions unto goodnesse, and some retractions
from evill.

<PB N="135" REF="74"/>
marvaile that we do not amend what we know to be a∣misse
in ourselves; seeing errors in every other mystery
or profession, make the professor ashamed: Onely such
as erre in matter of life &amp; manners are delighted with
their errours. The Mariner takes no delight to see his
vessell overturned, nor the Physitian in sending his
Patient before his time unto his grave. The Oratour
rejoyceth not when his Clyent is through his errour
overthrowne. Contrariwise, every criminous person is
delighted with his crime. One solaceth himselfe in
Adultery, and taketh courage to prosecute his desires
from the very difficulty of accomplishing thē. Another
delights in over-reaching others, and in theft; never
displeased with his faultinesse, untill it prove unfortu∣nate.
All are apt to dissemble their faults, being con∣tent
when they fall out fortunately, to reape the fruit of
them, whilest they subduct the faults of them; but, a
good conscience delighteth to set it selfe forth and to
have notice taken of it, whereas naughtinesse is afraid
of darknesse it selfe. <HI>And as</HI> Epicurus <HI>elegantly saith,</HI>
A malefactor may have the hap, but not the assu∣rance
to be undiscovered. But <HI>(as this Author re∣plyes)</HI>
what availes it him not to have his naughti∣nesse
discovered, without hope or assurance that it shall
not be discovered. <HI>His conclusion is,</HI> Naughtines may
be safe, but it can never be secure.</P>
<P>4 The reason why their naughtinesse an never
be warranted with security, is; because conscience
in men most vicious, still beares evidence against
them, that they live not as shee would have them.
For (as <HI>Seneca</HI> in the same place well observes)
<HI>though bad custome may worke a delight in naughti∣nesse,
<PB N="136" REF="75"/>
yet even in minds drencht in the very dreggs of
filthinesse, there still remaines a sense of goodnesse: nor
is it so much our want of knowledge, as of our right
estimate of what we know to be nought, which maketh
naughtinesse to be so little abhorred.</HI> The minde of
man, in that it is indued with reason, hath the rules
of Equity imprinted in it; which it alwaies seekes
to instampe upon the inferior faculties of the soule.
But this divine light of reason, hath as small force
to kindle the love of vertue in hearts overgrowne
with sensuall desires, as the Sunne in a mist, hath to
set moist stuffe on fire. The unsetled affections of
youth, somtimes admit the impression of these ide∣all
characters, in actuall retired speculations; so will
the water take the same shape from the seale, which
the waxe doth, but hold it no longer than the seale
is held upon it. The heart, which maturity of years
hath hardened with vast desires, will as hardly bee
wrought into a new forme, as the stone, which can∣not
take any other shape, but only by losing some of
its masse or substance; yet if those vast desires be cut
off, or their hopes of supplyes from externalls in∣terecepted;
the soule, thus freed, becomes more fa∣shionable
unto reason. Affability, which is as the
superficiall draught of reason indeavouring to
stampe the heart with reall and solid kindnesse; is as
naturall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Epicure, as to another man, so long
as the exercise of it is not prejudiciall to his belly.
And the less his desires were to satisfie it, the larger
would the extension of his bowels of compassion
be towards his brethren, or poore neighbours; some
drops of <HI>kindnesse</HI> may distill from him in the over∣flow
<PB N="137" REF="75"/>
of plentie or store sufficient to feed both eye
and appetite. But in the daies of scarcity, he suckes
in cruelty as wine, and feedes upon the needy as up∣on
delicates: Were there no more sweet morsels
in the market then would serve one man; not one
of this crew, but would cut them out of his Fathers
throat, rather than suffer his owne weasand to bee
defeated of its intemperate expectations. Indi∣gence
then, though <HI>Epicurus</HI> could not see so
much, is, upon different occasions, the mother as
well of cruelty and oppression, as of bounty or
pitty.</P>
<P>2 From doing to all, as we would be done unto
by any, nothing doth hinder us so much (if ought
befides doe hinder us at all) as our conceipted or
opinative want of somewhat, which either for the
present we doe, or hereafter may stand in need off,
for satisfying the variety or unconstant longings of
our unknowne desires. How well soever they may
speake or protest, experience schooles us; not to
trust any that fixe their expectations upon great
matters, or have one eye alwayes upon their pri∣vate
ends, but with this limitation; if the premisses
they now make shal not crosse their opportunities,
when matters come to tryall. But if wee know a
man of meanes, more than competent for maintai∣ning
that estate wherein his constant resolution
hath pitcht content, one otherwise of tempe∣rate
desires, and composed affections, able to
discerne what is fitting betwixt man and man; we
thinke him a fit rule for directing others, a patterne
whereto would all conforme themselves, nothing
<PB N="138" REF="76"/>
should goe amisse in Church or Common weale.
No man that conceives his owne cause to bee just
and good, but would commend it to his arbi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re∣ment
before anothers. For▪ internall moderation
mixt with outward competency, is the onely sup∣porter
of true constancy. Yet cannot this mixture,
in any created Essence bee so firme or permanent,
but possibilities or opportunities of satisfying some
internall latent capacities, by externall proffers,
may dissolve it. For finite existence hath possibi∣lity
of nonexistence to controll it, and possibility of
nonexistence includes possibility of being other∣wise
than it is. And therefore it is never impossi∣ble
to finite being either to lose it selfe, or change
his properties. A more particular root of this con∣tingency,
or unconstancy in reasonable creatures or
intelligent, is the infinite capacity of their conceits
or desires; within whose compasse their finite mo∣tions
may become <HI>excentricke</HI> and <HI>irregular,</HI> as it
were a starre fixed in too wide a sphere. The desires
of collapsed <HI>Angells,</HI> were once tuned by their
Creator in as perfect harmony as any creatures
could be: They had all cōpetency that could be de∣sired,
whether of internall faculties, or of objects to
cōtent thē. Howbeit, whilst the chiefe Ringleader
of this rebellious Rout, sought to satisfie this <HI>infi∣nitie</HI>
of his desire; not by participation of his joy∣full
presence, who was infinitely good; but by af∣fecting
that greatnesse and Majesty infinite, which
he was enabled to conceive, but whereof his nature
was more uncaple than a whirry of an <HI>Argoes-eyes</HI>
saile; his capacities did overcope. And his in∣temperate
<PB N="139" REF="76"/>
longings, while he was in travell of this
prodigious birth, hath imprinted that vgly shape
upon him, which now he beares. Hee is become
the monstrous brood of his owne monstrous and
deformed desires; his mouth opening too wide to
swallow that which is incomprehensible, could ne∣ver
since be shut; his ravenous appetite cannot bee
satisfied. Like the grave he feedes on rottennesse,
and by continuall gnawing and devouring that
which cannot satiate, he continually encreaseth his
unquenchable hunger. His will is wedded unto
mischiefe, and affecteth nothing but that which is
by nature evill; &amp; amongst evills that most greedily
and uncessantly, which is most contrary to <HI>infinite
goodness.</HI> The first man by this monsters impulsi∣on,
reaching too high for that which hee could
not compasse, did put himselfe from off the ap∣pointed
Center of his rest and revolutions; and
since continueth irregular and unconstant in all
his motions, thoughts, and actions. In him, in
our selves, in the whole nature (besides that part
which hath firme union with the infinite Es∣sence)
wee finde the Maxime infallibly verified,
<HI>Mota facilius moventur.</HI> By our first Parents
needlesse yeelding to one temptation, wee are not
able to resist any; Our resolutions to follow that
which wee acknowledge to bee good, or our ad∣haerence
unto that infinite goodness, from which
he divorced his will; can neuer in this life bee so
firme and strong, but the allurements to contrary
evills, may bee so great or so cunningly proposed
by the great Tempter, that, without especiall grace
<PB N="140" REF="77"/>
we cannot resist their attractions. Since our inter∣nall
harmonie betwixt soule and body; and mutu∣all
correspondency of each faculty with other,
was dissolved, no externalls can consort with us.
Iust competency seemes too little, all of us being
as easily led by abundance, as driven by want, to
doe evill. And, which is worst of all, our earnest
attempts to doe that which is good and right,
drawes iniquity after them; and whiles wee take
too hastie, or unweildy ayme at our owne welfare,
others harmes fall under our levell.</P>
<P>6 That which most improoveth the force
of temptations, whether suggested by want or
indigence, or by other occasions or opportu∣nities;
is the inequalitie, partly of our naturall
propensions, partly of meanes which minister
their severall contentments or annoyances.
Wealth, in some men, gets the start of Wit, and
overswayes them (otherwise not much mis-in∣clined)
unto such vanities, as usually are neither
bredd nor nursed, but by abundance. Others
wits over-reach their revenues; and imboldens
them to stretch their projects or inventions be∣yond
the rules of right and equity. Some
mens bodies overgrow their soules; and these
are easily impelled to act any boysterous mis∣chiefe:
Others being impotent of bodie,
strive so much the more to furnish their mindes
with subtill inventions or commodious expe∣rience:
and by making too much use of the com∣mon
Proverbe, <HI>[Hee that is weake had need to
bee wilie,]</HI> are easily tempted to practise un∣lawfull
<PB N="141" REF="77"/>
policie, with delight; as the onely preser∣vative
against contempt, or as an instrument of
revenge upon such as they hate or feare. And
it would goe much against the course of com∣mon
experience, if that wilinesse which hath
weaknesse for its foundation, should not be of∣ten
enforced to cover or shelter it selfe with
craft and fraud. To love our owne wills, is an im∣potency
naturall unto all. And wee love them
the better, at least more strongly, when we per∣ceive
them set on that which in it selfe is good.
Whence it is that our desires of doing many things
which are good and commendable, often draw
us to use meanes not so commendable, for their
accomplishment. Many, out of an extraordina∣rie
good will unto the poore, thinke it no robbery
to cozen the rich; or to dispense with publike
Lawes, for gratifying some private friend, whose
welfare in conscience they are bound to tender.
Vnto these, and many like enormities, the infinite
Capacity of finite Existence gave first possibility
of being, and the inequality of our internall pro∣pensions,
which can never fitly match or hold just
proportion with externall occurrences, gives life
and improvement.</P>
<P>7 But in the incomprehensible Sphere, which
hath Vbiquity for its Center, and Omnipotency
for its <HI>Axis;</HI> whose numberlesse <HI>lines</HI> are all pos∣sible
perfections, <HI>measurelesse;</HI> there is no place
for exorbitancie. One branch of <HI>Being,</HI> cannot
mis-sway or over-toppe another; all being so
great and firme, as none can bee greater or
<PB N="142" REF="78"/>
firmer; being not united, but possessed in such per∣fect
unity, as prevents all possibility of distraction
or division. Shall wee say then, hee possesseth all
things that possibly he can desire to have? Or ra∣ther,
he alwayes infinitely is, without all possibili∣ty
of not being, whatsoever possibly can be. And
though being infinite, he can doe all things; yet can
he not desire to perfect himselfe, or to be greater or
better than he is. In that he neither can feare the
impayrement, nor wish the inlargement of his own
estate; all outward imployments of his power are
for the good of his creatures. His will to have
them when they were not, was but the influence or
working of his essentiall goodnesse; which is so a∣bundantly
sufficient to his infinite <HI>being,</HI> that the
overflowing of it is the fountaine of all things be∣sides,
which are good. Nothing besides him could
possibly have beene, unlesse he were in power and
in <HI>being,</HI> infinite. And unlesse his infinite <HI>being</HI> had
beene infinitely good, nothing besides him, should
actually have beene, or beene indowed with such
<HI>being,</HI> as all things that actually are, have from him.
The proper <HI>being</HI> of every thing, which actually is,
or at least the continuance or amendment of such
<HI>being,</HI> is infinitely desired by all, as being the stamp
or impression of his infinite goodnesse, which is a∣like
truly, though not equally, or in the same mea∣sure
communicated to all things that are. The
Entity of every thing is good to it selfe, and most
desired.</P>
<P>8 And though these first assurances of his good∣nesse
and loving kindnesse, be usually requited on
<PB N="143" REF="78"/>
mans part with unkindnesse and despight: yet the
greatnesse of his Majesty, never swayes him to sud∣den
revenge. Quite contrary to the corrupt nature
of man, (whose <HI>goodnesse</HI> usually is ill-thriven by
his over-growing <HI>greatnes:)</HI> the unresistible strength
of his Almighty power, is the unmovable pillar of
moderation and mercifull forbearance. The grea∣test
potency of man being but finite, the higher it
growes, the apter it is to be overtopt with jealous
impotency. The greatest Monarch that is, may be
prevented by others, (of whose power he is jea∣lous)
in the exercise of his power or authority o∣ver
him; unlesse he carefully watch his time, and fit
seasons, or take opportunity when it is offered, for
accomplishing his projects. But of God, saith the
Wiseman, <HI>Wisd. 12. 18. Thou mustring thy power
judgest with equity, and orderest, or governest us with
great favour; for thou maist use power when thou wilt.
And his will is to use it, when men will not beleeve that
he is of full power to doe what hee will;</HI> as the same
Wiseman expresseth, <HI>vers. 17.</HI> But more full unto
our present purpose, are the sayings of the same
Wiseman, <HI>vers. 15, 16. For so much then as thou art
righteous thy selfe, thou orderest all things righteously;
thinking it not agreeable with thy power to condemne
him that hath not deserved to be punished. For thy
power is the beginning of righteousnesse, and because
thou art the Lord of all, it maketh thee to be gracious
to all.</HI> Though this Author be not, yet this passage
in him, is canonicall, and fully consonant to Gods
owne words to <HI>Ionah,</HI> Chap. 4. 10, 11. <HI>Then said the
Lord, thou hast had pitie on the Gourd, for the which
<PB N="144" REF="79"/>
thou hast not labored, neither madest it to grow, which
came up in a night, and perished in a night: And
should not I spare Nineveh that great City, wherein
are more than sixscore thousand persons, that cannot
discerne between their right hand and their left hand,
and also much cattle?</HI> Amongst great men▪ many
oppresse their tenants: but what Lord would spoile
his proper inheritance, whereto no other can be in∣tituled;
or eate out the heart of that ground which
hee cannot alienate or demise? What Architect
would deface his owne worke, unlesse the image of
his unskilfulnesse (whereof the Creator cannot bee
impeached) be so apparant in it, as he cannot but
blush to behold it? Or who would leave a goodly
foundation bare or naked, unlesse he be unable to
reare it up without injustice? Now seeing the En∣titative
Good of proper <HI>being,</HI> is the <HI>foundation</HI> of
that true happinesse which flowes from more spe∣ciall
participation of Gods presence; wheresoever
he hath laid the one, it is to all that rightly consider
his <HI>Wisedome, Truth,</HI> and <HI>Goodnesse,</HI> an assured
pledge of his will and pleasure to finish it with the
other. As his nature is immutable, so are his gifts
without repentance. The current of his joyfull be∣neficence,
can admit no intermission, much lesse
admixture of any evill. Sorrow, woe, and misery,
must seeke some other Originall; they have no hid∣den
vent, or secret issue from the Ocean of Ioy and
Happinesse.</P>
<P>9 As the fountaine of bodily light cannot send
forth darknesse, but uniformly diffuseth light; and
light onely throughout this visible Sphere: so can∣not
<PB N="145" REF="79"/>
the infinite Ocean of true felicity, send forth a∣ny
influence, but such as is apt to cherish the seeds
of joy and happinesse; wherewith every creature
capable of them, was sowne in its first creation.
And, as it is the property of light propagated or
diffused from the Sunne, to make such bodies as are
capable of its penetration (as Glasses, Chrystall,
Pearle, &amp;c.) secondary fountains of light to others:
so doth the influence of divine goodnesse, inspire
all that are conformable to his will, with desire of
doing to others as he hath done to them; that is, of
being secondary authors or instruments of good to
all. But such as wilfully strive against the streame of
his over-flowing goodnesse, or boysterously coun∣terblast
the sweet and placide spirations of celesti∣all
influence, become creators of their owne woe,
and raise unto themselves those stormes wherein
they perish. Yet so essentiall it is unto this infinite
Fountaine of goodnesse, however provoked, to
send forth onely streames of life; and such is the
vertue of the streames which issue from him, that
as well the evill and miseries which miscreants pro∣cure
unto themselves, as their mischievous intenti∣ons
towards others, infallibly occasion increase of
joy and happinesse unto all that give free passage
unto their current. And this current of life, which
issueth from this infinite Ocean, never dryes up, is
never wasted by diffusion: The more it is dammed
or <HI>quarved</HI> by opposition of the sonnes of darke∣nesse,
the more plentifully it overflowes the sonnes
of light. All the good which one refuseth or put∣teth
from thē, returnes in full measure to the other.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="80"/>
But if the miseries which wicked spirits, or their
conforts, either suffer themselves, or intend to
others, worke good to those that receive the in∣fluence
of infinite goodnesse; might he not with∣out
prejudice, or imputation, inspire these cast∣awayes
with such mischievous thoughts, or at
least intend their woe and misery, as these are
occasions or meanes of others happinesse, or of
his glory? Wee are indeed forbid to doe evill
that good may ensue; but if it bee his will to
have reprobates doe or suffer evill for the good
of his chosen, shall not both bee good, as willed
by him, whose will (in that hee hath absolute
dominion over all his creatures) is the rule of
goodnesse?</P>

that the decrees of great Monarchs, who are a

of Iustice, and their practices may not bee reputed
unjust either by themselves, or by others. But this
sophisticall inversion of these Ancients meaning,
was too palpable to please either the wiser or ho∣nester
sort of Heathen, though living in those cor∣rupt

<P>2 To derogate ought from his power, who is

more odious. Yet this comparison I may safely
make:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Quanto superior est Deus homi∣ne, tam mea malitia est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nferior bo∣nitate eius, ut qualitate ita etiam quantitate. Anselm. in meditat. cap. 8.</NOTE> He doth not more infinitely exceed the

than he doth the greatest Monarch the world

nor is his will the rule of Goodnesse, be∣cause
the designes thereof are backt by infinite po∣wer;
but because holines doth so rule his power, and
moderate his will, that the one cannot enjoyne, or
the other exact any thing not most consonant to
the eternall or abstract patternes of equity. His will
revealed doth sufficiently warrant all our actions,
because we know, that he wils nothing but what is
just and good; but this no way hindereth, but rather
supposeth Iustice and Goodnesse to be more essen∣tiall
objects of his will, than they are of ours. And
therefore when it is said [Things are good because
God wils them] this <HI>illative</HI> infers only the cause of
our knowledge, not of the goodness w<SUP>ch</SUP> we know:

<PB N="149" REF="81"/>
Gods will revealed commends it for such.</HI> But his will
revealed commends it for such, because it was in it
nature good; for unlesse such it had bin, he had not
willed it. These principles though unquestionable
to such as fetch their Divinity from the Fountaine,
will perhaps in the judgement of others that never
taste it but in trenches, be liable to these exceptiōs.</P>
<P>3 If the goodnesse of every thing presuppose its
being, &amp; nothing can be without Gods wil, what cā
be good (we speake in order of nature, not of time)
before God wills it? Of being or goodnesse actu∣ally
existent in any creature, it is most true, neither
can be without some precedent Act of Gods will.
But as there is a <HI>logicall possibility</HI> presupposed to
the working of the Almighty power: so is there a

the Act or exercise of his will. And unto some
things considered as <HI>logically possible;</HI> this <HI>goodnesse

disease. And our nature being corrupted, whets
our appetites to such things as are agreeable to the
praedominant corruption wherewith it is tainted,
not to the purity wherein it was created. To will
onely that which is consonant to his nature, is so
much more essentiall to God, than unto us, by how
much his nature is more simple than ours is. And
seeing it is essentiall purity, altogether uncapable
of corruption, his will cannot pitch but on that
which is pure and holy. Whence the prime rule of
all goodnesse, <HI>without himselfe,</HI> is consonancy to
his essentiall purity and Iustice. <HI>For as much as
thou art righteous thy selfe thou orderest all things
righteously, thinking it not agreeable to thy power to
condemne him that hath not deserved to bee punished.

which is coeternall to his Essence, includes
an everlasting enmity unto treachery, fraud, and

purity, cannot approve of lust and intemperan∣cy,
or condemne chastity in any person, at any time.
Nor could he have given a Law, as some lawlesse
Lawgivers have done, for the authorizing of pro∣miscuous
or preposterous lust. To legitimate vio∣lence,
or entitle oppression unto the inheritance be∣queath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
to conscionable and upright dealing, is
without the prerogative of omnipotency; it can∣not
be ratified by any Parliament of the Trinitie
blest for ever. The practise, or countenance of
these and the like, are evill; not in us onely, to whom
they are forbidden; but so evill in themselves, that
<PB N="151" REF="82"/>
the Almighty could not but forbid and condemne
thē, as profest enemies to his most sacred Majesty.</P>
<P>4 To square great mens actions to the dictates
of reason or nature, given in their good dayes, or
to bring their wills within compasse of any con∣stant
Law; seemes greater violence, than if we
should seeke to fashion their bodies by handsome
well proportioned garments, but much too strait.
And yet we see by daily experience, that such as are
most impatient of <HI>regulation</HI> or restraint, are most
importunate to have their owne unruly wills, the
rules of their inferiours minds and consciences. To
doe otherwise than they would have them, though
they alleage the dictates both of reason and Gods
word, will admit no appeale from the censure of
<HI>peevishnesse</HI> or perversenesse. But for them to set
constant patternes of that morality or good beha∣viour,
whose defects in inferiours they either pu∣nish
or make advantage of; is reputed a kinde of
<HI>Pedantisme,</HI> or <HI>Mechanicall</HI> servitude. To request
such performances, seemes as harsh, as if we should
intreat them to set us copies, or songs, or take pains
in teaching us some honest trade. And seeing infe∣riours
are secretly blinded with this pride of heart;
which breakes forth more violently in superiours;
most of both rankes, measure Gods will by their
owne. But if wee will condemne this impatience
of restraint, as a fault in our selves, we must of neces∣sity
acquit the Almighty from the like. The infi∣nite
greatnesse of his Majesty, cannot wrest his
most holy will from strict observance of such rules
of <HI>Righteousnesse</HI> as he sets us to follow. That inte∣grity
<PB N="152" REF="83"/>
wherewith our first nature was cloathed,
was but the Image of his <HI>Holinesse.</HI> And hee that
requires us <HI>to be holy, as He is holy, or perfect as our
Heavenly Father is perfect;</HI> exacts not of us, that wee
should be as holy and perfect as <HI>Hee</HI> is, in any point
of his imitable perfections. Every part of that ho∣linesse
which becommeth Saints, is in the best of
them, but as the <HI>materiall</HI> forme in an house built of
untowardly stuffe, by unskilfull hands: but in <HI>Him,</HI>
according to the exactest Mathematicall or I∣daeall
forme, that the cunningest Architect hath in
his head. The best examples of goodnesse, we can
conceive, are but as dead pictures of those <HI>everli∣ving</HI>
ones, which <HI>He</HI> expresseth in his workes. All
his decrees concerning man, are not in themselves
onely, but to mans eyes that looke not on them a
squint, so straight and just, that hee will referre the
tryall unto the deliberate and sober thoughts of his
Enemies. <HI>Is not my way equall? Are not your waies
unequall? Ezek. 18. 25.</HI></P>
<P>5 This may instruct us, that those patternes of
Holinesse or perfections which wee are bound to
imitate in <HI>Him,</HI> are not to be taken from his bare
Commandement, or revelation of his will, but
from the objects of his will revealed, or from the
eternall practices which hee hath exhibited; as so
many expresse or manifest proofes, that his will is
alwayes Holy and Iust: albeit wee cannot alwaies
so expressely discerne the manner how it is just and
holy in some particular Commandements; but
must implicitely beleeve it to bee such in them, be∣cause
it is so eminently and apparantly holy and
<PB N="153" REF="83"/>
just in those perfections, whereof our generall du∣ties
are the imperfect representations. Of all his
morall commandements, not one there is, whose
sincere practise doth not in part make vs truely like
him; &amp; we are bound to be conformable to his will
revealed, that we may be cōformable to his <HI>nature;</HI>
without conformity wherevnto, we cannot parti∣cipate
of his happinesse; For, Happinesse is the
immediate consequent of his nature. The antece∣dent
of <HI>Lactantius</HI> Argument. <HI>[Qui nos irasci jubet,
is uti{que} irascitur,]</HI> .i. <HI>He that biddeth us be angry, is
certainly angry himselfe,]</HI> is not so certaine or au∣thentique,
and the inference is somewhat doubtfull.
But out of all question, he that bids us unfaignedly
blesse our persecutors, doth unfaignedly tender his
blessings to such as persecute <HI>Him</HI> in his members.
He that seriously exhorts us to bee mercifull and
kind to all, sheweth kindnesse to the most unkinde.
That charity which hee hath injoyned every man
towards all (his greatest enemies not excepted)
though we consider it in the most charitably mind∣ed
Martyrs, in whose death it seemed to shine, were
but as weake sparkles, or vanishing smoak, of those
infinite and eternall flames of love, which burst out
in him toward such, as have deserved worse at his
hands, than any Tyrant of his tormented servants.
That truth and fidelity, which he exacts of us, the
faithfulnesse of <HI>Abraham</HI> himselfe; is but a little
mappe, or narrow surface of that infinite <HI>soliditie</HI> of
<HI>truth,</HI> whereon his promises are <HI>founded.</HI> Betweene
the chastity and temperance of purest virgins, and
his eternall purity, there is the like true correspon∣dency;
<PB N="154" REF="84"/>
but not so great, as there is betwixt the
dross and corpulency, and the refined or sublima∣ted
spirits of the same bodies. Or could that rule
which is the fulfilling of the whole Law &amp; the Pro∣phets,
<HI>Doe unto every man as we would be done unto;</HI>
be exactly fulfilled by us; it would be but a slender,
though a true modell or representation of his eter∣nall
equity. <HI>He that honoureth me, him will I honor.</HI>
For in this, and the like, he expects no more than
the inward affection of mortall hearts, or prayses of
man whose breath is in his nostrils, being ready
out of his goodnesse, to recompence these silly
services, with glory, love and happiness everlasting.
But doth he intend thus well to all, or destruction
unto some, as it is a <HI>meanes</HI> of blisse to those whom
he loves? If so he did, we might be exempt from
that negative precept, of not doing evill that good
might ensue. For the only reason why we are boūd
not to doe so, is because in so doing we should be∣come
unlike our heavenly Father, and <HI>not be perfect</HI>
as he <HI>is perfect.</HI> But as he turnes the voluntary evils
of some, to the good of others; so may wee, and
ought to consecrate such forfeitures, as legally fall
into our hands to pious uses; or better the states of
such as tender publike welfare, by others deserved
harmes.</P>
<P>6 Be it then granted, (which is the root of all
objections against these resolutions) that Gods glo∣ry
must as well appeare in the punishment of the
Reprobate, as in the beatifying of the Elect; the
consequence will bee quite contrary to that which
their objections would hence inferre; For, if the
<PB N="155" REF="84"/>
foundation of Gods glory, bee as sure in the one
case, as in the other; the manner of his dealing
with both must be alike perfect, and alike behove∣full
for us to follow. <HI>Sine bonitate</HI> (saith <HI>Seneca)
nulla majestas, Goodnesse is the foundation of glory.</HI>
Now, were it true, that he did intend evill to some,
before they had committed any (though not as
evill to them, but as a meanes of others good) or
absolutely ordained them to eternall inevitable mi∣sery,
for the advancement of his owne glory; wee
should not sinne, but rather imitate the perfection
of our heavenly Father, in robbing <HI>Iudas</HI> to pay
<HI>Peter,</HI> or in feeding the hungry, such especially as
be of the houshold of Faith, with the spoiles of
ungodly rich men, or unbeleevers. More war∣rantable
it were to guesse at the perfection of his
Iustice towards the wicked, and of his bounty to∣wards
the godly, by the commendable shadow or
imitatiō of it in earthly gods. To procure the com∣mon
good without intention of harme to any, and
with admission of as few private mischiefes as may
be, is the chiefe praise of great States-men. And it
is the glory of Princes, to encourage all men unto
vertuous courses by good example, gratious ex∣hortations,
and unpartiall distribution of publike
honors or commodities: and yet withall to inflict
disgrace upon haughty contemners of those graci∣ous
allurements; and to bee sterne in execution of
Iustice (without fauour) upon notorious trans∣gressors
of wholesome Lawes. Yet not to use
severity without sorrow, nor draw blood but
by way of medicine; for preserving of their
<PB N="156" REF="85"/>
Crownes and dignities, for maintenance of publike
peace, or for preventing the like diseases in other
particular members of the same body. Magistrates
that would mind these matters, more than raysing
themselves, their friends, or posterity, more than
life it selfe, which they owe unto their Countrey;
should exhibite us a true model, though (God wot)
but a slender one of our heavenly Fathers wisdome
and loving kindnesse: first in drawing men to re∣pentance,
by gratious promises, and unfaigned pro∣posalls
of inestimable rewards for their service:
Secondly, in making the wicked and obstinate de∣spisers
of his infinite goodnesse, serve to the mani∣festation
of his endlesse glory, and confirmation of
those that love him in the immortal state of happi∣nesse.
These prints of his Fatherly care and Iustice,
are yet fresh to bee seene in his proceedings with
ungratious <HI>Cain. And the Lord said unto Cain, why
art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
if thou doe well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou
dost not well, sinne lyeth at the doore: And unto thee
shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him, Gen. 4.
ver. 6, 7.</HI> Severe punishment for doing evill, with∣out
precedent loving instructions, or good encou∣ragement
to doe well, is the naturall off-spring of
unnaturalnesse. It beares no shadow of that justice
or equity, whose glorious patterne shines most
brightly in our heavenly Father.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of God infinite love to mankinde.</HEAD>
<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F the Apostles authority could
not perswade us to beleeve,
his reasons would inforce us
to grant, that the <HI>issues</HI> of
<HI>blessing</HI> and <HI>cursing</HI> from one
and the same mouth, are
contrary to the course of na∣ture,
and argue the nature of man, (in whom alone
this discord is found) to be much out of tune. <HI>Out
of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing, my
brethren, these things ought not so to be. Iam. 3. 10.</HI> For
nature in other things gives you a better example.
<HI>Doth a fountaine send forth at the same place, sweet
water and bitter? Can the Figtree, my brethren, beare
Olive berries? either a Vine figs? &amp;c.</HI> These and
the like fountaines of naturall truth, are as open to
us, as they were to him, and wee should much
wrong both this Ambassador of Christ, and Gods
image in our selves, if we did beleeve them only for
his authority, and not for their owne native perspi∣cuity.
The best use of Apostolique<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>authority, in
these allegations, is to warrant our use of the like,
though in matters divine: not one of his instances
but holds as truly in God, as in man; not one but
receiveth a necessary increase of strength, from the
indivisible unity of the divine Essence. For a Fig-tree
to beare Olive berries, is lesse impossible, than
for the tree of life to bring forth death. To cause
<PB N="158" REF="86"/>
the Vine bring forth Figs, were not so hard a point
of husbandry, as to derive cursednesse or misery
from the fountaine of blisse. For a Spring to send
forth water sweet and bitter, fresh and salt, at one
and the same place, is more compatible with any
reasonable conceipt, than for hate or harmefull in∣tentions
to have any issue from pure love. <HI>But God
is love: yea, love is his Essence as Creator.</HI> In that he
is the Author of being, hee is the Author of good∣nesse
to all things that are, <HI>(Being, unto every thing
in its owne proper being, is good)</HI> and goodnesse in an
intelligent <HI>Don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> is alwayes the fruit of Love.
Hence saith the Wiseman, of him that is wisest of
all, of him that can neither deceive nor be deceived:
<HI>He hateth nothing that he hath made.</HI> For even their
being, and that goodnesse which accompanies it, is
an undoubted pledge of his love. If to blesse God
the maker, and to curse men which are made after
his similitude, argue (in the Apostles supposall) a
dissolution of that internall harmony, which should
be in the humane nature: to hate some, and love o∣thers
of his best creatures, all being made after his
owne image; would necessarily infer a greater di∣straction
in the indivisible Essence, besides the con∣tradiction
which it implyes to infinite goodnes. To
love the workes of his owne hands, is more essenti∣all
to him, that made all things out of meere love,
than it is unto the fire to burn matter combustible:
and if his love be, as he is, truly infinite, it must ex∣tend
to all, seeing all are lesse than infinite.</P>
<P>2 Love, were it perfect in us, would perfectly
fulfill Gods Law, and make up a compleate body
<PB N="159" REF="86"/>
or <HI>System</HI> of morall goodnes. Now the most abso∣lute
perfection of that love, whereof the humane
nature (though uncorrupted) could bee capable,
would be but an imperfect shadow of our heavenly
Fathers most perfect love; which hath the same
proportion to his goodnesse, that love in us (were
it as perfect as it possibly might bee) should have to
our morall goodnesse. That is, it is his compleat
communicative goodnes. And though these two in
him bee rather different names, than divers attri∣butes,
yet wee love his goodnes better, whiles it is
attired with the name of Love. For, of men that doe
us equall good turnes, we love them best, whom we
conceive to love us most: and loving kindnesse
seemes good and lovely, even in the eyes of such as
reape no profit from it, besides the sight of it. The
very exercise of it in others, excites our weake in∣clinations
to the like: and our inclinations moved,
stir up a speculative assent or secret verdict of con∣science,
to approve that truth which wee cannot
follow in the practice: <HI>Beatius est dare, quam acci∣pere:
It is a more blessed thing to give, than to receive.</HI>
No man measureth that which wee call a good na∣ture
(as of men some are better natured than others)
either by the means it hath to benefit, or by the be∣nefits
bestowed; but by the fervency of unfaigned
good will, and hearty desires of doing good to all.
This is that wherein (especially when it is holpen by
grace) we most resemble the divine nature, which is
infinitely better than the humane nature (though ta∣kē
at the best) not only in respect of his ability to do
good, but of his good wil to do the best that may be.
<PB N="160" REF="87"/>
And this his good will exceeds ours, not intensively
only, but extensively. For we are bound to imitate
him as well in the extension of our unfaigned good
will towards all, as in the fervency of our desires to
do the best good we can to some, because his loving
kindnes to man is both waies infinitly perfect, <HI>Thus
saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wise∣dome,
nor the strong man glory in his strength, neither
the rich man glory in his riches: But let him that glo∣rieth,
glory in this, that he understandeth, and knoweth
me; that I am the Lord which exercise loving kindnes,
judgement, and righteousnesse in the earth: for in
these things I delight, saith the Lord. Ier. 9. 23, 24.</HI>
The first then &amp; most native issue of infinite <HI>good∣nesse,</HI>
is the exercise of <HI>bounty</HI> or loving kindnesse,
which floweth from it, without matter or motive
to incite it. This is that which gave <HI>being,</HI> and with
being, some portion of goodnesse unto all things
that are; it alters the <HI>name,</HI> but not the <HI>nature</HI> in the
current. To prevent others with good turnes be∣fore
they can expect or deserve them, is the highest
point of bounty, whereto the ability of man can
reach. But God gave vs that we most desire, pro∣per
<HI>being,</HI> with the appurtenances, before we could
desire it; for it is the foundation of all desire. From
Bounty or loving kindnesse, or from that Good∣nesse
whence they spring, Mercy and Compassion
differ only in the extrinsecall denomination taken
from different objects. <HI>Compassion</HI> is good will to∣wards
others, provoked from notice of their mise∣rie:
and <HI>Mercy</HI> is but an excesse of <HI>Bounty,</HI> not e∣stranged
from ill deservers, in distresse; so long as
<PB N="161" REF="87"/>
the exercise of it breedes no harme to such as are
more capable of bountifull love and favour. This
incompossibility betweene the exercise of Mercy
and bounty towards particulars ill deserving, and
the preservation of common good, occasioneth the
interposition of Iustice punitive; whose exercise is
in a sort, unnaturall to the Father of mercy. <HI>For he
doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of
men. Lamen. 3. 33.</HI> Nothing in good men can pro∣voke
it towards offenders, but the good of others
deserving either better or not so ill, which might
grow worse by evill doers impunity. To take plea∣sure
in the paine or torture of notorious malefac∣tors,
is a note of inhumanity: their just punishment
is onely so farre justly pleasant, as it procures either
our owne, or others welfare; or avoydance of those
grievances, which they more justly suffer, than wee
or others of the same societie, should doe. The
more kind and loving men by nature are, the more
unwilling they are to punish, unlesse it be for these
respects. How greatly then doth it goe against his
nature, who is loving kindnesse it selfe, to punish
the workes of his owne hands; <HI>Man</HI> especially, who
is more deare unto him, than any child can be unto
his Father, for hee is the Father of all mankind?
<HI>For it is he that made us, and not we our selves;</HI> not
those whom we call Fathers of our flesh, for even
they likewise were made by <HI>Him.</HI> Hence he saith,
<HI>Call no mā Father on earth, for one is your Father</HI> w<SUP>ch</SUP>
<HI>is in Heaven, Mat. 23. ver. 9.</HI> Is the title his pecu∣liar,
more than the realty answering to it? Is he
more willing to bee called the onely Father of all
<PB N="162" REF="88"/>
the sonnes of men, than to doe the kinde office of a
Father to them? <HI>No, like as a Father pittieth his
owne children, so the Lord pitieth them that feare
him, For he knoweth our frame, he remembreth we are
but dust. Psal. 103. 13, 14.</HI> It seemes this Psalmist
either was or had a most kinde and loving Father,
and hence illustrates the kindnesse of his Heauenly
Father, by the best modell of kindnesse which hee
knew. But if God truly be a father of all mankind,
he certainly exceeds all other fathers as farre in fa∣therly
kindnesse, as hee doth men in any branch of
goodnesse or perfection. This is the first foun∣dation
of our Faith, layd by his onely Sonne:

<PB N="163" REF="88"/>
Abrahams,</HI> is infinitely greater than any Parents
beare to the fruits of their bodies. Mortall fathers
love children when they have them; but love to
themselves, or want of means to immortalize their
owne persons, makes them desire to have children.
The onely wise immortall God (who is all-sufficient
to all, most to himselfe, unacquainted with want of
whatsoever can bee desired) out of the abundance
of his free bounty and meere loving kindnesse, did
first desire our being; and having given it us, doth
much more love us, after we are instamped with his
Image. For he sowes not wheate, to reape tares;
nor did he inspire man with the breath of life, that
he might bring forth death.</P>

by these dearest references amongst men,
whose naturall affection towards their tender
brood (in respect of meaner creatures) is much aba∣ted
by wrong use of reason (as many mothers by
greatnesse of place, or curiosity of education, are
lesse compassionate towards their children, then
other silly women are) he hath chosen the most af∣fectionate
female amongst reasonlesse creatures, to
blazon his tender care and loving protection over
ill-deserving children: <HI>How often would I have ga∣thered
thy children together, even as a Hen gathereth
her chickens under her wings! Math. 23. ver. 37.</HI>
Finally, as he gives much more to our being, than
our earthly Parents, whom we suppose to give us
being; so all the sweet fruits or comforts of love,
whether of fathers and mothers towards their chil∣dren,
of husbands towards their wives, or of bre∣thren
to brethren, sisters to sisters, or one friend to
another (their sinfulnesse onely excepted) are
but distillations or infusions of his infinite love to
our nature. To witnesse this truth unto us, the son
of God was made both father, and brother and hus∣band
to our nature, &amp;c. Every reference or kinde
office, whereof reasonable creatures are mutually
capable, every other creature (though voyd of rea∣son,
so not voyd of love and naturall affection) may
expresse some part of our heavenly Fathers loving
<PB N="165" REF="89"/>
kindnesse: but the love of all, though infinitely in∣creased
in every particular, and afterwards made
up in one, could no way equalize his love towards
every particular soule created by him. Feare of
death or other danger, hath such joynt interest
with love, (as well in the heart of man, as in other
creatures) that, albeit they would doe more for
their yong ones than they doe, if they could, yet
they doe not usually so much as they might: not
so much for their model of wit or strength, as God
for his part though infinite in wisedome &amp; power
doth for the sonnes of men. He that feareth none,
but is feared of al, he that needs no Counsellor, but
hath the heart of Prince and Counsellor in his
hand, makes protestation in his serious griefe, that
he hath done all for his unfruitfull vineyard that he
could, as much as possibly could be done for it. Or,
if his serious protestations cannot deserve credit
with deceitfull man, his solemne oath is witnesse
of greater love than hath beene mentioned, of
greater than the heart of man is able to conceive,
even towards such as all their life time have hated
Him. <HI>As I live saith the Lord, I will not the death
of him that dyes.</HI></P>

doth not in her publike and authorized doctrine
come short of any Church this day extant, in the
extent of Gods unspeakable love to mankind. No
nationall Councell, though assembled for that pur∣pose,
could fit their doctrine more expresly to meet
with all the late restrictions of Gods love, than the
Church our mother, even from the beginning of re∣formation,
hath done; as if she had then foreseene a
necessity of declaring her judgement in this point,
for preventing schismes or distraction in opinions a∣mongst
her sonnes. First, she injoynes us to beseech
God to <HI>have mercy upon all men.</HI> This was the
practice of the Ancient Church, which in her opi∣nion,
needed no reformation. A practice injoyned
<PB N="167" REF="90"/>
by<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2. 1</NOTE> S. <HI>Paul, I exhort or desire first of all, that suppli∣cations,
prayers, intercessions, and giving thankes be
made for all men.</HI> If any man shall seeke to lay that
restraint upon this place, which S. <HI>Austine</HI> some∣where
doth, as if the word <HI>[all men]</HI> did import only
<HI>genera singulorum [all sorts of men,]</HI> not, <HI>singula gene∣rum,
[every particular man:]</HI> the scanning of the
words following, the sifting of the matter contai∣ned
in both, with the reason of the exhortation,
and other reall circumstances, will shake off this or
other like restriction, with greater ease than it can
be laid upon it. Wee are commanded to pray for
no more▪ than them, whose salvation we are unfai∣nedly
to desire, otherwise our prayers were hypo∣criticall.
Are we then to desire the salvation of some
men onely, as they are dispersed here and there,
throughout all nations, sorts, or conditions of men,
or for every man of what condition soever, of what
sort or nation soever he be? The Apostle exhorts
us to pray for Kings (not excepting the most malig∣nant
enemies which the Christians then had) and
<HI>for all that be in authority.</HI> And if we must pray for
all that are in authority, with fervency of desire,
that they may come unto the knowledge of the
truth; then questionlesse, wee are to desire, wee
are to pray for the salvation of all and every one,
which are under authority. <HI>God is no accepter of per∣sons;</HI>
nor will the Omnipotent permit us so to re∣spect
the persons of the mighty in our prayers, as
that we should pray that all and every one of them
might become <HI>Peeres</HI> of the heavenly Ierusalem,
and but some choice or selected ones of the mea∣ner
<PB N="168" REF="91"/>
sort might bee admitted into the same society.
Wee must pray then for high and low, rich and
poore, without excepting any, either in particular
or indefinitely. The reason why our prayers for all
men must be universall, is, because wee are bound
to desire the spirituall good of all men; not as they
fall under our indefinite, but under our uniuersall
consideration. The reason againe, why wee are
bound to desire the spirituall good of all men uni∣versally
considered, is, because wee must be perfect
as our heavenly Father is perfect. Vnto this uni∣versall
desire, wee must adde our best endeavours
that saving truth may be imparted unto all; because
it is our heavenly Fathers will, his unfaigned will,
that all <HI>should come to the knowledge of truth.</HI></P>
<P>2 Both parts of this inference <HI>[as first, that it is
our duty to pray for all sorts of men, and for every man
of what sort soever: And secondly, that we are there∣fore
to pray thus universally, because it is Gods will,
not onely that we should thus pray, but that all with∣out
exception shold come unto the truth and be saved]</HI>
are expressely included in the prayers appointed by
the Church of England to bee used upon the most
solemne day of devotions. The Collects or Praiers
are in number three. The first, <HI>Almighty God we
beseech thee graciously to behold this thy family for
the which our Lord Iesus Christ was contented to be
betrayed, and given up into the hands of wicked men,
and to suffer death upon the Crosse, &amp;c.</HI> The tenour
of this petition, if we respect onely the <HI>forme,</HI> is in∣definite
not universall: but every Logician knows,
and every Divine should consider, that the neces∣sity
<PB N="169" REF="91"/>
of the matter, whether in prayers or proposi∣tions,
will stretch the indefinite <HI>forme</HI> wherewith it
is instamped, as farre as an absolute universall. That
the <HI>forme</HI> of this petition is in the intention of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> to be as farre extended as we
have said (that is) [to all and every one of the con∣gregation
present] the prayer following puts out
of question. For in that wee are taught to pray for
the whole Church, and for every member of it. <HI>Al∣mighty
and everlasting God, by whose spirit the whole
body of the Church is governed and sanctified: re∣ceive
our supplications and prayers, which we offer be∣fore
thee for all estates of men in thy holy Congregati∣on;
that every member of the same, in his vocation and
ministery, may truly and godly serve thee. &amp;c.</HI> If here
it be excepted, that albeit this prayer be conceived
in termes <HI>formally</HI> universall, yet is the universall
<HI>forme</HI> of it to be no further extended, than its pro∣per
matter or subject; and that (as will be alleaged)
is the mysticall live-body of Christ, whose extent,
or the number of whose members, is to us un∣knowne:
the third and last prayer will clearely
quit this exception, and free both the former pe∣titions,
from these or the like restrictions. For in
the last prayer wee are taught to pray for all and e∣very
one which are out of the Church, that they
may bee brought into the Church, and bee made
partakers with us of Gods mercy, and the common
salvation. <HI>Mercifull God, who hast made all men, and
hatest nothing that thou hast made, nor wouldest the
death of a sinner, but rather that he should be conver∣ted
and live: have mercy upon all Iewes, Turkes, In∣fidells,
<PB N="170" REF="92"/>
and heretiques, and take from them all igno∣rance,
hardnesse of heart; and contempt of thy Word▪
And so fetch them home, blessed Lord, to thy flocke,
that they may bee saved among the remnant of the
true Israelites, and be made one fold, under one shep∣heard
Iesus Christ our Lord.</HI> If God therefore will
not the death of any Iew, Turke or Infidell, because
of nothing hee made them men: wee may safely
conclude that he willeth not the death of any, but
the life of all, whom of men or infidells, hee hath
made Christians; to whom he hath vouchsafed the
ordinary meanes of salvation, and daily invites, by
his messengers, to imbrace them. Hee which made
all things without invitation, out of meere love,
made nothing hatefull; nor is it possible that the
unerring fountaine of truth and love, should cast
his dislike, much lesse fix his hatred upon any thing
that was not first in it nature odious. Nothing can
make the creature hatefull or odious to the Crea∣tor,
besides its hatred or enmity of that love, by
which it was created, and by which <HI>he</HI> sought the
restauration of it when it was lost. Nor is it every
degree of mans hatred or enmity unto God, but a
full measure of it, which utterly exempts man from
his love; as that reverend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Hooper in his Pre∣face to the ten Com∣mande∣ments. See Parag. 8 of this chapter.</NOTE> Bishop and glorious
Martyr, one of the first Reformers of the Religion
profest in this Land, observes.</P>
<P>3 If with these authorized devotions we com∣pare
the doctrine of our Church in the publike ca∣techisme,
what can bee more cleare, then that as
God the Father doth love all mankind, without ex∣ception;
so the Sonne of God did redeeme not
<PB N="171" REF="92"/>
some onely of all sorts, but all mankind universally
taken: First wee are taught <HI>to beleve in God the
Father who made us and all the world.</HI> Now, if the
Church our mother have in the former prayers
truly taught us, that God hateth nothing which
he hath made; this will bring forth another truth:
<HI>viz.</HI> That either there be some men which are not
of Gods making; or else that hee hateth no man
(not <HI>Esau)</HI> as he is a man, but as a sinner, but as an
enemy or contemner of his goodnesse. And con∣sequently
to this branch or corollary of this for∣mer
truth, wee are in the same Catechisme, in the
very next place taught to beleeve in God the Son
who hath redeemed us and all mankind. And if all
mankind were redeemed by him, than all of this
kind were unfeignedly loved; none were hated by
him. And though in the same place, wee are taught
to beleeve in the holy Ghost as in the sanctifier of
all that are sanctified, yet this wee are taught with
this caveat, that he doth sanctifie al the elect people
of God, not all mankind. All then are not sancti∣fied
by God the holy Ghost, which are redeemed
by God the Sonne, nor doth God the Father be∣stow
all his spirituall blessings upon all whom hee
doth unfeignedly love, or on whom hee hath be∣stowed
the blessing of Baptisme as the seale or
pledge of their redemption. All these inferences
are so cleere, that the consideration of them makes
us doubt, whether such amongst us, as teach the
contrary to any of these, have at any time subscri∣bed
unto the booke of Common prayers, or whe∣ther
they had read it before they did subscribe un∣to
<PB N="172" REF="93"/>
it or contradict it. That this universall extent of
Gods love, and of the redemption wrought by
Christ, is a fundamentall principle, whereon many
serious and fruitfull exhortations in the booke of
Homilies are immediately grounded, shall (by
Gods assistance) appeare in the Article concerning
<HI>Christ.</HI> For a concludent proofe that God doth
unfeignedly will, not <HI>genera singulorum,</HI> all sorts of
men onely; but <HI>singula generum,</HI> every one of all
sorts to be saved; take it briefely thus: All they
which are saved, and all they which are not saved,
make up both parts of the former distinction or di∣vision
to the full. But God will have all to bee
saved which are saved; he likewise willeth the salva∣tion
of all such, as are not saved, that is, of such as
dye: therefore he willeth the salvation of every one
of all sorts. That God doth will the salvation of all
that are saved, no man ever questioned; that God
did will not the life, but death of such as dyed, the
Iewes (Gods owne people) did sometimes more
then question: and to prevent the like querulous
murmurings of misbeliefe in others, he once for all
interposed his solemne oath; <HI>As I live saith the
Lord, I will not the death of him that dyeth, but ra∣ther
that he should repent and live.</HI> None then can
be saved whom God would not have saved; many
are not saved, whom God would have saved.</P>
<P>4 But how, or by what Will doth he will that
they should be saved that are not saved? Doth he
will their salvatiō by his revealed, not by his secret
will? Doth he give signification onely of his good
will towards them, whereas his good will and plea∣sure,
<PB N="173" REF="93"/>
is not finally to doe them any reall good? This
I take to be the meaning of <HI>voluntas signi,</HI> and <HI>be∣neplaciti.</HI>
But, it being granted, that God doth will
the salvation of all men, by his revealed will, or <HI>vo∣luntate
signi;</HI> This alone will sufficiently inferre our
intended conclusion [That he truly wils the salvati∣on
of all, without the exemption of any.] Vpon
such as contradict this doctrine, it lyes upon them
to prove not the negative onely, that God doth not
will the salvation of all by his secret will; but this
positive particular, that God doth nill or unwill the
salvation of some by his secret will, whose salvati∣on
he willeth by his revealed will. Now if it be an∣swered,
that he doth by his secret will or good plea∣sure,
unwill or nill the salvation of the same parties
to whom he willeth salvation by his will revealed
or signified; they must (without remedy) acknow∣ledge
the one or the other member of this division:
as, either [that there be two wils in God of as dif∣ferent
inclinations <HI>ad extra,</HI> as the reasonable and
sensitive appetite are in man:] or [that there is a
manifest contradiction in the object of one and the
same Divine Will.] That, <HI>All men should be saved,</HI>
and <HI>that some men should not be saved,</HI> implyeth as
formall a contradiction, as to say, [All men are li∣ving
creatures, some men are no living creatures.]
Now that all men should bee living creatures, and
that some men should not be living creatures, falls
not within the object of Omnipotency. And if the
will of God, be at truly undivided in it selfe, as the
omnipotent power is: it is no lesse impossible that
the salvation of all, and the non-salvation of some
<PB N="174" REF="94"/>
should be the object, or true parts of the object of
one and the same divine will undivided in it selfe,
than that the actuall salvation of all, and the actuall
and finall condemnation of some, or the non-salva∣tion
of all, should be really effected by the omnipo∣tent
power. Whether this divine will be clearly re∣vealed,
or in part revealed, and in part reserved or
secret in respect of us, all is one; so this will in it
selfe and in its nature, bee but one, and undivided.
The manifestation or reservation of it, or whatso∣ever
other references it may have to us, can neither
increase nor abate the former contradiction in the
object. Or if <HI>voluntas signi,</HI> bee not essentially the
same with <HI>voluntas beneplaciti,</HI> there is a manifest
contradiction or contrariety betwixt them: If the
salvation of all bee the object of the one, and the
non-salvation or reprobation of others, be the ob∣ject
of the other.</P>
<P>5 Yet doe we not (like rigorous Critiques) so
much intend the utter banishment of this distincti∣on
out of the confines of Divinity, as the confine∣ment
of it to its proper seat and place. Rightly con∣fined
or limited, it may beare faith and allegiance to
the truth, and open some passages for clearing some
branches of it: But permitted to use that extent of
liberty which hath beene given to it by some, it wil
make way for canonization <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>esuiticall perjuries,
for deification of mentall evasions or reservations.
Let us compare Iesuiticall practices with that <HI>pat∣terne,</HI>
which is the necessary resultance of some
mens interpretation of Gods oath in this case.
Were this interrogatory put to any Iesuiticall As∣sassinat,
<PB N="175" REF="94"/>
imagine a powder-plotter; <HI>[Doe you will
or intend the ruine of the King or State, or doe you
know of any such project or intendment?]</HI> there is
none of this crue so mischievously minded, but
would be ready to sweare unto this negative [As
the Lord liveth, and as I hope for life and salvation
by him, I neither intend the ruine of King or State,
nor doe I know of any conspiracy against him.]
And yet in case the event should evidently disco∣ver
his protestation to be most false; yet would he
rest perswaded, that this or the like mentall evasion
or reservation <HI>[I neither intended the ruine of King
or State, so they would become Romane Catholiques;
nor did I know of any conspiracy against them, with
minde or purpose to reveale it unto them,]</HI> may be a
preservative more than sufficient, a soveraigne An∣tidote
against the sinne of perjury, which hee had
swallowed or harboured in his brest; specially if
the concealement of his treason, make for the good
of the Church. To put the like interrogatory un∣to
the Almighty Iudge, concerning the ruine or
welfare of men, no Magistrate, no authority of
earth hath any power. Yet <HI>hee,</HI> to free himselfe
from that foule aspersion, which the Iewes had cast
upon him (as if such as perished in their sinnes, had
therefore perished, because it was his will and plea∣sure
they should not live but dye,) hath interposed
his often mentioned voluntary oath; <HI>As I live, I
will not the death of him that dyes, but rather that he
should live.</HI> Shall it here bee enough to make an∣swer
for him, <HI>interpretando,</HI> by interpreting his
meaning to be this? I doe not will the death of
<PB N="176" REF="95"/>
him that dyes, so he will repent, which I know he
cannot doe: nor doe I will his non-repentance,
with purpose to make this part of my will knowne
to him; however, according to my secret and reser∣ved
will, I have resolved never to grant him the
meanes, without which he cannot possibly repent;
whereas without repentance hee cannot live but
must dye. But, did Gods oath give men no better
assurance than this interpretation of it doth, I see
no reason (yet heartily wish, that others might see
more) why any man should so much blame the
Iesuites, for secret evasions or mentall reservations
in matter of oath. For the performance of our
oaths in the best manner that wee are capable of,
is but an observance of a particular branch of that
generall precept, <HI>Be ye perfect as your heavenly Fa∣ther
is perfect.</HI> Who then can justly challenge the
Iesuite of imperfection or falshood, much lesse of
perjury, for secret evasions or mentall reservations,
when his life is called in question; if once it bee
granted, that the God of truth, in matter of oath
concerning the eternall life or death of more men
than the Iesuites have to deale with, doth use
the like?</P>
<P>6 In matters then determined by Divine Oath,
the distinction of <HI>voluntas signi</HI> and <HI>beneplaciti,</HI> can
have no place; specially in their doctrine who make
the bare <HI>entity</HI> or personall <HI>being</HI> of men, the im∣mediate
object of the immutable decree concern∣ing
life and death everlasting. For the <HI>entity</HI> or
personall <HI>being</HI> of man, is so indivisible, that an uni∣versall
negation, and a particular affirmation of the
<PB N="177" REF="95"/>
same thing, [to wit, Salvation] falling upon man,
as man, or upon the personall being of men, drawes
to the strictest point of contradiction. Farre ever
be it from us to thinke, that God should sweare un∣to
this universall negative, <Q><HI>I will not the death of
the man that dyeth;</HI> and yet beleeve withall, that
he wils the death of some men that dye, as they
are men, or as they are the sonnes of <HI>Adam:</HI> that
hee should by his secret or reserved will, recall
any part of his will declared by oath; that hee
should proclaime an universall pardon to all the
sonnes of <HI>Adam</HI> under the seale of his oath, and
yet exempt many from all possibility of receiving
any benefit by it.</Q></P>
<P>7 Shall we then conclude that the former di∣stinction
hath no use at all in Divinity? Or if this
conclusion be too rigorous, let us see in what cases
it may have place, or to what particulars it may bee
confined. First, it hath place in matters of threat∣ning,
or of plagues not denounced by oath. Thus
God, by his Prophet <HI>Ionas,</HI> did signifie his will to
have <HI>Nineveh</HI> destroyed at forty dayes end; this
was <HI>voluntas signi;</HI> and he truly intended what hee
signified: yet was it his <HI>voluntas beneplaciti,</HI> his
good will and pleasure at the very same time, that
the Ninevites should repent and live. And by their
repentance, his good will and pleasure was fulfilled
in their safety. But in this case there was no con∣trariety
betweene Gods will declared or signified
.i. <HI>[voluntas signi]</HI> and his good will and pleasure,
.i. <HI>[voluntas beneplaciti];</HI> no contradiction in the
object of his will however considered, for that was
<PB N="178" REF="96"/>
not one and the same, but much different, in respect
of Gods will signified by <HI>Ionas;</HI> and of his good
will and pleasure, which, not signified by him, was
fulfilled. One and the same immutable will or de∣cree
of God did from eternity award two doomes,
much different, unto <HI>Ninevch;</HI> taking it as it stood
affected when <HI>Ionas</HI> threatned destruction unto it,
or as it should continue so affected; and taking it
as it proved, upon the judgement threatned. All the
alteration was in <HI>Nineveh,</HI> none in Gods will or <HI>de∣cree:</HI>
and <HI>Nineveh</HI> being altered to the <HI>better,</HI> the
selfe same rule of Iustice, doth not deale with it af∣ter
the selfe same manner. The doome or sentence
could not bee the same without some alteration in
the Iudge, who is unalterable. And in that hee is
unalterably Iust and Good, his doome or award,
was of necessity to alter, as the object of it altered.
<HI>Deus saepe mutat sententiam, nunquam consilium.</HI>
Gods unchangeable will or counsell doth often
change his doome or sentence. The same rule holds
thus farre true in matter of blessing or promise not
confirmed by oath: upon the parties alteration un∣to
worse, unto whom the promise is made, the
blessing promised may be revoked, without any al∣teration
of Gods will or counsell. Yet may we not
say, that the death or destruction of any to whom
God promiseth life, is so truely the object of his
good will and pleasure, as the life and salvation of
them is, unto whom he threatneth destruction. The
same distinctiō is of good use in some extraordina∣rie
cases, or as applyed to men after they have
made up the full measure of their iniquity, and are
<PB N="179" REF="96"/>
cut off from all possibility of repentance. Thus God
willed <HI>Pharaoh</HI> to let his people goe out of Egypt,
and signified this his will unto him by <HI>Moses</HI> and
<HI>Aaron,</HI> in mighty signes and wonders. This was
<HI>voluntas signi,</HI> onely, not <HI>voluntas beneplaciti.</HI> For
though it were his good will and pleasure, that his
people should depart out of Egypt; yet was it no
branch of this his good will and pleasure, that <HI>Pha∣raoh</HI>
should now repent or bee willing to let them
goe. Rather it was his good will and pleasure (spe∣cially
after the seventh plague) to have the heart of
<HI>Pharaoh</HI> hardned. And yet after his heart was so
hardned, that it could not repent, God so punished
him, as if it had beene free and possible for him to
repent, and grant a friendly passe unto his people.
But <HI>Pharaohs</HI> case was extraordinary; his punish∣ment
so exemplary, as not to be drawne into ex∣ample.
For as our Apostle intimates, it was an ar∣gument
of Gods great mercy and long suffering, to
permit <HI>Pharaoh</HI> to live any longer on earth, after he
was become a vessell of wrath destinated to ever∣lasting
punishment in hell. The reason why God
thus plagued <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> for not doing that which
now he could not doe (all possibility of amendment
being taken from him) was to teach all generations
following, by his fearefull end, to beware of his
desperate beginnings, of struggling with God, or
of persecuting them, whose patronage hee had in
peculiar manner undertaken. And here again, there
is no contradiction betweene these two propositi∣on
<HI>[God from all eternity did will the death of Pha∣raoh;
God from all eternity did not will the death, but
<PB N="180" REF="97"/>
rather the life of Pharaoh.</HI> For albeit <HI>Pharaoh</HI> con∣tinued
one and the same man, from his birth unto
his death, yet did he not all this time continue one
and the same object of Gods immutable will and
eternall decree. This object did alter as <HI>Pharaohs</HI>
dispositions or affections towards God or his
neighbours altered. There is no contrariety, much
lesse any contradiction, betweene these [God un∣faignedly
loveth all men; God doth not love, but
hate the Reprobate, although they be men, yea the
greatest part of men.] For here the object of his
love and hate is not the same; he loves all men un∣faignedly
as they are men, or as men which have
not made up the full measure of iniquity: but ha∣ving
made up that, or having their soules betroa∣thed
unto wickednesse, he hates them. His hate of
them as Reprobates; is no lesse necessary or usuall,
than his love of them as men. But though he neces∣sarily
bates them being once become Reprobates,
or having made up the full measure of iniquity: yet
was there no necessity layd upon them by his eter∣nall
decree, to make up such a measure of iniquity.</P>
<P>8 How these deductions will consort with some
moderne Catechismes I doe not know: sure I am
they are consonant to the opinion of that learned
Bishop and blessed Martyr in his Preface to his ex∣positions
of the ten Commandements; a fit Cate∣chisme
for a Bishop to make. Every man is called
in the Scripture, wicked, and the enemy of God;
for the privation and lacke of faith and love, that he
oweth to God. <HI>Et impii vocantur, qui non omnino
sunt pii;</HI> that is, They are called wicked that in all
<PB N="181" REF="97"/>
things honour not God, beleeve not in God, and
observe not his Commandements as they should
doe; which we cannot do by reason of this natu∣rall
infirmity, or hatred of the flesh, as <HI>Paul</HI> calleth
it, against God. In this sense taketh <HI>Paul</HI> this word,
wicked. So must we interpret St. <HI>Paul</HI> and take his
words; or else no man should be damned. Now we
know that <HI>Paul</HI> himselfe, St. <HI>Iohn,</HI> and Christ dam∣neth
the contemners of God, or such as willingly
continue in sinne, and will not repent. Those the
Scripture excludeth from the generall promise of
grace. Thou seest by the places afore rehearsed,
that though wee cannot beleeve in God as un∣doubtedly
as is required, by reason of this our natu∣rall
sicknesse and disease, yet for Christs sake in the
judgement of God wee are accounted as faithfull
beleevers, for whose sake this naturall disease and
sicknesse is pardoned, by what name soever S. <HI>Paul</HI>
calleth the naturall infirmity, or originall sinne in
man. And this imperfection or naturall sicknesse
taken of <HI>Adam,</HI> excludeth not the person from the
promise of God in Christ, except wee transgresse
the limits and bounds of this originall sinne by our
owne folly and malice; and either of a contempt
or hate of Gods word, we fall into sinne, and trans∣forme
our selves into the image of the devill. Then
wee exclude by this meanes our selves from the
promises and merits of Christ, who only received
our infirmities, and originall disease, and not the
contempt of him, and his Law.</P>

extend it not so farre, is our pronenesse to extend
our owne power to the utmost, and, for the most
part farther then justice or true goodnesse can ac∣company
it. It is our nature to be humorous, and
the nature of humor to be unconstant. <HI>Fortunes
character</HI> may be every sonne of <HI>Adams</HI> Motto:
<HI>Tantum constans in levitate, Onely constant in un∣constancy.</HI>
And being such, nothing can imply any
constant contradiction to our nature; nothing that
is truly and constantly the same, but will one time
or other contradict our changeable and inconstant
humors. And these enraged with contradiction,
doe, (Tyrant-like) arme power, without just tryall
or examination, without either respect or reve∣rence,
against whatsoever contradicts them. The
right use of power in creatures meerely sensitive, is
to satiate their appetites of sense: for nothing
hath power to move it selfe, but what is sensitive:
and, all power, whether of body or minde, was be∣stowed
on man for the execution of his will, or ac∣complishing
his desire of good: but, since his will,
by his fall, became irregular, and his desires cor∣rupt;
his power is become like a common officer,
or undercommander to all his unruly appetites, do∣mineering
by turne or succession; all other incli∣nations
being under the command of it. So the
wise man hath charactered the resolution of volup∣tuous
men, <HI>cap. 1. 6. Come on therefore, let us enjoy
the good things that are present, and let us speedily use
the creatures like as in youth.</HI> And <HI>ver. 11. Let our
strength be the Law of justice; for that which is feeble
is found to be nothing worth.</HI> Even in such as are by
<PB N="184" REF="99"/>
most esteemed good men and sober, those notions
of truth and equity which are naturall and implan∣ted,
are so weake and ill taken; that, rather than up∣start
carnall appetites or desires which custome
countenanceth, should be enraged through their
reluctance, they presently yeeld their consents to
such proposalls, as (were they resolute, firme and
constant) would as offensively contradict them, as
punishment or paine doth our sense of pleasure.
Vnto such proposalls we often yeeld, as are impos∣sible
to be approved by <HI>Equity;</HI> to whom we usu∣ally
professe our dearest love and allegiance, with
promises to frame our lives by her rules. But love
in us (whether one simple and indivisible quality,
or an aggregation or cluster of divers inclinations,
all rooted in one Center,) is not alike set on divers
objects. Hence, when it comes to opposition be∣tweene
sense and reason, betweene our selves, our
private friends, and common equity, it divides it
selfe unequally. The particular inconveniences
whereto we are daily exposed, by the inordinate
love of the world, and the flesh, are infinite; all may
be reduced to these two originalls: First, it blindes
our judgements, and makes our intentions seeme
upright and just to our partiall desires, or at least
not incompatible with the rules of equity; when
as, to impartiall judgements, they are palpably un∣just.
Secondly, having blinded our judgements,
it forthwith abuseth our power or authority; to
effect whatsoever is not, for the present, apprehen∣ded
for a grosse and evident wrong. So that no∣thing
whereon our love or liking is for the present
<PB N="185" REF="99"/>
mainly set, seemes any way impossible unto us; un∣lesse
it bee altogether without the compasse of our
power: And, through the variousnesse of our hu∣merous
disposition, <HI>that,</HI> which we cannot like or
admit to day, will be allowed of to morrow. But
though there bee none that doth good, no not one,
yet some there be doe lesse evill than others. And
seeing those amongst us, whose love to equity is
more strong and constant than their neighbours,
are alwayes drawne with greater difficulty to dis∣pense
with truth or approve unjustice; the conse∣quence
necessarily amounting from this experi∣mented
 truth, is, That <Q>[if any mans judgement
in matters of equity and justice were infallible,
and <HI>his love</HI> to justice and knowne equity alto∣gether
constant and invincible, it would bee im∣possible
for him to transgresse in judgement.]</Q>
Thus as well the strength of unconstant humorous
desires, as the faintnesse of love or equity (both
which most men may experience in themselves) as
the contrary vertues, which they may observe in
some few joyntly conspire to rectifie our conceit
of God, in whom the Ideall perfection, of the ones
integrity and constancy, is without all mixture of
the others vice or humorous impotency.</P>
<P>2 The first rule for right extending the former
Maxime [To make both parts of a contradiction
true, is no part of the object of power omnipotent]
would be this; Many effects which are very possible
to power alone considered, or as it hath the maste∣ry
over weake inclinations unto equity, necessarily
imply a direct and manifest contradiction unto
<PB N="186" REF="100"/>
some Divine Attributes, no lesse infinite or immu∣table
than Almighty power. Hence it followes,
that many effects or designes, which seeme <HI>possible</HI>
to the humane nature, may bee impossible or most
incongruous to the Divine. It is more shamefull
then impossible for rich men to lye &amp; cozen, or for
Magistrates to oppresse and wrong their inferiors;
albeit the ones riches or others power, were infi∣nitely
increased, without internall increase of their
fidelity. But to him that is eternally true and just,
yea eternall <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>justice,</HI> it is as impossible to
speak an untruth, or doe wrong, as for truth to be a
lye, or <HI>justice</HI> to be <HI>unjust.</HI> Many things then are po∣ssible
to meere power, which are impossible to it, as
linkt with truth or love; and many things againe
possible to it, as linkt with these, which yet directly
contradict the eternall patterne of justice or good∣nesse;
and are by consequent impossible to the Al∣mighty,
who is no lesse just and good, then power∣full.
Many Pyrats by Sea, or Robbers by Land,
might they injoy but halfe the power &amp; authority
for a Month, whereof ordinary Princes by inheri∣tance
are possest; would doe their companions and
friends more good, and worke their enemies grea∣ter
spoyle in this short space, than any Monarch can
doe in his whole raigne, which holds it a point of
Majestie to moderate his actions by that Princely
rule; <HI>Princeps id potest quod jure potest, Princes can do
no more than they can doe justly.</HI> In this sense, I think
we may truly say, all before Christ were theeves &amp;
robbers, or in respect of him very unjust; not <HI>Abra∣ham,
David, Ezekiah, Iosias,</HI> not one of the Pro∣phets,
<PB N="187" REF="100"/>
might they have but halfe that power and au∣thority
cōmitted to them over Angels for a night,
which the Son of God from everlasting had, with∣out
robbery; but would have thought it very possi∣ble
to have removed the Romane Army with as
great terror, losse and disgrace, as the Angell of the
Lord sometimes had done the <HI>Assyrians,</HI> from <HI>Ieru∣salems</HI>-siege;
whose fatall destruction, God incar∣nate
cleerly foreseeing, bewailed with teares, but
would not, but could not prevent. For to the King
of everlasting righteousnesse, that onely was possi∣ble,
which was justly possible. And though he were
a Father to <HI>Israel,</HI> and the Prince of peace, yet he
approves a most bloody and mercilesse warre, be∣fore
an unjust peace, and disgracefull to Eternall
Majestie; for so the Prophet had said in his name,
before, <HI>There is no peace unto the wicked;</HI> to such as
stubbornely abandon the wayes of peace, and wil∣fully
neglect saving health, so often and lovingly
tendred unto them; <HI>Hos salus ipsa servare non potuit,</HI>
and shall infinite power save them, whom infinite
salvation cannot save?</P>
<P>3 To have smitten the men of <HI>Sodom</HI> with blind∣nesse,
before lust had entred in at their eyes; had
beene a worke as easie to Almighty power, as
blinding them in the attempt or prosecution of lust
conceived. But that contradiction which the pre∣vention
of this sinne, did not imply unto Gods
power, it did (all circumstances considered) neces∣sarily
imply unto his Iustice; by whose immutable
and eternall rules, they were left unguarded against
these foule temptions, for wilfull contempt of
<PB N="188" REF="101"/>
his goodnesse, for abusing his long suffering and
loving kindnesse. But did it imply any contradictiō
to his goodnesse or loving kindnesse, to have pre∣vented
the <HI>Sodomites</HI> former contempt or abuse of
them? Out of question it did, unto his eternall e∣quity;
<HI>for all his waies are mercy and truth.</HI> And
these <HI>Sodomites</HI> wilfulnesse presupposed, the eter∣nall
rule of his goodnesse and loving kindnesse, had
appointed justice to debarre them, as now they
are, from reaping those fruits, whereof his good∣nesse,
as they were men, had made them capable.
The principle whence the just proofe of these
seeming paradoxes, as also the right explication of
all difficulties in this argument, must be derived, is
a Schoole Maxime borrowed from orthodoxall
antiquity, now not much used, but of much use in
true Divinity, and for this reason to bee more fully
insisted upon, in the <HI>Treatise of mans first estate.</HI> The
Maxime it self is briefly thus; <HI>It is impossible for mā
or other created substance, to be absolutely impeccable
from his creation.</HI> Onely <HI>He</HI> that is infinite in be∣ing,
is infinitely good; and infinite goodnesse onely
implyes an absolute impossibility of being bad. As
God onely essentially <HI>is,</HI> so hee onely is essentially
and immutably good; all things besides him are
or sometimes were subject to mutability, aswell in
<HI>Essence</HI> as in their state and condition. Power om∣nipotent
could not from the first Creation, have
pared off all mutabilitie from mans morall good∣nesse,
without <HI>perishing</HI> the onely possible root of
his eternall and immutable happinesse. To decline
to evill, implyes no contradiction to <HI>Being simply,</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="101"/>
but onely to <HI>omnipotent being:</HI> it is so possible to all
Creatures, that without this possibility, it were (as
we shall afterwards prove) impossible for them to
be truly like their Creator, for a moment in that
attribute, whose participation is the only assurance
of their eternall weale. If God either by his om∣nipotent
power, or infinite wisedome, had necessa∣rily
(though without any violence) restrained this
possibility in man, of declining from good to evill,
man had forthwith ceased to have beene truly and
inherently good, and ceasing to be such, had utter∣ly
lost all possibilities of that estate, whose pledge
or earnest he received in his creation. Gods good∣nesse
is his happinesse. And his participative good∣nesse
is the foundation of mans happinesse. So that
not Gods justice onely, but that loving kindnesse
whereby hee created man, and appointed him as
heyre apparent of life eternall, did remove all neces∣sity
from his will, because the imposition of neces∣sity
(whether laid upon him by power or wisdome
infinite) had utterly extinguished that goodnesse
wherein it was onely possible for the creature to
expresse the Creators goodnesse manifested in his
creation. Now that was not Gods essentiall or im∣mutable
goodnesse, for that is incommunicable.
All the goodnesse man is capable of, doth but ex∣presse
Gods goodnesse communicative. It is the
stampe of it communicated. As God then did com∣municate
his goodnesse to his creatures, not by ne∣cessity
but freely, so could not the creature be truly
good (that is like his God) by necessity but freely.
Nor was it possible for him to have beene either
<PB N="190" REF="102"/>
confirmed in such goodnesse as he had, or transla∣ted
to everlasting happinesse; but by continuing
freely good for some space, or lesse evill, than by
the liberty which God by his immutable law had
given him in his creation, hee possibly might have
beene. Continuing good, though but for a while,
without necessity, the riches of Gods free bounty,
had beene continually increased towards him, and
had finally established him in everlasting blisse by
confirmation of him in true goodnesse, or by inve∣sting
him with immortality. Since his fall wee are
not usually capable of mercy or of the increase of
his bounty; much lesse of these everlasting fruits
whereof blessings temporall are the pledges; but
by free abstinence from some evills, unto whose
practices, the possibility of our corrupted nature
might be improved. And albeit we doe not alway
that which is in its nature evill, yet we can doe no∣thing
well, but even the good which we do we doe
it naughtily: yet unlesse we doe both lesse evill, and
the good which we do lesse naughtily than we pos∣sibly
might doe, God still diminisheth the riches
of his bounty towards us; and by inhibiting the
sweet influence of his gracious providence, suffers
us to fall from one wickednesse to another, be∣ing
prone to runne headlong into all, if once
the <HI>reines</HI> of our unruly appetites, bee given
into our unweildie hands. Farre bee it from
any sonne of <HI>Adam</HI> to thinke hee is able with∣out
Gods love and favour to withdraw himselfe
from the extremities of mischiefe, much lesse to
doe such good as may make him capable of well-doing.
<PB N="191" REF="102"/>
So strong is our love to sinfull pleasures,
since our first parents gave the reines unto our ap∣petite,
that none can recall themselves or repent,
without the attractions of infinite love. And yet
many whom this infinite love doth daily imbrace,
because they apprehend not it, are never brought
by the attractions of it to true repentance. <HI>Despisest
thou the riches of his goodnesse,</HI> saith the Apostle,
<HI>Rom. 2. 4. his forbearance and long suffering, not
knowing that the goodnesse of God leadeth thee to re∣pentance?</HI>
Of whom speakes he thus? of such one∣ly
as truly repent, and by patient continuance in
wel-doing, seeke for glory, honour, and immorta∣lity?
nay, but, of them who for <HI>hardnesse of heart,
cannot repent; but treasure up wrath against the
day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judg∣ment
of God.</HI></P>
<P>4 Were the riches of his bounty therefore fai∣ned,
or did hee onely profer, but not purpose to
draw them unto repentance, which repented not?
this is no part of our heavenly Fathers <HI>perfection,</HI> no
fruit of that wisedome which is from above, but a
point of earthly policy devoid of honesty; a meere
tricke of wordly wit, to whose practice nothing
but weaknesse and impotence to accomplish great
desires, can mis-incline mans corrupted nature. But
doth it not argue the like impotency, though no
such want of integrity in God, not to effect what he
wils more ardently and more unfainedly, than man
can doe the increase or continuance of his welfare,
or avoidance of endlesse misery? No; it being sup∣posed
(as we have said) that man is not capable of
<PB N="192" REF="103"/>
endlesse joyes, unlesse he will be wrought by meere
love, without the impulsions of unresistible power,
unfaignedly to love him that hath prepared them
for him; the same infinite love which continually
drawes him unto repentance, was in congruity to
leave him a possibility not to be drawne by it. For
coactive penitency, would have frustrated the end
to which repentance is but a meane subordinate.
The imployment or exercise of Gods almighty po∣wer
to make men repent against their wils, or be∣fore
they were wrought to a willingnesse by the
sweet attractions of his infinite love, or by threat∣nings
of judgements not infinite or irresistible,
would be like the indeavors of a loving Father,
more strong than circumspect, who out of pity to
his sonne, whom he sees ready to be choked with
water, should strangle him by violent haling him
to the shore. Most men by ascribing that unto
Gods power which is the peculiar and essentiall
effect of his love, doe finally misse of that <HI>good,</HI>
which both infallibly conspire to poure, without
measure, upon all such as take right and orderly
hold of them. How shall wee then fasten our faith
to them aright? we are to beleeve, that Gods infi∣nite
power shall effect without controule or checke
of any thing in heaven or earth, all things possible
for their endlesse good, that truly love him; but
constraines no mans will to love him, being alwaies
armed against wilfull neglectors of his unfaigned
love. No man would argue his love to be lesse than
infinite, because not able to produce the effects of
infinite power: and as little reason wee have to
<PB N="193" REF="103"/>
thinke, that power, though infinite, should bee the
true immediate parent of love, which never springs
in any reasonable creature, but from the seedes of
love or lovelines sown in the humane soule, though
they doe not alwayes prosper. Constraint, because
it is the proper and immediate effect of power, is a
companion fit for lust; whose satisfaction breedes
rather a loathing of the parties constrained, than
any good wil or purpose to reward them for being
unwilling, unloving, or impatient passives; nothing
but true unforced love, can yeeld contentment un∣to
love. Needy man, to whom benevolences
though wrested are ever gratefull, cannot bee indu∣ced
to love the parties from whom they are wre∣sted.
For, <HI>Non tantum ingratum sed invisum est be∣neficium
superbè datum: Good offices whilest they are
presented by pride, are not onely ungratefull but odi∣ous.</HI>
But God who giveth to all men liberally, and
upbraideth no man; as he esteemes no gifts (how∣soever
given) so he alwayes detests the niggardly
backwardnesse, and loves the cheerfulnesse of the
giver.</P>
<P>5 From these discussions the truth of the former
rule, with the right solution of the maine probleme
proposed, may bee illustrated, by examples of di∣vers
kinds in subjects knowne and familiar. Be the
charge never so great, so the exonerations be well
nigh equal, the incoms are lesse than if their charge
were little, and their exonerations none. Or, be a
mans revenues never so large, so his necessary ex∣pences
be no lesse, hee shall not bee able to doe as
much for his friend in some reall kindnesse, as hee
<PB N="194" REF="104"/>
whose estate is not halfe so great, if so his annuall
expences be tenne times lesse. In like case, though
mans love to his dearest friend, be (in respect of
Gods love to us) but faint, and his power but small;
yet because his love to justice is much lesse, or ra∣ther
his partiality greater, hee oft-times effects that
for his temporall good, which God though infi∣nite
in power, doth not effect for those whom hee
infinitely loves. For the bequests or grants made
unto man by his infinite love, must undergoe the
examination of <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>equitie.</HI> What are alike
infinite, before they passe the irrevocable seale of
infinite power, one of these cannot attempt, much
lesse absolutely bring ought to passe, without the
others consent. Infinite love cannot oversway, ei∣ther
Gods incomprehensible wisedome to devise,
or his omnipotency to practise meanes for mans
salvation, which contradict the unchangeable rules
of infinite equity. His love is as truly indivisible, as
infinite; and is for this reason more indissolubly
linkt unto the unchangeable rules of his owne
justice or equity, than unto mankinde, whose good∣nesse
in his best estate, was but mutable; nor are any
of <HI>Adams</HI> posterity so capable of that infinite mer∣cie,
wherewith God embraceth them, as Gods
Iustice and Majestie are of his infinite Love. These
being as He is absolutely immutable, are through∣out
eternity immutably loved of him, who indivi∣sibly
is <HI>Majestie, Iustice, Love, immutable.</HI></P>

the eternall rules of Gods infinite justice or equity:
and from these different motions or distractions,
thus occasioned from that indissoluble uniō of his
divisible soule, with these two different attributes
of the indivisible nature, were his teares squeezed
out. He wept then as man, not as God; and yet in
this humane passion, did visibly act that part which
God before his incarnation had penned, as a sen∣sible
memoriall of his unconceivable love. <HI>O that
my people had hearkned unto me: and Israel had wal∣ked
in my wayes; I should soone have subdued their
enemies, and turned my hand against their adversa∣ries.
The haters of the Lord should have submitted
themselves unto him but their time should have endu∣red

have satisfied thee. Psalm. 81. vers. 13, 14, 15, 16.
Wheat</HI> and <HI>Honey,</HI> here promised, were Emblemes
of better blessings purposed towards them. And
thus avouching this his purpose, under no chara∣cter

said, as <HI>Ierusalem</HI> afterwards did of her sorrow;
<HI>Was there ever any love like unto this love wherewith
the Lord imbraced mee in the dayes of my youth.</HI>
Notwithstanding this excessive fervency of <HI>His</HI>
loving kindnesse (whose will is infinite) laid no
necessity upon their wils to whom hee wished all
this good. They had a liberty left them by eter∣nall
equity, to refuse it. Hee out of the wishes of

out his best blessings according to the immensity
of his loving kindnesse, so <HI>Israel</HI> would open his
mouth wide to receive them. <HI>But my people</HI> (saith

<P>2 Lord, who had sinned, the heathen people or

a sacred truth received by all good Christians, <HI>viz.
[Al such as have heard Gods love in Christ proclaimed
and not beleeved in it, shall in the day of Iudgement
appeare guilty of greater sinnes, than their forefathers
could be endited of; and undergoe more bitter death,
than any corruption drawne from</HI> Adam, <HI>if Christ

wrong the Apostle in unfolding his exhortations to

spirit by which hee spake, some kinde of violence,
that would contract his meaning shorter. <HI>The times
of this ignorance</HI> (before Christs death) <HI>God winked
at, but now commandeth all men every where to re∣pent;
Because hee hath appointed a day, in the which
he will judge the world in righteousnesse, by that man
whom hee hath ordained, whereof he hath given assu∣rance

for their free and voluntary progresse from evill to

daily profered to them in such pledges, as they
were well content to swallow; foolishly esteeming
these good in themselves, being good onely as
they plight the truth of Gods love to them, which
he manifested in the death of his Sonne. With

Who would not be willing to be saved, if hee were
fully perswaded, that God did will his salvation in
particular; because hee protests hee wills not the
death of any, but the repentance of all, that all
might live? Or were the particulars of this doc∣trine,
unto whose generality, every loyall member
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> hath subscribed, general∣ly
taught &amp; beleeved; all would unfeignedly endea∣vour
with fervent alacrity to be truely happy, be∣cause
none could suspect himselfe to bee excluded
from his unfeigned and fervent love, who is true
happinesse. Whose love and goodnesse is so great,
that hee cannot passe any act, whereby any of his
creatures should bee debarred either from being
like him in love and goodnesse; or being such, from
being like him in true happinesse: But alas, while
the world is borne in hand, that the Creator oft-times
dispenseth the blessings of this life, not as un∣doubted
pledges of a better, but deales with most
men, as man doth with beasts, feeding them
fattest which are appointed first to bee slaine:
the magnificent praises of his bounty secretly

goodnesse; (at least towards them) as the Epigram∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tist
had of a professed Benefactor, that shewed
him (as he thought) little kindnesse in great Bene∣volence.</P>

<L>And by the fish to be belov'd,</L>

<P>2 The frequency of sinister respects in dispen∣sing
of secular dignities or benevolences, makes
such as are truly kind, to be either unregarded, or
mistrusted by such as stand in neede of their kind∣nesse.
And as fishes in beaten waters, will nibble
at the bait, although they suspect the hooke: so
the world hath learned the wit to take good
turnes, and not to be taken by them; as suspecting
them to bee profered in cunning rather than in
true kindnesse: and cunning, where it is discovered
or suspected, is usually requited with craft; love
onely hath just title unto love. The most part in∣deed
are so worldly wise, that none but fooles will
easily trust them; howbeit our naturall mistrust of
others, makes all of us a great deale worse than we
would be. And as if we thought it a sinne or point
of uncharitablenesse, to prove other mens conjec∣tures,
that measure our dispositions by their owne,
altogether false; wee fit our demeanours to their
misdeemings of us, and resolve rather to do amisse;
than they should thinke amisse. Howbeit even in
<PB N="203" REF="108"/>
this perfidious and faithlesse age, the old saying is,
not quite out of date: <HI>Ipsa fides habita obligat fidē.</HI>
Many would be more trusty than they are; and do
much better by us than they doe, would we whol∣ly
commit our selves to their trust and kindnesse.
Now, though by mans goodnesse or badness, God
can neither become worse nor better in himselfe;
yet the riches of his bounty, or communication of
his goodnesse, are still multiplyed towards those
that stedfastly beleeve him to bee such as hee is:
One, whom all are bound to love; because hee is so
kind and loving; one whom all may safely trust, be∣cause
his loving kindnesse is so utterly void of par∣tiality,
being armed with power and justice infi∣nite.
<HI>Thy righteousnesse is like the great mountaines,
thy judgements are like the great deepe; O Lord
thou preservest man and beast. How excellent is thy
louing kindnesse, O God! therefore the children of
men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
Psal. 36. ver. 6, 7.</HI> This especially should move
all to admire his loving kindnesse, that he loved all
without any other motive than his owne meere
goodnesse or loving kindnesse, either to incline his
will or stirre up his power to give them a being
like his owne: <HI>We love him</HI> (saith Saint <HI>Iohn) be∣cause
he loved us first.</HI> Doe all then whom hee un∣feignedly
loves, love him vnfeignedly? Would
God they did: for so (as his will is) all should bee
saved. Did then the Apostle meane that his love
to us, is no true cause of our love to him? yes; yet
not simply as it is in him, but as being unfeignedly
in him it is truly apprehended by us. Ingenuous
<PB N="204" REF="109"/>
love is never lawfully begotten, or fully concei∣ved
but from an apprehension of true lovelinesse in
the object; and nothing can bee more lovely then
love it selfe, when it is firmely apprehended or un∣doubtedly
knowne.</P>
<P>3 Though secret consciousnesse of our owne un∣lovelinesse,
in the state of nature, makes us oft-times
too mistrustfull of others love: Yet unto our na∣ture
unregenerate and overgrowne with corrupti∣on,
it is almost impossible, not to love them whose
love to us we assuredly know to be unfaigned; un∣lesse
their behaviour be very loathsome. Howbeit
even so we love their persons, though not their pre∣sence,
wherewith againe we willingly dispense, if
it may gratifie us in other things, which we much
desire. That which makes the worlds condemna∣tion
so just, that infinite mercy may not dispence
with it, is mens dull backwardnesse to love him, of
whose glorious beauty, the most glorious, most
admired creatures are but fleeting shadowes, no
true pictures. Him of whose infinite love and un∣feigned
preventions in unrecompensable benefits,
all the pleasures wee take in health, the joy of
strength, the sweetnesse of life it selfe; and whatso∣ever
in it is good and lovely, are infallible pledges,
and yet his intention in free bestowing them is to
bind himselfe (more strictly than man is bound by
receiving the just price of what he bargaines for) to
instate us in the incomprehensible joyes of endlesse
life.</P>
<P>Hee requires nothing at our hand, but that wee
may be more capable of his loving kindnesse, by
<PB N="205" REF="109"/>
drawing still nearer and nearer to him, with all our
hearts, with all our soules, and with all our strength;
of whose least portion he is sole maker and preser∣ver;
of all whose motions hee is sole author and
guide. From participation of his favour or presence,
whatsoever is good in them, is undoubtedly ca∣pable
of increase. The services wherein the eter∣nall
King requires demonstration of this our love,
are not so hard, as those which wee willingly per∣forme
to corruptible men, not invested with any
shadow of his <HI>lovelinesse,</HI> nor seasoned with any
tincture of his loving kindnesse; to men, that can∣not
be so beneficiall as loving to their friends, nor
halfe so loving as they are lovely, though their
lovelinesse come farre short of their greatnesse.
Far otherwise it is with <HI>him,</HI> whose Greatnesse and
Majesty are truly infinite: hee is as glorious and
lovely as great, as loving as lovely, and yet withall
no lesse beneficiall than loving to those which love
him, and doe his will.</P>
<P>4 This unfaigned love of him, raised from be∣leefe
of his loving kindnes toward us, is as the first
conception or plantation of true happines, to which
once truly planted, whatsoever in this life can befal
us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 28.</NOTE> serves as nutriment. <HI>Diligentibus Deum omnia
operantur in bonum. Wee know that all things worke
together for good, to them that love God, to them who
are called according to his purpose.</HI></P>
<P>As this Article of his goodnesse and love is to be
prest before any other, so the first and most natu∣rall
deduction, that can be made from this or any
other sacred principle; and that which every one
<PB N="206" REF="110"/>
when hee first comes to enjoy the use of reason,
should be taught to make by heart, is this: <HI>He that
gave mee life indued with sense, and beautified my
sense with reason, before I could desire one or other of
them, or know what being meant; hath doubtlesse a
purpose to give me with them, whatsoever good things
my heart, my sense or reason can desire; even life or
being as farre surpassing all goodnesse, flesh and blood
can conceive or desire, as this present life, I now enjoy,
doth my former not being, or my desirelesse want of
being what now I am.</HI> These are principles, which
elsewhere (by Gods assistance) shall bee more at
large extended: yet would I have the Reader ever
to remēber, that the infinite love, wherewith God
sought us when we were not, by which he found
out a <HI>beginning</HI> for mankind, fitted as a foundation
for endlesse life, can never be indissolubly betroth∣ed
unto the bare <HI>beeing</HI> which hee bestowed upon
us. The finall contract betwixt him and us, neces∣sarily
presupposeth a bond or linke of mutuall love.
There is no meanes possible for us to be made bet∣ter
or happier than we are, but by unfaigned loving
him, which out of love hath made us what we are.
Nor are we what we are, because <HI>he is,</HI> or from his
<HI>Essence onely,</HI> but because he was loving to us. And
after our love to him enclasped with his unspeaka∣ble
and unchangeable love to us, whose apprehen∣sion
must beget it; the faith by which it is begot∣ten
in us, assures our soules of all the good meanes
the <HI>infinitie</HI> of goodnesse may vouchsafe to grant,
the <HI>infinity</HI> of wisedome can contrive, or power
omnipotent is able to practise; for attaining the
<PB N="207" REF="110"/>
end whereto his infinite love from all Eternities
doth ordaine us. And who could desire better en∣couragement
or assurance more strong then this,
for the recompence of all his labours? or if all
this cannot suffice to allure us, hee hath set feare be∣hind
us to impell us unto goodnesse; or rather be∣fore
us, to turne us backe from evill.</P>

had taken the like care and paines to traine up their
children in the most commendable qualities of that
age. Not one would have adventured his owne
person further, to have rescued his sonne from the
enemy, or justified him in any honourable quarrell.
In these and the like points, he had, and, upon just
occasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meroveo certe auget probitatis famam at{que} justitiae ne∣catus filius, justissimas uti{que} ob cau∣sas, ne quis ipsi dirita∣tem in alie∣nos falso exprobet li∣beros, vel in suos inau∣ditam saevi∣tiam nullis fultam rationibus: quales nec Posthumius Tiburtus, nec T.

unfained love, as any father could unto his sonne;
more than the imbecility of sex would suffer a ten∣der
hearted mother, to make proofe of. Doth then
the adjudging of this his owne son to death, rightly
argue he loved him lesse than other parents did
their children, whose worse deserts they would not
have sentenced so severely? No: it rather proves
love and care of martiall discipline, and hate to par∣tiality
in administration of civill Iustice, to have
beene much greater in him, than in other parents
of his time. The more just and equall the law hee
transgressed was, or might have beene (as for illu∣stration
<PB N="209" REF="111"/>
sake we will suppose it to have been a law
most equall and just) the more it commends his im∣partiall
severity, that would not suffer the violation
of it goe unpunished in his dearest sonne; whom
the more desirous hee was to make like himselfe in
religious observance of Martiall Discipline, and
practice of Iustice towards the enemy; the readier
he was to doe justice upon him for doing the con∣trary.
That excessive love, which he bare unto his
person, whilest his hopefull beginnings did seeme
to promise an accomplishment of those martiall
vertues, whose first draught hee himselfe had well
expressed; turnes into extreame severity and indig∣nation,
after he proves transgressor of those funda∣mentall
rules, by which he had taken his direction;
and unto whose observance his desire of posterity
was destinated. So it falls out by the unalterable
course of nature, or rather by a Law more transcen∣dent
and immutable than nature it selfe, that a lesse
love being chained (by references of subordinati∣on
betweene the objects loved) with a greater, can∣not
dislinke it selfe without some deeper touch of
displeasure, than if the bond or reference had beene
none. The neerer the reference, or the stricter the
bond; the more violent will the rupture be, and the
dissociation more unpleasant: As there is no en∣mity
to the enmity of brethren, if the knot of bro∣therly
kindnesse once fully untie: The reason is, be∣cause
our love to our brethren, is neerest united
with the love of our selves, unto which all other
love is in some sort subordinate. True affection is
alwayes most displeased, where it is most defeated;
<PB N="210" REF="112"/>
where most is deservedly expected and least perfor∣med.
Now as partiality towards our selves, and
indulgence to our inordinate desires, oft-times be∣gets
desire of revenge upon unnaturall or unkinde
brethren: so doth the constant and unpartiall love
of equity and wholesome Lawes, naturally bring
forth just severity towards presumptuous neglec∣ters
of them whose persons wee love no lesse, than
they do that would plead with teares for their im∣punity.
Towards them, unto whom wee would
give reall proofe of more tender and true affection,
than their partiall abetters doe, could wee winne
them, by these or other warrantable means, to link
their love with ours, or to love that best which
most deserveth loue. As <HI>Seleucus</HI> loved his son (for
saving the one of whose eyes, (both being forfait
by the law) he was cōtented to lose one of his own)
more dearely than most princely mothers do their
children, for he loved him as himselfe, yet could
not dispence either with himselfe, or his sonne, be∣cause
he loved the publike law, and common good,
that might accrue by this singular example of Iu∣stice;
better than either, better than both.</P>
<P>3 For every man to love himselfe best, is in our
judgement no breach, but rather a <HI>foundation</HI> of
charitie. Alaw to whose performance every man
is bound in matters of necessity concerning this
life, or in whatsoever may concerne the life to
come; though not in cases of secular honour or
preferment, wherein <HI>Proximus quis{que} sibi,</HI> must (by
the law of conscience, and fundamentall rule of
Christianitie) give place to <HI>Detur digniori.</HI> But
<PB N="211" REF="112"/>
nothing can be so worthy of love or honour as <HI>God;</HI>
who will we, nill we, doth and must enjoy this li∣berty
or priviledge of loving himselfe best. And if
he love himselfe better than he doth any creature,
he must love equity and justice better than he doth
any man; for he himselfe is <HI>equity</HI> it selfe, the eter∣nall
patterne as well of Iustice as of Mercy; he can∣not
be unjustly mercifull towards those men, whom
he loves more dearely than any man doth himselfe.
And in as much as goodnesse it selfe is the essentiall
object of his will, he loves nothing absolutely and
irrevocably, but that which is absolutely &amp; immu∣tably
good. So was not man in his first creation,
much less is he such in his collapsed estate; and yet
Gods love (so super infinite is it) extends it selfe un∣to
our nature so collapsed and polluted with cor∣ruption,
which he infinitely hates. This his love,
which knowes no limit in it selfe, is limited in its
effects towards men, by the correspondency which
they hold or lose with that absolute goodnesse, or
with those eternall rules of equity, justice, or mer∣cy,
in which his will is to haue man made like him.
Such as have beene either in <HI>re</HI> or <HI>spe,</HI> though not
as they should bee, yet such as either infinite loving
kindnesse can vouchsafe to accept, to cherish, or
encourage to goe forward as they haue begunne;
or infinite mercy to tollerate in expectation of
their repentance, or aversion from their wonted
courses: these, if once they finally dissolve the
correspondency, which they held with <HI>Mer∣cie,</HI>
or burst the linke which they had in Gods
love, (with reference to that goodnesse, wherto the
<PB N="212" REF="113"/>
riches of his bounty daily inviteth them) his dis∣pleasure
towards them kindles according to the
<HI>measure</HI> of his former <HI>mercies</HI> or loving kindnesse.
If being illuminated by his Spirit, they finally as∣sociate
themselves to the sonnes of darknesse, or ha∣ving
put on Christ in baptisme, they resume their
swinish habit, and make a sport of wallowing in the
mire; the sweet fountaines of joy and comfort,
which were opened to them as they were Gods
creatures, not uncapable of his infinite mercy, prove
floods of wo &amp; misery to them as they are sworne
servants of sinne and corruption: For, hate to <HI>fil∣thinesse</HI>
and <HI>uncleanness,</HI> is essentially and formally
included in Gods love of <HI>absolute goodnesse,</HI> righte∣ousnesse
and true <HI>holinesse.</HI> And the displeasure or
indignation which he beares to these, must needes
seize on their persons that have covered thēselves
with them, as with a garment; and to whose soules
they sticke more closely than their skinnes doe to
their bodies, or their flesh unto their bones.</P>

for infinite justice or equity to vouch∣safe

unto evill, may bee thus farre improved in the

but in another place. Concerning Infants (save

begotten by our writing or preaching, nor is the
written word the rule of theirs as of all others
faith that are of yeares. And unto them onely that
can heare or reade, or have the use of reason, I write
and speake this, as well for their comfort and en∣couragement
to follow goodnes, or for their terror,
lest they follow evill. <Q><HI>Love,</HI> much greater than a∣ny
creature owes or performes, or is capable of,
either in respect of himselfe, or in others, is the
essentiall and sole fruit of Gods <HI>antecedent will,</HI>
whether concerning our nature as it was in the
first man, or now is in the severall persons deri∣ved
from him. And of this love every particular
faculty of soule or body is a pledge undoubted;
all, are as so many ties or <HI>handles</HI> to draw us un∣to
him, from whom we are separated onely by
dissimilitude; our very natures being otherwise
linkt to his <HI>being,</HI> with bonds of strictest refe∣rence

and <HI>Severity</HI> are the proper effects of his <HI>consequent
will,</HI> that is, they are the infallible consequents of
our neglecting and despising his will revealed for
our good, or sweet promises of saving health.
The full explication and necessary use of this di∣stinction,
hath taken up its place, in the Articles of
Creation, or Divine Providence. Thus much of it
may serve our present turn. That Gods absolute wil
was to have man capable of <HI>Heaven</HI> &amp; <HI>Hel,</HI> of joyes
and miseries immortall. That this absolute will
whose possible objects are two, is in the first place
set on mans eternall and everlasting joy, more fer∣vently
<PB N="215" REF="114"/>
than man can conceive; yet not so, as to
contradict it selfe by frustrating the contrary possi∣bility,
which unto man it had appointed. That
Gods anger never kindles, but out of the ashes of
his flaming love despised. Nor doth the turning of
tender love and compassion, into severity &amp; wrath,
presuppose or argue any change or turning in the
Father of lights and everlasting mercy; it is wholly
seated in mens irregular deviation from that course
which by the appointment of his antecedent will
they should and might have taken (whereto his fa∣therly
kindnesse did still invite them) unto whose
crooked wayes, which they doe, but should not
follow; from which the same infinite goodnesse
doth still allure them by every temporall blessing,
and deterre them by every crosse and plague that
doth befall them.</P>
<P>2 This bodily Sunne, which wee see, never
changeth with the Moone, his light, his heat are

reflected on bodies solid, but of corruptible and
changeable nature, often inflame matter capable of
combustion. But (as some Philosophers thinke)
wold not annoy us (unless by too much light) were
we in that aethereall or coelestiall region wherein it
moves. At least, were our bodies of the like sub∣stance
with the heavens; the vicinity of it would
rather comfort than torment us. Thus is the Fa∣ther
of lights a refreshing flame of unquenchable
<PB N="216" REF="115"/>
love, to such as are drawne by love to be like him
in purity of life, but a consuming fire to such as he
beholdeth a farre off; to such as run from him by
making themselves most unlike unto him. No
sonnes of <HI>Adam</HI> there be, which in some measure
or other had not some taste or participation of his
bountie. And the measure of his wrath is but e∣quall
to the riches of his bounty despised. To
whom this infinite treasure of his bounty hath
beene most liberally opened, it proves in the end a
storehouse of wrath and torments, unlesse it final∣ly
draw them to repentance: According to the
height of that exaltation whereunto his antecedent
will had designed them, shall the degrees of their
depression be in hell for not being exalted by it.
Nor doth any man in that lake of torments, suffer
paines more against his will, than he had done ma∣ny
things against the <HI>will</HI> of his righteous Iudge
daily leading him to repenttnce. The flames of
hell take their scantling from the flames of Gods
love neglected; they may not, they cannot exceede
the measure of this neglect. Or to knit up this
point with evidence of sacred truth; God alwaies
proportioneth his plagues or punishments in just
equality to mens sinnes. And the onely rule for
measuring sinne or transgression right, must bee
taken from the degrees of mans opposition to
Gods delight or pleasure in his salvation. Not so
much as a dramme of his delight or pleasure can be
abated, not a scruple of his will, but must finally be
accomplished. The measure of his delight in mans
repentance or salvation, shall beee exactly satisfied
<PB N="217" REF="115"/>
and fulfilled. Mans repentance he loves as hee is
infinite in mercy and in bounty: mans punish∣ment
he doth not love at all in it selfe, yet doth hee
punish as hee is infinitely just, or as hee infinitely
loveth justice. This is but the extract of <HI>Wisedomes</HI>
speech, <HI>Prov. 1. vers. 24. Because I have called, and

<HI>His mercy is above all his works. Psal. 145. 9.</HI></P>
<P>3 To thinke God should punish sinne unlesse it
were truly against his will, or any sinne more deep∣ly
than it is against his will and pleasure, is one of
those three grosse transformations of the divine na∣ture,
which Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> refutes. For thus to
doe is neither incident to the divine nature, nor to
any other imaginable. Most of us, are by nature
cholericke, and often take offence where none is
given, and almost alwayes greater than is justly gi∣ven;
But to be offended with any thing, that goes
not against their present wills, is a way wardnesse
of men, whereof the humane nature is uncapable.
To punish any, which doe not contradict their
wills, is an injustice scarce incident to the inhabi∣tants
of Hell. It is the mutability of our wills or
multiplicity of humors, which makes us so hard to
be pleased. Our minds (at lest our affections) are
set upon one thing fasting, upon another full; on
this to day, on that to morrow; on sweet meates
in health, on sowre in sicknesse; on kindnesse in
mirth, on cruelty in anger; and because each hath
his severall inconstant motions, wee cannot hold
consort long together, without crossing or thwar∣ring.
But no man ever offended by merrily consor∣ting
<PB N="219" REF="116"/>
with his brother disposed to mirth; nor by
consenting to wreake his will, whilest hee was in
rage. No man ever punished his servant for doing
that which for the present he would have him doe;
nor doe the Devills themselves vex the wicked (till
Gods justice overtake them) but the godly; because
the one doth what they would, the other what they
would not have him doe; neither could displease
them, were it not their wicked will to have all as
bad and miserable as themselves. Could the dam∣ned
by their suffering, either ease these tormentors,
of paine, or abate their malice; they would be lesse
displeased at them, and lesse displeased, torment
them lesse. And, whom then have they made the
<HI>subject</HI> of their thoughts, or did they rather dreame
than thinke on God, that sometimes write as if it
were not as much against Gods will to have men
dye, as it is against mans will to suffer death. For
they suffer death, not because God delighteth in it,
but that Gods will may be fulfilled in their <HI>suffering</HI>
or <HI>passion,</HI> according to the measure it hath beene
neglected or opposed, by their actions.</P>
<P>4 But though the rule of justice bee exactly ob∣served
in proportioning their paines to the degrees
or fervency of his love neglected; yet seeing the
continuance of their neglect was but temporall,
how stands it with his justice to make their paines
eternall? The doubt were pertinent, if the immor∣tall
happinesse, wherunto the riches of Gods boun∣tie,
did daily lead them during their pilgrimage on
earth, whereof they had sweet promises and full
assurance, had not farther exceeded all the plea∣sures
<PB N="220" REF="117"/>
of this mortall life, for whose purchase, they
morgaged their hopes of immortality, than the
paines of hell doe these grievances or corrections,
which caused them murmure against their heaven∣ly
Father. In this sense we may maintaine what
<HI>Mirandula</HI> in another doth: that no man is everlast∣ingly
punished for temporall offences as commit∣ted
against God. How then? Man wilfully ex∣changing
his everlasting inheritance for momen∣tany
and transient pleasures, becomes the Author
of his owne woe, and reapes the fruit of his rash
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">For I reckon, that the sufferings of this pre∣sent time, are not worthy to be compa∣red with the glory which shall be revealed in us. <HI>Rom. 8. 18.</HI></NOTE>bargaines, and so makes up that measure of Gods
glory and pleasure, by his eternall sufferings, which
he might and would not doe, by eternall participa∣tion
of his joyfull presence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Quod si Christo salus nostra tam chara fuit, &amp; tam charò con∣stitit, quid est quare nostram ipsi salutem tantopere negligamus?

just, (for it is justice tempered with abundant mer∣cy)
that they should suffer everlasting paines, who
not twice, or thrice, or seven times onely, but
more than seventy times seven times, have wilfully

accepting the sweet profers of their eternall joy.
In every moment of this life, we have a pledge of
his bounty to assure us of a better inheritance, the
very first neglect whereof, might in justice con∣demne
us to everlasting bondage. The often and
perpetuall neglect, turnes flames of eternall
love into an eternall consuming fire. For if
love and mercy bee his property as hee is Crea∣tor
and preserver of all mankinde: his love
<PB N="221" REF="117"/>
(as was said before) must needs be more indissolu∣bly
set on those attributes than on man. The end
of his love to man, is to make him happy by be∣ing
like him in the love of goodnesse: Now the
more he loves him with reference to this end, or
the oftner hee pardons him for neglecting or refu∣sing
the meanes that draw unto it; the greater is his
wrath against impenitency, or finall contempt of
his loving mercy. This is his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Isa. 42. 14 I have long time hol∣den my peace, I have been still and re∣frained my selfe: now will I cry like a tra∣vailing woman, I wil destroy &amp; devoure at once.</NOTE> most deare and ten∣der

out to the terror of the ungodly in the pro∣pheticall

<PB N="223" REF="118"/>
whose meaning in conclusion he acknowled∣geth
to be Orthodoxall and good; albeit his cha∣racters
of divine wrath in the premisses, may seeme
better to fit the fragility of humane peevishnesse,
than the Majesty of the Almighty Iudge. His phrase
(perhaps) might be excused in part, by the security
of those times wherein he wrote; his fault (if any
fault it were not to speake precisely in an age more
precise for maintaining the elegancy or life of style,
than the right use or logicall propriety of words)
is too common to most Writers yet, and consisteth
onely in <HI>appropriating</HI> that to the Divine Nature,
which is attributed to it onely by extrinsecall deno∣mination.
But leaving his phrase (about which
perhaps he himselfe would not have wrangled) his
argument holds thus farre true: God is more deep∣ly
displeased with sinne, than man is, though his
displeasure bee not cloathed with such passions, as
mans anger is: and yet the motions of the crea∣tures
appointed to execute his wrath, are more fu∣rious
than any mans passions in extreamest fury can
bee. What mans voice is like his thunder? What
Tyrants frownes like to a lowring sky, breathing
out stormes of fire and brimstone? Yet are the most
terrible sounds, which the creatures can present,
but as so many ecchoes of his angry voice; the most
dreadfull spectacles that Heaven or Earth, or the
intermediate Elements can afford, but copies of his
irefull countenance. Howbe it this change or altera∣tion
in the creature proceeds from him without a∣ny
internall passion or alteration. <HI>Immotus movet:

<P><PB N="224" REF="119"/>
6 But as <HI>Lactantius</HI> may bee so farre justified, as
we have said, so perhaps he is inexcusable in avou∣ching
anger to bee as naturall to GOD, as mer∣cie,
love, and favour are. To him that duely
considers his infinite goodnesse, it may seeme im∣possible
that hee should bee moved by us, or by
any thing in us, to mercy; seeing, as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Deus ex se sumil se∣minarium miserendi, quod judi∣cat &amp; con∣demnat nos, eum quo∣dammodo cogimus, ut longe aliter de corde ipsius mise∣ratio quam animadver. sio procede∣re videatur.

And though he be the Author as well of punish∣ment
as of compassion, yet the manner how these
two opposite attributes, in respect of us proceed
from him, is much different; the one is naturall
to him, and much better than any naturall comfort
unto us; the other is in a sort to him unnaturall, and
most unnaturall and unpleasant unto us: for as S.
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Vide Hie∣rom. in cap. 1. Mich. vi∣de Riberam in 1. Mich. num. 5. Et in 4. Mal. num. 4.</NOTE><HI>Ierome</HI> saith, <HI>God when he punisheth,</HI> doth in a man∣ner,
<HI>relinquish his nature, and therefore when he pro∣ceeds
to punishment, he is said to goe out of his place,</HI>
and to worke <HI>alienum opus,</HI> a strange or uncouth
worke. The wicked and reprobate, after this life,
shall alwayes see and feele his anger: But though
they see him thus, immediately, they doe not see
his nature so immediately as the Elect shall doe, to
whom he shewes himselfe in love; this is his pro∣per
visage, the live-character of his native counte∣nance.
The manifestation of his anger in what part
of the world soever, or in what manner soever
made, is a veile or <HI>vizard</HI> put betweene him and the
<PB N="225" REF="119"/>
Reprobate, lest they shold see the light of his coun∣tenance
and be made whole. Hence, in the sentence
of condemnation, it shall be said, <HI>Depart from mee
yee cursed into everlasting fire.</HI> From his essentiall
presence they cannot, but from the light of his
countenance or joyfull presence, they must of ne∣cessity
depart. For were it possible for them to be∣hold
it, no torments could take hold of them; the
reflex of it upon whom soever it lighteth, createth
joy; the fruition of it, is that happinesse which we
seeke. To conclude: <HI>Lactantius</HI> rightly inferres,
<HI>It were impossible sinne should not be odious to him, to
whom goodnesse is pleasant and delightfull.</HI> Now his
dispeasure at sinne, is the true cause of all displea∣sant
motions or alterations in the creatures. His er∣rour,
albeit we take him at the worst, was not great:
and as it may easily be committed by others, so it
may as quickly be rectified, if wee say, that <HI>Anger</HI>
and <HI>Hate</HI> are by consequent, or upon supposall of
sinne, as necessary to the Divine Nature, as Love
and Mercy, but not so naturall. But how either
<HI>Love</HI> or <HI>Anger,</HI> both of them being either formally
passions, or indissolubly linkt with passions, may
be rightly conceived to be in God, is a point worth
explication.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>O affection or operation that es∣sentially
includes imperfection,
can properly be attributed to per∣fection
it selfe. But if the imper∣fection
be onely accidentall, that
is, such as may bee severed from
the affection; the affection after such separation
made, may without meaphor (in some Schoole∣mens
judgement) be ascribed to God. Hence the
same Schoolemen will have distributive justice to
be in him, after a more peculiar manner than com∣mutative
justice is; because commutative justice
(as they alledge) essentially includes <HI>rationem dati,

Mercy likewise is (in their judgements) more pro∣perly
in God, than anger or revenge; because it
may bee abstracted from compassion, which is an
imperfectiō annexed, but not essential to the reliefe
of others misery, wherein mercy (as they contend)
formally consists. It sufficeth us, that such affecti∣ons
or morall qualities as in us formally and essen∣tially
include imperfectiō, may be contained in the
Divine Essence; though not formally, yet eminent∣ly,
and most truly, as we suppose anger is. For in
this point wee rather approve of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">De Ira Dei, cap. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Lactantius</HI> his
Divinity, than of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Quotiens impetu o∣pus est non irascitur, sed exurgit, &amp; in quan∣tum puta∣vit opus esse concitatur remittitur{que} non aliter quam quae tormentis exprimun∣tur tela, in potestate mittentis sunt, in quantum torque an∣tur.

Nor should we sin, if we were angry onely as he is
angry; or at those things onely that displease him,
so far as they are displeasing to him; And were we
as much inclined to mercy and loving kindnesse as
we are to anger, the motions of the one would ar∣gue
as great passion as the motiōs of the other. But

Greg∣moral. lib. 20. in 30. cap. Iob.</NOTE> Gods mercy which is proposed unto us
for a patterne, is (if I may so speake) more reall and
trnly affectionate in him than his anger, the difficul∣ty
how either should be in him is the same, or not
much different: How can there be true compassi∣on
without passion, without motion or mutation?
In many men it is observable; that the better use
they have of reason, the lesse they participate of af∣fection:
and to cary those matters with moderati∣on,
which others can neither accomplish nor affect
without excesse of passion or perturbation, is a per∣fection
peculiar to good education, much &amp; choice
experience or true learning. And thus by proporti∣on
they argue, that God who is infinitly wise, must
be as utterly void of passiō, though he be truly said
mercifull in respect of the event. The conclusion is
truer than the reason assigned. And in most men
whom the world accounteth wise or subtile, reason
doth not so much moderate as devoure affections
of that rank we treat of. The cunningest heads have
commonly most deceitfull or unmercifull hearts:
and want of passion often argues want of religion,
if not abundance of habituated atheism or irreligiō.
Every mans passions are for the most part mode∣rate
<PB N="228" REF="121"/>
in matters w<SUP>ch</SUP> he either least affects or minds
the most. Perpetuall minding, especially of world∣ly
matters, coucheth the affections in an equall ha∣bit
or constant temper; which is not easily moved,
unlesse it be directly or strongly thwarted. Desires
once stifned with hope of advantage by close solli∣citation,
secret cariage, or cunning contrivance;
take small notice of violent oppositions which ap∣parantly
either overshoot, or come short of the
game they lye in wait for. But even such moderate
politiques, if their nets be once discovered and the
prey caught from them, fall into <HI>Achitophels</HI> pas∣sion.
Indignation and mercy, because incompati∣ble
with such meanes as serve best to politique
ends, are held the companions of fooles. And unto
the world so they seeme, because they are the pro∣per
passions of reason throughly apprehending the
true worth of matters spirituall. For though gra∣vity
or good education may decently figure the
outward motions; yet is it impossible not to bee
vehemently moved, at the miscariage of those
things, which we most esteeme. And the wiser we
are in matters spirituall, the higher wee esteeme
the promulgation of religion, the good of Gods
Church, and promotion of his glory. The better
experience we have of his goodnesse; the more we
pity their case which as yet never tasted it: the more
compassionate wee are to all that are in that misery
whence we are redeemed. Did we esteeme these or
other duties of spiritual life, as they deserve: the ex∣treamest
fits of passion, which any worldly wise
man can be cast into, wold seem but as light flashes
<PB N="229" REF="121"/>
to those flames of zeale and indignation w<SUP>ch</SUP> the ve∣ry
sight of this misguided world, would forthwith
kindle in our brests. It is not then Gods infinit wis∣dome
which swallowes up all passion, or exempts
him from those affections which essentially include
perturbation; for so the most zealous and compas∣sionate
should be most unlike him in heavenly wis∣dome.
But as the swift motion of the heaven, bet∣ter
expresseth his immobility or vigorous rest, then
the dull stability of the earth. So doth the vehe∣mency
of zeale, of indignation, or other passions of
the godly (so the motives be weighty and just) ex∣hibite
a more lively resemblance of his immutabili∣ty
or want of passion, then the Stoicall apathy, or
worldings insensibility in matters spirituall can doe.</P>
<P>2 How we should in godly passions bee likest
GOD in whom is no passion; or how those ver∣tues
or affections which are formally in us, should
bee eminently in him; cannot by my barren ima∣gination
bee better illustrated, then by compa∣ring
the circle in some properties with other fi∣gures.
A circle, in some mens definitive language,
is but a circular line; and to any mans sense (as in
some respects (perhaps) reason must acknow∣ledge)
it is rather one line, then a comprehensi∣on
of different lines, or a multitude of sides inclo∣sed
in angles. And from the unity of it perhaps it
is, that many flexible bodies, as wands or small
rods of iron, brasse, &amp;c. which presently breake if
you presse them into angles, or seek to frame them
into any other figure, will bee drawne without
danger into a circular forme. Notwithstanding
<PB N="230" REF="122"/>
some infallible mathematicall rules there be exprest
in tearmes which in strict property of speech
(or univocally) agree only to figures consisting of
sides and angles; whose truth and use, reason expe∣rienceth
to bee most eminently true in the Circle.
Take a Quadrangle ten yards in length, and foure
in bredth, another eight yards in length, and sixe
in bredth, a third seven yards every way: The cir∣cumference
of all three is equall 28. yards; so is not
the superficiall quantity, but of the first 40. yards,
of the second 48. of the third 49. The same inducti∣on
alike sensible in other many-sided figures, af∣foords
this generall unquestionable rule;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inter figu∣ras <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, ordinator <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> est capacior.</NOTE> Among
figures of the same kind, whose circumference is e∣quall,
that whose sides are most equall, are most ca∣pacious.
Yet frame a five-angled figure whose whol
circumference is but 28. yards, though the sides
be not equall, the superficiall quantity of it will
bee greater, then the superficiall quantity of the
former square: and yet a sixe-angled figure of the
same circumference, though the sides be unequall,
will bee more capacious then that. And still the
more you encrease the number of angles, though
without any encrease of the circumference, the
greater will the capacity or superficiall quantity of
the figures be, specially if the sides be not unequall.
From this evident induction ariseth a second tryed
rule in the Mathematique.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inter figu∣ras <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Heteroge∣neas termi∣natior est capacior.</NOTE> Amongst figures of
divers kinds, whose circumferences are equall, that
which hath most angles, is alwayes most capaci∣ous.
The circle which to our sense seemes neither
to have sides, nor angles; by a double title groun∣ded
<PB N="231" REF="122"/>
on both the former rules, hath the prehemi∣nence
for capacity of all other figures. It is more
uniforme than any other, or rather the abstract or
patterne of uniformity in figures, admitting neither
difference of ranckes, or sorts, as triangles, qua∣drangles,
or other many-sided figures doe: nor of
inequality betweene its owne internall parts or
lines: neither can one circle bee more capacious
then another of the same circumference: nor can
any line in the same circle bee longer then another
that is drawne from one part of the circumference,
to another, through the same center. It is then in
this respect more capacious then any other figure,
because it is most uniforme. The sides of other fi∣gures
may be exactly equall, but the distance of e∣very
part of their circumference from the center,
cannot admit such equality, as every part of the cir∣cles
circumference doth. The circle againe is more
capacious then any other figure, because more full
of angles. for the angles which it no where hath
univocally, formally, or conspicuous to sense; rea∣son
apprehends it to have every where eminently.
For as the Philosopher tells us, it is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a totan∣gle,
and so hath the prerogative or royalty, though
not the propriety of the second Rule. It is more
capacious than any other figure, not onely because
it is more <HI>ordinate</HI> or uniforme, but withall, because
it hath more angles than any other figures can
have; even as many as can be imagined, it being a

<P>3 This analogy betweene sides and angles as
they are found in the circle and in other figures,
<PB N="232" REF="123"/>
mee thinkes well expresseth that analogy which
Schoole Divines assigne betweene wisedome, sci∣ence,
love, hatred, goodnesse, desire, &amp;c. as they
are found in God and in man. For no one name or
title of any affection can be univocally attributed
to the Creator and to the creature: and yet the
rules of equity, of mercy, of Iustice, of patience, of
anger, of love, which we are commanded to follow,
though not without passion or affection, are most
truly observed by him: yea their truth in him is
infinitely eminent: so farre must we be from con∣ceiting
him to bee without ardent love, without
true and unfaigned good will to us, without wrath
burning like fire to consume his adversaries, be∣cause
he is without all passion. He is most loving,
yet never moved with love, because he is eternally
wholly love; He is most compassionate, yet never
moved with compassion, because he is eternally
wholly compassion; He is most jealous of his glo∣ry
and a revenger of iniquity most severe; yet ne∣ver
moved with jealousie, yet never passionate in re∣venge;
because to such as provoke his punitive ju∣stice,
hee is eternally severity and revenge it selfe.
Againe, how the indivisible Essence should bee
wholly love, and wholly displeasure, wholly mer∣cy,
and wholly severity, I cannot better illustrate
then by the circle, the true embleme of his eterni∣tie,
which is as truly <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as well all
sides, as all angles. And being such, the sides and
angles cannot be distinguished in it: but the sides
are angles, and the angles sides; at least they are, if
not essentially, yet penetratively the same. The
<PB N="233" REF="123"/>
circle likewise is as truely <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, of
equall sides and equall angles, as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
a totangle or totilater; and did it not contiaine mul∣tiplicitie
of sides, as well as of angles in most exact
and eminent uniformity, it could not have the full
prerogative of the former rules. Nor could the
indivisible essence either be so great or excellent in
himselfe, or a moderator of all things so powerfull
and just, as wee beleeve hee is; unlesse he did emi∣nently
containe the perfections of all things possi∣ble
as well as of any one.</P>
<P>4 Some Philosophers have placed the humane
nature, as a line diameter or aequilibrium in this vi∣sible
sphere; making man the measure of all
things, as participating all other natures: much
what after the same manner that mixt bodies con∣taine
the force and vertues of the elements. And
mans nature, til it was corrupt, did (without doubt)
include such an eminent uniformity to all things
created, as the eye doth unto colours. As hee was
then the true image of God for his essence; so did
he in this <HI>property,</HI> beare a true shadow of the di∣vine
prerogative, whose essence, though, for num∣ber
or greatnesse of perfections contained in it, al∣together
measurelesse, is the most true and exqui∣site
<HI>measure</HI> of all things that are, or possibly can be:
All the conditions or properties of measure assign∣ed
by the Philosopher are as truly contained in the
incomprehensible essence, as sides or angles in the
circle, but farre more eminently. A measure it is,
not appliable to measurables, for kind or quantity
much different, according to diversitie of parts,
<PB N="234" REF="124"/>
which it hath none, for it is immutably, eternally
and indivisibly the same: and unto it the nature,
essence, quality, and quantity of all things, are actu∣ally
applyed, in that they have actuall being. It is
impossible the immutable Creator should be fitted
to any thing created; but in that he is immutable,
and yet eminently containeth all things in his indi∣visible
essence, he eternally and immutably fits all
the possible varieties whereof contingency it selfe
is capable. Being all things else, hee is fitnesse it
selfe in a most eminent and excellent manner: the
present disposition of every thing, either, whiles it
first begins to be, or continues the same, or whiles
it is in the change or motion (whether from good
to evill, or from evill to good, from evill to worse,
or from good to better) is more exquisitely fitted
in it owne kind, by eternall, immutable and incom∣parable
fitnesse; then it could be by any other mea∣sure,
which the Creator himselfe could create with
it, or devise for it, after the alteration or change
were accomplished. In that he is indivisibly <HI>One,</HI>
and yet eminently <HI>All,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Esay 66. 14, 15, 16.</NOTE> he is immutable, contrariety
it selfe unto contraries:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 7. 4.</NOTE> Arithmeticall equality it
selfe to things equall, Geometrically equall to
things unequall;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 7. 9, 10.</NOTE> according to every degree of
their unequall capacities, in what sort soever. And
as of his other attributes one truly and really is ano∣ther,
so in respect of man, his <HI>measure</HI> is his judge∣ment
or retribution whether of rewards or punish∣ments,
not the rule onely by which he rewards or
punisheth. Vnto man in his first creation, and
whiles he continued as he created him, he was and
<PB N="235" REF="124"/>
would have continued bountie it selfe; unto man
yet as he is his creature, he is love it selfe: and unto
man made by his own folly an impotent wretched
and miserable creature, hee is so entyrely mercy
and compassion if selfe, that were there a distinct
god of love, or a goddesse of mercy, or two infi∣nite
living abstracts of meere love, and meere mer∣cie;
they could not be so loving and mercifull unto
man touched with the sense of his owne miseries,
nor solicite him so seriously and perpetually unto
repentance as <HI>he</HI> doth, who is entirely infinite mer∣cy,
but not mercy only. Vnto the truly penitent he
is so truly and entirely gratiousnesse it selfe, that if
there were a Trinity of such abstract Graces, as the
Poets have faigned, they could be but a figure or
picture of his solid and infinite gratiousnesse. Vn∣to
the elect and throughly sanctified, he is so truely
and entirely felicity and salvation it selfe; that if
the Heathen goddesses, <HI>Felicitas</HI> and <HI>Salus,</HI> or <HI>Pla∣toes
Idea</HI> of true happinesse might be inspired with
life and sense;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Qui quoti∣die contem∣nit Deum, etiam quoti∣die judica∣tur, non ma∣nifesto sed occulto judi∣cio, non a∣perto sed ta∣men certo: occultiora saepe sunt certiora ma∣nifestioribus Coppen. in Psal. 7.</NOTE> they could not communicate halfe
that happinesse to any one man (though they wold
choose his hart for their closet, or actuate his reaso∣nable
soule as it doth the sensitive) that is imparted
by him to al his chosen, who is entirely infinite hap∣pinesse,
but not happinesse onely. For unto the im∣penitent
and despisers of his bountie, of his love,
his mercy, grace, and salvation; he is justice, indig∣nation,
and severity it selfe. <HI>Nemesis</HI> her selfe were

Satan and his wicked Angles, in such full and ex∣quisite
measure as the just Iudge will doe in that last
dreadfull day. Then shall he truely appeare to be,

of all those powers which the heathens ado∣red
for gods, as authors either of good or of evill:

all things which in this life our love did seeke after,
or our feare naturally laboured to avoyd: The
onely loadstone whereto our love, our desire in
our creation were directed, was his goodnesse and
loving kindnesse. And feare was implanted in our
nature as an Helme or Rudder to divert us from his
immutable justice or indignation; which are as
rockes immoveable, against whom whosoever shall
carelessely or presumptuously runne, must everla∣stingly
perish without redemption.</P>

<ITEM>4 The first objection of the Atheist, <HI>Of nothing, no∣thing
can be made.</HI> Of the doubtful sense of this <HI>na∣turall,</HI>
how far it is true, and how far it is false. 19</ITEM>
<PB REF="127"/>
<ITEM>5 By what manner of induction or enumeration of
particulars, universall rules or Maximes must bee
framed and supported. That no induction can bee
brought to prove the Naturalists Maxime, <HI>Of no∣thing,
nothing can be made.</HI> 25</ITEM>
<ITEM>6 The second objection of the Naturalist: <HI>[Every a∣gent
praesupposeth a patient or passive subject to
worke upon]</HI> cannot be proved by any induction.
The contradictorie to this Maxime proued by suf∣ficient
induction. 31</ITEM>
<ITEM>7 Shewing by reasons philosophicall, that aswell the
physicall matter of bodies sublunary, as the celestiall
bodies which work upon it, were of necessity to have
a beginning of their Being and Duration. 45</ITEM>
<ITEM>8 Discussing the second generall proposed, Whether
the making something of nothing rightly argue a

<HEAD>SECT. II.
OF Divine Providence in generall: and
how Contingency, and necessity in
things created are subiect unto it.</HEAD>
<ITEM>Chapter. Folio.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9 Of the perpetuall dependance which all things crea∣ted
have on the Almighty Creator, both for their
being and their operations. 65</ITEM>
<ITEM>10 The usuall and daily operations of naturall causes
with their severall events or successes, are as imme∣diately

the first Creation of all things, with the reasons
why they are so ascribed. 80</ITEM>
<ITEM>11 Containing the summe of what we are to beleeue in
this Article of Creation, and of the duties where∣to
it binds us: with an introduction to the Article
of His Providence. 87</ITEM>
<ITEM>12 Though nothing can fall out otherwise then God
hath decreed: yet God hath decreed that many
things may fall out otherwise than they doe. 98</ITEM>
<ITEM>13 Contingency is absolutely possible, and part of the
object of Omnipotency, as formall a part, as neces∣sity
is. 102</ITEM>
<ITEM>14 The former conclusion proved by the consent of all
the Ancients, whether Christians or Heathens,
which did dislike the errour of the <HI>Stoickes.</HI> 109</ITEM>
<ITEM>15 The principall conclusions, which are held by the
favourers of absolute necessity, may be more clear∣ly
justified, and acquitted from all inconveniences,
by admitting a mixt possibilitie or contingency in
humane actions. 118</ITEM>
<ITEM>16 The former contingency in humane actions or mu∣tuall
possibility of obtaining reward or incurring
punishment, proved by the infallibile rule of faith,
and by the tenour of Gods Covenant with his peo∣ple. 126</ITEM>

<ITEM>Chapter. Folio.</ITEM>
<ITEM>31 Of the rule of retaliation or counterpassion. And

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N further explication
of this Article, it is ad∣ded
in the NICENE
CREEDE, <HI>I beleeve in
one God the Father Al∣mighty.</HI>
This title of
<HI>Almighty</HI> or <HI>Omni∣potency,</HI>
is not given
to the <HI>Sonne,</HI> or to the
<HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> nor are ei∣ther
of them expresly <HI>enstyled</HI> by the name of
God, in the Creede. The omission of the title of
<PB N="2" REF="130"/>
God, and of the Attribute <HI>Almightie,</HI> (which is
proper to the Godhead) when the persons of the
<HI>Sonne</HI> and of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> with their severall of∣fices
are described; may administer this scruple to
men, not much conversant in these great mysteries,
<HI>[Whether the Father onely be God, or onely Almigh∣tie,
or the onely God Almightie, in such sort as the
Sonne and holy Ghost are not.]</HI> To say the Father
onely is God, or the Father onely is Almightie,
were to wrong the Sonne and Holy Ghost; to
both whose Persons these titles are due: and our
Faith in this point of the Trinitie, above all others,
must be uniforme and unpartiall, without respect
of <HI>Persons.</HI> And for the better instruction of such
as did not fully apprehend the right meaning
of the Apostolique Creede, this uniformi∣tie
of our Faith is expresly taught by <HI>Athana∣sius.
Such as the Father is, such is the Sonne, and such
is the holy Ghost: the Father is God, the Sonne is God,
and the holy Ghost is God: the Father is Almightie,
the Sonne is Almighty, and the holy Ghost Almightie:</HI>
yet shall we often reade in Scriptures, and in Wri∣ters
Orthodoxal, euen in <HI>Athanasius</HI> himselfe, <HI>[that
the Father is the onely God.]</HI> So saith the Sonne of
God, <HI>Iohn 17. vers. 3. This is life eternall, that they
may know thee, the onely true God, and Iesus Christ
whom thou hast sent.</HI> Doth Christ therefore deny
himselfe to be the onely true God? or rather is it
a part of our beleefe, and of our Saviours meaning
in that place, that wee must know not onely God
the Father, but Iesus Christ also, whom hee hath
sent, to be the onely true God? And though it be
<PB N="3" REF="130"/>
not in that place expressed, yet it is necessarily im∣plyed
in other Scriptures, that the holy Ghost is
the onely true God. No Christian may question
this Proposition, (Pater est solus Deus) <HI>The Father
is the onely God:</HI> nor this, (Filius est solus Deus)
<HI>The Sonne is the onely God:</HI> nor this third, (Spiritus
sanctus est solus Deus) <HI>The holy Ghost is the onely
God.</HI> The Father likewise is the onely Almightie,
the Sonne likewise is the onely Almightie, and the
holy Ghost the onely Almightie: on whom our
Faith is joyntly and uniformly set. This uniformi∣tie
of our Faith hath for its object, the unitie of <HI>na∣ture</HI>
in the <HI>Trinitie.</HI> But to say (Solus Pater est
Deus, solus Pater est omnipotens) <HI>The Father one∣ly
is God,</HI> or <HI>the Father onely is Almightie; The Son
onely is God,</HI> or <HI>the Sonne onely is Almightie; The
holy Ghost onely is Almightie:</HI> were more then he∣resie,
grosse infidelitie. For every one of these
speeches include a deniall both of the coequalitie
of their persons, and of the unitie of their nature.
Of the ground of this distinction, or of the diffe∣rence
betweene these severall Propositions (Solus
Pater est Deus, Pater est solus Deus) <HI>The Father
onely is God,</HI> and <HI>the Father is the onely God, &amp;c.</HI> by
the assistance of this blessed Trinitie wee shall dis∣cusse,
after wee have proved the Sonne to be truly
God, and the holy Ghost likewise to be truly God,
in the severall Articles which concerne their per∣sons
and offices. Now the same Arguments,
which proves the Sonne to be truly God, and the
holy Ghost likewise to be truly God, will likewise
prove the <HI>Sonne</HI> to be the <HI>onely</HI> God, the onely Al∣mightie.
<PB N="4" REF="131"/>
The point next in view, and first to bee
handled, is the meaning of this Attribute <HI>Almighty,</HI>
and how it agrees to the Godhead or divine nature
as it is presupposed one and the same in the three
Persons.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> <SEG REND="decorInit">Ὀ</SEG>Υκ αδυνατήσει παρα τῷ Θεῶ παν ῥὴμα. <HI>Nothing
shall be unpossible unto God,</HI> saith the
Angell to the blessed Virgin, doubting
or moving this question, <HI>How shall I</HI>
(instantly) <HI>conceive and beare a sonne,
seeing I know not a man?</HI> That the accomplishing
of <HI>that,</HI> which the Angell had said, was possible to
God, the event did prove. But that nothing should
be impossible unto God, can neyther be proved by
any event, nor will it necessarily follow, at least the
necessity of its <HI>consequence</HI> is not so cleare from the
words uttered by the Angel, which admit of some
restriction. For, to be God, or to be <HI>equall with
God,</HI> is <HI>something,</HI> more then meere nothing. Is it
then <HI>possible</HI> for God to make a God euery way
<HI>equall</HI> unto himselfe? The <HI>Sonne</HI> of God, who was
conceived by the holy Ghost, and borne of the
blessed Virgin, was equall with God, yet not so
made, but so begotten from all eternitie. Hee is
more then <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and is not comprehended
under the <HI>former</HI> Proposition. For being God
<PB N="5" REF="131"/>
from all eternitie, it was impossible hee should be
made. Must then the Angels speech, or the Arti∣cle
of Omnipotencie bee restrained to things pos∣sible?
or is God said to be omnipotent onely in
<HI>this respect,</HI> that hee is able to doe all things, that
are <HI>possible</HI> to be done? In respect of whom then
shall they be counted possible? In respect of God
himselfe, or in respect of Men or Angells? Or with
reference to Angelicall or humane knowledge one∣ly?
or in respect of knowledge divine? To be able
onely to doe all things, that man or Angels can
doe, or can conceive may be done, doth not exe∣quiate
or <HI>fill</HI> our conceit of power and wisedome
truly infinite: it is much lesse than the full <HI>extent,</HI>
or <HI>contents</HI> of Omnipotencie: which certainly con∣taineth
<HI>power</HI> and <HI>wisedome</HI> much greater than can
be comprehended by man or Angell. Againe, to
say that God can doe all things, that are possible for
<HI>him</HI> to doe, or may be effected by his infinite po∣wer
and wisedome, is to say the same thing <HI>twise,</HI>
and yet to leave the true <HI>notion</HI> of Omnipotencie
unexpressed.</P>
<P>Were the question propounded, what things can
be seene or heard; What things cannot be seene or
heard: a man should be little wiser by this answer,
<HI>Things visible onely can be seene; Things invisible
cannot be seene: Things audible onely can be heard;
Things inaudible cannot be heard.</HI> For if one which
knowes no Latine, nor the derivation of English
words from it, should further aske what it is to be
<HI>visible,</HI> what it is to be <HI>invisible;</HI> or what is the
meaning or signification of <HI>audible</HI> and <HI>inaudible?</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="132"/>
the answer would be, That is <HI>visible,</HI> which can be
seene; that is <HI>invisible,</HI> which cannot be seene:
that is <HI>audible,</HI> which may be heard; that <HI>inaudible,</HI>
which cannot be heard. So that he which former∣ly
knew the signification of these words, or their
<HI>forme</HI> in Latine (whence they are derived,) should
learne nothing by this answer, which for reall sense
is but <HI>idem per idem,</HI> a diversitie of words, without
any difference in the thing signified by them. A∣gaine,
though these two Propositions be converti∣ble,
[1. Every object of <HI>sight</HI> is <HI>visible,</HI> and what∣soever
is <HI>visible</HI> is the object of <HI>sight:</HI> 2. Every ob∣ject
of <HI>hearing</HI> is <HI>audible,</HI> and whatsoever is <HI>audible</HI>
is the object of <HI>hearing;]</HI> yet is not <HI>visibilitie</HI> the
true and proper object of <HI>sight</HI> nor <HI>audibilitie</HI> of
<HI>hearing.</HI> To be <HI>visible,</HI> or <HI>invisible;</HI> to be <HI>audible,</HI>
or <HI>inaudible,</HI> are termes <HI>relative.</HI> And euery <HI>rela∣tion</HI>
or <HI>relative terme</HI> supposeth a ground or root,
whence it ariseth or results; which in nature hath
precedency of it: now it is the <HI>root</HI> or ground
from which the relation results, which is the pro∣per
object of every facultie whether it be pas∣sive
as our senses are, or active, as our understan∣ding
is.</P>
<P>2. This relation or relative terme, to be <HI>visible</HI>
or <HI>audible,</HI> results from the impression, which the
proper object of sight or hearing make upon these
two senses, or at least from the aptitude which
they have to imprint their proper shape or <HI>forme</HI>
upon these senses. The object of sight, which is
<HI>colour</HI> or <HI>light,</HI> cannot <HI>found</HI> the <HI>relation</HI> of <HI>audibi∣litie,</HI>
because neyther light nor colour have any
<PB N="7" REF="132"/>
aptitude to imprint their <HI>forme</HI> upon the eare; nor
can the relation of <HI>visibilitie</HI> result from <HI>sounds,</HI>
which are the proper object of <HI>hearing,</HI> because
<HI>sounds</HI> have no aptnesse or power to make any sen∣sitive
impression upon the eye. <HI>Sounds</HI> then are the
proper object of hearing, and the ground or root,
whence bodies take the denomination of being <HI>au∣dible.
Light</HI> or <HI>colour</HI> is the proper object of sight, &amp;
the ground or root whence bodies in which light
or colour is found, receive the relative denomina∣tion
of being visible. Vnto the question then,
<HI>[What things may be seene, what things may not bee
seene; what things may be heard, or may not bee
heard,]</HI> the true and onely Philosophicall answer
is, Those things onely can be seene, which are <HI>en∣dowed</HI>
with colours, or participate of light; those
things which have no colour or participation of
light cannot be seene. Those bodies onely which
are apt to make or give <HI>sound,</HI> can be heard; those
which can yeeld no <HI>sound,</HI> cannot be heard. If it
should further be demanded, why sounds only are
<HI>audible,</HI> when as neyther colours nor other quali∣ties
can be <HI>audible,</HI> or become the object of hea∣ring?
The only way to assoyle this question would
be to instruct him that makes it, in the manner how
<HI>sounds</HI> are produced, how they are carryed by the
ayre unto the eare, how they are there entertained
by the ayre, which the eare or organ of hearing
continually harbours within it selfe for their enter∣tainment.
Hee that should see the fabricke of the
eare, and take the use of its severall parts (of the
<HI>anvile</HI> &amp; the <HI>hammer</HI> especially) into serious consi∣deration,
<PB N="8" REF="133"/>
would cease to enquire why sounds are
audible rather then colours, and begin to admire
the inexpressible skill of the Artificer, which fra∣med
this live-eccho in all more perfect sensitive
creatures. No marvell if the eare perceive sounds,
seeing the use or exercise of this sense is a continu∣all
imitation of the production of sounds. And as
no creature understands the expressions of our ra∣tionall
internall notions, save that onely which is
endowed with the like internall notions of reasons;
so neither could the eare or sense of hearing per∣ceive
sounds, unlesse it had a continuall internall
<HI>sound</HI> within it selfe. Hee againe that should view
the severall humours of the eye, the Chrystalline
especially, would never move question, why co∣lours
should make that impression upon the eye,
which they doe not upon the eare.</P>
<P>3 The point questioned in this part of Divini∣tie,
or concerning the meaning of this Attribute
[Omnipotencie] comes to this issue. Whether
<HI>power infinite</HI> &amp; <HI>omnipotent</HI> have any object wher∣unto
it is, or may be so immediately terminated, as
<HI>sight</HI> or the <HI>visive facultie</HI> is unto <HI>light</HI> or <HI>colours,</HI>
or as the faculty of hearing is to <HI>sounds,</HI> whence the
relation or relative denomination of <HI>possibilitie</HI>
doth so result, as visibilitie doth from the sight or
visive facultie, as it respecteth colours. If infinite
power presuppose any other object pre-existent to
possibilitie, as light and colours are to visibilitie,
this object must needs be eyther privative or posi∣tive:
Something or meere nothing. If wee shall
say this <HI>object</HI> is a positive entitie, eyther it was frō
<PB N="9" REF="133"/>
Eternitie without dependence on his Almightie
power, &amp; so it should be, as that power is, infinite.
Or if we say this supposed object were from him,
or by him, or had dependance on his power; then
certainly it was <HI>possible,</HI> and therefore cannot bee
precedent to all possibilitie. Whence it may seeme
concluded, that Gods infinite power or Omnipo∣tencie
is the onely <HI>foundation</HI> of possibilitie, and
by consequence cannot possibly have any <HI>object,</HI>
whereto it is or can be terminated, or so fitted, as
the <HI>visive facultie</HI> or <HI>sight</HI> is to light or colours.
Howbeit in truth the former reasons onely con∣clude,
that the object of Omnipotencie can be no
positive entitie, nor the <HI>privation</HI> or negation of
any <HI>determinate</HI> being. But that the same <HI>Omni∣potent
power</HI> may have an object purely <HI>negative,</HI> or
including a totall negation of all things numerable,
though their number were potentially infinite, the
former reasons or the like cannot enforce us to de∣ny.
All things are said to be <HI>possible</HI> unto God,
because by his omnipotent power, he can make all
things not out of positive possibilities or Entities
possible, but of meere nothing, that is, without
any positive Entitie pre-existent, to serve either as
<HI>matter,</HI> agent, or instrument. What? shall we say
then, that things not possible onely, but impossible,
may be done or made by power Omnipotent? Or
may wee say that impossibilitie is eyther some∣thing,
or at least (as some have taught) a degree or
part of <HI>non esse,</HI> or of <HI>nothing?</HI> But how can that
which <HI>is not,</HI> have any degrees or parts? Or, admit
we might conceive things <HI>impossible</HI> or, <HI>impossibili∣ties</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="134"/>
to be degrees or parts of <HI>nothing,</HI> yet so concei∣ved,
wee must needs conceive them to have the
same <HI>negative</HI> conditions or properties, which are
attributed to <HI>non esse,</HI> to <HI>simple not being,</HI> or to <HI>no∣thing,</HI>
that is, they might be such <HI>objects</HI> of infinite
power, as <HI>non esse,</HI> or <HI>not being</HI> is. Yet he that made
all things that are, of nothing and can resolve them
into nothing againe, doth never attempt or profer
to resolve them into <HI>impossibilities,</HI> nor did hee
make any thing of <HI>impossibles.</HI> Whether then <HI>im∣possibilitie</HI> or <HI>impossibles</HI> be something or nothing,
how is it possible they should so resist the power
Omnipotent, which can doe all things, as that no∣thing
can be made of them? Lastly, if impossibi∣lities
can be no objects of Gods power, then things
<HI>possible</HI> or <HI>possibilities,</HI> must be the onely object of
it, and so we shall fall into the former circle, that
God can doe those things onely that are possible,
and those things onely are possible which God
can doe.</P>

<HI>possibilitie relative</HI> and <HI>absolute.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Certe non est per ectus &amp; pulcher mundus, nisi omne quod sit palehrū, sit aliqua <HI>bo∣nitas</HI> quae velit; &amp; omne quod scibil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, sit <HI>sapientia</HI> quae sciat; &amp; quod pos∣sibile, poten∣tia quae pos∣sit.

relative</HI> being the first draught or capacitie of all

<PB N="11" REF="134"/>
upon Omnipotencie: nothing is <HI>relatively</HI> possible,
but by reference to, or by denomination from this
Almighty power. Absolute possibilitie they con∣ceive
<HI>ad modum objecti,</HI> as it were an object that
doth terminate Omnipotent power, not <HI>positively</HI>
as colours do sight, but privatively as <HI>darknesse</HI> doth
sight; or as an empty sphere without which Om∣nipotencie
it selfe doth never worke. This absolute
<HI>possibilitie,</HI> or <HI>possibilitie meerly Logicall,</HI> which is
presupposed to <HI>relative</HI> possibilitie, as <HI>light</HI> or co∣lour
is to <HI>visibilitie,</HI> cannot otherwise be notified
or expressed than by this negative, <HI>of not implying
contradiction.</HI> But here the former difficultie con∣cerning
<HI>impossibilities</HI> meets with us in another
shape. For it will be againe demanded, whether
<HI>contradiction</HI> be any thing or nothing? or how it
should come to oppose Gods Almightie power,
more then eyther <HI>non esse,</HI> simple not being, or all
things that are possibly can doe? Can it bee lesse
then nothing? That is impossible; rather it is, if not
so much more, yet so much worse then nothing,
as that it cannot <HI>possibly</HI> beare the true <HI>forme</HI> or cha∣racter
of any thing; and for this reason can be no
object of power Omnipotent. Vnder that notion
which wee have of Omnipotencie or infinite Bee∣ing,
<HI>Truth it selfe,</HI> and <HI>Vnitie it selfe</HI> or <HI>Identitie,</HI>
are as essentially included, as <HI>Entitie</HI> or <HI>Being</HI> it
selfe. It is no impotency in God, but rather the
prerogative of his Omnipotencie, that he cannot
<HI>weaken</HI> his power by division, nor admit any mix∣ture
of imbecilitie, that he cannot deny or contra∣dict
himselfe. In that hee is infinitely <HI>true,</HI> or infi∣nite
<PB N="12" REF="135"/>
<HI>Truth</HI> it selfe, the ratification or approbation
of contradictions, is more incompatible with his
nature or Essence, than falshood is with truth, than
weaknesse with power, than malice with goodnes.
There is no falshood unlesse it include some de∣grees
or seeds of contradiction: as all <HI>Truth</HI> is the
offspring of unitie or <HI>Identitie.</HI> In conclusion, as
all things which are or possibly may be, can be no
more then <HI>participations</HI> of his <HI>Beeing,</HI> who is <HI>Bee∣ing
it selfe:</HI> so they must by an eternall Law, when∣soever
they begin to be, beare a true though an im∣perfect
resemblance of his <HI>unitie,</HI> of his <HI>Identitie,</HI> of
his <HI>veracitie,</HI> as well as of his power which is om∣nipotently
true, omnipotently just.</P>
<P>5 In answer to the last difficultie proposed, it
must be said that impossibilitie is neyther any posi∣tive
Entitie, nor is it any part or branch of <HI>non esse,</HI>
or of nothing. For in respect of him who is <HI>All,</HI>
more then all things, there can be no absolute <HI>non
esse. Hee calleth things that are not as if they were,</HI>
that is, hee can by his <HI>sole wrod</HI> make all things
which yet are not, which yet have not beene, to
have true being. Hee can make any thing of no∣thing.
That then which we call <HI>impossibilitie,</HI> must
not be derived from <HI>non esse,</HI> nor from falshood,
which is finally resolved into contradiction. So that
the rule of contradiction is the <HI>Test,</HI> by which im∣possibilities, as well as falshood must be discove∣red:
and it is more to bee impossible then to bee
false. From what fountaine then doth impossibi∣litie
spring? From absolute and Omnipotent pow∣er,
or from the infinitie of the Divine nature? But
<PB N="13" REF="135"/>
seeing in him all power and being is contained,
seeing the very possibilitie of limited being takes
its beginning from him, the possibilitie of weake∣ning
his power, the possibilitie of contradicting
or opposing himselfe, must by the eternall Law be
excluded from the object of Omnipotencie. As
we say, two negatives make an affirmative, so to be
unable to dis-enable it selfe, is no imperfection, no
impotencie; but the greatest perfection, the high∣est
degree of power wherof any nature is capable,
because the impossibilitie of dis-enabling or weak∣ning
himselfe is a positive branch of the preroga∣tive
of Omnipotencie. 2. It is not so true an argu∣ment
of power in men to be illimited by law, or
to be able to doe what they list, as to bee willing
to doe nothing, but that which is lawfull and just:
unlesse mans will be a law to his power, and good∣nesse
a law unto his will, how absolute and illimi∣ted
soever his power may bee in respect of other
men, or of any coactive law which they can make
to restraine it, it may quickly come to make an end
of it selfe. And the <HI>end</HI> or cessation of power ab∣solute
is the worst kind of limit that can be set un∣to
it.</P>
<P>The power of the Persian kings, was sometimes
so absolute and so illimited, that <HI>Cambyses</HI> having
no possitive law to curbe his will, fell in love with
his owne sister. And yet so naturall is the <HI>notion</HI>
of mans subjection unto some law, even unto men
of corrupt mindes, that this lawlesse King consulted
his Iudges, whether his desire to enjoy the love
of his sister, might be countenanced by law. The
<PB N="14" REF="136"/>
effect of these Sages answer, was, that they knew no
law in speciall, which might warrant the brother
to marry the sister, but they had found a transcen∣dent
law, by which the Kings of Persia might doe
what they list. By the like prerogative of this trans∣cendent
law; another King, upon her request did
delegate his absolute power unto his Queene for a
day. And she by delegation of this power, having
libertie to doe what she list, did use it to the destru∣ction
of him that gave it her: for shee cut off his
head, before she surrendred it. It is then a branch
of the Almighties prerogative, that his omnipo∣tent
power cannot for a moment be delegated or
bequeathed to any other; that as he can doe what∣soever
he will, so nothing can be done or willed by
him, which may derogate from the endlesse exer∣cise
of his infinite Majestie, power, truth, or
goodnesse.</P>
<P>The use of this doctrine concerning the prero∣gative
of Omnipotencie, and the absolute <HI>impossi∣bilitie</HI>
of doing any thing that may derogate from
it, is in generall this. As no opinion in the judge∣ment
of Philosophers can be convinced of absur∣dity,
untill it be resolved into a contradiction ei∣ther
unto it selfe, or unto some principle of nature
from which it pretends some Originall title of
<HI>Truth:</HI> so the only rule for the discovering impiety
of opinions in <HI>Divinitie,</HI> or for cōvincing their Au∣thors
of heresie or infidelitie, is by manifesting
their <HI>repugnancie</HI> or contradictiō to some one or o∣ther
divine Attribute, or to some special promise or
asseveration made by the Almightie in Scriptures,
<PB N="15" REF="136"/>
and whosoever denies or contradicts any part of
Gods word, doth contradict the divine truth or
veracitie which no man hath any temptation either
to deny or contradict, but from some doubt or de∣niall
of his Omnipotencie. Of such opinions as
either contradict this Article of Omnipotency, or
falsely pretend some colourable title of truth from
it, wee shall have occasion to speake in the particu∣lar
Articles, against which these Errors are concei∣ved,
or whose truth they prejudice. Having hi∣therto

not onely that hee made both, but that hee

to effect all things for us, for which wee have his

To this purpose the Nicene Creed expresseth this

many things to us invisible, cā prepare those things

<HI>were Canonicall writers, though their joynt au∣thoritie
be not infallible, yet the holy Ghost a tea∣er
most infallible, hath declared the reasons which
they used, to be most infallible by the testimonie of
two Canonical writers. The first is that of the Psal∣mist,
Psal. 96. 4, 5.</HI> The Lord is great &amp; greatly to be
praised: he is to be feared above all gods. For all the
gods of the Nations are Idols, or gods no-gods: but the
Lord made the heavens. <HI>The Prophet</HI> Ieremy <HI>is more
expresse and more peremptorie. chap. 10. vers. 10,
11, 12.</HI> But the Lord is the true God, he is the living
God and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth
shall tremble, and the Nations shall not bee able to
abide his indignation. Thus shall yee say unto them,
The gods that have not made the heavens, and the
earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from
under those heavens. Hee hath made the earth by his
power, he hath established the world by his wisdome,
and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</P>
<P>3. The consonancie between the live oracles of
God and the dictates of reason in heathen men, af∣ford
us this <HI>Aphorisme,</HI> that it is not <HI>nature</HI> her
selfe (which is never otherwise than negatively, or
at the most <HI>Privatively</HI> opposed to the goodnesse
of God) but the corruption of nature, which is al∣waies
contrarie to the good Spirit of God, where∣by
men are seduced unto Atheisme. And seeing
this corruption of nature whereof <HI>Atheisme</HI> is the
symptome, is the onely disease of the soule; the disease
<PB N="18" REF="138"/>
and the symptome cannot more kindly be cu∣red
then by reviving the strength of nature. The
receipt for reviving and strengthning nature must
be compounded of these two <HI>Truths,</HI> both evident
by light of reason not eclipsed by <HI>interposition</HI> of
corrupt affections or malignant habits, or freed
from these by illumination of the spirit. The first
truth is, <HI>that this visible world did not make it selfe,
but had a maker which gave it beginning and conti∣nuation
of being:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The two main prin∣ciples con∣tained in the Arti∣cle of Cre∣ation</NOTE> the <HI>second, that the making of this
visible world doth evince the maker of it to be Omni∣potent,</HI>
and able to effect whatsoever he hath pro∣mised.
But before the former truth can have its
operation upon the humane soule which is misaf∣fected;
the objections of the Atheists must bee re∣moved.
All his objections may be reduced to these
two, <HI>ex nihilo nihil fit;</HI> of nothing nothing can bee
made: whence seeing we acknowledge <HI>Creation,</HI>
either to be a making of all things of nothing, or
(at least) to suppose that some things are made of
meere nothing: the truth which we Christians in
this Article beleeve, may seeme directly to contra∣dict
a Philosophicall truth or principle in <HI>nature.</HI>
This first objection is seconded by another. To
create or to make something of nothing is to bee
active: or thus, <HI>Creation supposeth an agent, and eue∣ry
agent presupposeth a patient.</HI> Now if there were
any patient, or passive power praeexistēt to the Act
of creation, this passive power or patient wherein
it lodgeth was not created, but must have a beeing
from Eternitie. From the difficultie <HI>included</HI> in
this last objection, some philosophers did conceive
<PB N="19" REF="138"/>
an <HI>unfashioned</HI> or confused masse, coëuall to the
Eternitie of divine power, which they acknow∣ledged
to be the Artificer or framer of this great
worke, into that uniformitie or beautie of severall
formes which now it beares. The first objection
admits a double sense or doubtfull construction,
and hath no truth in respect of the Almightie ma∣ker,

objection universally taken, is false.</P>

it <HI>comproduced</HI> or <HI>concreated</HI> with them, but created
in them after they were made. God had gathered
the waters into one place, and the drie land into
another, before either of them had power to con∣ceive
or become the common mothers of vege∣table
and living things. Thus were the heaven, and
the earth first made, and the waters divided by
the firmament, whereas the earth did not become
the <HI>Matter</HI> or common <HI>mother</HI> of things vegeta∣ble,
before the third day,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Of this Argument see <HI>Erastus</HI> in the be∣ginning of his first Tome a∣gainst <HI>Pa∣racelsus.</HI></NOTE> wherein God said, <HI>Let the
earth bring forth grasse, the hearb yeelding seed, and
the fruit tree, yeelding fruit after his kind, whose seed
is in it selfe, upon the earth; and it was so. Gen. 1. 11.</HI>
Nor did the waters become the common <HI>Mat∣ter</HI>
or <HI>mother</HI> of fishes, before the fift day, <HI>Let the
waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature
that hath life, &amp;c.</HI> Now this production of hearbs
or plants out of the earth, of fish and fowle out of
the substance of the water, was not a meer <HI>conserva∣tion</HI>
or <HI>actuation</HI> of that power, which the earth &amp;
waters had before; but the Creation of a new po∣wer
in them, the continuation of which power, is
part of that, which we call the passive power of the
<HI>matter.</HI> Nor had the fishes or whales, which God
created, this passive power in themselves from
<PB N="22" REF="140"/>
their first creation, but received it from that bles∣sing
of God, <HI>ver. 22. Be fruitfull and multiply, and
fill the waters in the seas, and let fowle multiply in
the earth.</HI> Nor did the earth become the Common
<HI>mother</HI> of vegetables, as of hearbs, grasse, trees, &amp;c.
and of more perfect livings creatures, at the same
time. It received power to bring forth the one
upon the third day; not enabled to bring forth the
other, untill the fift day; God said, <HI>Let the earth
bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattell,
and creeping thing, and beast of the earth.</HI> So that
all these and man himselfe were not immediately
made of nothing, though immediately made by
God himselfe: for they were made by him of the
substance of the earth, which was visible &amp; praeex∣istent
to their making, though not made of it as of
the <HI>matter.</HI> But when it is said, in the first of <HI>Ge∣nesis,
[God in the beginning made the heaven and
earth,]</HI> it cannot be supposed or imported, that
he made them of any visible or invisible substance
praeexistent: and if hee made them or their com∣mon
<HI>masse</HI> of no substance praeexistent, here
was something made of nothing: but how of
nothing? or what doth this particle import? not
that <HI>nothing</HI> should remaine as an ingredient
in the first masse, or as if it had the like prece∣dency
to it, as the earth had to living things: the Al∣mightie
did not so turne nothing into something,
as our Sauiour did water into wine. To say any
thing could be made of <HI>nothing</HI> in this sense, or ac∣cording
to the former importances of the particle
<HI>of,</HI> doth indeed imply an evident contradiction; for
<PB N="23" REF="140"/>
so nothing should be something, and simple <HI>not
beeing</HI> should haue a true being. To make nothing
to be something, fals not within the object of pow∣er
Omnipotent; it can be no part of the Almightie
makers worke. As <HI>Cyphers</HI> cannot bee multiplied
into numbers, by any skill in <HI>Arithmetique,</HI> though
supposed infinite; so neither can <HI>nothing</HI> be conver∣ted
into <HI>something,</HI> nor become an ingredient in bo∣dies
created by any power, though infinite. As the
Omnipotent Creator is one vnitie it selfe, so euery
thing which he makes must have its unitie or Iden∣titie,
it cannot consist of contradictories.</P>
<P>2. When then it is said, that all things were
made of nothing, or that creation supposeth some
things to be immediately made of <HI>nothing,</HI> this
particle <HI>of</HI> can onely import <HI>terminum a quo,</HI> the
terme onely of the Action, not any <HI>matter</HI> or <HI>sub∣ject:</HI>
and yet the tearme thus imported, can bee
no positive Entitie, but a meere negation of any
positive Entitie precedent. To make the heauens
and earth of nothing, is in <HI>reall value</HI> no more, then
to make them not of any <HI>matter</HI> or <HI>Entitie</HI> praeex∣istent,
whether <HI>visible</HI> or <HI>invisible,</HI> on which their
Maker did exercise his <HI>efficient power</HI> or <HI>efficacie;</HI>
but to give them such beeing, as they then first
began to have, that is, a corporeall beeing or ex∣istence,
by the meere efficacie or vertue of his <HI>word.</HI>
As, suppose the Sunne should in a moment be suf∣fered
to transmit his light into a close vault of
stone; we might truely say, this heavenly bodie,
did make light of darknesse <HI>tanquam ex termino,</HI> in
that it made light to be there, where was no light
<PB N="24" REF="141"/>
at all before, but meere darkenesse. And thus to
make light out of darknesse, doth no way argue,
that it turned darknesse into light, or that <HI>darknesse</HI>
did remaine as an ingredient in the <HI>light</HI> made.
After this manner, did the Amightie make the
heaven and earth of nothing, that is, he made the
<HI>corporeall</HI> masse or <HI>substance,</HI> out of which all things
visible were made, where no limited substance,
whether visible or invisible, was before; and by the
same <HI>efficiencie,</HI> by which this masse was made, he
made <HI>place</HI> or <HI>spatiousnesse quantitative,</HI> which had
no beeing at all before; he did not turne <HI>indivisibi∣litie</HI>
into <HI>spatiousnes,</HI> or meere <HI>vacuitie</HI> into <HI>fulnes:
fulnes</HI> and <HI>spatiousnesse</HI> were the <HI>resultance</HI> of that
masse which was first made, without any Entitie or
ingredient praeexistent. To make something of
nothing in this sense, implies no contradiction;
there is no impossibilitie, that the heaven and
earth should be thus made, but this will not suffice
to refute the Atheist or infidell. For many things
are possible which are not probable, and many
things probable which are not necessary. The next
question then is, what necessitie there is in the infal∣lible
rules of nature and reason, that the Heavens
&amp; the earth, should be made of nothing. Against the
probabilitie onely of <HI>Moses</HI> his historie of the first
creation, the Atheist will yet oppose this generall
induction, <HI>That all bodily substances that begin to be</HI>
what before they were not, that all things <HI>which
we see made,</HI> are alwayes made by some <HI>efficient</HI>
cause, not out of meere nothing, <HI>but of some imper∣fect
being praexistent.</HI> To examine then the general
<PB N="25" REF="141"/>
rule pretended to <HI>amount</HI> from this generall indu∣ction,
s or what truth there is in that philosophicall
<HI>maxime, ex nihilo nihil fit,</HI> is the next point.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. 5.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">By what manner of induction or enumeration of
particulars, universall rules or Maximes must bee
framed and supported. That no induction can bee
brought to proove the Naturalists Maxime, Of
nothing, nothing can be made.</HEAD>
<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O frame a generall rule or principle
in any <HI>facultie, Art,</HI> or <HI>science,</HI> there is
no other meanes possible besides in∣duction,
or a sufficient enumerati∣on
of particular experiments to sup∣port
it. The particulars, from which this suffici∣encie
must amount, may be in some subjects fewer,
in others more. How many soeuer the particular
instances or alleaged experiments be; the number
of thē will not suffice to support an universall rule,
unlesse they <HI>erect</HI> our understandings to a cleare
view of the same reason, not onely in all the parti∣culars
instanced in, but in all that can be brought
of the same kind. Vnlesse there bee a cleare <HI>resul∣tance</HI>
of the same reason in all, the induction failes,
and the rule which is grounded on it, must needes
fall. For this cause, universall rules are easily fra∣med
in the Mathematiques, or in other Arts,
whose subjects are more abstract, or not charged
with multiplicitie of considerations or <HI>ingredients;</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="142"/>
from whose least variation, whether by addition
or subtraction, whether by further commixture
or dissolution, the cause or reason of truth so va∣ries,
that the rule which constantly holds in a great
many like particulars, will not hold in all, because
they are not absolutely or every way alike.</P>
<P>Hee which seriously observes the manner, how
<HI>right angles</HI> are framed will without difficultie
yeeld his assent unto this universall rule, <HI>That all
right angles are equall,</HI> because hee sees there is one
and the same reason of absolute equalitie in <HI>al</HI> that
can be imagined. And this negative rule, will, by
the same <HI>inspection,</HI> win our assent without more
adoe, that if any two angles be unequall, the one
of them (at least) can be no right angle. The consi∣deration
likewise of a few particulars, will suffice
to make up these universall never-failing rules.</P>
<P>1. First, that the greater any circle is, the grea∣ter
alwayes will the angle of the semicircle be.</P>
<P>2. The second, that the angle of the least semi∣circle
which can be imagined, is greater then the
most capacious <HI>acute-angle</HI> that can be made by
the concurrence of two right lines. And yet it will
as clearly appeare from the inspection of the same
particulars, from which the former rules do a∣mount,
that the <HI>angle</HI> of the greatest <HI>semicircle</HI> ima∣ginable,
cannot possibly be so capacious, as every
right <HI>angle</HI> is. The consideration of the former
rules, specially of the first and third, will clearly
manifest, that the quantitie contained in these an∣gles,
how little soever they be, is <HI>divisible</HI> into in∣finite
indeterminate parts, or <HI>divisible</HI> into such
<PB N="27" REF="142"/>
parts, without possible end or limitation of <HI>divi∣sion.</HI>
But albeit the difference of quantitie between
a right angle and the angle of a semicircle, bee <HI>po∣tentially
infinite,</HI> or infinitely <HI>divisible,</HI> according
to parts or portions in determinate; yet will it not
hence follow, that the one <HI>angle</HI> is as great againe
as the <HI>other,</HI> according to the <HI>scale</HI> of any distinct
or determinate quantitie, or <HI>expressible</HI> portions.
And this observation in Mathematicall quantitie,
would quickly checke or discover the weaknesse
of many <HI>calculatory Arguments</HI> or inductions oft∣times
used by great Divines in matters morall or
civill. As for example, that every <HI>sinne</HI> deserveth
punishment <HI>infinite,</HI> because every sinne is an of∣fence
committed against an <HI>infinite</HI> Being or Ma∣jestie.
And the greater, or more soveraigne the
Majestie is, which wee offend; the greater alwayes
will the offence be, and meritorious of greater pu∣nishment.
Yet all this onely proves, an infinitie
of <HI>indeterminate degrees</HI> in every offence against
the divine Majestie, by which it exceedes all offen∣ces
of the same kinde committed onely against
man: it no way inferres an <HI>infinite</HI> excesse or ods
of <HI>actuall</HI> determinate punishment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the first part of the Divine Essence &amp; Attributes, chap. 20. pag. 219. 220.</NOTE> or ill deserts.
For this reason, wee have derived the just <HI>award</HI>
of everlasting supernaturall paines, unto tempora∣rie
and transeunt (bodily or naturall) pleasures,
from the contempt of Gods infinite goodnesse,
which destinates no creatures unto everlasting
death, but such as he had made capable of everlast∣ing
joyes; nor were any of them infallibly destina∣ted
unto everlasting death, untill they had by vo∣luntary
<PB N="28" REF="143"/>
transgression, or continuance in despising
of the riches of his goodnesse, made themselves un∣capable
of the blisse to which hee had destinated
them.</P>
<P>2 But to returne unto the force or efficacie of
induction: that (wee say) is neyther so cleare, nor
so facile in matters physicall or morall, as it is in
the Mathematiques. Now, the reason, why <HI>per∣fect</HI>
inductions are so difficultly made, in matters
naturall, is, because the <HI>subject</HI> of naturall <HI>Philoso∣phy</HI>
is not so <HI>simple</HI> or <HI>uncompounded,</HI> as Mathema∣ticall
bodies or figures are: and yet are naturall bo∣dies
subject to greater <HI>varietie</HI> of <HI>circumstances,</HI>
more obnoxious to alteration by occurrences ex∣ternall,
then abstract lines, or <HI>motionlesse</HI> figures,
or bodies are. The cunningest Alchymist (albeit
hee could exactly temper his furnace to all the se∣verall
degrees of heate, that any fewell, of what
kinde soever, could afford) cannot by any fire, or
by any degree of <HI>heate,</HI> which issues from it, hatch
the most imperfect bird that flyes: yet if he should
hence inferre, that no birds could bee hatched by
any kinde of heate, daily experience would con∣vince
his assertion of falshood, and his induction,
although it consisted of ten thousand instances or
experiments taken from the heate of the forge, or
furnace, to be altogether lame. A man mighty try
the like conclusion of hatching birds, in all the
sands, that this Iland affords, upon the <HI>eggs</HI> of all
the <HI>fowles</HI> that breed in it, or about it, and finde
their <HI>barrennesse</HI> and unaptnesse for bringing forth
any flying Creature, to bee as great, as it is for
<PB N="29" REF="143"/>
bringing forth wheate or other corne. And I am
perswaded the <HI>compost</HI> of this our soyle is an unapt
to bring forth the former effects, as our <HI>sands</HI> are.
Yet if any man should hence make this generall in∣duction,
that no <HI>sand</HI> or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Ma∣crobius</HI> in his relati∣on of <HI>Au∣gustus</HI> his Apoph∣thegmes.</NOTE> <HI>compost</HI> could performe
this <HI>midwifery</HI> to the conception of any <HI>fowles;</HI>
his errour might bee confuted by the Ostriches,
which have beene hatched in the sands of <HI>Arabia;</HI>
and by some <HI>compost</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which performes
that office unto young chickens, which <HI>brood-hens</HI>
doe with us. No man in his time, or since he died,
hath beene either more accurate or more industri∣ous
in observing the externall causes of sicknesse
and health, then <HI>Hippocrates</HI> was. And, no questi∣on,
but he was as carefull to take his observations
or frame his generall rules, from multitude of ex∣periences,
as any Philosopher or <HI>Physitian</HI> hath
beene. Notwithstanding<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide Sep∣talium in Hippoc. de aere, aquis &amp; locis.</NOTE> his observation concer∣ning
the nature and qualities of winds, and the <HI>de∣pendence</HI>
of mens health or sicknesse upon them, are
farther out of date in <HI>France,</HI> then an Almanacke
made the last yeare for the meridian of <HI>London,</HI>
would be this yeare for the meridian of <HI>Mexico.</HI>
The same winds, which in his Countrey, or in
Countries wherein hee made his observations,
were most healthfull; are most noysome in some
parts of <HI>France.</HI> The diversitie of the <HI>soile,</HI> whence
windes in severall regions arise or passe through,
makes one and the same winde (in respect of the
point or quarter of heaven from whence it
comes,) to produce quite contrary effects in seve∣rall
religions, or situations. The East wind may, in
<PB N="30" REF="144"/>
some regions, dispose mens bodies to the <HI>Iaun∣dice,</HI>
and yet purifie mens blood in other places
not farre distant for latitude. So may the South-wind,
in some regions, taint mens bodies with
consumptions, <HI>coughs,</HI> or other infirmities, and
yet bee healthfull, in other regions not much
distant for longitude.</P>
<P>Let then the meere Naturalist tyre himselfe,
and his Reader, by long inductions, or with mul∣titude
of experiments in agents &amp; subjects natural,
for supporting his generall rule, <HI>ex nihilo nihil fit,
[Every thing is made of something]</HI> yet his obser∣vation,
will reach no farther then to Agents or
<HI>efficients, visible,</HI> or <HI>limited.</HI> Albeit his experi∣ments
in this kind were infinite; this inference ne∣verthelesse
[No visible agent can make any thing
of nothing, therefore nothing can bee made of no∣thing
by an invisible or supernaturall Agent]
would be more disjoynted then this following; <HI>No
heate</HI> of fire <HI>or of the Sunne in what degree</HI> soever,
can hatch liue-creatures, <HI>ergo</HI> the heate of the <HI>Dam</HI>
cannot hatch her young ones. The difference be∣tweene
visible agents, may be much greater, then
the difference betweene the heate or warmth of
divers bodies. No earthly bodies can produce
heate in others, but either by heate inherent in
themselves or by motion, yet this will not con∣clude,
that no celestiall bodie (the Sunne for exam∣ple)
can produce heat in bodies sublunary, unlesse
it selfe be inherently hot, or at least not without
motion. It is more then probable, that the Sunne
is not <HI>formally</HI> or inherently <HI>hot,</HI> and yet although
<PB N="31" REF="144"/>
it should stand still, (as once it did) in its sphere
above our horizon, it would heat and warme us no
lesse then now it doth, whilst it moueth. For cōclu∣sion;
to make any perfect inductiō sufficient to sup∣port
an vniversall rule, from earthly bodies, which
shall conclude bodies Coelestiall, or from agents
sublunarie or uisible, which shall as uniformely
hold true in an agent invisible and supercoelestiall,
is more difficult then to twist ropes of loose sand.
That which the Naturalist should proove, if hee
would bee an Atheist or infidell in graine, or op∣pose
the truth of Scriptures with probabilitie,
is, that there is no invisible or spirituall Agent.
And this is the point whereat the second obje∣ction
aymes: there can be no agent without a pa∣tient,
no exercise of Art, or power, without some
<HI>matter</HI> or <HI>subject</HI> to worke upon.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. 6.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The second objection of the Naturalist: [Every agent
praesupposeth a patient or passiue subject to
worke upon] cannot bee proved by any induction.
The contradictorie to this Maxime proved by suf∣ficient
induction.</HEAD>
<P>1 <HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Ctus agentium sunt in patiente bene
disposito.</HI> The efficacie of every A∣gent
(saith the Philosopher) is in the
patient fitly disposed to receive it.
And else-where hee determines it as
a positive truth, that every action is in the <HI>patient,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="145"/>
not in the Agent. And this his position, may bee
ratified by perfect induction or experiments in∣pregnable:
for every action is an operation, and
every operation is so necessarily annexed vnto the
<HI>effect</HI> produced, that where the one is, the other
needes must be; and every effect is in the patient, or
at least is the patient. The softning of waxe, the
hardning of clay, the <HI>revivall</HI> of vegetables of se∣verall
kindes, are all actions proceeding from one
and the same actuall force, or unvariable influence
of the Sunne. The reason, why the active force is
but one and the same, and why the <HI>actions</HI> or <HI>ope∣rations</HI>
are many and much different, is, because
the active force, is in the Agent, whereas the <HI>acti∣on</HI>
or operation is in the <HI>patient,</HI> and is diversly
multiplied according to the diversitie and multi∣tude
of the <HI>patients.</HI> We shall not need to question
the universall truth of the former <HI>Maxime, That
every action is in the patient,</HI> as some have done.
For it holds as true in Divinitie as in Philosophy,
&amp; most apparent in the subject whereof we treate.
Creation it selfe is an <HI>action,</HI> a reall <HI>action,</HI> yet not
<HI>really</HI> in the Creator, but in the Creature onely.
For no reall <HI>attribute,</HI> can be in the Creator, which
was not in him from Eternitie; the Creature one∣ly
gets beginning of Being by Creation, which be∣fore
it had not. If then there can bee no agencie
without an action, and every action be in the pati∣ent,
the cause is concluded, that every agent
though Omnipotent supposeth a patient.</P>
<P>2. But it is one thing to suppose or require, ano∣ther
to praesuppose or praerequire <HI>patiēt;</HI> one thing
<PB N="33" REF="145"/>
to require or suppose a patient, another to require
or suppose a <HI>matter</HI> or subject to worke upon. We
are then to distinguish of Patients, and betwixt the
workes wrought or effected by agents. A Patient
is usually taken for the <HI>matter</HI> or subject on which
the Agent doth exercise his active force, or out of
which it produceth its worke. Euery finite <HI>a∣gent,</HI>
aswell naturall as artificiall doth praere∣quire
and presuppose such a kind of <HI>patient,</HI> that is,
some reall <HI>matter</HI> or subject, whereon to worke.
But this kind of <HI>patient</HI> is no just compere, no full
<HI>correlative</HI> to an agent universally taken. The rela∣latiō
betwixt an agent &amp; <HI>Patient</HI> taken in this sense,
is neither so <HI>formall</HI> or necessary, as it is (inter agens
&amp; actum) <HI>betweene the Agent, and that which is
acted,</HI> betweene the efficient and the <HI>effect,</HI> or be∣tweene
the <HI>worker</HI> and his worke. God wee grant
could be no <HI>actuall agent,</HI> much lesse an Omnipo∣tent
actuall agent, without some Act or worke pro∣duced
by him. As there could bee no <HI>Creature</HI>
without a <HI>Creator,</HI> so could there bee no <HI>Creator</HI>
without a <HI>Creature.</HI> But that which the <HI>Naturalist</HI>
is to prove, is, that the worke of Creation pre∣supposeth
some <HI>matter</HI> or subject for the Creator
to worke upon. To manifest the impperfection
of his inductions to this purpose, and to cleare our
contradictorie assertion, wee are to distinguish or
explicate the severall workes, which are or can be
wrought.</P>
<P>3. Three sorts of workes the meere Naturalist
grants. <HI>1. Meerely naturall. 2. Meerely artificiall.
3. Partly naturall, partly artificiall.</HI> Workes of
<PB N="34" REF="146"/>
the last ranke, (for instance) are <HI>Physicall</HI> medi∣cines,
or all such workes as Nature of her owne
accord, doth not attempt or undertake, but onely
as shee is set a working by Art. Natu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e makes no
physicall <HI>doses,</HI> but onely affords the simples, of
which they are compounded by the Apothecarie:
who notwithstanding cannot compound them
without the ministery or operation of <HI>Nature.</HI> The
Physitian may allot the severall quantitie of every
ingredient, besides the proportion betwixt them;
but the mixture must be immediately effected by
<HI>heate,</HI> or other naturall qualities. So likewise must
the <HI>extraction</HI> or <HI>expression</HI> of many simples bee
wrought by Nature, but at the appointment or
direction of the Physitian. Nature doth not at∣tempt
the making of Bell-metall, much lesse of
Bells; and yet she affords all the ingredients to the
Bell-founder, who cannot mixe them by any <HI>art,</HI>
or skill, without the <HI>heate</HI> of the fire, or other ope∣rations
of <HI>Nature,</HI> set on worke or directed by him.
Workes meerly <HI>naturall</HI> comprehend all sorts of
bodies generable, whether the elements, or bodies
mixt. The generation of every such body presup∣poseth
a mutation or alteration of qualities in the
matter, before it become capable of a new <HI>forme</HI>
or <HI>nature.</HI> Every alteration of qualitie wrought in
any sublunary body (whether it be a praeviall dis∣position
or introduction to a new <HI>forme</HI> or <HI>nature;</HI>
or whether it be accomplished without generation
of any new substance) is the proper effect or worke
of the agent, which causeth it. So is every artifici∣all
<HI>worke</HI> or <HI>forme,</HI> the effect or worke of the Arti∣ficer.
<PB N="35" REF="146"/>
So that Art hath its proper effects as well as
Nature, and every artificiall <HI>effect</HI> or <HI>worke</HI> suppo∣seth
an <HI>efficiencie</HI> or agencie in the Art or Artist:
yet doth not the exercise of this active force or ef∣ficiencie,
eyther presuppose or require any such
passive alteration of quality in the matter or <HI>subject,</HI>
whereon it workes, as <HI>Nature</HI> requires in her <HI>pa∣tients.</HI>
Every <HI>Statue</HI> or Image of <HI>wood,</HI> is the ef∣fect
of the Statuarie, or a worke of the <HI>Art</HI> of Ima∣gery;
yet doe not these workes, being meerly ar∣tificiall,
eyther suppose, or necessarily require any
<HI>alteration</HI> of <HI>qualitie</HI> in stone and wood. The Sta∣tuary
produceth no naturall <HI>effect</HI> or <HI>qualitie,</HI> which
was not in the stone <HI>before,</HI> but onely makes that
<HI>visible</HI> and apparant to the eye, which was former∣ly
hidden or enveyled in the stone. Every <HI>Letter</HI> of
the Decalogue was in the Tables of stone, before
they were <HI>ingraven,</HI> eyther by the finger of God
or by <HI>Moses,</HI> and became legible onely by their
Art or skill of ingraving; yet not made legible by
any <HI>addition</HI> of <HI>substance,</HI> of <HI>quantitie,</HI> or <HI>qualitie,</HI>
but by meere <HI>abscision</HI> of quantitative parts. And
this abscision, from which visible <HI>characters,</HI> or <HI>ter∣minate</HI>
figures <HI>result,</HI> whether in wood or stone, is
the proper <HI>effect</HI> of the Carver or Ingraver. Both
these inductions following, universally taken, are
false, (though both true in their proper subject:)
[1. No Statuary, or Carver, or other like Artifi∣cer
can produce his proper worke, without some
abscision or variation of quantitie in the subject,
whereon hee workes: therefore Nature cannot
produce her proper effects, without some altera∣tion
<PB N="36" REF="147"/>
of quantitie in the <HI>matter</HI> or subject wherein
shee workes. 2. Naturall agents or efficients ne∣ver
produce their proper effects, but by working
some alteration or qualitie in the Matter: there∣fore
no Artificer can produce the proper workes
of his Art, without the like alteration of qualitie
in the <HI>subject</HI> whereon hee workes.] Nor will it
follow, that because effects meerly artificiall may
be wrought without any alteration of qualitie,
therefore mixt <HI>effects,</HI> or workes partly <HI>naturall,</HI>
partly <HI>artificiall,</HI> as compounded Medicines or
Bell-metall, can be so wrought. Least of all can
it be inferred, that because <HI>Art</HI> as well as <HI>Nature</HI>
supposeth a subject praeexistent whereon to worke;
therefore the <HI>Agent supernaturall,</HI> or the <HI>Efficient
superartificiall,</HI> alwayes presupposeth some matter
or subject praeexistent, out of which, or in which
hee produceth his proper worke. The reason why
the <HI>former</HI> Inductions faile, is because the <HI>Agents</HI>
or <HI>Efficients</HI> are of a different <HI>ranke</HI> or <HI>kinde.</HI> And
the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide Arist lib. 1. Poster. Analyt. cap.</NOTE> <HI>prohibition</HI> holds as true in point of <HI>induction</HI>
as of <HI>demonstration, Non licet transcendere a genere
ad genus.</HI> Hee that will demonstrate any conclu∣sion,
must not rove from one kinde of subject to
another. And the reason why in thus <HI>roving</HI> he
shall certainly faile of his intended conclusion, is,
because the principles whence the intended con∣clusion
must be inferred, cannot be gathered but
by induction, and no <HI>induction</HI> can prove any ge∣nerall
<HI>Maxime,</HI> unlesse <HI>it consist</HI> of <HI>particulars</HI> of
the same kinde. A philosophicall <HI>maxime</HI> can∣not
be gathered from <HI>Inductions</HI> meerly Mathe∣maticall,
<PB N="37" REF="147"/>
nor mathematicall principles from ex∣periments
philosophicall. Nor can Artificiall
<HI>Maximes</HI> or conclusions (especially negative) bee
gathered from experiments naturall, nor <HI>Maximes</HI>
naturall from observations in subjects meerely <HI>Ar∣tificiall.</HI>
Least of all can any theologicall maximes,
be ratified from experiments meerely naturall, ar∣tificiall,
or mathematicall; but onely by inducti∣ons,
or reasons abstract and metaphysicall, that is,
such as hold true in all Arts or sciences whatsoe∣ver.
The onely certaine rule, which all the former
inductions can afford, is this: There can bee no
reall <HI>effect,</HI> whether artificiall, naturall, or superna∣turall,
without an efficient: Nothing which now
is not, or sometimes was not, could possibly bee
made without some <HI>agent</HI> or maker: betweene
every naturall Agent and its patient, betweene eve∣ry
Artificer and his worke, there alwayes results a
mutuall <HI>relation</HI> of efficient and <HI>effect.</HI> But this rule
will not abide the turning: Betweene every effici∣ent
and its proper <HI>effect,</HI> there alwayes results a
mutuall relation of <HI>agent</HI> and <HI>patient;</HI> if by this
terme <HI>patient</HI> wee understand a <HI>matter</HI> or <HI>subject</HI>
praeexistent to the exercise of the agents effici∣encie.</P>
<P>4 The usuall division of Agents into artificiall,
naturall, and supernaturall, supposeth a three-fold
diversitie in their objects, betwixt which there is
this proportion, As <HI>nature</HI> alwayes affordeth <HI>art</HI>
a compleat naturall subject to worke upon: so the
<HI>supernaturall</HI> agent, or supreme <HI>efficient,</HI> exhibits
that imperfect substance or matter unto <HI>nature,</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="148"/>
which shee brings unto perfection. Nature doth
so unto Art, as it is done to <HI>her</HI> by a <HI>benefactor su∣pernaturall.</HI>
Vnto this observation upon the for∣mer
division, wee can adde no more, nor can any
more be required, besides a just proofe that there
is an agent supernaturall, which sometimes had <HI>no
matter</HI> at all to worke upon, but made even Nature
her selfe, and the passive <HI>capacitie</HI> or <HI>subject</HI> where∣on
shee workes, of no worke or <HI>matter</HI> praeexistent.
The matter it selfe, and nature it selfe, are the im∣mediate
<HI>effects</HI> of his active force or <HI>efficiencie.</HI>
Now to beate the Naturalist at his owne weapon,
wee are to make proofe of this assertion by full in∣duction,
and strength of reason grounded upon ex∣periments
in every subject wherein the Naturalist
can instance. First, it is universally true of all the
workes as well of Nature, as of Art, which now
are perfect, and sometimes were not so, that they
did not make themselves, but had (respectively)
their severall makers or efficient causes, which
brought them unto that perfect estate and condi∣tion
which now they have. The most perfect works
of nature cannot put themselves into a <HI>perfect</HI> arti∣ficiall
forme, without the help of some Artificer.
Stones doe not naturally grow into <HI>Statues,</HI> nor
trees into the <HI>pictures</HI> or Images of men or birds:
Brasse and Copper, with other metalls conceived
in the bowells of the earth, doe not either by them∣selves,
or by the help of <HI>naturall</HI> causes which pro∣duce
them, cast or mould themselves into <HI>Guns</HI> or
<HI>Bullets.</HI> The Earth and Water doe not worke them∣selves
into the live-substance of plants or vegeta∣bles,
<PB N="39" REF="148"/>
but are first wrought, and (as it were) kneaded
together by the heate of the Sunne; first altered, &amp;
then incorporated into the substance of such trees,
by the vegetative faculty, which is actually resident
and praeexistent in the trees or plants, which are
nourished by them. There is no sublunarie sub∣stance
which did not take beginning, either entire∣ly
and together, or <HI>piece-meale</HI> and successively.
The elementall bodies of the ayre and water, were
not totally the same a thousand yeares agoe, that
now they are: both continue the same they were by
equivalencie of succeeding parts, or daily addition
by new generation. Now successive generation
supposeth an end or destruction of that that was, &amp;
a beginning of that which succeedes in its place;
and the beginning of every thing, supposeth a be∣ginner
or cause efficient, to give it being. The <HI>race</HI>
or continuation of more perfect sublunary sub∣stances,
as of vegetables and moving creatures, re∣maines
the same, not by equivalency of succeeding
parts, but by a totall production of distinct indivi∣dualls.
And every distinct individuall tree or liuing
creature, hath its immediate and proper efficient,
as well as its materiall cause, nothing can give it
selfe a distinct numericall being.</P>
<P>5 What is the reason then, why the workes of
nature, which are perfected in their kinde by their
proper efficients (as trees come to full growth)
cannot transforme themselves into bodies artifici∣all
without the worke of the Artificer? What is the
reason why the imperfect <HI>masse,</HI> wherein the seeds
of nature are contained, cannot grow up into a
<PB N="40" REF="149"/>
perfect or compleate body naturall, without the
<HI>efficiencie</HI> of some other in the same kinde already
compleate? <HI>Fortes creantur fortibus. Nature</HI> makes
nothing perfect, but by the help of some Agent
formerly made <HI>perfect:</HI> Doth the <HI>perfection</HI> of bo∣dies
artificiall by an <HI>indispensable</HI> Law of necessitie,
require a perfect worke of nature praeexistent to
the operation of Art: and doth this perfect worke
of nature, bee it brasse, wood, or stone, by a like
indispensable Law of necessitie, require an imper∣fect
masse or <HI>matter</HI> praeexistent to the naturall <HI>A∣gents</HI>
or efficients, which mould or kneade it into
its perfect or specificall <HI>forme?</HI> And shall not this
imperfect masse, with all its severall <HI>Elements</HI> or <HI>in∣gredients</HI>
that can be required to the perfection of
any naturall body, more necessarily require some
precedent <HI>efficient</HI> cause of its imperfect <HI>being</HI> or
<HI>existence?</HI> This cannot be conceived; for if these
imperfect substances, whereof any naturall body is
made, could eyther give beginning of being to
themselves, or have it from no cause efficient,
they should bee in this respect much more per∣fect,
than the more perfect workes of nature, in
that they eyther make themselves, or have no
maker.</P>
<P>Vpon this principle of nature, or from this <HI>impos∣sibilitie</HI>
in nature [That any visible work whether
naturall or artificiall, should either give it selfe be∣ing
or have its being from no cause precedent] did
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Tully Lib. de na∣tura Deo∣rum.</NOTE><HI>Tully</HI> rightly argue, that as a man comming into
an house, wherein were no live creatures saue Rats
and Mice, could not conceive that either the house
<PB N="41" REF="149"/>
did make it selfe, or had no other maker besides
these Rats and Mice, which were found in it: So
neither can it be imagined, that this visible spheare
wherein the workes of Art and Nature, are daily
seene, and doe daily begin to be and expire; could
either make it selfe, or have <HI>beeing</HI> of it selfe,
without beginning, without a Maker super-arti∣ficiall,
or an efficient supernaturall. Every part of
this Vniverse considered alone, is a worke of na∣ture,
but the exquisite harmony betweene them,
is a worke more then Artificiall. All that <HI>nature</HI>
can adde to <HI>art,</HI> or art to <HI>nature,</HI> is but a shadow
of that great Artificers skill, which composed
the severall workes of nature into so excellent a
forme, and tuneth their discording qualities, in∣to
such exact harmony. The induction of <HI>Tully</HI>
is more briefly, but more pithily and expressely
gathered by our Apostle Heb. 3. ver. 4. <HI>Euery house
is builded by some man, but hee that built all things
is God.</HI> But if every house bee built by some man,
how is God said to build all things? shall every
builder of an house be a God? No: but whatso∣ever
man doth build, God doth likewise build.
<HI>For except the Lord doth build the house, they labour
in vaine, that are builders of it.</HI> Psalm. 127. 1. Better
it were to bee idle or to doe nothing, then either
to be laborious in building houses, or watchfull in
guarding Cities strongly built, unlesse the Lord
doe afford not onely his <HI>concurrence,</HI> but his <HI>blessing</HI>
to the labours of the one, and to the <HI>watchfulnesse</HI>
of the other. But in this argument wee may expa∣tiate
without impeachment of digression from the
<PB N="42" REF="150"/>
matter, or of diversion from our ayme, in the fol∣lowing
Treatise of <HI>divine providence.</HI></P>
<P>6. This present Treatise requires an inducti∣on,
sufficient to prove that every visible or subluna∣rie
substance, aswell the <HI>common matter</HI> whereof
all such things are made, as the severall <HI>formes,</HI>
which are produced out of it, have an <HI>efficient</HI>
cause precedent to their <HI>making</HI> or <HI>production.</HI> For
the seuerall formes, or bodies generable which
are constituted by them, the induction is as cleare
to every mans sense or understanding, as any ma∣thematicall
induction can bee. The naturalist is
neither able nor disposed to except against the uni∣versalitie
of it, or to instance in any sublunarie bo∣die,
which hath not a true <HI>efficient</HI> cause, or an
<HI>agent</HI> precedent; from whose efficacie its physicall
or essentiall <HI>forme,</HI> was either made, or did result.
The question onely remaines about the <HI>efficien∣cie</HI>
or <HI>production</HI> of the <HI>prime</HI> or common <HI>matter.</HI>
Seeing it is the <HI>mother</HI> of generation, wee will not
vexe the Naturalist by demanding a <HI>generative</HI>
cause <HI>efficient</HI> of its beeing, but that it must have
some cause <HI>efficient,</HI> wee shall enforce him to grant
from a generall Maxime most in request with men
of his profession. The Maxime is [That the phi∣losophicall
progresse from effects to their causes,
or from inferiour to superiour causes, is not like
Arithmeticall or geometricall progressions; it can∣not
bee infinite.] Wee must at length come to
one supreme cause <HI>efficient,</HI> which in that it is su∣preame,
is a cause of causes, but no effect, and being
no effect, nor cause subordinate to any other A∣gent,
<PB N="43" REF="150"/>
it can have no limit of Beeing, it can admit
no restraint in working. Whatsoever we can con∣ceive
as possible to have limited Beeing, or begin∣ning
of such Beeing, must haue both frō it &amp; by it.
Now if the perfect workes of nature, bodies sub∣lunarie
of what kind soever, suppose a <HI>possibilitie</HI>
physicall included in the prime and common
matter, before they have actuall Being; if it imply
no contradiction for them to have <HI>beginning</HI> of
<HI>Beeing,</HI> it will imply no contradiction, that the
prime <HI>mater</HI> it selfe or imperfect <HI>masse,</HI> whereof
they are made, should have a beginning of its im∣perfect
<HI>beeing;</HI> That Physicall beeing which it hath,
doth presuppose a logicall <HI>possibilitie</HI> of beeing, as it
is; that is, no contradiction, for it sometimes to be,
and sometimes not to haue beene. This supreame
cause or agent which (as we suppose,) did reduce
the logicall <HI>possibilitie</HI> of the prime matter of sub∣lunary
bodies into Act, cannot be the heavens, or a∣ny
part of the hoast of heavē, neither the sun, moon
nor stars. For, albeit the Sun be the efficient cause,
by which most workes of nature in this sublunarie
part of the world, are brought to perfection: yet
is it no cause at all of that imperfect masse or part
of nature, on which it workes. Vnlesse it had
some matter to worke upon, it could produce no
reall or solid effect by its influence, light or moti∣on,
how ever assisted with the influence of other
stars or planets. Yet must this prime matter, have
some cause; otherwise it should be <HI>more perfect</HI> than
the bodily substances, which are made of it. For
they all stand in neede, both of this prime <HI>matter,</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="151"/>
as a cause in it kinde concurrent to their producti∣on,
and of the <HI>efficiencie</HI> of the Sunne or other
coelestiall Agents to worke or fashion the <HI>materi∣alls</HI>
or Ingredients, of which they are made. If
either this common matter of sublunary sub∣stances,
or the Sunne which workes upon it, had
no superiour cause to limit their beeing or distin∣guish
their offices; both of them should bee <HI>infinite</HI>
in Beeing; both <HI>infinite</HI> in operation. Now if the
matter were infinite in beeing: the Sunne or o∣ther
coelestiall Agents, could have no <HI>beeing</HI> but
in it, or from it. For if the <HI>Sunne</HI> were infinite in
operation, the matter it selfe could bee nothing at
all; no part of nature, unlesse it were a worke or
effect of the Sunne. Infinitie in beeing <HI>excludes</HI> all
possibilitie of other Beeing <HI>save in</HI> it and <HI>from</HI> it.
And infinitie in operation, supposeth all things
that are limited, whether in beeing or operation,
to bee its workes, or <HI>resultances</HI> of its illimited
efficacie.</P>

<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Or further demonstration, that as
well the <HI>Sunne,</HI> which is the <HI>effici∣ent
generall,</HI> as the prime <HI>matter</HI>
which is the common <HI>mother</HI> of bo∣dies
sublunary, had a beginning of
beeing, there can be no <HI>meane</HI> eyther more forcible
or more plausible, then another Maxime much im∣braced
and insisted upon by the <HI>great Philosopher,</HI>
to wit, that as well the <HI>efficient</HI> as the <HI>materiall</HI> cause
derive the necessitie of their causalitie from the
end or finall cause, unto which they are destinated.
The <HI>Sunne</HI> doth not runne its daily course from
East to West, or make its annuall progresse from
North to South, to get it selfe heate, or for the
increase of its native force or vigour, by change of
Climates; but for the propagation of vegetables,
for the continuance of life and health in more per∣fect
sublunary substances. If then wee can demon∣strate,
that those vegetables or more perfect sublu∣narie
bodies, for whose continuall propagation, for
the continuance of whose life and well-fare the
Sunne becomes so indefatigable in its course, had
a true beginning of beeing, that the propagation is
not infinitely circular: the cause will be concluded,
that as well the common matter, whereof they are
<PB N="46" REF="152"/>
made, as the Sunne it selfe which produceth them,
had a beginning of <HI>beeing</HI> and <HI>operation</HI> from the
same supreame cause, which appointed the <HI>Sunne</HI>
thus to <HI>dispense</HI> its heate and <HI>influence,</HI> for the re∣liefe
and comfort of this inferiour world. To
prove that these sublunarie more perfect bodies,
as vegetables, &amp;c, had a beginning of beeing or
propagation; no Argument can be more effectuall
to the Naturalist, or others that will take it into
serious consideration; than the discussion of that
probleme, which <HI>Plutarch</HI> hath propounded, <HI>Whe∣ther
the Egg were before the Hen, or the Hen before
the Egg.</HI> The state of the question will be the same
in all more perfect vegetables, or living Creatures,
which usually grow from an imperfect or weake
estate to a more perfect and stronger: <HI>[Whether the
Acorne were before the Oake, or the Oake before the
Acorne. Whether the Lyon had precedencie of nature
to the Lyons whelp, or the Lyons whelp unto the Lyon.</HI>
The induction may be for eyther part most com∣pleate,
in respect of all times and of all places, if
with the Naturalist wee imagine the world to have
beene without beginning, or without ending. No
Naturalist can ever instance in any more perfect
<HI>feathered</HI> fowle, which was not first covered with
a shell, or contained in some more imperfect <HI>filme;</HI>
in any Bull which was not first a Calfe; in any Ly∣on,
which was not first a whelp; in any Oake,
which did not first spring from an Acorne: unlesse
he instance in painted Trees, in brazen Bulls, or
artificiall Lyons. Of live naturall substances it is
universally true, (Omnia ortus habent, sua{que} certa
<PB N="47" REF="152"/>
incrementa) <HI>All have their beginning, all their cer∣taine
increase or augmentation.</HI> The induction again
is for the other partie as compleate and perfect.
There never was a true Acorne, which did not
presuppose an Oake; nor a Lyons whelp which
did not presuppose a Lyon to beget it, and a Ly∣onesse
to bring it forth. Now every productive
cause, every live-substance, which produceth ano∣ther
by proper <HI>causalitie</HI> or efficiencie, hath al∣wayes
precedencie of nature and of time, in respect
of that which is produced by it. The Lyon is in
order of nature and of <HI>time,</HI> before his whelp, and
yet is every Lyon wherein the Naturalist can in∣stance,
a whelp before it be a Lyon; so is the Oake,
in order of nature and of time, before the Acorne,
and yet cannot the Naturalist instance in any Oake,
which was not an Acorne or plant before it grew
to be an Oake. If then eyther the race of Lyons, or
the propagation of Oakes, had no beginning; it
would inevitably follow, that Oakes had beene
perpetually before Acornes, and Acornes perpe∣tually
before Oakes; That Lyons whelpes from
eternitie had precedency or prioritie of time of
Lyons, and Lyons the like precedencie or prioritie
of time of their whelps. And if they had bin mutu∣ally
each before other from eternitie, according to
prioritie of time and nature, they must have beene
mutually each after other. How the Naturalist will
be able to digest this circular revolution of priori∣tie
and posterioritie, in respect of the same indivi∣duall
natures, or what hee will say to these follow∣ing
inconveniences, I cannot tell, but desire to
<PB N="48" REF="153"/>
know: Every whole or perfect <HI>Fish,</HI> which the
Naturalist hath heard or read of, had beginning of
its individuall Beeing from Spawne. This induction
is most compleate and perfect in the Schoole of
Nature, most irrefragable by the supposition of
the Naturalist with whom wee dispute. Every Fish
hath a beginning from Spawne, and that which
hath a beginning from Spawne, hath a beginning
of its beeing. No Fish or Spawne is or hath beene
immortall, or without beginning. Now if it bee
universally true, that every particular Fish hath its
beginning, it implies an evident contradiction, to
say that the race of Fishes, which consist onely of
particular Fishes, was without beginning. There
must in every race of Fishes be some first Fishes, or
first Spawnes, before which there was none of the
same kind, frō which this mutual propagation did
take its beginning. And though this propagation
be without end, yet could it not be without be∣ginning,
unlesse wee would grant that fishes are
not onely of an <HI>incorruptible</HI> nature, but of a na∣ture
infinite or eternall. If there were no begin∣ning
of this mutuall propagation, it would bee de∣manded
whether the number of fishes or Lyons
that shall bee (granting what the Naturalists sup∣pose,
that this propagation shall be endlesse) can
ever be as great, as the number of those Fishes and
Lyons that have beene? Or whether the number
of those that have beene, may not be conceived to
be more infinite, or in another sort infinite, than
the number of those that shall be. That the num∣ber
of Fishes, or Lyons, which, from this time for∣ward,
<PB N="49" REF="153"/>
may be, (suppose the world were never to
end) can be no otherwise infinite then potentially
or successively onely, or by addition, because there
shall never be any last Lyon, or fish, &amp;c. after which
there shall bee no more, the Naturalist will not
denie. For those Lyons or fishes, which from this
point of time shall be, have as yet no actuall beeing,
nor have they before this time had any such bee∣ing.
Whence it is cleare, that their number can
never be actually infinite, but infinite onely by <HI>ad∣dition,</HI>
as <HI>continuate</HI> quantitie is by division.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ego certe hac in re laudo Ari∣stotelem, quod cum impossibi∣litatem (ut ita dixe∣rim) aeter∣norum mo∣tuum, &amp; corporum, non praevi∣derit, maluit ab Eterno esse pulchrā hanc mundi faciem, quam ali∣quando ex aeterna de∣formitate emersisse.

if fishes have beene produced from Spawne, and
Spawne from fishes, without any beginning of
time, wee must of necessitie grant, that there have
beene Fishes, Lyons, Oakes, &amp;c. propagated each
from other, for number actually <HI>infinite:</HI> for every
Fish, which could produce Spawn, had actuall bee∣ing
before it could yeeld Spawne, &amp; every Spawne
wherof any fish is made, hath actuall beeing before
any Fish can be made of it. Whence if this propa∣gation
had beene without beginning, their number
must needes be actually infinite, so infinite that
there could have beene no more than have beene,
that there can be no more than now are. <HI>That</HI> onely
is <HI>actually</HI> infinite, unto which nothing of the same
kinde can be added. If this mutuall propagation
had beene from eternity, the number of things pro∣pagated
should have been actually infinite in every
<PB N="50" REF="154"/>
point of time imaginable. It is impossible that any
thing should be actually <HI>infinite</HI> from eternitie, and
not bee alike actually infinite throughout every
part of time; as infinite yesterday as to day, or as it
shall be to morrow. It is againe impossible, that
any thing should be actually infinite in any part of
time, or by any succession of time, which was not
infinite from eternitie, and before all times.
If wee shall suffer our imaginations of mutuall pro∣pagations,
to <HI>rove</HI> backward without an imagina∣tion
or acknowledgement of some first beginning
to stay or limit them, our soules shall finde as little
rest (with lesse securitie) as <HI>Noahs</HI> Dove did, whi∣lest

not returned to the Arke. Vnlesse wee thus pitch
upon a first beginning of time and all things tem∣porall,
we shall not only make shipwracke of faith,
but drench our immortall soules in a bottomlesse
lake or poole of absurdities, even in nature.</P>
<P>2 The conclusion arising from these premises,
is, that albeit naturall reason or discourse could ne∣ver
have found out that which <HI>Moses</HI> hath written,
concerning the particular manner of the worlds
creation; as that it, and all things in it, all the seve∣rall

That <HI>God blessed them,</HI> (after hee had made them)
saying, <HI>Be fruitfull and multiply, and fill the waters

it was this blessing upon <HI>fish</HI> and <HI>fowle</HI> (thus crea∣ted
at <HI>once,</HI> that is, made perfect in their kinde, not
by growth or succession, but by present operation
of his Omnipotent power) which gave first begin∣ning
to the naturall propagation of Fishes and
Fowles by Seede or Spawne. Againe, in as much
as the greatest <HI>Whales</HI> or other creatures most per∣fect
<PB N="52" REF="155"/>
in their kinde, though produced in a moment,
did presuppose a possibilitie of their being, and in
their most perfect actual beeing include more than
a possibilitie of not beeing, a necessary inclination
to returne unto the matter or masse out of which
they were made. This beeing which they have, pre∣supposeth
an infinite and pure act, which every
way hath precedencie of them, as having no cause
at all of his <HI>beeing,</HI> but is <HI>beeing it selfe,</HI> without pos∣sibilitie
of <HI>not beeing.</HI> The manner or method
which <HI>Moses</HI> observed in the Creation, was this:
Hee made the Heaven and Earth and first masse, of
meere nothing, that is, without any masse or <HI>sub∣ject</HI>
visible or invisible praeexistent, whereon to
worke. That imperfect masse of this great Spheare,
now distinguished into its severall parts, and, with∣in
sixe dayes, adorned and beautified in every part
beyond all skill of Art, was the first <HI>effect</HI> or prime
worke in order of time or nature of his <HI>all sufficient</HI>
active power or <HI>efficiencie.</HI> Out of this masse hee
made all things visible in their kind, not by meanes
or <HI>efficiencie</HI> naturall, but by the same supernaturall
or Omnipotent power, by which he made the first
masse out of nothing. In the prime and Cardinall
workes of the sixe dayes, the Almighty did pro∣ceede,
though by supernaturall efficiencie, in that
order or method, which Nature, by his appoint∣ment,
since hath followed. Man which is the most
perfect visible creature, was the last made, &amp; next
before him, the beasts of the field, which are next in
perfection to him: Next before them, the fowles
of the Ayre and fishes of the Sea; and immediately
<PB N="53" REF="155"/>
before them, the <HI>Sunne,</HI> the <HI>Moone,</HI> and the <HI>Stars.</HI>
But in the severall fountaines or roots of propaga∣tion
by seede, hee baganne the contrary way. Hee
first made man perfect, before hee gave him the
power of propagation. So did hee make every li∣ving
creature <HI>actually perfect</HI> in his kinde, before he
gave them power to increase and multiply by natu∣rall
seede or inchoation of now being.</P>

<HI>[In the beginning God made the heaven and the
earth]</HI> we doe not reade, that God saw it was
good. What is the reason? because as yet they
were not perfected in their kind; but destinated
onely unto more perfection. Of the light which
was created the first day (saith <HI>Moses) God saw
that it was good.</HI> But so he saith not of the second

this omission of the divine approbation intimate
unto us? thus much, if no more, That the second
dayes worke did not bring the waters to that per∣fection
and use whereunto they were destinated.
But of the third dayes worke, in which the earth
was severed from the waters, under the firma∣ment,
and enabled by his creative power, to bring
forth Hearbes and other Vegetables, God (saith
<HI>Moses) saw that it was good.</HI> And so it is likewise said
of the fourth dayes worke, in which the Sun and
Moone and the Stars were made; and so likewise
of the fift, wherein the water was authorized to
bring forth fowles and fishes perfect in their kind:
and lastly of the sixt day, wherein man was made,
it is said, that God saw all that he had made, and it

was <HI>exceeding good.</HI> To explicate every dayes
worke in particular, would require a larger

such Euangelicall mysteries, as the Historie of the

<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He discussion of the second generall
Principle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Chap∣ter 3. § 3.</NOTE> might well have had its
<HI>admission</HI> into Divinity denyed, had
not some Schoole Divines, by di∣sputing
whether there can be any

pretence for intruding it selfe. Their meaning
may in more <HI>civill</HI> language be thus exprest; <HI>[Whe∣ther
the power of creating may by omnipotency be de∣legated
to any agent, not omnipotent.]</HI> That Omni∣potency
it self cannot be delegated, all agree. Now
if the production of <HI>spirituall</HI> grace in the heart of
man be, a true and proper effect of creative power;
they who teach that the Sacraments of the Gospel
do conferre grace <HI>ex opere operato,</HI> that is, by their
proper efficacy; are ingaged to make proofe, that
the power of creation may be delegated, by the
Almighty Father, either to the consecrated Sacra∣mentary
Elements, or to the Priest which conse∣crates
them. But leaving the discussion of this
Question (in the explication of whose termes or
meaning, the favourers or maintainers of it, do not
<PB N="58" REF="158"/>
agree) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> proper place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our present questi∣on
is, Whether <HI>ability</HI> to create <HI>substances</HI> visible
or invisible, doth necessarily inferre it to be Omni∣potent.
Spirituall <HI>grace,</HI> all grant, is no substance.
But here againe, the Schoolemen have troubled
themselves and their Readers, with a question, if
not more curious, yet as <HI>unnecessary</HI> as the former;
as whether this visible world, or at least some part
of it, might not have beene created immediately by
Angels, as by Gods instrumets. The Question
(perhaps) might be more pertinent and more di∣stinct,
were it framed thus; <HI>[Whether to make any
visible or invisible substance of nothing, or without
any matter pretedent, which should remaine, as an
ingredient in the substance made, do rightly infer the
immediate maker to be Omnipotent.]</HI> That any
cause efficient of substance, which hath beene crea∣ted,
or hereafter may be created, could be enabled
to create or make any other substance, without any
<HI>entity</HI> praexistent, whereof it should be made, is
an hypothesis or supposall, which hath no other
ground either in Philosophy or Divinity; besides
the vncertaine grounds, from which some have
attempted to prove, that <HI>creation</HI> is a prerogative
of the one Omnipotent, which cannot be delega∣ted
to any other. This truth some labour to prove
from this Maxime, <HI>Inter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; non ens infinita di¦stantia
est:</HI> [Betweene something, betweene any
thing which truly is, and meere nothing, there is
an infinite distance or disparity.] Now this breach
of disparity or distance infinite (which they con∣ceive)
between <HI>something &amp; nothing,</HI> cānot be fully
<PB N="59" REF="158"/>
made up save only by power truly inf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nite, whence
it may seeme concluded, that it is impossible for
any thing to be made of nothing; save onely by
power in it selfe Omnipotent, or absolutely: infi∣nite.
The conclusion it selfe, or the last propositi∣on
in the inference, I verily beleeve to be most
true; but the <HI>meane</HI> to inferre it, or <HI>manner</HI> of infer∣ring
it, is not so certaine, as the conclusion is sound.
The Argument is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t calculatory. And this kind
of argument is deceitfull, unlesse the degrees of
proportion whether between the disparity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> con∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity
of termes compared, bee determinate and
certaine. The degrees of disparity, betweene some∣thing
and nothing, cannot be more in number or
more infinite, than are the entitive degrees of any
created substance. And these are not actually or
absolutely infinite, nor can the disparity betwixt
something and nothing, betwixt <HI>nothing</HI> and the
most <HI>excellent eventure</HI> that is, be so great or so ab∣solutely
infinite, as is the disparity betwixt the
most excellent creature that is or can be, and the
<HI>one</HI> Omnipotent Creator, who alone is absolutely
infinite.</P>
<P>2 But be it onely supposed, no way granted,
that the power of making some visible substance
out of nothing, might be delegated to some Crea∣ture;
the exercise of this power thus delegated,
would not inferre the <HI>Exerciser</HI> of it, but only the
<HI>Author,</HI> to be Omnipotent. For to be Omnipo∣tent,
includes as much as to be able to do all things,
which imply no contradiction; as much as to make
all things that can be conceived as <HI>logically possible,</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="159"/>
out of nothing, because all sorts or kinds of <HI>being,
numerable</HI> or <HI>comprehensible,</HI> are <HI>eminently</HI> contai∣ned
in the incomprehensible Essence; of which
the attribute of Omnipotency is a chiefe preroga∣tive.
It is not then all one, to be enabled to make
some thing, suppose a gnat or flye, out of nothing;
and to be able to make as many things, as now are
extant in the world, or much better than these are,
out of meere nothing. It is a maxime evident by
light of reason, that no Doner can really give more
than he hath to give: suppose he were willing, en∣abled
and authorized to give himselfe: to give its
whole nature with the appurtenances to any other
Creature already extant, or in possibility to bee
<HI>created.</HI> It being then supposed, that an Angell by
some speciall delegation from the incomprehen∣sible
Essence or power Omnipotent, might be en∣abled
to make something of nothing, it were not
possible that he should make any nature or essence
more excellent than himselfe. Yet it is possible,
that there might be some more excellent created
substance than this Angell: yea of necessity there
should be a possibilitie of his being more excellent
in his kind, than now he is. However; for him to
give, for him to bestow a more excellent being up∣on
that which is not, than, for the present he him∣selfe
hath, is no way possible. Suppose then hee
might entirely <HI>alienate</HI> from himselfe, or bequeath
the best being, which for the present he hath, upon
some possibility of being, or advance some nume∣rable
not <HI>being</HI> to his own estate by his utter anni∣hilation;
this could not argue him to be Omnipo∣tent,
<PB N="61" REF="159"/>
because there be many other effects possible,
which are not in his power to produce; albeit he
could resume that which he had given unto ano∣ther,
and bestow it againe where he pleased. Last∣ly,
seeing the prime Essence, who alone is abso∣lutely
infinite, did not make all things out of no∣thing
by a necessity of nature, but because it was
his will so to make them: no creature by any de∣legated
power imaginable, could possibly make
any one thing, or more things out of nothing, be∣sides
those which the Omnipotent was willing
should be so made; nor these any better either for
substance or qualitie, than his will was, they should
be. Nor could any creature be enabled by his will
out of nothing to make any thing, which was not
<HI>eminently contained</HI> in the nature of that creature,
to whom this power of creating, is supposed to be,
by his will, delegated. For albeit some efficient
or productive causes bring forth effects for sub∣stance
or qualitie more excellent then themselves:
yet this they never doe, this they cannot doe, un∣lesse
they worke upon some advantage, which the
subject or matter whereon they worke doth afford
them. But this advantage cannot be supposed in
the production of any substance, out of no <HI>subject</HI>
or <HI>matter</HI> praexistent. All the excellency, which
any effect or substance so produced can have, must
be intirely derived from its efficient. And that can
be no greater excellency or perfection, than the
efficient it selfe hath; not altogether so great, be∣cause
it must be <HI>eminently</HI> contained in the perfec∣tion
of its efficient: if so be the efficient have any
<PB N="62" REF="160"/>
perfection or being left, after the production of
such an effect. So that every efficient cause, which
is or can be supposed, as an instrumentall cause of
creation, or as enabled to produce something out
of nothing, is thus farre limited, that it can produce
no effect more excellent that it selfe, and being
thus limited in it selfe, and by dependance on an
higher cause, as well in its being, as in its operati∣on,
it cannot be conceived to bee Omnipotent.
For that includes as much as to be <HI>illimited</HI> in ope∣ration,
or, which is all one, to bee the operative
power of the incomprehensible Essence, or of Be∣ing
<HI>infinite.</HI></P>
<P>3 But though to be able to make something out
of nothing be not formally <HI>aequipollent</HI> to the <HI>attri∣bute</HI>
of Omnipotency: yet can it not hence be con∣cluded,
that any agent besides the one Omnipo∣tent,
is either able or can be enabled to produce
the least substance that is, the least portion or mat∣ter
ingredient to any bodily substance out of meer
nothing. To lay the first foundation or beginning
of being of any <HI>finite</HI> substance, is the sole effect of
<HI>being</HI> it selfe, and therefore of that which is truly
<HI>infinite</HI> in operation. Whatsoever is finite or limi∣ted,
can have no other kind of being, than <HI>borrowed</HI>
or <HI>participated.</HI> And this kinde of <HI>being</HI> must bee
immediately derived, without intervention of any
instrumentall cause, from <HI>being</HI> not <HI>participated or
borrowed,</HI> but from <HI>increated</HI> and <HI>authentique being.</HI>
To create, is to give actuall being or existance,
without the help or furtherance of any Contribu∣ter
or Confounder. Now if this power of creating
<PB N="63" REF="160"/>
could possibly bee delegated to any created sub∣stance,
it were possible for that which is created by
it, to have its being <HI>extra infinitum esse,</HI> that is, it
should not be immediately and intirely contained
in the infinite and incomprehensible Essence or
Being. For in this very <HI>supposall</HI> [That one crea∣ted
substance might by power delegated from
Omnipotency, create another] it is necessarily im∣plied,
that the substance created should have its
<HI>being</HI> intirely, or <HI>part</HI> of its <HI>being</HI> immediately
from the other, which, by power delegated, is sup∣posed
to <HI>create</HI> it. And having such being, as it
hath, either intirely or in part immediately from
the other, it could not be <HI>immediately</HI> and <HI>intirely</HI>
contained in the first cause of all things. And if the
least <HI>substance</HI> possible, could have its Being, not
immediately and intirely from the first cause or
supreame Efficient, he could not bee actually and
absolutely infinite in Being, or Omnipotent in
working. For that onely is <HI>absolutely</HI> infinite, or
<HI>infinite</HI> in <HI>Being,</HI> in which all things possible are
immediately contained; without whose incom∣prehensible
Being, nothing can have existence;
without whose immediate operation nothing can
begin to be or exist.</P>
<P>These agitatiōs discussions may notifie unto us
the strength &amp; soundness of that treble rule or fun∣damentall
principle layd by others, and before tou∣ched
by us. First, it is peculiar unto Art to turne
bodies already formed and perfected by nature, in∣to
another fashion: It is the property of nature, and
of naturall and finite Agents, to worke the <HI>unfa∣shioned</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="161"/>
or <HI>confused matter</HI> into some determinate
<HI>forme</HI> or set kinde of being. It is the prerogative of
the Omnipotent <HI>Maker,</HI> to afford naturall Agents
the intire <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>stuffe,</HI> whereon they worke;
and to bestow on them such being as they have,
whether that be <HI>materiall</HI> or <HI>immateriall,</HI> celestiall

whose convenience it was made. The Clocke-maker
doth not tye himselfe to keep all the Clocks
which he makes: nor doth he which undertakes to
<HI>keepe</HI> them, binde himselfe to watch their motions
perpetually, or to observe them as curiously as
Physitians doe their sicke Patients. Againe, the
most perfect works of nature, as vegetables and
living things, depend upon their causes, whether
materiall or efficient, (for the most part) onely in
<HI>fieri,</HI> not in <HI>facto, whilest they are in making or in
perfecting, not after they be made and perfected.</HI> The
Lyonesse doth not perpetually nourish her whelps
with her owne substance; nor doth the Raven
continually provide for her young ones; or any o∣ther
creatures more kinde than they, perpetually
<PB N="67" REF="162"/>
support or direct their <HI>brood</HI> in their motions, but
leave them to <HI>fend</HI> for themselves. If the Almigh∣tie
Creator should doe no better by his most per∣fect
Creatures, their <HI>returne</HI> to nothing, would be
as speedy, as their production from it. All of them
have a perpetuall and undispensable dependance
upon his power, not onely whilst they are in <HI>ma∣king,</HI>
but as great after they are made. And thus
great and perpetuall it is, not in respect of their sub∣stances
onely, but as truly in respect of their moti∣ons
or operations. The imperfect <HI>masse</HI> or <HI>matter</HI>
whereof bodies naturall are made, is not onely his
<HI>sole</HI> worke, or effect of his Omnipotency; but that
it is <HI>workable</HI> or <HI>fashionable</HI> unto any set forme, this
likewise is an effect of his operative power; it could
not be perpetually thus fashionable, but by his per∣petuall
working. That the most perfect <HI>naturall
Agent,</HI> should worke or dispose this <HI>matter</HI> to any
set forme: this likewise is his worke. He doth not
onely <HI>support</HI> both <HI>Agent</HI> and <HI>Patient</HI> in that <HI>being</HI>
which he gave them, but doth perpetually <HI>coope∣rate</HI>
with them in their motions; doth apply and
direct their motions unto those ends and uses,
whereto his wisdome hath ordained them.</P>

dependance, which all <HI>finite</HI> Agents with their <HI>ef∣fects,</HI>
have on the one Omnipotent and supreame
illimited <HI>efficient,</HI> whether in respect of their ex∣istence
or operation; the disputes in Schooles are
intricate, and the questions perplexed. But the
best is, the ingenuous Reader may <HI>quit</HI> them, if
he will be but pleased to take unto himselfe, if not
<PB N="68" REF="163"/>
an ocular demonstration, yet a <HI>visible representation</HI>
of this truth, in that <HI>perpetuall dependance,</HI> which
light diffused (whether through the celestiall bo∣dies,
as the moone or starres, or through the ayre
or other inferiour elementary bodies capable of en∣lightning)
hath on the <HI>Fountaine</HI> of Light, to wit,
the <HI>body</HI> of the <HI>Sunne:</HI> or which the <HI>light</HI> in rooms,
otherwise dark, hath on the light of <HI>Fire</HI> or candles
by night. So perpetuall, so essentiall is this depen∣dance
which <HI>light,</HI> in bodies inlightned by others,
hath on the bodies which enlighten them; that
some<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide Za∣barel. de Lumine.</NOTE> good Philosophers, from observation of
this dependance, have concluded, that [Lumen.
non est inhaesive in corpore illuminato, sed in cor∣pore
lucente▪] <HI>The lightsomnesse which appeares
in these inferiour bodies, or in bodies not lucent in
themselves, is not inherently or subjectively, in the
borrowers, or bodies enlightned, but in the bodies
which enlightens them.</HI> To prove this conclusion,
they use this Antecedent, that light borrowed or
participated, doth follow the motion of the body
which bestowes or <HI>lends</HI> it; and this Antecedent
they thinke sufficiently proved by sense. For if we
hold a <HI>looking-glasse</HI> to a candle by night, the light
which for the present appeares either in the whole
glasse or in some part of it, will alter its place or
seat according to the <HI>motion</HI> of the candle. If you
move the candle <HI>higher</HI> or lower than it was, the
light in the glasse will remove with it, from the
highest place to the lowest, and from the lowest to
the highest, as it shall please the <HI>mover</HI> to alter the
<HI>aspect</HI> betwixt them, so will the light move from
<PB N="69" REF="163"/>
one part of the <HI>roome</HI> to another, as the candle is re∣moved.
And if you take the candle quite out of
the roome, the light will follow it, and leave no∣thing
but darknesse behind. The same observa∣tion
holds as true in a Dyall, in which the light or
shadow constantly followes the motion of the Sun.
But to hold this conclusion, [That light borrowed
from the Sunne or a Candle, should be <HI>inherently</HI>
or subjectively in the Sunne or Candle] is more
than true Philosophy will warrant; more than the
unquestionable truth of the former experiment
can <HI>logically</HI> inferre. For though <HI>light</HI> in bodies
not <HI>lucent</HI> in themselves, bee not their owne, but
borrowed; yet in that it is <HI>borrowed,</HI> it must bee
truly in the borrower, not in the body which lends
it. For every one which <HI>lends,</HI> is presumed to
<HI>transfer</HI> the use of what hee lends unto him that
borrowes: the borrower must have the <HI>posses∣sion</HI>
of what is lent him, during the time of the
loane. As for the former experiments, they may
be retorted upon such as use their helpe for infer∣ring
this pretended conclusion, [<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide An∣ton. Scar∣milion. de coloribus.</NOTE> That light diffu∣sed
is not inherently in the body enlightned, but
in the body lucent, or enlightning.] For the <HI>muta∣tion</HI>
of the <HI>seat</HI> of <HI>borrowed light,</HI> whether in a look∣ing-glasse
held to a candle, or in a Sun-dyall, will
be the very same, albeit the Candle or Dyall stand
still in the same place; if so we move the <HI>Looking-glasse</HI>
the same way from the Candle, or the Dyall
the same way from the Sunne, by which the Sun
did move from the Dyall, or the Candle was mo∣ved
from the <HI>Looking-glasse.</HI> This conclusion is
<PB N="70" REF="164"/>
most certaine, [That the motion of light, accor∣ding
to the motion of the body which diffuseth it,
doth no way inferre the light not to be <HI>inherently,</HI>
(according to the inherency which it hath) in the
body, through which it is diffused; but rather that
this light, however inherent in the body enlight∣ned,
hath a perpetuall indispensable dependance
upon the light of the body which produceth it; a
dependance on it, not onely in <HI>fieri,</HI> that is, whilest
it is in production, which is in an instant; but a de∣pendance
in <HI>facto,</HI> so long as it continues in the bo∣dy
enlightned. And we cannot better conceive
the manner, how a <HI>line</HI> should be made by the <HI>con∣tinued</HI>
fluxe of a point, or a surface by the <HI>continued</HI>
motion of a line; or how time should receive its
continuation from the continued fluxe of an in∣stant,
than by observing the manner how <HI>light</HI>
being produced in an instant in the body, which
borrowes it (the extremity of it being terminated
to a mathematicall point or line) doth vary its place
of residence in the same body, moving continually
from one part to another, according to the degrees
of motion, either of the <HI>body</HI> which gives the light,
or of the <HI>body</HI> which is enlightned, one from the
other. If either body could <HI>move</HI> or bee moved
from the <HI>aspect</HI> of the other, in an instant, the light
would remove from the body enlightned in the
same instant. But <HI>moving</HI> as it doth, the motion
of the light from one part of the same body or
roome into another, is perpetuall; there is no in∣terruption
in the motion so much as momentary,
no <HI>interposition</HI> of darknesse so long as the motion
<PB N="71" REF="164"/>
lasts. And yet it is not the same numericall light,
which thus moveth in the bodie or roome enlight∣ned.
There is a continuall <HI>production</HI> of light fully
answerable to the continuall <HI>succession</HI> of the mo∣tion.
The light, whilest in motion, continues no
longer the same than the aspect betweene the bodie
<HI>enlightning</HI> and <HI>enlightned</HI> continues the same.
And it may be questioned, whether there be not
a perpetuall production of <HI>new</HI> light, even whilest
neyther the body enlightning nor enlightned <HI>re∣move</HI>
one from the other, whilest both stand or
rest upon their severall centers.</P>
<P>3 But what ever Philosophers may dispute one
way or other concerning the proper <HI>subject</HI> of light
<HI>diffused</HI> or participated, or concerning the identifie
or multiplication of it in <HI>bodies</HI> not <HI>lucent</HI> in them∣selves,
but enlightned: the dependance of <HI>borrowed</HI>
or <HI>participated</HI> light upon the fountaine of light,
whence it is borrowed, is the most perfect Em∣bleme,
which the eye of man can behold, of that
<HI>dependance</HI> which all things <HI>numerable</HI> that are, or
can be, have on the <HI>incomprehensible</HI> Essence, or <HI>in∣exhaustible
fountaine</HI> of Beeing. Whether light
participated or diffused, have any true inherence or
no in bodies enlightned, or whether it be present
with them or in them, (ad modum spiritalium) <HI>af∣ter
such a manner</HI> as spirits are in sublunary bodies,
or with them; this is certaine, that light participa∣ted,
is not deduced or drawne out of any <HI>matter</HI>
praeexistent, or out of any <HI>positive qualitie</HI> inhe∣rent;
it is produced out of darknes or want of light.
And herein it is the true Embleme of created Enti∣ties,
<PB N="72" REF="165"/>
w<SUP>ch</SUP> were not made of any entities praeexistent,
but of nothing. As light participated or diffused,
hath no permanent root in bodies enlightned: So
things created have not their <HI>root</HI> of beeing in any
<HI>maetter</HI> praeexistent, nor hath the prime <HI>matter,</HI> of
which things generated are made, any root prece∣dent
out of which it groweth. Such <HI>being</HI> as it hath,
it hath intirely by its perpetuall dependance upon
<HI>beeing it selfe.</HI> The most excellent <HI>numerable bee∣ing</HI>
that can be imagined, is more truely participa∣ted
or borrowed from <HI>beeing</HI> it selfe, than the <HI>light</HI>
of the Moone or Sarres, than the <HI>light</HI> in the <HI>ayre,
water,</HI> or <HI>yce,</HI> is from the body of the Sunne. And
albeit the formes or perfect bodies, which, by ope∣ration
of efficients <HI>naturall,</HI> respectively result or
are produced out of the <HI>matter,</HI> have a being di∣stinct
from the <HI>matter,</HI> out of which they are made
or produced: yet even these have the same imme∣diate
dependency upon the <HI>incomprehensible Es∣sence</HI>
or inexhaustible fountaine of Beeing, which
the prime <HI>matter</HI> hath. As the resplendencie or ir∣radiation
of coloured glasses, be they <HI>yellow, greene</HI>
or <HI>azure,</HI> have the same immediate dependance
upon the light of the Sunne, which the light diffu∣sed
throughout the heavens, water, ayre, or pure
glasses, hath; unlesse the Sun send forth his beames
upon them, these colours have no resplendencie,
they cannot <HI>affect</HI> the sense of sight. Nor can any
created Agent (albeit endowed with qualities ope∣rative,
more forcible and permanent, than any co∣loured
glasses can bee) produce any reall effect,
without the cooperation or coagencie of the <HI>in∣comprehensible
<PB N="73" REF="165"/>
Essence,</HI> or <HI>inexhaustible fountaine</HI> of
Beeing. As impossible it is, that any <HI>agent</HI> should
move, or be moved, otherwise than by the vertue
of his Almighty <HI>power,</HI> as that it should have <HI>beeing</HI>
or existence (extra infinitum esse) <HI>without his infi∣nite
Beeing or immensitie,</HI> or that the continuance
of it in such <HI>being,</HI> should not be comprehended in
his infinite and interminable duration, which wee
call Eternitie. Againe, as light borrowed or diffu∣sed
throughout this inferiour world, hath a <HI>beeing</HI>
in its kinde distinct from that <HI>light,</HI> which is per∣manently
seated in the fountaine of light, on
which, notwithstanding, all borrowed light abso∣lutely
depends as being eminently contained in it:
so every <HI>numerable</HI> beeing, or <HI>part</HI> of this <HI>world,</HI>
the <HI>Sunne,</HI> the <HI>Moone,</HI> the <HI>Starres,</HI> the <HI>Elements,
mixt bodies, vegetables, man,</HI> and <HI>beast,</HI> have their
proper kinde of Beeing distinct each from other,
and distinct againe from the incomprehensible
<HI>fountaine</HI> of <HI>beeing;</HI> on which notwithstanding all
of them have more immediate, more essentiall de∣pendance,
than either the <HI>lights,</HI> or different shapes
in a glasse, have on the <HI>Sunne</HI> which gives the light,
or on the bodies which they represent. And in this
incomprehensible fountaine of <HI>beeing,</HI> all things
not onely which are, but which possibly may bee,
are more <HI>eminently</HI> contained, than the least-spar∣kles
or portions of borrowed light, which appeare
in broken glasses, are in the body of the Sunne.</P>
<P>4 In this point onely, or in this especially, is the
production of light in this inferiour world by the
Sunne, unlike the Creation of all things by the Al∣mighty
<PB N="74" REF="166"/>
Father of <HI>lights,</HI> in that the Sunne produ∣ceth
<HI>light</HI> or resplendency, without any free choice
or intelligence, but by a necessitie of nature, that is,
it so produceth light, as it hath no power not to
produce it. So doth not the Almighty Father ey∣ther
create the things that are, or preserve them in
their estate of beeing, or cooperate with them in
the production of such effects, as they in their seve∣rall
<HI>kindes</HI> and <HI>rankes</HI> are truly said to produce. For
albeit the Almighty Father, bee more immutable
than the Sunne, yet is hee immutably free. For
freedome of will, by which creatures rationall ex∣ceede
all creatures meerly naturall, or capable of no
better endowment then sense, being a true and
reall branch of <HI>beeing,</HI> a perfection of the most per∣fect
creatures, must be as truely and really, though
in an <HI>eminent manner,</HI> contained in the <HI>Maker</HI> of all
things, as any other branch of <HI>numerable beeing</HI> is.
Now the object of this freedome of will in the
Omnipotent Maker, is not onely the <HI>Creation</HI> or
<HI>not creation</HI> of things that are or may bee; not the
preservation or destruction of things <HI>created,</HI> or of
the severall endowments or qualifications: but
part of this <HI>object</HI> of divine freedome is the ena∣bling
or inhibiting of all his creatures, to exercise
those qualities or faculties which are to them most
naturall, and in their kinde most powerfull. Albeit
<HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> had power to make the flames of
intēded persecution, much hotter than any ordina∣ry
fire; though other Tyrants might have power
to make the like againe, much hotter than hee did,
or to environ Gods Saints with the fire of Hell; yet
<PB N="75" REF="166"/>
if the Almighty Creator withdraw the <HI>influence</HI>
of his power from such fire or flames, they can
have no more power to burne or scorch his Ser∣vants,
than they have to coole them; although we
suppose their nature and qualities to be preserved
still entire, by the same power, by which they were
created. For as (but now) was said, the <HI>inhibition</HI>
or <HI>enabling</HI> of naturall qualities or faculties to ex∣ercise
their native force, is as truely the object of
divine freedome, as the preservation or destruction
of the Agents themselves, with their qualities or
endowments is. For the same reason, the <HI>Sunne</HI> was
no way wounded in his substance, nor <HI>hurt,</HI> nor
<HI>tainted</HI> in its influence or other qualitie, when, by
the divine power, which is immutably and perpe∣tually
free, it was inhibited in its course or mo∣tion.</P>
<P>5 That the Almightie Creator neyther in our
time, nor in the times long before us, hath laid any
such restraint upon the Sunne, that it should not
move, or upon the <HI>fire,</HI> that it should not burne, is
not from any restraint which hee hath laid upon his
<HI>power</HI> by his eternall <HI>decree;</HI> but from his <HI>immuta∣ble</HI>
and <HI>eternall freedome.</HI> Wee may not say, that he
cannot, for the times present or which are to come,
lay the like inhibition upon the <HI>Sunne,</HI> upon the
<HI>fire,</HI> or upon other celestiall or sublunarie bodies,
for exercising the functions most naturall to them.
That hee will not, at any time, lay the like restraint
upon them, wee are not bound to beleeve, untill
thus much be by his word revealed unto us. That
God cannot at this time bring such a generall In∣undation
<PB N="76" REF="167"/>
upon the earth as hee did in the dayes of
<HI>Noah,</HI> we may not say or thinke: but that hee <HI>will</HI>
not destroy the world by <HI>water,</HI> wee must beleeve,
because wee have his solemne promise to this pur∣pose
sealed unto us, by the signe of the <HI>Bow</HI> in the
Cloud. But when the iniquitie of this present
world shall come unto the same height and mea∣sure,
which the old world had made up, wee be∣leeve
hee will destroy it by fire. For other mutati∣ons
in the course of nature, the condition or exi∣gence
of times ensuing, may be such, as that they
may be as <HI>strange</HI> and miraculous, as at any time
heretofore they have beene. The not interposing
of miracles in these our dayes, proceedes not from
any Act <HI>passed</HI> by the Almightie to the contrary,
nor from the <HI>unchangeablenesse</HI> of his eternall will;
but from the condition or course, which his crea∣tures
hold <HI>de facto,</HI> whose condition or estate is
in it selfe, and by his Almighty will so to have it, so
changeable and so improveable to different pur∣poses,
that many events, which to our observation
would be most strange, might upon speciall occa∣sions
be produced, without any change or altera∣tion
in his power, whose exercise <HI>ad extra,</HI> that is,
<HI>in respect of effects producible in the creature,</HI> is im∣mutably
free, untill hee promise to inhibit them, as
hee hath done the generall Inundation. And al∣though
hee be most immutable in all his promises
or inhibitions: yet doth not every promise or in∣hibition
which hee makes, induce an absolute im∣mutabilitie
or necessitie of the things promised or
inhibited. Their immutabilitie or necessitie is the
<PB N="77" REF="167"/>
proper effect of his more solemne or peculiar pro∣mises.
Nor are such inhibitions as he hath set un∣to
the water absolutely necessary from Eternity,
but grow necessary in revolution of time, by the
<HI>changeable</HI> condition of the Creature. And albeit
we can neither prescribe limits to his will, nor con∣ceive
any reason of the mutations which fall out in
the Creatures by his inhibition, by his <HI>permission,</HI>
or by his positive <HI>enabling</HI> them to exercise their
native functions; yet of the least <HI>mutation,</HI> that can
fall out in the world, he knowes a cause or <HI>reason,</HI>
nor doth he suffer any thing to be done, for which
his immutable <HI>freedome</HI> in <HI>governing</HI> the world,
hath not an <HI>eternall</HI> rule or reason <HI>infinitely</HI> more
perfect, than the wisest man living can give any for
his best Acts or undertakings. But suppose the Sun
to have that freedome of power in the <HI>emission</HI> or
not emission of his beames, which men have over
their breath, or that dexterity in tempering or mo∣derating
its light or influence, which skilfull Mu∣sitians
have in modulating their <HI>voices:</HI> and the
former representation of that power which God
hath over all his creatures, and of their dependance
on him in their beings and operations by the de∣pendance
which light hath on the Sunne, would
be more lively and full.</P>
<P>6 But the Psalmist hath made choice of that
free power, which man hath over his <HI>animall fa∣culties,</HI>
as over his <HI>breath</HI> or <HI>operation</HI> of his senses;
as the fairest picture of Gods free power creative
and providence over his Creatures. <HI>These wait all
upon thee, that thou mightest give them their meat in
<PB N="78" REF="168"/>
due seasons. That thou givest them, they gather: thou
openest thine hand, they are filled with good. Thou
hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away
their breath, they dye, and returne to their dust. Thou
sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
renewest the face of the earth. The glory of the Lord
shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoyce in his
workes. He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth:
he toucheth the hils and they smoake. Psal. 104. vers.
27. &amp;c.</HI> Yet even in these and the like emblemati∣call
expressions of the <HI>Creators</HI> free power over his
Creatures, or in the choisest that can bee taken or
gathered out of the Propheticall descriptions,
from the exercise of mens free and purest thoughts,
there will still remaine this disparity: We cannot
alter the objects of our intellectuall or abstract con∣templations,
without some alteration or change of
<HI>Acts.</HI> It is then the prerogative of the <HI>Almighty,
freely</HI> to will things most contrary and different,
without any diversity in his will. And this his free
will not onely worketh greater varietie or change
in the Creature, than the wits of all men in the
world can conceive, but withall <HI>irresistibly deter∣mines</HI>
the issue of every possible change, without
any shadow of change or alteration in his thoughts
or resolutions; which in him are not many, but
more truly one <HI>infinity,</HI> than any one thought in us
is one. This disparity betweene the Identity of his
Eternall <HI>knowledge,</HI> and of his <HI>immutable</HI> freedome,
and the manner of our understanding or intellectu∣all
choice, I cannot yet better represent than by the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See the first part of the Divine Essence &amp; Attributes, chap. 21. pag. 229, 230. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>former <HI>disparity,</HI> betweene the circle and many

sided figures. Mans purest intellectuall thoughts or
actuall choices, are in the contemplative part of
the soule, as <HI>angles</HI> are in many sided <HI>figures,</HI> all as
different each from other, as one <HI>angle</HI> is from a∣nother
in a <HI>quadrangle,</HI> and every one is as distinct
from the <HI>substance</HI> of the soule wherein they are, as
angles in a <HI>quadrangle</HI> are from the sides or surface
of it. But those which wee terme, or conceive as
severall Acts or exercises of the <HI>Divine</HI> power, as
the <HI>Act</HI> of creation, the act of preservation, the act
of <HI>conseruation,</HI> the production of miracles, &amp;c.
are in the Almighty, not so much distinct one from
another, or from his incomprehensible essence, as
the <HI>Angles</HI> in a circle are from the sides or from the

in which there is no <HI>sensible</HI> distinction be∣tweene

immediately and as intirely ascribed unto the ope∣rative
power of the Creator, as their first Creation
out of nothing was. Yet the reason of their ascri∣bing
all this unto the immediate and sole power
of God, will no way warrant the truth of their cri∣ticisme,
who teach that neither the fire doth truly

solaecisme of vaine Philosophy, or of sciences fals∣ly
so called; whereas the right resolution of this
solaecisme into distinct and Christian phrase, is but
this, <HI>God doth produce heat, cold, moisture, vegeta∣bles,

<HI>the Fire, Water, Sunne, Earth, &amp;c. being

Creator doth daily worke all those effects, which
we attribute to naturall agents: yet doth hee not
worke such effects onely in them, or where they
are present, but he truly <HI>worketh</HI> by them and with
them. And if the Omnipotent power be truly said

must truly worke <HI>with him,</HI> in their kinde. When

the Creator, than the first production of their vi∣sible
and naturall causes. As for the former Cri∣tickes,
in whose language, God onely worketh in
his creatures, or (his creatures being present) they
might with as good reason, affirme that the Sunne
did not really <HI>move,</HI> but that God did move, the
Sun being present; yet could <HI>he</HI> not <HI>move</HI> or create
motion <HI>ad praesentiam</HI> Solis, unlesse the Sunne did
truly move. The truth is, the Sunne doth move,
or is moved by Gods <HI>presence</HI> in it, but he doth not
move with it or by it. But with the <HI>Sunne</HI> or other
Creatures, he truly worketh, as they truly worke
with <HI>him.</HI> And, by this concession of some true
power and property of working unto naturall A∣gents,
more is ascribed to the Creator of all things,
than can bee ascribed by the contrary opinion,
which utterly denies al power or property of wor∣king
to the Creatures. For he that denyes any ef∣fects
to be truly wrought by them, cannot ascribe
their abilities or operative force (which, in his o∣pinion,
is none) unto their Creator.

which is grounded on it, being for the present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣questred;
he hath a peculiar title to all the <HI>works</HI> or
<HI>effects,</HI> (especially to all of greater and more pub∣lique
consequence) which the Creatures produce,
from his <HI>skill</HI> or wisedome in contriving the com∣bination
of second causes, with their severall ope∣rations,
for the assequution of their last or utmost
end. Nor was the entitative goodnesse of every
creature in his kinde, albeit considered in that per∣fection
wherein God made it, the ground or rea∣son
of that <HI>approbation</HI> which hee bestowed upon
them, as they severally began to bee, or after hee
had accomplished them all. God (saith <HI>Moses)</HI>
saw all that he had made, and loe it was exceeding
good. What goodnesse then was this, which hee
thus commends? the goodnesse of order or of har∣mony
betwixt them, as they were parts of this V∣niverse.
This <HI>harmony,</HI> was the accomplishment
of his severall workes, the ground of his praises,
and the complete object of our beleefe of this Ar∣ticle
of Creation. Hence saith the Apostle, <HI>Heb. 11</HI>
By faith we beleeve; What? <HI>Secula facta esse,</HI> nay
<PB N="84" REF="171"/>
more then so <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>that the worlds were
harmonically made.</HI> It was a double over-sight in
some good Divines, from one or both of these two
principles, (Omne ens qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ens, est bonum,) <HI>What
soever hath being is good,</HI> whatsoever is, was made
by God, and all things which God made were
good; to infer, that sinne or morall evill could have
no positive entitie. For the greater the entitative
<HI>goodnesse</HI> of any creature is, the greater measure of
<HI>morall</HI> evill it alwayes includes, unlesse its entita∣tive
goodnesse hold such harmony or correspon∣dency
with the rest, as may helpe to make up or
support that goodnesse of order, that is, that good∣nesse
of coordination amongst themselves, or of
that joint subordination unto their Creator, which
he first framed and placed in this Vniverse, as it was
his worke. Vnlesse sinne or morall evill had some
positive entitie, or some positive degrees or mea∣sure,
all sinnes should be equall, there could bee no
different kinds of sinne, no <HI>numericall difference</HI> or

<P>3 <HI>If the Reader desire a briefe abstract or summe
of what hath beene said of Gods power in crea∣ting
the world, or of the reservation of this free
power unto himselfe to alter, to innovate or a∣mend
the estate wherein he hath hitherto preser∣ved
it; I cannot exhibite this generall</HI> view <HI>more
clearly or more succinctly than</HI> Iustin Martyr <HI>hath
done in his answer to the fourth question of the
Grecians. The question was thus proposed, [An
Deus faciat, feceritve, facturusve sit: Et si facit,
suaptene voluntare, an praeter voluntatem?]</HI> Whe∣ther
God do make the things that are, whether hee
hath made the things that have beene, whether hee
will make other things which yet are not, or the things
which are, after a better manner than as yet they have
beene made: or if he be or hath beene a maker, or con∣tinue
to make things better, whether he do all this out
of his owne free will, or besides his will. <HI>His full an∣swer
to this question is,</HI> Fecit Deus, &amp; facit, &amp;
facturus est, suapte sponte &amp; voluntate: nam creatu∣ram
ipse condidit, quae antehac non fuerat, volens.
Eam providentia sua in eo ut sit, conservat: quod
quidem est, facit. Quam etiam instauraturus est, &amp;
in statum meliorem redacturus per restitutionem sive
renovationem: quod est facturus est: ut repurget
cam ab absurditate omni, ex rationalium ignavia
contracta. Non quod per judicii considerationem &amp;
deliberationem posterius id quod melius sit, invenerit;
sed quod longe antea &amp; prius quam mundum condi∣dit,
<PB N="86" REF="172"/>
constitutum habuerit ut faceret. Neque enim
possibile est ut vel ad notionem vel ad potentiam, Deo
posterius quidquam accedat, quod prius non habuerit.
Volentem autem Deum mundum creasse, illud est do∣cumento,
quod cum Deus potuerit plures efficere soles,
non plures, sed unum duntaxat effecerit. Nam qui
plures non potest condere soles, neque unum condere
potest: &amp; qui unum solem creare potuit, necessario
quoque plures creare potuit. Quomodo igitur quos
facere potuit plures soles, Deus non fecit, nisi certe
quod plures soles facere noluit? Sin quos non fecit
soles, voluntate non fecit: perspicuam utique fuerit,
cum etiam quem fecit, voluntate fecisse. Et veluti
sol, ita &amp; reliquae creaturae partes omnes, quae vel ob∣noxiae
vel non obnoxiae sunt corruptibilitati, ex vo∣luntate
Dei &amp; id quod sint, &amp; id quod hujusmodi

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing the summe of what wee are to beleeve in
this Article of Creation, and of the duties where∣to
it binds us: with an introduction to the Article
of His providence.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O beleeve that God is the maker
of Heaven and Earth, and of all
things visible and invisible, in∣cludes
in it an acknowledge∣ment
not onely of the six dayes
worke, but that he still makes all
things that are, and shal make all things which here∣after
shall be. So long as any thing which hath
beene continues in beeing, so long as any thing
which now is not, shall beginne or not cease to be,
so long the Almighty continues a Maker. And in
as much as some things which are made, or which
hereafter shall be made, shall have no end, he con∣tinues
an everlasting Maker. This title of Maker
is none of his Eternall Attributes, but a denomina∣tion
ascribed unto him from his workes which all
had their beginning in time, or rather with time,
or with duration finite or numerable. It is an ever∣lasting
Attribute, for that properly is everlasting,
which though it have beginning yet it hath no end.
But albeit the acts or exercises of his will or power
had a beginning with the world, (for they are al∣wayes
in the creature or effect) yet his will and pur∣pose
to make the world are eternall: So is the po∣wer
by which he made it, so is the combination
<PB N="88" REF="173"/>
of all these, to wit, his providence, by which hee
orders and governes all things, coeternall to his es∣sence.
All moderne controversies to my knowledge
account it an heathenish solecism to say, God only
did make or hath made the world and all things in
it, he doth not now make them. For this were to
deny the necessity of his everlasting worke in pre∣serving,
supporting, and continuing all things in
their proper being. And to deny this, would bee
more than a solecisme of speech, a reall branch of
infidelity. Is it then a lesse solecisme of speech to
say, or a smaller portion of infidelity to thinke, that
God only hath decreed before all times what shall
fall out in time, but doth not now decree nor shall
any thing hereafter be decreed by him? Question∣lesse,
if his decree be coeternall to his power, the
same with his will or purpose, if hee cease not to
worke or will, he ceaseth not to worke or decree.
He did decree to worke when he did not worke, or
produce any effect <HI>ad extra,</HI> but hee never produ∣ced
any effect or worke when hee did not decree.
For he worketh all things by the Counsell of his
will, not by the Counsell of his will as past and en∣ded,
but by the Counsell of his will, which was,
which is, and which is to come. And he decreeth
all things for the times present after the selfe same
manner that he decreed them from eternity, other∣wise
his decree were not eternall, could have no re∣semblance
of eternity. To infer that Gods decree
is an act past, or that God doth not now decree,
because he hath decreed al things before all worlds,
is a solecisme or ignorance, to say no worse, of the
<PB N="89" REF="173"/>
same nature, quality &amp; scantling, as if you shold say,
God was before the world was, therefore God is
not since the world was, nor shall be after the end
of this world. For the world could neither begin,
continue, nor cease to be, but by his eternall and ir∣resistible
decree, which neither hath beginning
nor end, nor can admit any interposition of change.
It is true, that if we consider the Deity in himselfe
or his decree as it is in him, or the same with him,
there is neither <HI>praeteritum</HI> nor <HI>futurum,</HI> no such
difference in them as wee character or notifie by
these termes <HI>past</HI> or <HI>to come:</HI> yet if wee consider
God or his eternall Decree, as they include a refe∣rence
of precedency to things temporall, past, or to
come, or as times current have coexistence with
him, wee may not deny that God was before all
times, and did decree things to come, that he is in
all times current, and doth decree the issue of times
present or ensuing. Thus in all times, and in all
places, the Almighty Father is present with us, pre∣sent
in us, as our maker and preserver, present by
his eternall providence to order and governe us.
And the government of the world, specially of
Men and Angels, is in true Divinity, the proper
object of the Eternall Decree. And if God be thus
with us, nothing can goe amisse with us, save only
by our ignorance, by our misbeleefe or weake be∣leefe
of this first Article.</P>
<P>2 The true, that is, the firme and sound beleefe
of every morall or sacred truth, specially of such
fundamental truths as are contained in this Article,
alwayes include a correspondency in the beleever
<PB N="90" REF="174"/>
unto the thing beleeved. And this corresponden∣cie
must have its place, not in the braine or appre∣hensive
faculty onely, but in the affection. The
sympathy of affection unto the thing beleeved, re∣sults
from the impression which the speculative
<HI>forme</HI> or representation in the braine makes upon
the heart, which is the seat of the affection. The
<HI>meanes</HI> subordinate to the Spirit of God for ma∣king
this impression, are two: A right explication
or branching of the article or object to be belee∣ved:
&amp; a serious and frequent meditation upon the
object rightly branched, or a taking not of the truth
onely, but the consequences of it into deepe and
setled consideration; or as we say, a laying of both
to heart. The maine branches of this Article are
three: First, that God is the maker of all men that
are, not of <HI>Adam</HI> onely. Secondly, that he is the
preserver of all. Thirdly, that he perpetually or∣dereth
and governeth all things, even the thoughts
of men, by the irresistible uncessant working of his
Omnipotent decree or will. In our beleefe of the
two first branches (bee it lesse or more, weake or
strong) so it be uniforme, it is <HI>essentially</HI> included,
that God is good to all, in that he hath given life
and being unto all. Of this his goodnesse no man
can want store of witnesses, so long as either he in∣joyes
himselfe or the necessary supplyes of life.
One speciall duty, whereunto the beleefe of this
Article doth immediately bind all men, is expresly
commended to us by our Saviour, <HI>Matth. 6.</HI> The
generall neglect whereof is more than sufficient to
condemne not the Heathens or Infidels onely, but
<PB N="91" REF="174"/>
the greatest part of such as professe the Christian
Faith, of infidelity: <HI>Take no thought for your life,
what ye shall eate, or what ye shall drinke, nor yet for
your body what you shall put on. Is not the life more
than meat? and the body than rayment?</HI> It is a sin
for him which beleeves that God hath given him
that life and being which he hath, not to beleeve
that God did give him both for his greater good,
or that he will not increase his blessings upon him,
so he doe not distrust his fatherly care and provi∣dence:
A greater sinne it is to suspect or question,
whether God have not a more fatherly care over
all men, than he hath over other creatures. So our
Saviour addes, <HI>Behold the fowles of the ayre: For
they sow not, neither doe they reape, nor gather into
barnes, yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are
ye not much better then they?</HI> In that God hath gi∣ven
man a better kind of life and being than the
fowles of the ayre; this is an undoubted pledge
unto all, that he hath prepared far better food for
them than for birds and beasts, an everlasting food;
so they do not distrust his providence. And as hee
provideth better food for man than for beast, so
hath he better rayment for them in store, than he
hath for vegetables; so they will seeke it from him,
and not be their owne carvers. <HI>Which of you by ta∣king
thought can add one cubit unto his stature? And
why take ye thought for rayment? Consider the Lillies
of the field, how they grow; they toyle not, neither do
they spin. And yet I say unto you that even Salomon
in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these: wher∣fore
if God so cloath the grasse of the field, which to
<PB N="92" REF="175"/>
day is and to morrow is cast into the Oven; shall hee
not much more cloath you, O ye of little faith.</HI> That
to distrust Gods providence or doubt of his love,
of such love as is ready to bestow better rayment
upon them than <HI>Salomon</HI> in all his royalty had, is a
point of infidelity, is included in our Saviours infe∣rence
or conclusion: <HI>Therefore take no thought, say∣ing,
What shall we eate? or what shall we drinke? or
wherewithall shall we be cloathed? For after all these
things do the Gentiles seeke. For your heavenly Fa∣ther
knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</HI> Is
it then unlawfull to make any thing which the Gen∣tiles
sought after, any part of our care? No, the
Gentiles after their fashion, sought after God, who
(as the Apostle saith) <HI>giveth to all life and breath
and all things,</HI> even to the Gentiles, <HI>that they should
seeke the Lord: if happely they might feele after him
and finde him. Acts 17. 25, 27.</HI> The onely reason
why they did not find him, was because they
sought him amisse. And the reason why they
sought him amiss was their ignorance of this truth
which our Saviour and S. <HI>Paul</HI> hath taught, to wit,
that God did give the very Gentiles themselves
food and rayment, with other necessaries of life,
even life it selfe, with all its contentments, to the
end that they might seeke him and taste his good∣nesse.
But they ran counter, and sought only after
those things which were good not in themselves,
but as they were pledges of his goodnesse. And
the more eagerly they thus sought after these tem∣porall
good things, the further they ran from the
Fountaine of goodness, which alone must sweeten
<PB N="93" REF="175"/>
the best things we can desire, and season our soules
for the right entertainment or fruition of them.</P>
<P>3 Our speculative assent unto this Article, or
approbation of this truth, whereof these Gentiles
were ignorant, will rather aggravate than mitigate
our Saviours censure of them; if we be as greedy
seekers after the necessities of life, or as solicitous
hunters after superfluities, as the Gentiles were.
The distinctions or divisions of <HI>care,</HI> with annota∣tions
what kinde of care, is by our Saviour forbid∣den,
what allowed of, are easie to be found almost
in every Writer, especially in the Expositors of
that 6. chapter of <HI>Matthew.</HI> But whether through
the default of hearers or of teachers, or respective∣ly
of both: too much liberty is every where taken
for employing the greatest part of mens times and
indeavours in providing things of this life. Not∣withstanding
all the prohibitions which have been
given by our Saviour to the contrary: <HI>Covetous∣nesse</HI>
and <HI>ambition,</HI> the two grand enemies of be∣leefe
in God and his loving providence, have no
where in any age thriven better, than amongst zea∣lous
Christian professors in these later times. And
which is most to be lamented, Scripture is secretly
opposed to Scripture for justifying or countenan∣cing
unchristian care of wordly matters. The war∣rant,
which many take to themselves from the
mistaken sense of one place in S.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 5▪ 8</NOTE> <HI>Paul, He that pro∣videth
not for his family is worse then an Infidell,</HI> is
used as a <HI>countermand</HI> to our Saviours prohibition.
For the right limitation whereof, the onely caveat
which I have to commend unto the Reader, is this,
<PB N="94" REF="176"/>
As S. <HI>Paul,</HI> how mightily soever he debase workes,
not ceremoniall onely, but morall, doth never de∣nie
their use or necessity either for attaining to
justification, or for making our Election sure, but
onely seeks to strengthen our relyance upon Gods
mercies in Christ by denyall of our selves, and of
the best works w<SUP>ch</SUP> we can do, whether before rege∣neration
or after: so our Saviour, albeit he seeme
universally to forbid all care of minding temporall
contentments, yet in deed and reall meaning, for∣bids
us onely to place any part of our hopes or con∣fidence
in our owne endeavours. He doth not sim∣ply
forbid all care of things temporall, but so farre
onely as it is an hindrance to our care and watch∣fulnesse
for trying and tasting the goodnesse of
God, or as it weakens our relyance upon his father∣ly
providence. If we be watchfull in prayer, and
frequent in meditations upon Gods goodnesse al∣ready
experienced, our care of heavenly things and
estimate of Gods goodnesse will better teach every
one of us in his severall calling, the right limitation
of his domestique cares, than any generall rule
which can be gathered from the nature, quality, or
quantity of cares. For conclusion, he which for∣bids
us to take care for the morrow, commands us
to pray this day for to morrowes bread, that is, to
pray every day for the good successe or blessings
of the dayes following, with all attention and
watchfulnesse.</P>
<P>4 Another fundamentall duty, and one of the
most formall effects of faith, as it respects this Ar∣ticle,
is that of the Preacher, <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI> the 12.
<PB N="95" REF="176"/>
vers. 1. <HI>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of
thy youth.</HI> But why is this duty in particular prest
upon youth? Because the prints of Gods creative
power are then most fresh in our nature, and might
transmit a fairer copy or truer estimate of the Crea∣tors
goodnesse unto old age, than old age can take
any: so young men by often reflecting upon the
present comforts of health and strength, upon the
activity of body, the quicknesse of sense and spirit,
would ingrosse them deeply in their memories.
Youth then is the fittest season for estimating the
benefits of Creation, and old age the choicest time
for surveying our unthankfulnesse to our Creator.
If the former contentments of youth, with the
comforts which accompany our best thoughts
and actions, were truly calculated in our fresh and
choicest daies, and rightly waighed upon their pro∣per
center, our thankfulnesse would reciprocate
upon the Fountaine from which they flow, and be
returned to their doner in a measure equiponde∣rant
to their waight upon our soules. And nothing
but want of thankfulnesse in such as have tasted the
ordinary benefits of Creation, can hinder the de∣scent
of Gods choice of blessings in great abun∣dance.
Would we but sequester that delight which
we take in health and strength from our selves, and
surrender it wholly into his hands that gave it, he
is still ready to renew and better our present and
former estate. Did we empty our hearts of pride,
of selfe-delight, or complacency, by powring
forth such joyfull thanks giving as the Psalmist
doth, It is he that hath made us, and not wee our
<PB N="96" REF="177"/>
selves: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is he that gives us all those good things
wherein we joy, we did not receive them from our
friends or parents, wee cannot take them to our
selves: the same Lord, as the Psalmist elsewhere
avoucheth, would give us our hearts desire, even
fill our hearts with joy and gladnesse which shall
never saile or decrease. This is his sole and proper
gift, for though we could take unto our selves all
the temporary contentments of transitory plea∣sures,
which either our hearts could wish, or our
inventions calculate, yet should wee not have our
hearts desire, so long as we fixe our delight either
in the things enjoyed, or in the enjoying of them,
and not in the Lord which gave them unto us, and
us power to enjoy them.</P>
<P>From thus delighting in the Lord, or from ren∣dring
according to the benefits bestowed upon us,
the generall withdrawments are but two. First, an
over prizing of such externalls as procure or in∣crease
our contentments. Secondly, an ouervalu∣ing
the feare or dread of mens persons, or other
externalls which seeme to menace disgrace, vexa∣tion,
or torment unto us, if we should doe as in our
calmest thoughts we often desire to doe. The sini∣ster
sway of both temptations or withdrawments
from the duties commended unto us, cannot be
otherwise counterpoized than by taking the last
branch of this Article into deepe and serious con∣sideration.
The last branch was, that God doth
nor onely make and preserve us, but doth withall
perpetually order, direct, and governe both us and
all the externalls which we love or feare, by his all-seeing,
<PB N="97" REF="177"/>
ever-working Decree or Counsell. If our
soules or senses have for once or twice beene over∣joyed
with the possession of any externalls or in∣strumentall
causes of contentment, let us call to
minde, that as the Almighty Creator gives both
us and them their being, so hee likewise stints and
limits as well their operations, as our capacities to
receive their impressions at his pleasure. The same
externalls which formerly wrought our comfort
or contentments, may procure our griefe and mi∣sery
by too much or unseasonable familiarity with
them, or fruition of them. If in feare or dread of
evill menaced by man, or represented to us by fire,
by sword, or other unruly instruments of wrath or
vengeance, wee cannot hope that the Almighty
Creator will by miracle abate their strength, or in∣hibit
the exercise of their native qualities or dispo∣sitions,
as he did in <HI>Daniel</HI> and the three childrens
cases; yet unlesse our faith in the last branch of this
Article faile, it will confirme us in this resolution,
that he can and will so contrive the concurrence of
hurtfull agents, as they shall become instruments
of greater good to such as love him, and in tempta∣tions
adhere unto him. The rule or Maxime is uni∣versally
true: No agent or instrument, whether
of temporall harme or comfort, whether of joy or
griefe, can worke any other wayes or any further
than he by his Eternall Decree or Providence hath
appointed it for the present to worke. And in that
promise made unto us by our Apostle, <HI>That hee
will not suffer us to bee tempted above our strength;</HI>
it is included that he will so restraine or abate the
<PB N="98" REF="178"/>
force and efficacy of all second causes, as they shall
not conquer our patience or quell the comfort of
our unwounded conscience.</P>

<PB N="99" REF="178"/>
sollicitous not to speake amisse,) make no scruple
of entertaining these and the like inferences follow∣ing,
as naturally descending from the former Ma∣xime:
<HI>[It is impossible ought should fall out other∣wise
than it doth: all things in respect of God and
his Omnipotent Decree, are necessary: Contingencie
is but a solecisme of secular language, or if any thing
may without offence be termed contingent, it must be
reputed such, onely with reference to second causes.]</HI></P>
<P>2 Howbeit such good men as doe thus write
and speake, will give us leave (I know) to take it in
the first place as granted, that God is wiser than we
are, and knowes the nature of all things and their
differences better than they or we doe. This being
granted, we will in the second place suppose that
Contingency is not a meere fictitious name of that
which is not, as <HI>Tragelaphus;</HI> nor altogether Syno∣nymall
to Necessity. The question about <HI>Contin∣gency,</HI>
and of its difference from necessity, is not
such as one in merriment once proposed in schools;
<HI>An chimera calcitrans in vacuo terat calceos:</HI> The
very names of <HI>Contingency</HI> and <HI>Necessity</HI> to ordi∣nary
Latinists differ more than <HI>Ensis</HI> and <HI>Gladius,</HI>
than <HI>Vestis</HI> and <HI>Indumentum,</HI> betwixt which per∣haps
the ancient Latine Artificers or <HI>Nomencla∣tors</HI>
knew some difference. Yet was it impossible
for them to know any thing which God knew not,
who out of all controversie knowes the true diffe∣rence
betweene <HI>Contingency</HI> and <HI>Necessity,</HI> much
better then we can doe. For both of them are En∣tities
of his making, and serve as different Lawes
to the diversity of his creatures, or their different
<PB N="100" REF="179"/>
actions. All the reasons that can be drawne from
the immutability of Gods Decree to the contrary,
may with greater facility and strength of the same
Decree be retorted than brought against us. For
God immutably decrees mutability. Now who
will say that things mutable, are in respect of Gods
decree or knowledge immutable? The Heavens
and other bodies moveable according to locall mo∣tion,
are truly moveable in themselves, absolutely
moveable, not immoveable in respect of Gods de∣cree
or knowledge: for he knowes them to bee
moveable, because he decreed them so to be; hee
doth not know them to be immoveable because he
decreed them not to be such, unlesse for a time by
interposition of miracle. It implies lesse contra∣diction,
to say, <HI>Deus immutabiliter decernit muta∣bilia,</HI>
than to say (which hath beene accounted an
ancient orthodoxall Maxime,) <HI>Stabilis dat cuncta
movere.</HI> For <HI>Mobility</HI> is a branch of <HI>Mutability.</HI></P>
<P>3 Every thing in respect of Gods decree or
knowledge is altogether such as God hath decreed
it should be.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what good sense all things may be said necessary in respect of Gods decree.</NOTE> If then God hath decreed there should
be <HI>contingency,</HI> as well as <HI>necessity;</HI> it is altogether
as necessary that some events should be contingent
as others necessary: and as truly contingent as the
other is necessary in respect of Gods decree.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See chap. 22. parag. 2.</NOTE> Albeit
to speake properly, the natures of contingency and
necessity consist not in meere <HI>relation</HI> or <HI>respect.</HI>
For in as much as both are immediate and re∣all
effects of Divine Omnipotency; both must have
absolute being, the being of neither is meerly <HI>re∣lative.</HI>
Now if Contingency have a true and ab∣solute
<PB N="101" REF="179"/>
being, it is neither constituted in the nature
of contingency by any respect or relation to se∣cond
causes, nor can any respect or relation to
the first cause deprive it of that absolute nature,
which the Omnipotent efficacy of the cause of cau∣ses
hath irrevocably bestowed upon it. Briefly, if
Contingency be any thing, it is that which it is by
the Omnipotent Decree; and being such, it is alto∣gether
as impossible that some effects should not
be absolutely contingent, as that such effects as the
Divine Decree hath appointed to bee necessary,
should not be at all. Or if we would make impar∣tiall
inquiry into the originall of all things, nothing
without the precincts of the most glorious and
ever blessed Trinity, is absolutely necessary.</P>
<P>4 By <HI>Contingency</HI> (lest haply we might be mis∣taken)
we understand the <HI>possible meane</HI> betweene
necessity of being and necessity of not being, or of
being such, or of not being such; or betweene ne∣cessity
of doing, and necessity of not doing, or ne∣cessity
of being done, or necessity of being left un∣done.
This <HI>meane</HI> betweene necessity of doing,
and necessity of not doing, is that which in agents
intellectuall, as in men and Angells wee call free∣dome
of will or choice. Vnto which freedome,
necessity is as contradictory, as irrationability is to
the nature of man, and contingency as necessarily
presupposed as life and sense are to reason. Adde
reason to contingency, and we have the compleat
definition of Free-will. In those cases wherein the
Creator hath exempted man from restraint of ne∣cessity,
his will is free. The divine will it selfe is
<PB N="102" REF="180"/>
not free in those operations which are essentiall,
though most delectable. God the Father is more
delighted in the eternall generation of his Sonne:
so is God the Father and the Sonne in the eternall
procession of the Holy Ghost; than in the creati∣on,
production, or preservation of all the creatures.
Yet are not these or other internall operations of
the blessed Trinity so <HI>free</HI> in respect of the divine
nature, as is the production of the world. What∣soever
God decrees he decrees it freely, that is, so
as he might not decree it. Whatsoever he makes
he makes it freely, that is, he so makes it, as that it
was not necessary for him to make it.</P>

<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is an unquestionable rule in the Art
of Arts, that propositions, for their
forme not incompatible, may from
the necessity of their matter or sub∣ject,
become equivalent to proposi∣tions
directly contradictory; whose indispensable
law or rule it is, that if the one be true, the other
must needs be false, they admit of no meane be∣twixt
them. Now there is no matter or subject in
the world, which is so absolutely necessary, as the
existence of the Divine Nature, or the internall
operations of the Trinity. Whence it is, that be∣tweene
<PB N="103" REF="180"/>
these two propositions <HI>[The generation of
the Sonne, is necessary, the not generation of the Son
is necessary.]</HI> there is no possible meane which can
be capable of truth. The first is so absolutely ne∣cessary,
and so necessarily true, that the latter is e∣ternally
false. But such is not the case or conditi∣on
of these two propositions following: <HI>[The
Creation or Existence of the World is necessary: The
not Creation or non existence of the World is necessa∣rie.]</HI>
These are not contradictories for their form,
nor equivalent to contradictories for their matter
or subject, and therefore may admit a meane be∣tweene
them. To say the creation or existence of
the world was absolutely necessary, hath no truth
in it: for it had a beginning of existence and being,
and may have an end: and the other extreame or
contrary <HI>[The not creation or non existence of the
world is absolutely necessary,]</HI> hath lesse appearance
of truth in it. It remaines then, that the two con∣tradictorie
propositions to these false ones, must be
true. The contradictory to the former is this:
<HI>[The creation or existence of the world is not abso∣lutely
necessarie.]</HI> The contradictory to the lat∣ter
is this▪ <HI>[The not creation or non existence of the
World is not absolutely necessary.]</HI> Now seeing the
world is created, and yet it was not necessary that
it should be created: both these propositions fol∣lowing
(seeing either of them is a true meane be∣tweene
the two former extreames or false ones,)
are most true: <HI>[1 The creation of the world was
possible, 2 The not creation of the world was possible.]</HI>
And if as well the not creation, as the creation of
<PB N="104" REF="181"/>
the world, was possible; wee may not deny that
God did freely create it: seeing freedome pro∣perly
taken, includes or is a possibility of doing or
not doing. It was likewise free for the Almighty, to
create or not to create Man or Angell. But his free
purpose to create them after his owne Image be∣ing
supposed: it was not meerly possible, but al∣together
necessary that they should bee created
good. In as much as he is goodnesse it selfe, it is
not possible that evill should bee created by him,
that he should be the Author of it. As is his being,
so is his goodnesse, perpetually absolute, eternally
necessary. But though Men and Angels were ne∣cessarily
created good, yet their goodnesse in the
beginning was mutable, not perpetually necessa∣rie.
The question is, whether continuance in that
goodnesse, wherein God created them, were tru∣ly
possible in respect of Gods decree, unto such as
have not so continued, or their non continuance
necessary: Or whether, neither their continuance
or non continuance were necessary, or both alike
possible. To say that <HI>Adams</HI> continuance in good∣nesse
was, in respect of Gods decree, necessary, is
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vidently convinced of falshood by his fall. So that
the other part onely remaines questionable, whe∣ther
<HI>Adams</HI> non continuance in the state of good∣nesse,
were so absolutely decreed by God, that it
was not possible for him to continue. For resolu∣tion
of this point, we are to inquire, First, whe∣ther
in respect of Gods power it were possible.
Secondly, whether in respect of his goodnesse it
were necessary or most congruent, to ordaine or
<PB N="105" REF="181"/>
decree neither a necessitie of continuance, nor a
necessitie of non continuance in goodnesse; but
the meane betweene them, that is, an absolute
possibilitie of continuance, and an absolute pos∣sibilitie
of non continuance. That it was pos∣sible
to decree such a mutuall possibilitie, may
thus be proved.</P>
<P>2. Whatsoever implies no contradiction, is ab∣solutely
possible, and fals within the object of om∣nipotencie.
But this mixt possibilitie of <HI>continu∣ing</HI>
or <HI>not continuing,</HI> being a meane betwixt the
necessitie of <HI>Adams continuance,</HI> and the necessi∣tie
of <HI>not continuance</HI> in the state of integritie, im∣plies
no contradiction: <HI>Ergo,</HI> it was possible for
God to decree it. That it implies no contradicti∣on
in respect of the <HI>forme,</HI> is a point so cleare from
the first principles of <HI>argumentation▪</HI> that hee
which vnderstands not this, is neither fit to dis∣pute,
nor to be disputed with. But the same <HI>forme</HI>
(notwithstanding) of contrarietie applied to the
divine nature, the persons in Trinitie, or their in∣ternall
operations, admits no <HI>meane.</HI> What is the
reason? The nature and <HI>attributes</HI> of the <HI>Deitie</HI>
are <HI>absolutely</HI> necessary and precedent to all divine
decrees or effects of Gods power. And it im∣plies
a contradiction, that any thing which is ab∣solutely
<HI>necessarie,</HI> should admit any mixture of
contingency, or of possibilitie of the contrary.
But the <HI>nature, state, condition,</HI> or <HI>existence</HI> of man,
are not proper obiects of the divine decree, yet
proper effects of his power, and being such, they
are not absolutely necessary; and not being neces∣sary
<PB N="106" REF="182"/>
in themselves, they cannot <HI>incomber</HI> or <HI>involve</HI>
propositions, for their <HI>forme,</HI> not necessarie with
absolute necessitie. Whatsoever had a true possi∣bilitie
of beeing before it was, may bee actually
such as it was absolutely possible for it to be, or such
as it might please the Almightie Creator (who
is free in all his actions <HI>ad extra)</HI> to make it. It was
possible for him to make mans goodnesse or his
continuance in it, not to be necessary, but contin∣gent.
He that made man of <HI>nothing,</HI> had nothing
to resist or hinder him from <HI>squaring</HI> or <HI>framing</HI>
his <HI>nature,</HI> to that <HI>abstract forme</HI> of truth which was
in its selfe, or (as we say) <HI>objectively possible.</HI> For
absolute <HI>Omnipotencie</HI> includes an abilitie to <HI>in∣grosse</HI>
or fill meere logicall possibilities, with true
and Physicall substances or qualities, as truely an∣swerable
unto them, as naturall <HI>bodies</HI> are to <HI>bo∣dies</HI>
mathematicall. But concerning Gods power
to decree an absolute contingencie in the state,
Condition, or Actions of men, there can bee no
question amongst such as grant his <HI>Omnipotencie</HI>
to be out of question. What could necessitate his
will to lay a necessitie of sinning upon <HI>Adam,</HI>
whose fall or first sinne, if it were necessary in re∣spect
of Gods decree, the necessitie must needs
proceed from Gods Omnipotent decree, without
which nothing can haue any reall possibilitie or
true title of beeing, much lesse a <HI>necessitie</HI> of bee∣ing.
For Divine Omnipotencie is the first and sole
<HI>Foundation</HI> of all <HI>Beeing,</HI> otherwise then by it; and
from it nothing can come to passe either necessa∣rily
or contingently.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="182"/>
3. Whatsoeuer is and hath not beene, must of
necessitie have some cause of now beeing. And
as is the event or effect, such must the causalty bee.
If the one be necessarie or inevitable, it is impossi∣ble
the other should bee contingent or meerely
possible. Both, or neither, must bee necessarie.
Man we suppose did once stand upright, his <HI>first
sinne</HI> or fall, <HI>That</HI> action what soever it were, which
brought him downe, the evils which thence en∣sued,
are not meere <HI>nothing:</HI> Evill it selfe got
some kinde of beeing by his negligence, which
from the beginning it had not. Of all, or any of
these, the question still <HI>revolves,</HI> whether they
were necessary or not necessarie, but <HI>Contingent.</HI>
If <HI>Contingent,</HI> we have no more to say, but Gods
peace be on them, which so speake and thinke: If
any reply, that they were necessarie, he must assigne
a necessary cause of their beeing. For without
some cause they could not be, and without a ne∣cessitating
cause, there was no necessitie that they
should bee. Was this <HI>supposed</HI> necessitie then
from man or from God? from any second cause,
or from the first cause of all things? if from man
onely or from other second causes; then were
they necessary not in respect of the first cause, but
in respect of the second: that is, some second cause
did make them necessarie, when as the first cause
had left them free, or meerely possible; which to
affirme is contrary to their positions, with whom
we dispute, and in it selfe unconceiveable. For
who can make that <HI>necessarie,</HI> which God hath
made contingent or subject to <HI>change?</HI> What can
<PB N="108" REF="183"/>
be said then? that God did <HI>make</HI> mans fall, his first
sinne or <HI>appetite</HI> of the forbidden fruite, to bee ne∣cessarie,
or necessitate his will in his sinister choy∣ces?
This were all one, as to say, that God were
the immediate and <HI>necessarie</HI> cause of sinne, of
death, of all the <HI>evills</HI> that have befallen mankinde
since <HI>Adam.</HI> For he is the <HI>sole immediate</HI> and ne∣cessarie
cause of all things which hee so decrees as
they cannot possibly fall out otherwise. For him
to erre in decreeing, or for the execution of his
decree to bee defeated, is impossible. In respect of
his proper and adaequate object, and peremptorily
intended <HI>effect,</HI> his will is a more irresistible, more
powerfully <HI>necessitating</HI> cause, than any other cause
whatsoever. Now if Gods <HI>will</HI> had beene, to leave
no possibility for <HI>Adams</HI> perserverance, his <HI>fall</HI> had
beene the compleat object of Gods decree con∣cerning
our first estate, and by consequence
Gods <HI>decree,</HI> or <HI>will</HI> had beene the first cause of
<HI>sinnes</HI> first entrance into the world.</P>

this necessitie they derived from an evill <HI>Author,</HI>
from a prime cause or <HI>Creator</HI> of evill onely, not
of any thing that was good. And better it is (for it
is more consonant to our Saviours advise) to ac∣knowledge

then those which hold <HI>evill</HI> to be <HI>necessary</HI> in

good. In fine, the <HI>Manichees</HI> were grosse hae∣retiques
in holding evill and mischiefe to fall out
by inevitable necessitie; but this heresie once ad∣mitted,
it was rather a consonancy of error, then a∣ny
addition of new heresie, to admit two prime
<HI>causes</HI> or Creators, the one of good, the other of
evill. They durst not slander <HI>goodnesse</HI> with any
crime, or for being the Author of any thing that
was not <HI>good:</HI> nor were they disposed to flatter
greatnesse, as if <HI>evill</HI> were <HI>no evill,</HI> because it pro∣ceeded
from it.</P>
<P>2. That which the Ancients reprooved in the
<HI>Stoicks</HI> opinion, as most injurious to God and all
good men, was, that they held all things (and e∣vill
things amongst the rest) to fall out by <HI>fate</HI> or
<PB N="111" REF="184"/>
unavoydable <HI>necessitie.</HI> This foundation being
once laied, the rootes of vertue must utterly perish,
and that which we call <HI>vice</HI> should bee a meere
name, or matter of nothing: there is no place left
for just <HI>reward</HI> or <HI>punishment.</HI> Whether by <HI>fate</HI>
the <HI>Stoicks</HI> meant the influence of starres, the
course of nature, or the decree of GOD (who to
them was all one with Nature;) <HI>all</HI> was one in re∣spect
of the former inconveniences, which neces∣sarily
followed from admission of an inevitable
necessitie in humane actions, whence soever <HI>that</HI>
be derived. To say, it comes from the first cause,
or from the second, is meerly accidentall to the er∣ror
or inconvenience so sharply &amp; justly reproved
by the primitive Church. In respect of a Trades∣mans
commoditie, it is all one, whether he be pro∣hibited
for setting up or trafiquing, by the compa∣nie
of his own profession, or by some higher pow∣ers,
so the prohibition or restraint be as large &amp; pe∣remptorie,
without hope of release: or if he bee
restrained upon his allegiance by the Prince or
privy counsell, his hopes of thriving will be much
lesse, then if he were <HI>tied</HI> onely by the locall sta∣tutes
of some pettie Corporation. Thus if the
Stoick derived the necessitie of all things from the
revolution of the Heavens, or from other second
causes, as their supposed guides: the impossibili∣tie
of doing otherwise then we doe, was, in every
Christians conceipt, evidently much lesse, then if
we derive this necessitie from the <HI>Omnipotent de∣cree.</HI>
Now the danger or incenvenience of their
opinion, did <HI>formally</HI> consist, in nursing a conceipt
<PB N="112" REF="185"/>
in men, that it was impossible for them to doe o∣therwise
then they doe, or to avoyd the <HI>evills</HI> and
mischiefes into which they fall. And these dan∣gers
or inconveniences, are so much greater in
Christians then they were in the <HI>Stoicks;</HI> as the
God which wee acknowledge is more Omnipo∣tent,
then nature or the <HI>Stoicks</HI> god. For the more
Omnipotent he is, the more impossible is it for a∣ny
creature to avoid the necessitie which by <HI>his</HI>
decree is layed upon him.</P>
<P>3. In respect of the former inconveniences, or
of the opinion it selfe, it is meerely accidentall,
whether this necessity bee layed upon us by coa∣ction,
or willingly and cheerefully entertained by
us; whether it proceed from Gods power or im∣pulsion,
or from his wisdome: so our actions and
their issues, bee, in respect of his Omnipotent
power or will, alike unavoidable. If birds and
fishes could speake, I suppose the one would as
much complaine of those that in hard <HI>frost</HI> or
<HI>snow,</HI> allure them with baites to come within the
<HI>fall</HI> of the trappe, as the other would doe of Fish∣ers
for driving them violently into their nets. If
the birds once taken be used as hardly; their expo∣stulations
would be so much more just, as their
usage before their taking, was more kinde. To
make a man willing to undoe himselfe, upon faire
promises made, not with purpose to doe him
good, but to circumvent him; is greater cruelty
then can accompany open violence. Hee that wit∣tingly
ministers poyson instead of Physick, is in all
mens judgement, as true a Murderer, as hee that
<PB N="113" REF="185"/>
kils with the sword, albeit the partie to whom it
is ministred, having no reason to suspect any dan∣ger,
doe willingly drinke it. And the lesse suspiti∣ous
or more charitably affected hee is to his
professed Physitian, the greater wrong he hath in
being thus uncharitably dealt with. It would lit∣tle
boote the malefactor in this kinde, to plead;
Albeit <HI>I gave it him, hee might have chosen</HI> whe∣ther
he would have drunke it, because I did not in∣force
him with a drawen Dagger or other wea∣pon
to be his owne executioner. In many cases,
one may be the true cause of anothers death, and
deserve death himselfe, although he be not any <HI>ne∣cessarie
cause</HI> of his death, or plot his destruction
without possibilitie of avoidance. But if our <HI>wil∣ling</HI>
choyse of those waies which lead to death,
be necessarie in respect of the Almighties decree,
so that there be no possibilitie left, to escape it; hee
is a more necessarie and more immediate cause of
all their deaths that thus perish, then any man can
be of his death whom he poisons. And if the case
stood thus with any, their miserie were greater, by
how much they did lesse suspect his goodnesse:
However, most miserable, because most desperate.
Reason and knowledge (the two ornaments of the
humane nature) should be to them a curse. He that

crimes.</HI> But this is <HI>principium petere,</HI> to take that
for granted which is questioned. For, if the <HI>harmes</HI>
which malefactors do and suffer, be truly <HI>fatall;</HI> the
one is no true crime, the other is no just punish∣ment.
To <HI>Galen</HI> I answer, that if we could by any
skill in physick or complexions discerne some men
to bee as naturally disposed to <HI>mischiefe</HI> all that
come in their way, or by chance offend them; as are
the Snake, the Sloworm, or other serpent, it would
be the wisest way for such as love their lives, to rid
the world of these <HI>fatally</HI> mischievous reasonable
creatures, as fast as they met with them▪ or to ap∣point
some certaine daies for hunting them, as wee
do noysome beasts. But to examine their suspitious
<HI>intentions,</HI> to question their actions, to arraign their
persons, or put them upon a <HI>formall</HI> or legall tryall
of their life, would be as ridiculous, as to produce
<HI>witnesses</HI> against a Snake, to <HI>empannell</HI> a Iury upon a
mad Dog, or to take bale for a Wolfes appearance,
before a Butcher, in an assembly of Mastives.</P>
<P>5 The common <HI>notions</HI> of good and evill, &amp; the
ingraffed opinion of contingency in humane acti∣ons,
<PB N="116" REF="187"/>
have taught the Lawgivers of every nation, to
put notorious malefactors unto more exquisite tor∣tures,
than we do harmfull creatures; either to en∣force
them to utter, what no <HI>destiny</HI> nor complexi∣on
makes them voluntarily confesse, or else to de∣terre
others (that are as naturally disposed to evill,
as they were) from doing the like. Scarce any male∣factor
(unless he be <HI>poysoned</HI> with this opinion of
absolute necessity) but will acknowledge that it was
possible for him to have done otherwise thē he hath
done; possible for him to have avoided the doome,
which is passed upon him by man: which to have a∣voided
had been absolutely <HI>impossible,</HI> if it were to
be awarded upon him by Gods eternall decree, or
(which is all one) if in respect of this decree, it had
been necessary. As ignorance of the true God, and
his saving truth, makes the <HI>former</HI> error more ex∣cusable
in the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> than in such Christians as shal
maintain it: so might impotency exempt that God
which the <HI>Stoicks</HI> worshipped, (whether Nature,
<HI>Fate,</HI> or some other distinct celestiall <HI>power)</HI> from
those imputatiōs, unto which omnipotency makes
the God of Christians lyable, if all things were by
vertue of his decree absolutely necessary. It was a
received opinion among many Heathens, that the
gods themselves were subject unto <HI>Fate,</HI> &amp; for this
reason, when any thing fell out in their judgement
amiss; <HI>Fates</HI> commonly did either intirely bear the
blame, or the greatest part of it. And their gods (in∣deed)
had deserved pity rather than blame, if they
could do no better than they did, as being <HI>over∣mastered</HI>
by <HI>Fates.</HI> But for a Christian to inveigh a∣gainst
<PB N="117" REF="187"/>
<HI>Fates,</HI> is to accuse or deny his God. If <HI>Fates</HI>
be nothing, hee hath no reason to complaine of
them: if any thing they bee, they are of the true
Gods <HI>making,</HI> who made all things, who cannot
possibly be subject to any thing that he hath made.
Nor can it stand with our <HI>allegiance</HI> to say when any
disasters befall us, that our God could no other∣wise
choose, that our mischances were the abso∣lutely
necessary effects of his Omnipotent decree.
One speciall cause of this error, and of some mens
adherence to it, is a jealousie or zealous needlesse
feare, lest they should grant God to be impotent,
or not so omnipotent but that some things might
take possession of <HI>beeing</HI> without his leave or no∣tice.
The originall of this feare, is, want of di∣stinction,
betweene <HI>chance</HI> or <HI>casualty,</HI> and such
<HI>contingency</HI> as hath beene expressed.</P>
<P>6 Many reasons might be alledged sufficient to
demonstrate the inevitable absurdities of this sup∣posed
absolute necessity. But it is one labour to
convince an error before indifferent hearers; ano∣ther
to make men forsake the errours which have
long possessed them: a third to win them unto a
liking of the contrary truth. For effecting the two
latter, no meanes can be so effectuall in respect of
their disposition with whom we have to deale, as a
plaine declaration, how ill <HI>this opinion of absolute
necessity,</HI> how well <HI>this doctrine of mixt possibility
or contingency consorts:</HI> first with their owne re∣solution
of other difficulties in this very argu∣ment

that God did decree to <HI>permit</HI> his fall. But the

afford it none. <HI>Permission,</HI> to speake properly, is a

have eaten it. But their meaning haply is not, that
God did allow or approve his eating of it, seeing
he threatned it with death. But if, by his decree,
he did not allow it, he did <HI>permit</HI> it onely in such a
<HI>sense,</HI> as we may say the Lawes of our land, <HI>per∣mit</HI>
men to be hanged because they keepe not men
close <HI>prisoners,</HI> nor so tye their hands that they
cannot steale, <HI>rob</HI> or kill, before they bee suspected
or convicted of <HI>felonie,</HI> robbery, or <HI>murder.</HI> But▪
no tyrant did ever before hand forbid such a fact,
under paine of death, without a supposed naturall
possibility to avoid it. And just Lawes afford or∣dinary
or civill meanes for satisfying nature in ne∣cessities,
lest these (as they know no l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w) enforce
men to use their naturall possibilities or faculties
amisse. The lawes of this Land and others, which
make theft matter of death, permit men the free
<PB N="120" REF="189"/>
imployment of bodily faculties, to <HI>earne</HI> their
bread, or (if they be impotent) to crave or accept
the <HI>benevolence</HI> of others, lest they should perish
for hunger, or be enforced to steale. If our lawes
or Lawgivers, not permitting any of these meanes
or the like, should punish the taking of a loafe of
<HI>bread</HI> or cup of drinke, with death; they might be
more truly said to enjoyne, then permit theft;
to be more delighted with the bloud of the <HI>needy,</HI>
than with preservation of publike peace; albeit
they did not set other mens meat before thē, when
they are hungred, nor lead their hands to take it. In
like manner, he that saith, God did permit <HI>Adam</HI>
to eate the forbidden fruit, and by eating to in∣curre
death, doth necessarily imply, that God per∣mitted
him the free use of his externall and inter∣nall
faculties to satisfie his appetite, with some o∣ther
meate. Now the free use of any faculty in∣cludes
the <HI>concourse</HI> or <HI>cooperation</HI> of God, with∣out
which it is impossible any creature should
move. And this concourse was a part of his decree
or <HI>will</HI> as it concerned this <HI>act.</HI> More plainly: He
that permitted <HI>Adam</HI> to sinne, did more than per∣mit
him to abstaine from sinne, or to persevere in
obedience. If then God in <HI>permitting</HI> him onely
to sinne, did afford meanes necessary for reducing
this possibility of sinning into a sinfull act not al∣lowed;
his <HI>more</HI> than <HI>permission</HI> of him to abstaine
from sinne, <HI>his commandement to persevere in obedi∣ence,</HI>
did not onely suppose a true possibility for
him to abstaine and persevere, but include withall
better meanes for reducing this possibility into act,
<PB N="121" REF="189"/>
then were afforded for enabling him actually to
sinne. These two contrary possibilities, and the se∣verall
meanes for accomplishing them, must beare a
proportion answerable to a meere permission
without approbation, or to a prohibition, and to a
peremptorie command of civill authoritie. Now
every just Lawgiver affords better meanes and in∣couragement
for accomplishing his commands
or requests, then he doth for breaking or negle∣cting
them.</P>
<P>2▪ For conclusion, when they say God, by his
aeternall deree, did permit <HI>Adams fall,</HI> their mea∣ning
rightly expressed, is no more then this; God
did <HI>not</HI> decree that his <HI>perseverance</HI> should bee ne∣cessarie.
For <HI>necessitie</HI> of <HI>perseverance</HI> excludes
all possibility of falling. But if his fall had beene
<HI>necessarie</HI> in respect of the aeternall <HI>decree,</HI> it had
not onely beene <HI>permitted,</HI> but <HI>allowed</HI> and requi∣red.
It remaines then that both were possible,
neither necessary in respect of the divine decree.
Or to untwist the knot a little further; God by
his decree did <HI>permit</HI> and <HI>allow</HI> him a possibility
to fall; but he did not allow the reduction of this
possibility into act, that is, he gave it him, not to
the end that he should fal, but that his perseverance
might be more beneficiall. He did not onely per∣mit
or allow him a <HI>possibitie</HI> of perseverance, but
did command and require the reduction of this
possibilitie into act.</P>
<P>3 This forme of wholsome doctrine admitted,
will clearely <HI>enlighten</HI> the truth of another distin∣ction
or resolution much used, but mightily ob∣scured,
<PB N="122" REF="190"/>
or rather quite stifeled, by such as hold all
things necessary in respect of the aeternall decree.
The distinction is: <HI>God is the cause of every action,
but he is not the cause of the obliquitie which accom∣panies
sinfull actions, nor of sinne as it is sinne.</HI> This
is their last Apologie for avoyding that imputati∣on
of making God the author of sinne. Herein
wee both agree; The coexistence of the <HI>all-wor∣king</HI>
decree (or divine cooperation) is necessarily
required to every action or effect. Every action
includes a <HI>motion,</HI> and <HI>in him wee move, wee live,
and have our beeing.</HI> But hee that will grant this
<HI>cooperation</HI> or actuall coexistence of the all-wor∣king
decree to be the <HI>necessarie cause</HI> of every acti∣on,
unto which it is most necessarily required;
must, upon the same tearmes, grant, God to bee
not the <HI>necessarie</HI> onely, but the onely cause of all
and every <HI>obliquitie,</HI> of all and every sinne, of all
that hath beene, is, or can be <HI>blame-worthy</HI> in men
or <HI>devills,</HI> from their <HI>creation</HI> to euerlasting. The
demonstration of this inconvenience or absurdi∣ty,
wherewith we charge the adverse opinion (but
no maintainer of it) must be referred unto the dis∣cussions
of the <HI>state</HI> of <HI>Innocency</HI> and the manner
of sinnes entring into the world: we are now en∣gaged
to extract a better meaning out of their
other words, than they themselves expresse, or
can truely be contained in them, untill they aban∣don
the opinion of absolute necessity in humane
actions, as they have reference to the aeternall
decree.</P>
<P>Seeing it is agreed vpon, that God and man are
<PB N="123" REF="190"/>
joynt agents in every sinfull action, or in effects
<HI>essentially</HI> evill (such questionlesse was mans desire
to be like God, or his lusting after the forbiden
fruite:) The Probleme remaines, why both
should not be aequall sharers in the sinne: or how
it is possible justly to condemne men of iniquitie,
without some imputation unto God, who is the
principall agent in all actions. <HI>Shall wee bee partiall
for him or seeke to excuse him by his greatnesse?
Shall wee say hee cannot doe amisse, because he is su∣preame
Lord over all, and may doe with his creatures
what hee list?</HI> To such as count the donative of
robbers a true <HI>boone</HI> or reall curtesie; to such as
can magnifie their owne integrity, whereof they
give no proofe, save onely as he did by negatives,
(non hominem occidi,) <HI>I am no murtherer.</HI> The
Poet hath shaped an answere, as fit as pertinent,
(non pasces in cruce corvos,) <HI>Thou shalt not feede
Ravens upon a Gibbet.</HI> To say God is the Au∣thor
of sinne were hideous blasphemie: yet to say
he is no <HI>tempter,</HI> no seducer of mankind to evill,
is not to offer praise unto him. Let my spirit va∣nish
with my breath, and my immortall soule re∣turne
to nothing, rather then suffer her selfe to be
overtaken with such a dead slumber, as can rest
contented to set forth <HI>His Glory</HI> by <HI>bare negatives,</HI>
or by not being the Author of sinne, who is most
highly to be praised in all his works, whose good∣nesse
is infinitely greater in concurring to sinfull
actions, then the goodnesse of his best creatures
in the accomplishment of their most syncere
intentions.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="191"/>
4 The truth of this conclusion is necessarily
grounded upon these assertions hereafter to bee
discussed: <HI>That mans possibilitie or hopes of attai∣ning
everlasting happinesse, was of necessitie to bee
tempered with a possibilitie of sinning, or falling into
miserie.</HI> To permit or allow man this possibility of
sinning, &amp; to bestow upon him the contrary possi∣bility
of not sinning and hope of happines was one
&amp; the same <HI>branch</HI> of divine goodnesse. One &amp; the
selfe same branch of Gods goodnesse it was, to
allow this possibilitie of sinning, and to afford his
concourse for reducing of it into Act. For unlesse
he had decreed to afford his concourse thereto, it
had beene impossible for man actually to have sin∣ned.
And if for man to sinne had beene made im∣possible
by Gods decree: it had been alike impos∣sible
for him to have <HI>done well</HI> or ill, or to become
truly happy. Briefly, God in that hee decreed a
mixture of contrary possibilities, decreed withall
a concourse or cooperation <HI>sutable</HI> unto, and suf∣ficient
for the actuall accomplishment of both. To
the probleme propounded, the answere from these
grounds, is easie: <HI>Albeit God</HI> and man bee joynt
<HI>agents</HI> in every action or effect essentially <HI>evill,</HI>
yet the whole sinne is wholy mans: because the
nature of sinne consists either in mans using the
possibility of <HI>sinne</HI> allowed of God for his good,
to accomplish such acts, as God disallowes, or in
not using the contrary <HI>possibilitie</HI> unto such acts,
as he not onely alloweth and approveth, but re∣quireth
and commandeth, such as he most boun∣tifully
rewardeth, and unto whose accomplish∣ment,
<PB N="125" REF="191"/>
hee affordeth, not his ordinarie concourse
onely, but his speciall furtherance and assistance.
In every sin of commission, we approve and make
choice of those acts which his infinite goodnesse
disalloweth. In every sinne of omission, we do not
approve those acts, which he approveth: although
perhaps it may be questioned, whether there can
be any sinne of pure omission, or not mixt with
commission; that is, any sinne wherein we doe not
either like what God dislikes, or reject and con∣temne
what he likes &amp; cōmends unto us for good.</P>
<P>5 From these resolutions we may finde some
truth in an usuall position; which, without this
truth presupposed, is palpably false. <HI>Every action
or effect, as it is an effect or action, or as it proceeds
from God, is good.</HI> The best meaning whereof it is
capable, must be this; Gods goodnesse is seene in
every action, even in those which are most sinfull. To
vouchsafe his cooperation to <HI>them,</HI> is a branch
of his goodnesse, because man could not be happy
without a possibility of deserving to be miserable.
But humane actions or effects in their owne na∣ture,
indefinitely considered, or in the abstract as
they are actions, are neither morally good, nor mo∣rally
bad. When it is said that every action, as an
action, is good, this must be understood of transcen∣dentall
goodnes only, of w<SUP>ch</SUP> kind of goodnes mo∣ral
evill or sin it selfe is partaker. If every action, as
it is an actiō were morally good, it were impossible
any action shold be morally evill. If we consider hu∣mane
actions not indefinitely, or with this redupli∣cation,
as they are actions, but descending unto par∣ticulars,
<PB N="126" REF="192"/>
some <HI>are good,</HI> some <HI>are bad,</HI> and some <HI>(per∣haps)</HI>
positively indifferent, but of this hereafter.</P>

<P>This tenor or condition was to continue one
and the same throughout all generations. But
some generations, as the event hath proved, were
<HI>de facto</HI> partakers of the blessings promised; others
have had their portion in the curses. Shall wee
hence inferre, that prosperitie, was in respect of
GODS decree or good pleasure altogether
necessarie unto such as prospered, not so much as
possible unto those that perished, or that their
calamity was absolutely necessary? I would say ra∣ther,
&amp; I have Gods word, yea his heartie wishes,
for my warrant, that the most prosperous times,
which any of <HI>Abrahams</HI> or <HI>Davids</HI> posteritie en∣joyed,
did come farre short of that measure of pro∣speritie,
which by Gods aeternall decree, was pos∣sible
to all, even to the whole stocke of <HI>Iacob</HI>
throughout all their generations. <HI>O that my peo∣ple
had hearkned unto me: and Israel had walked in
my wayes! I should soone have subdued their ene∣mies,
and turned my hand against their adversaries.
The haters of the Lord should have submitted them∣selves
unto him: but their time should have endu∣red
for ever.</HI> Psal. 81. verse 13, 14, 15. But in what
estate? <HI>fed with the finest of the wheate, and satified
<PB N="131" REF="194"/>
with hony out of the Rocke.</HI> verse 16. Were these
meere wishes of <HI>winde</HI> which vanished with the
avouchers breath? did the Pslmist utter them
out of tender affection to his people and country,
without commission from his Maker? or was <HI>He</HI>
lesse affected towards his people then this his mes∣senger,
that his message wants the waight of ever∣lasting
truth? To these and the like demands, of
many bad answers, this is the best and most com∣mon:
<HI>God would undoubtedly have made his pro∣mise
good, and done aswell by Israell as here hee wish∣eth,
if Israell could have turned to him or done what
he requires.</HI> But that, say the same men, was in re∣pect
of Gods decree or secret will, <HI>impossible.</HI>
Whēce, seeing the condition neither was nor could
be performed by Israel, God was not bound to be∣stow
these blessings upon them, but free to reserve
his store unto himselfe, or for some other people;
which was profered (but upon conditions impos∣sible
to bee performed) unto Israell. Might not
churlish <HI>Naball</HI> have promised abundance of
bread, of wine and flesh to <HI>Davids</HI> servants, upon
like tearmes? May not cutthroate Vsurers assure
bags of Gold to bedridden or decrepit limbs, up∣on
condition they will fetch them from the toppe
of high towers or sleep mountains? But what kind∣nesse,
what synceritie could there be in such lavish
profers, specially if the impotent wretches were by
covenant excluded from al use of crutches? Yet
is it more possible for a <HI>creeple</HI> to goe without
his crutches, then for Israell to walke in the waies
of God, without his aide or assistance. Necessitie
<PB N="132" REF="195"/>
therefore constraines us to confesse the one of
these <HI>two, Either that there was no more synceritie
in the Almighties protestations, then in</HI> Nabals <HI>or
the Vsurers supposed bountie,</HI> which they never
meant to use, but upon performance of impossibi∣lities:
Or else his promises, if they had any syncerity
in them, did include his furtherance and assistance
unto Israell for performing the condition requi∣red.
Now unto whatsoever effect or event the
<HI>furtherance</HI> or speciall <HI>assistance</HI> of Omnipotent
power is, upon the truth and <HI>synceritie</HI> of divine
promise, alwaies ready and assured, the same <HI>effect</HI>
cannot truly be deemed <HI>impossible</HI> in respect of the
aeternall decree. And whatsoever is not in respect
of this decree impossible, the non existence of it, or
the existence of the contrary effect, cannot, in re∣spect
of the same decree, be necessarie. So then nei∣ther
was Israels well-doing and prosperitie, nor
their ill-doing and calamitie at any time absolute∣ly
<HI>necessarie,</HI> in respect of Gods decree; both were
possible, both contingent.</P>
<P>4 The truth of these collections from Gods
word (or rather of these infallible consequences of
his essentiall goodnesse, sincerity and truth) though
necessarie and evident unto Artists, may from o∣ther
positive authorities of the same word be rati∣fied
<HI>à fortior</HI> to common sense. If <HI>Neither</HI> these
good things which God sincerely purposeth and
expressely promiseth, nor that evill which he seri∣ously
and expressely threatens, bee <HI>necessary</HI> in re∣spect
of his decree: much lesse can <HI>that</HI> good
which is neither particularly <HI>promised</HI> or avouch∣ed;
<PB N="133" REF="195"/>
or <HI>that evil</HI> which is not expressely threatned or
foretold by his infallible messengers, be held neces∣sary
in respect of his decree. Now, that the prospe∣rity
which he expresly promiseth by such messen∣gers,
is not so necessary, as to exclude all possibili∣tie
of cōtrary <HI>Evill;</HI> nor the evill which he solemn∣ly
denounceth so necessarie, as not to leave a true
possibilitie for a contrary <HI>blessing:</HI> his Prophet hath
given such a generall and evident assurance, not to
Israell onely out to all the Nations of the earth; as
we cānot deny, but that it was devised of purpose,
by the Lord himselfe, as a <HI>post statute to prevent</HI>
this strange <HI>misconstruction,</HI> which his people had
then made, &amp; which he then foresaw would after∣wards
be <HI>enforced</HI> upon his decrees or lawes, by
this praejud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cate opinion of absolute necessitie. <HI>At
what instant I shall speake concerning a nation, and
concerning a kingdome, to pluck up and to pull downe,
and to destroy it; if that nation against whom I have
pronounced, turne from their evill, I will repent of the
evill that I thought to doe unto them. And at what in∣stant
I shall speake concerning a nation, and concer∣ning
a kingdome to build and to plant it; If it doe
evill in my sight, that it obey not my voyce, then I
will repent of the good wherewith I said I would be∣nefite
them.</HI> Ier. 18. ver. 7, 8, 9, 10. And, if wee may
gesse at the nature of the disease, by the medicine,
and the manner of applying it; the house of Israell,
was at this time almost desperately sicke of this
errour which we refute. Or what need we <HI>frame</HI>
conjectures from the qualitie of the medicine,
when as the working of it hath made the <HI>Crisis</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="196"/>
palpable and apparent. The pestilence is best
knowne by the botch, or <HI>outbursting.</HI> What then
was the issue of that <HI>Cordiall</HI> which the Prophet
ministred unto them, being but the <HI>extraction</HI> of
the former generalls? <HI>Thus saith the Lord; Be∣hold,
I frame evill against you, and devise a device
against you; returne yee now every one from his evill
way, and make your wayes and your doings good.</HI> We
have seene the application of the medicine, what
was the operation? <HI>And they said, there is no hope,
but wee will walke after our owne devises, and wee
will every one doe the imagination of his evill
heart.</HI> Ier. 18. ver. 11, 12. But did the Prophet
take their answere <HI>verbatim,</HI> as they uttered it?
No, God did not appoint him to keepe a <HI>Register</HI>
of their words, but to make a comment upon the
secret language of their hearts. They are suffici∣ently
convicted to have said, <HI>wee will every one doe
the imagination of his evill heart,</HI> in that the
imaginations of their heart were evill, and they
had resolved to retaine their wonted principles,
and not to hearken unto the Prophets doctrine.
The true and literall paraphrase of their replye,
no interpreter extant hath so fully expressed, as
the usuall language of some in our times briefly
doth; <HI>What shall bee, will be: there is no hope the
world will amend: if it bee Gods will to prosper the
courses which are taken, all will be well: if not, his will
however must be done.</HI> Thus we delude and put off
our <HI>Maker</HI> with <HI>Ifs,</HI> and <HI>Ands:</HI> when as his will re∣vealed,
aswell for private as publike good, so wee
would addresse our selves to doe it, is plaine and
<PB N="135" REF="196"/>
absolute. And it is impossible we should addresse
our selves to doe it, vnlesse wee would hearken
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to such as teach it. To expect any other
fruite, or use of this doctrine of <HI>absolute necessitie,</HI>
then carnall securitie in time of peace and pro∣speritie,
and than desperate wilfulnesse in distresse
and adversitie, were a madnesse. And seeing this
frenzie did still grow greater and greater, in the
<HI>Iew,</HI> as the destruction of Ierusalem (whereof it
was both times the principall cause and most
fearefull prognostique) grew neerer: the Lord
authorized another Prophet (after <HI>Ieremie)</HI> to in∣terpose
his oath for the cure of it. They thought
that <HI>death and destruction,</HI> when they approached,
were armed with absolute <HI>necessitie,</HI> (derived from
Gods decree) to punish them for their fathers
sinnes: and in this conceipt many yeelded unto
them, when they might easily haue conquered
them. To discover the vanitie of this <HI>skale</HI> and to
acquit his omnipotent decree from the suspected
<HI>imposition</HI> of necessitie. <HI>As I live (saith the Lord
God) yee shall not have occasion any more to use this
Proverbe in Israel: The Fathers have eaten sowre
grapes, and the Childrens teeth are set on edge. Be∣hold,
all soules are mine, as the soule of the father, so
also the soule of the son is mine: the soule that sinneth,
it shall die.</HI> Ezek. 18. ver. 2, 3, 4. <HI>Have I any plasure
at all that the wicked should die, saith the Lord God?
And not that he should returne from his wayes and
live?</HI> ver. 23. <HI>Cast away from you all your transgres¦sions,
whereby yee have transgressed, and make you a
new heart, and a new spirit: for why will yee dye, O
<PB N="136" REF="197"/>
house of Israel?</HI> For, <HI>I have no pleasure in the death
of him that dieth, saith the Lord God: wherefore turne
your selves and live ye.</HI> vers. 31, 32. If the returning
of this people, wherein God tooke pleasure, were
not <HI>necessary,</HI> as the event hath proved (for, the
most part of them did not returne) it must needs
argue a spice of their frenzy, to think their <HI>death,</HI>
wherein he tooke no pleasure, should be <HI>necessary.</HI>
The onely orthodoxall resolution of this point
then, must be this, <HI>[It was Gods good will and plea∣sure,]</HI>
(the formall dictate, and absolute injunction
of his eternall and irresistible decree,) that neither
the life or death of such as perished should be ne∣cessary;
but that both should be possible: albeit
the choise of life had beene more <HI>pleasant</HI> to God,
who had complained with griefe, <HI>Perditio tua ex

<P>1 <HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Vt erit aut non erit,</HI> is a Prophe∣cie
which will never bee out of
date, impossible ever to bee im∣peached
of falshood: an answer
as universally true to all, as un∣sufficient
to any question con∣cerning
things to come. The truth of every dis∣junctive
proposition, as Logicians teach, is fully
salved, if any one member, though of never so ma∣ny,
be true. Or if the disjunction or <HI>division</HI> be ar∣tificially
<HI>formall,</HI> the actuall existence of one part
or member, excludes the <HI>actuall</HI> existence of the
other: so doth the absolute necessity of the one
exclude all possibility of the others reduction into
act. If I should wage any summe that it would ei∣ther
raine all day to morrow, or be faire all day to
morrow; no man of understanding would put me
to prove, that it did <HI>both raine all the day,</HI> and hold
<HI>up</HI> all the day. The proofe of either part, would
be sufficient to evince the truth of my disjunctive
assertion; that both should be actually true is im∣possible.
Or if my adversary could substantially
prove, either any <HI>intermission</HI> of raine or <HI>interrup∣tion</HI>
of faire weather: His advantage against mee
would bee as evident; because the proposition,
which he was to make good against me, was but
<PB N="138" REF="198"/>
disjunctive: so that of any two minutes in the whole
day, if the one were rainy, and the other faire, my
universall disjunctive must needs be false, and his
apparantly true, because directly contradictory un∣to
mine. That it should at one and the same time
raine and not raine, is impossible, and comes not
within the compasse of any contradictory conte∣station,
it can be no object of <HI>lay</HI> or <HI>wager.</HI></P>
<P>2 When wee say that God in many humane
actions decrees a mixture or multiplicity of possibi∣lities;
our meaning is, that the tenour of Gods e∣ternall
&amp; omnipotent word, from which all things
derive as well the <HI>law</HI> and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> of their being;
as their being it selfe: is in respect of the severall
<HI>possible</HI> events decreed, not conjunctive or catego∣ricall,
but disjunctive. And we hold it a sinne to
thinke or say, that the onely wise Almighty <HI>Crea∣tor</HI>
is not able to conceive or make propositions as
truly <HI>disjunctive,</HI> as any of our making are, or not
able to make as formall and contradictory <HI>oppositi∣on</HI>
betweene their severall parts, as any humane
wit can conceive. Thus much being granted, our
intended inference is an everlasting truth. Gods
decree or determinate <HI>proposition,</HI> concerning the
supposed multiplicity of possibilities or manifold
events, all alike possible; is alwaies exactly fulfil∣led,
when any one of the events, whose <HI>possibilities</HI>
are decreed, goes actuall existence. To reduce more
of them then one into <HI>act</HI> at one and the same time,
is, in many cases altogether impossible, and falls not
within the <HI>object</HI> of Omnipotency. If the reducti∣on
of any one of them, into actuall possession of its
<PB N="139" REF="198"/>
owne being, were in respect of his decree, or by
any other meanes, altogether necessary; his decree
should necessarily; be broken, and his omnipotency
might be overborne. For the <HI>necessity</HI> of ones be∣ing,
takes away all <HI>possibilitie</HI> of being from the <HI>con∣tradictorie,</HI>
which omnipotency (as is supposed)
had bestowed upon it. Finally, Gods decree in re∣spect
of all and every part of its proper object, is
alike Omnipotent: and therefore it is as impossible
for any <HI>necessity</HI> (by vertue or <HI>respect</HI> of what cause
soever,) to incroach upon those events, the Law
or manner of whose production God hath de∣creed
to be contingent; as for <HI>Contingency</HI> to hin∣der
the production of those events, the law or
manner of whose production or existence, he hath
decreed to be <HI>necessary.</HI> As impossible for neces∣sity
to mingle with absolute contingency, from
which God hath separated it; as for contingencie
to be <HI>wedded</HI> to absolute necessity, whose <HI>mariage</HI>
God hath forbidden by an everlasting decree.</P>
<P>3 The onely difficulty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection</NOTE> wherewith these con∣clusions
can (as I conceive) with probability bee
charged, may be conceived thus: <HI>Admitting Gods
decree</HI> concerning the <HI>house</HI> of Israels <HI>life</HI> or <HI>death,</HI>
were (as evidently it was) disjunctive, and did es∣sentially
include a possibility of <HI>life,</HI> and a possibi∣lity
of <HI>death,</HI> in respect of all or most of their per∣sons,
or of their publike state; Yet no man will de∣nie
but that amongst the severall or opposite <HI>mem∣bers</HI>
of this or the like decree, God wills one, more
than another. For so he saith, <HI>That hee willed not
the death, but the life of him that dyed.</HI> Now if that
<PB N="140" REF="199"/>
which God willeth not, may come to passe; and
that which he willeth may not come to passe; or if,
of two possible events, that whose actuall being he
willeth tenne thousand times more ardently, never
get actuall being or existence (as being prevented
by the actuall accomplishment of the contradicto∣rie
or incompatible event which he lesse willeth,)
How can his will, in this case bee fulfilled? and if
his will be not fulfilled, his decree must needs bee
broken; and if his decree may be broken, how is his
will said to be <HI>irresistible?</HI> how do we beleeve him
to be Omnipotent? Some perhaps would hence
conclude, that if of two objects, which we suppose
to bee alike truly <HI>possible,</HI> there bee no necessity,
that <HI>that</HI> should come to passe, which GOD
willeth most, or any probabilitie for that to come
to passe, which he lesse willeth, or willeth not at
all, but rather the contrary: Then there is a possi∣bilitie
or rather a necessitie, that his will should
not be alwaies fulfilled, that he might sometimes
sit downe with a kinde of losse, and say with im∣potent
man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer.</NOTE> <HI>I have failed of my purpose.</HI> The best
preparation for fit and peaceable entertainment of
the Orthodoxall solution to these difficulties, will
be to declare the evident and necessary truth of
that assertion, which they object unto us, as a dan∣gerous
inconvenience able in their judgement to
infer the last conclusion.</P>
<P>Truth fully and evidently declared will justifie
it selfe against all gainsaiers. The assertion which
we grant will necessarily follow from our former
discursions, and comes now to justifie it selfe is
<PB N="141" REF="199"/>
this; <HI>That such things as God no way willeth, oft∣times
come to passe, when as their contradictories,
which he wils most ardently, come not to passe.]</HI> The
principall instance for justifying this truth, is the
<HI>repentance</HI> and life of a sinner, which God hath
sworne that he willeth; so doth hee not his death,
if we will beleeve his oath. If any mans verdict
shall scatter from mine, or others, which main∣taine
this doctrine, I must call God and his consci∣ence
to witnesse, whether he hath not left that un∣done,
w<SUP>ch</SUP> God wold have had him to do, &amp; some∣times
done, that which God would have had him
not to doe? Let him that will answere negatively
to this Interrogative, indite that confession which
we daily make in our Liturgy of falshood or slaun∣der.
Let him call for <HI>Iacobs Ladder</HI> downe from
heaven, and require a <HI>guard</HI> of Angels to conduct
him safely into Gods presence. For if hee have as
truely and continually done Gods will here on
Earth, as the Angels doe it in heaven; hee may
justly challenge speedie <HI>admission</HI> into their socie∣tie.
But if he can with safe conscience <HI>communi∣cate</HI>
with us sinnefull men, in that confession; his
exceptions against our assertion are but needlesse
scrupulosities, altogether against reason? what∣soever
they bee in respect of his conscience, yet
to his exceptions wee are to frame a further ans∣were.</P>
<P>4 There is an absolute necessity, that Gods will
should alwayes be fulfilled: but there is no such
necessitie, that it should alwayes bee fulfilled by
the parties to whom it is revealed or directed.
<PB N="142" REF="200"/>
They are tyed indeed by necessitie of praecept,
and at their perill, alwayes to doe it; but the Al∣mightie
God, doth not referre the <HI>fulfilling</HI> or
<HI>evacuation</HI> of it, to their fidelitie, choice or resolu∣tion:
for so the certaintie or infallibilitie of execu∣ting
his decree, should bee but commensurable
to the fragility of our Nature; and that which
some object unto us would fall directly upon
themselves, to wit, That Gods will should depend
upon mans will. As hee alwayes grants the re∣quests
of the faithfull, or, as the Psalmist speakes,
<HI>gives such as delight in him, their hearts desire,</HI> al∣beit
he alwaies gives them not the particulars or
<HI>materialls</HI> which they request or heartily de∣sire:
so he knows how to fulfill his own will, or do
his pleasure, albeit those particulars or materials,
which he ardently <HI>wils</HI> and takes most pleasure in,
be not alwayes done by us. And this answer might
suffice unto a Reader not scrupulously curious. But
sophisticall and captious objections require artifi∣ciall
and <HI>formall</HI> solutions. The former objection
may perhaps be framed more captiously thus. Of
more <HI>particulars</HI> proposed to the choise of men, if
that bee not alwayes done, which God willeth
most, his will is not done at all. For as a lesser good
whilest it stands in competition with a greater, is
rather evill than good: so, that which is lesse wil∣led
or desired, cannot be said to bee willed or de∣sired
at all, in respect of that which is more desired,
specially in the language of Gods Spirit, which
expressely saith, that <HI>God will have mercy, and not
sacrifice.</HI> Whence it will follow, that when sacri∣fice
<PB N="143" REF="200"/>
was offered, without performance of duties
of mercy, or obedience; Gods will was not done,
but broken. It is Gods will likewise, that <HI>we should
goe unto the house of mourning, rather then unto the
house of mirth.</HI> The duties to be performed in the
house of mourning are many: <HI>To mourne, to fast,
to pray,</HI> with other branches of humiliation; all
which God truly willeth, in different measure ac∣cording
to the diversity of their <HI>nature,</HI> or the more
or lesse intensive manner of their performance.
The transgressions likewise usuall and frequent in
the <HI>house</HI> of unhallowed <HI>mirth,</HI> are many and
much different as well in quality as degree; all de∣tested
of God as contrary to his most holy will,
but more or less detested according to their <HI>nature,
quality</HI> or <HI>degree,</HI> or other circumstance. Suppose
a man, to whom choise of going into the house of
<HI>mirth</HI> or <HI>mourning</HI> is solemnly proposed; the in∣conveniences
of the one, and gracious acceptance
of the other in Gods fight, seriously prest by Gods
Minister; do vtterly reject the <HI>Preachers</HI> counsell,
and adventure upon the most desperate evill that
is practised in the house of mirth: shall wee say
Gods will is in this case fulfilled? Yes, though the
<HI>evils</HI> which he willeth not, were tenne thousand,
and man did desperately resolve to doe the very
worst and most contrary to his will; yet that which
he willeth most, shall still be done: for it is his ab∣solute
and peremptory will, that all the particu∣lars
offered to mans choice, as well those which his
Holinesse most abhorreth, as those which hee <HI>wil∣leth</HI>
most, should bee truly <HI>possible</HI> for a man to
<PB N="144" REF="201"/>
choose without impediment, that none should bee
necessary. Now this liberty being left to man
which way soever his will inclineth, Gods will shall
be most <HI>infallibly</HI> fulfilled, in the selfe same mea∣sure,
as if the very best had beene chosen by man;
seeing it is his absolute will to grant him freedome
(at his perill) to choose the very worst and refuse
the best. And the perill is, that Gods will shall be
done upon him according to the measure it was
neglected by him. As this proposition [The Sun
will either shine or not shine this day at twelve of
the clocke] will be as true if the Sunne shine not,
as if it shine: so Gods <HI>will</HI> being (as is supposed
in this case) disjunctive, shall bee as truly fulfilled,
albeit man doth that which he willeth not, as if he
did that which he willed most. For his will (as was
now said) may (according to the same measure) be
fulfilled two wayes, either by us, or upon us; whe∣ther
it be this way or that way fulfilled, it is all one
to God, but much better for us <HI>to doe it,</HI> then <HI>to
have it done upon us.</HI> And though it be possible for
us not to doe it, yet not doing it there is no possi∣bility
left, that it shall not be done upon us. In as
much then as Gods will must of necessity be done,
and no man can doe it by doing evill, (seeing it is
set onely on that which is truly good;) the punish∣ment
of such as continue to doe evill, is absolutely
necessary, that is altogether as unavoydable, as if
they had beene appointed to it from all eternities,
or created to no other end, then that they might
be <HI>punished.</HI> For the punishment of evill is good,
and is for this reason a part of Gods <HI>will,</HI> or rather a
<PB N="145" REF="201"/>
part of the <HI>object</HI> of his irresistible will or inviolable
decree; yet may we not say that God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Et vere clamor &amp; grandis cla∣mor est, quando pie∣tas Dei, pec∣catorum clamoribus vincitur, ut peccantes punire coga∣tur.

of his <HI>antecedent</HI> and <HI>consequent</HI> will, and yet are
content to distinguish his will into <HI>revealed</HI> and <HI>se∣cret,</HI>
or into <HI>voluntatem signi &amp; beneplaciti.</HI> The
use notwithstanding of the first distinction [of his
antecedent and consequent will] is most ancient;
warranted by the authority of <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> and well
exemplified by <HI>Damascene.</HI> And of this distincti∣on
I have made choise in other meditations, as
most commodious (to my apprehension) for re∣solving
many problemes arising out of Propheti∣call
and Euangelicall passages, concerning the ful∣filling
of Gods will in his threats or promises. The
ingenuous Reader will not bee so uncharitable or
injurious towards <HI>Chrysostom</HI> or <HI>Damascene,</HI> as to
suspect, that either of them imagined two <HI>wills</HI> in
God; unto which imputation, they are more just∣ly
liable, which <HI>affect</HI> the distinction of Gods <HI>secret</HI>
and revealed <HI>will,</HI> or of <HI>voluntatis signi &amp; benepla∣citi.</HI>
For every distinction of Gods will, must bee
framed <HI>ex parte volitorum, non ex parte volentis,</HI> in
<PB N="147" REF="202"/>
respect of the things willed, not in respect of him
that willeth them. We must in charity and good
manners permit <HI>Chrysostom</HI> and <HI>Damascene</HI> that li∣berty
of speech which we take our selves. Now it
is usuall with all of us, to attribute that <HI>verbo tenus</HI>
unto the cause, w<SUP>ch</SUP> really and properly belongs on∣ly
unto the effect, or to denominate the intellectual
faculty from the qualitie of the object to which it
hath reference; as when we say <HI>the Sunne is hot, the
understanding is practique, &amp;c.</HI> The meaning of
those two good Authors, whom we follow in the
use of the distinction of Gods <HI>antecedent or conse∣quent
will,</HI> was this, or the like: <HI>That God by one
and the same indivisible will, might differently af∣fect
or approve divers objects, according to the nature
quality or degrees of goodnes contained in them.</HI> And
certaine it is, that the immensity or greatnesse of
our God, doth not make his power or will to bee
unweildy. Though he be in <HI>power</HI> truly <HI>infinite,</HI> yet
he alwayes worketh not according to the <HI>infinity</HI>
of his power, but oft-times more <HI>gently</HI> and pla∣cidly,
then the weakest or softest spirited of his rea∣sonable
creatures can doe. Though his will like∣wise
be alwayes irresistible, yet is it not alwayes so
peremptorily set on this or that particular object
willed by him, as mans will, for the most part, is.
The variety of particular objects which hee truely
willeth in different measure, is much greater than
the wit of man can comprehend So is the liberty
or variety of choise, which hee alloweth unto his
creature, much greater then we can without grud∣ging,
afford to such as have dependance on us.
<PB N="148" REF="203"/>
Some things he willeth in the first place and di∣rectly;
though not so peremptorily, but that things
lesse willed by him, or contrary <HI>evills,</HI> which hee
willeth not, may get the start or take place of them
in humane choise. Other things he willeth in the
second place, or by consequence, as in case, <HI>that</HI>
which in the first place he willed, be (by abuse of
mans free will) rejected. The <HI>former</HI> he is said to
will by his <HI>antecedent</HI> will, because the object wil∣led
by him, hath <HI>antecedence</HI> or <HI>preeminence</HI> in re∣spect
of his <HI>beneplacitum</HI> or <HI>acceptance:</HI> the latter
he is said to will by his consequent will, that is not
in the first place or directly, but by <HI>consequent,</HI> as
supposing those <HI>objects,</HI> which he better approved,
to be neglected. Whatsoever is good in it selfe,
and good withal for a reasonable creature to make
choise of, that, God is said to will by his antece∣dent
will, as the repentance of a <HI>sinner,</HI> and the joy∣full
fruits which the <HI>sinner</HI> shall reape by his <HI>peni∣tencie.</HI>
Whatsoever in it selfe is not evill, or con∣trary
to the rule of goodnesse, but evill to the rea∣sonable
creature, which must suffer it, as sicknesse,
death, all kinde of torture or calamity, <HI>that God
willeth onely by his consequent will.</HI> We may not
deny but that he truly willeth the death of obsti∣nate
sinners, yet this he willeth by his consequent
will. Their obstinacy in sinne he willeth not at all,
for if he did, he would not punish it: for punish∣ment
is the necessary consequent of his <HI>will</HI> neg∣lected.
Both these branches of one and the same
<HI>will</HI> (which from the reference onely which they
have unto their different <HI>objects,</HI> wee conceive to
<PB N="149" REF="203"/>
bee two or divers) are subordinate to his abso∣lute
and peremptorie will, which is, that man
should have a libertie of doing, and not doing
those things which in the first place he willed or
liked better. But is not this libertie of man an im∣perfection?</P>
<P>2 <HI>An issue</HI> though a blemish to youth and live∣lihood,
is ofttimes a good meane or principall
cause of health to an unsound and crasie bodie. So
<HI>possibility</HI> of declining to evill, albeit in it selfe
an imperfection, and not possibly incident to <HI>aeter∣nall</HI>
and <HI>immutable</HI> goodnesse, is no way contra∣ry
to the participated actuall goodnesse of the rea∣sonable
creature; whereof it is an essentiall or con∣stitutive
part, at the least a necessarie ingredient
or condition precedent to the constitution of it.
And imperfection with reference to this end, may
be the object of Gods antecedent will, or part of
that which in the first place he willeth and princi∣pally
intends. But inasmuch as <HI>actuall</HI> evill is <HI>for∣mally</HI>
dissonant to actuall goodnesse; hee which is
<HI>actually</HI> and <HI>infinitely</HI> good, cannot but hate or
dislik actuall evill in whomsoever it is <HI>found,</HI> as
much as he loveth the contrary good. Now <HI>pu∣nishment</HI>
or <HI>malum poenae,</HI> being as necessarie a con∣sequent
of Gods hate or dislike of sinne, as <HI>re∣ward</HI>
or happinesse is of his loue to <HI>vertue</HI> and
<HI>pietie:</HI> the reasonable creature by declining from
vertue to vice, from good to bad, doth <HI>ipso facto</HI>
and inevitably bring evill <HI>[malum poenae &amp; damni]
tribulation</HI> and anguish upon it selfe. By reward
and punishment in this place, wee understand not
<PB N="150" REF="204"/>
onely life and death everlasting (of whose refe∣rence
to Gods aeternall decree, we shall in parti∣cular
dispute hereafter, if Superiours shall so think
fit:) but every temporall blessing or crosse, all
prosperity or calamitie, specially publike &amp; remar∣kable.
Prosperitie we alwayes take to be a pledge
of Gods love (though not alwaies of the Person,
on whom it is bestowed, yet of some good quality
in him or in some of his, serving for publique use
or private imitation;) and is alwayes (in the begin∣ning
at least) an effect of Gods antecedent will.
Calamitie we take alwayes for a token of Gods
dislike, though not alwaies of the person afflicted,
yet either of somewhat in him to bee amended, or
of somewhat formerly done by him, to bee by o∣thers
avoided; and is an effect of Gods consequent
will. For hee wils <HI>no evill</HI> at all, not <HI>malum poenae,</HI>
but as it is either a punishment or correction for
evill done, or good neglected, or as it is a mede∣cine
to prevent the doing of evill, or neglect of
goodnesse.</P>
<P>3 From the infinite varietie of <HI>possibilities</HI> au∣thorized
by the aeternall decree, and their corre∣spondent
consequences, which one time or other
actually follow upon their <HI>reductions</HI> into Act, by
the irresistible award of the same decree; wee may
resolve many difficulties, and abandon sundry in∣conveniences,
wherewith the Heathen in their
vaine speculations, and many Christians in more
grievous temptations, <HI>charge,</HI> either the truth or
goodnesse of Gods <HI>Providence.</HI> The varietie of
such possibilities, amounts, partly from the speci∣ficall
<PB N="151" REF="204"/>
nature of the objects, made possible by the
divine decree: partly from the severall degrees
of <HI>good</HI> or evill contained in such objects, or in
mens actions concerning them. The whole lati∣tude
(if I may so speake) of Gods providence, as
it concernes kingdomes, states or <HI>persons,</HI> consists
in moderating and ordering the possible devoluti∣ons
or alternations of the <HI>resonable creature</HI> from
his <HI>antecedent</HI> will to his <HI>consequent.</HI> The alterna∣tions
or devolutions themselves, may be number∣lesse,
save onely to God; so may the degrees bee
of mans dissonancie or consonancie to Gods <HI>ante∣cedent

Errour, which the Heathens, against whom hee
disputes, covered under this <HI>name.</HI> Vpon conditi∣on
they would be pleased not to revive the nature
of the errour, or bury their opinions that way ten∣ding;
my heart and mouth should never give
breath unto the <HI>name.</HI> The opinion which some
rigid <HI>Stoicks</HI> had of <HI>Fate,</HI> is an haeresie not to bee
named among the Heathen; so deepely tainted
with the very dregs of heathenisme, that it is a
wonder any Christian writer should come neere
it; that any at least should take <HI>infection</HI> from
it: especially seeing the Reverend and learned Fa∣thers
of the primitive church, had provided so ma∣ny
excellent preservatives against it. But albeit <HI>Fate,</HI>
according to that sense or meaning, where in some
heathens tooke it, was become a wicked Idol: yet
seeing the word or <HI>name,</HI> whether in the ordinary
use of Greeke or Latine writers, hath greater va∣rietie
of significations or importances, then al∣most
any other word in the world besides▪ to a∣bandon
all, for one ill sense, or importance, seemes
to me as rude and uncivill a part, as to roote out a
whole clan or surname, because one of the same
name and stocke had beene at deadly sohood with
our family or had otherwise deserved death. Vpon
diligent perusall of the best Philosophers, histori∣ans

<PB N="153" REF="205"/>
well expressed by any other terme or <HI>name,</HI> by any
paraphrase more briefe than the true and proper
definition of the matter or reality signified by it.
Now if the <HI>matter</HI> defined, prove to bee no <HI>Idoll;</HI>
the <HI>name</HI> certainly is <HI>indifferent,</HI> and of the defini∣tion
there may be a good morall or historicall use.

<P>2 <HI>Fatum à fando dictum,</HI> and sometimes imports
no more then the <HI>dictate</HI> of nature, or the certaine
course appointed to things naturall. Thus natu∣rall
death, is by some accounted fatall. And <HI>Dido</HI>
according to this importance, did not die by Fate,
because shee prevented <HI>Lachesis</HI> by cutting the
thred of her owne life, before this great Arbitresse
of mortality had passed sentence upon her;</P>
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Virgil. 4. Aeneid. vid. Rodiginum lib. 21. cap. 4▪ pag. 972.</NOTE> Sed quia nec fato, merita nec morte peribat.</Q>
<P>And according to this importance it is used by the
Prince of Romane Historians in the sixt booke of
his Annals; <HI>Per idem tempus Lucius Piso Pontifex
(rarum in tanta claritudine) fato obijt.</HI> About the
same time <HI>L. Piso</HI> High Priest died a naturall death
(being 80. yeares of age;) a matter rare in those
times, in a man of so great birth and place. Some∣times
againe Death it selfe, howsoever it come up∣on
men, is termed <HI>Fate</HI> or Destiny; perhaps be∣cause
the comming of it is by course of nature cer∣taine,
albeit the time and manner of it, be unknown
or incomprehensible. So another Roman Poet
<PB N="154" REF="206"/>
saith, The parthians poysoned arrowes carryed
Fates upon their points, able to let in Death at the
least breach of skin, <HI>Fatum{que} in sanguine summo est.</HI>
It may be <HI>Virgil</HI> held <HI>naturall</HI> death to be <HI>fatall,</HI> be∣cause it cannot be avoided, being otherwise of our
opinion, that <HI>Dido</HI> might have lived longer, or that
it was not absolutely necessary from the houre of
her birth, that she should live so many yeares and
no<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Cha. 23. §. 2.</NOTE> more. For so some of the wisest amongst the
Heathens held death to be fatall, that is, simply
necessary unto all; albeit to dye at this or that set
houre, were in their opinion contingent, or at least
supposed a <HI>Contingency</HI> before it became necessary.
Of this opinion was<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">That Death it selfe is fatall, <HI>Pythago∣ras</HI> supposeth in those verses;

<HI>Tacitus,</HI> who seemes to be doubtfull, whether all

violent and undeserved death, as well as naturall,

Subordinate to this division of Fates, were the
<PB N="158" REF="208"/>

concerning the power or efficacie of the hea∣vens,
over sublunary bodies. The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide Bel∣lantium.</NOTE> Caldeans were

it would bee no great sinne to be their Schollers.</P>
<P>4 There is no Christian but will grant his God
to be greater then Heathenish <HI>Fate,</HI> and his Law
to be above all controll of any other Law or pow∣er
whatsoever. And yet by the doctrine of many
Divines, the Almighty Lawgiver is made aeternal∣ly
subject to his owne decrees. Their meaning is
taken by many to be in effect this: <HI>That albeit God
be Omnipotent,</HI> yet it is true of him,</P>
<Q>Post semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum.</Q>
<P>That he had past his <HI>Omnipotent</HI> word, concer∣ning
the ordering and managing of all things to
come, before it could be taken or accepted by a∣ny
creature: and that by his word thus past
once for all for ever, such irrevocable doome had
<HI>passed</HI> upon some of his best creatures before their
nonage, (in their non existence;) as they would not
have accepted life or being it selfe, when they first
<HI>entred vpon</HI> possession of it, if they had knowne up∣on
<PB N="159" REF="208"/>
what hard conditions it had beene tendred. Or,
were it yet left free for them to disclaime those
covenants or conditions of life and beeing, where∣unto
they never gave their consent; The greatest
part of divine <HI>goodnesse</HI> which they could hope to
be partakers of, were to be released from the <HI>right</HI>
of creatures, and to returne againe to nothing.
Briefly, by making God supreame Lord of such
hard <HI>weirds</HI> or sinister <HI>Fates,</HI> as are by these men
inevitably awarded to absolute <HI>reprobates;</HI> they
doe not adde so much unto his greatnesse, as they
derogate from his goodnesse, in respect of the hea∣then
gods. For, unto such of the heathens, as gran∣ted
Fates a negative voice in some cases against the
good purposes of their gods; it was some comfort
to thinke, that their gods wished them well, and
did entreate them, as great personages or cour∣teous
gentlemen do their sutors, whom for the pre∣sent
they cannot pleasure, as being overborn by the
opposite faction. But alas, what can it boot poor im∣potent
man, to beleeve his Maker was not from ae∣ternitie
subject to Fates, or any other law; if by his
owne Lawes, or decrees, he hath bound them be∣fore
the world had beginning, (without all hope or
possibility of release) to harder conditions of Life,
then the heathens imagined could bee injoyned by
<HI>Fates.</HI> For it is probable, that such of the heathen
as were most peremptorie for the absolute neces∣sitie
of <HI>fatall</HI> events, did thinke bad Fates had spit
their poyson, when this life was ended. They did
not suspect the miseries inflicted by them, to
be for time so everlasting, or for their qualitie so
<PB N="160" REF="209"/>
unsufferable, as wee Christians beleeve the tor∣ments
of the life to come shall bee to all that are
<HI>ordained</HI> for the day of wrath. But bee the tor∣ments
for their qualitie more exquisite than the

by these two Writers themselves, much less
observed at all by others: with</HI> Cominaeus, Ma∣chiavel,
<HI>and other later Historians or Politicians,</HI>
Fortune <HI>and</HI> Fate, <HI>are used promiscuously. The</HI>

whether such events as we say fall out by <HI>Fortune</HI>

attempted to no end or purpose. <HI>Oderunt me fru∣stra,</HI>

<P>6 The meaning of <HI>Plato,</HI> of <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Plu∣tarch</HI>

contrary to his intention that gave it; and altoge∣ther

His purpose was only to maintaine his reputation
or revenge his wrongs, either to wound or to be
wounded, without any hope or thought of curing
his disease, the danger wherof was not fully disco∣vered,
til it was past. But a more perfect Idaea or ex∣emplarie
forme of fortune good or bad, then any
historian relates, the greeke Epigrammatist hath
pictured for our contemplation. The matter of
the Epigram was in English thus: A silly poore

he sought a place convenient for acting this despe∣rate

exact, most infallible and irresistible; yet <HI>alternant.</HI>
Punishment or chastisement for offences past is
necessarie, yet not absolutely necessarie to any
mans person in this or that degree; because the
aeternall decree hath left him a <HI>possibilitie</HI> not to
offend in this or that kinde, or not to offend in
such a degree; or in case hee so offended, to seeke
for pardon. Nor shall wee, by this assertion bee
enforced to imagine any new act or determinati∣on
in God, either for daily awarding different
<HI>successe,</HI> or the same <HI>successe</HI> in different measure,
according to the diversitie or contingency of hu∣mane
<HI>choise,</HI> which may varie, every moment.
For the <HI>infinite, incomprehensible</HI> and all <HI>comprising
essence,</HI> as is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In the Treatise of the Divine Essence. Part. 1.</NOTE> before observed, is fitnesse it selfe,
an vnchangeable rule <HI>aeternally fitting</HI> every altera∣tion

in it selfe. A rule it is, which needes no ap∣plication
to the event, the event by getting exi∣stence
or actuall <HI>beeing</HI> is actually <HI>applied</HI> unto it.
The just measure and qualitie of that successe,
which is by the <HI>Idea</HI> of <HI>equitie, bountie,</HI> or <HI>mercie</HI> al∣lotted
to every event, is no lesse essentially contai∣ned
in <HI>goodnesse</HI> it selfe, then the event it selfe or
its <HI>beeing,</HI> is in <HI>infinite essence,</HI> or in <HI>Essence</HI> it selfe.</P>
<P>3 The immediate and proper subject of Fate,
is <HI>Freedome</HI> of choise or <HI>contingencie</HI> in humane
actions; the <HI>genus proximum,</HI> is the certaintie of
Divine <HI>retribution</HI> according to the <HI>nature</HI> and
qualitie of the choyse wee make. Yet are not <HI>re∣wards</HI>
or <HI>retributions,</HI> but retributions <HI>extraordi∣nary</HI>
and remarkeable, aswell for their manner of
execution as for their <HI>matter</HI> or <HI>qualitie,</HI> properly
termed <HI>Fatall.</HI> Of sinister Fates, there is no con∣tingent
subject, which can exhibit a more exact
picture or modell, for the manner how they come
to passe, then a game at Chesse or Tables. Many
games at both, which at the beginning, or untill
the middle of time spent, in them, are very faire
and more then tenne to one; after some few <HI>over∣sights,</HI>
or ill dice, become desperate and irrecove∣rable,
by any skill that can be vsed: so events pro∣perly
<HI>fatall,</HI> become at length unpreventable, irre∣sistible;
but such they were not from the begin∣ning
of time, or from their infancie or first at∣tempts,
on whom they fall. Such disasterous or
dismall <HI>events,</HI> for which the Heathens usually in∣dited
<HI>Fates,</HI> were commonly remarkable <HI>checks</HI>
given, they know not by whom, to humane poli∣cies
<PB N="178" REF="220"/>
or cunning contrivances. They were, as the
unexpected <HI>winning</HI> of an <HI>after-game,</HI> upon some
great stake or wager. Good or <HI>dexterous Fates,</HI>
were the unexpected issues of mens contrivances,
for their owne or associates good <HI>Fortunes.</HI> The
manner of accomplishing such <HI>fates</HI> or <HI>Fortunes,</HI>
is like a game wonne by a <HI>bungler,</HI> against a skilfull
player, by extraordinarie dice, or by the suggesti∣on
of some by-stander, more skilfull then both.
This kinde of <HI>Fate</HI> or strange <HI>Fortune,</HI> of which
most of the Heathen knew not well what to make,
wee may define, <HI>To be the incomprehensible dispo∣sition,
or irresistible combination of second causes,
conspiring for the infallible execution of Gods will,</HI>
maugre all plots or conspiracies of men to defeate
the events, which hee had purposed. Sinister or
disasterous <HI>Fates</HI> were the infallible execution of
his consequent will. Good fates or fortune, were
the infallible effects of his antecedent will; both
were sometimes strangely &amp; remarkeably accom∣plished
against cunning and potent oppositions,
not so much for the parties sakes whom they be∣fell,
as for others. Many disasters have befallen
some men, though deservedly for their owne sins,
yet withall for the admonishing of others, to pre∣vent
the like. Hence it is that the Heathen Poets
observation <HI>[Multi committunt eadem diverso eri∣mina
Fato]</HI> though in many cases most true, is no
way prejudiciall to the unchangeable rules of the
All-seeing Providence, which is alwayes full of
equitie, whose justice is still allayed with mercy.</P>

<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Stoicks did well in contra∣dicting
the Epicures, which
held <HI>fortune</HI> and <HI>Chance</HI> to rule
all things, or at least to bee in
themselves <HI>somethings,</HI> not
meere <HI>denominations</HI> of such
events as had no certaine or constant cause, appre∣hensible
by man. The Originall of their Errour,
was, their desire to be <HI>extreamely</HI> contrary to the
Epicureans in a matter contingent, or rather in
contingencie it selfe: for <HI>that</HI> is the common sub∣ject
of <HI>Fortune, chance</HI> or <HI>fate.</HI> Fortune and chance
they deny to be any thing, with no other purpose,
it seemes, then that they may make <HI>Fate</HI> to bee all
things. They were Orthodoxall in acknowledg∣ing
an infallible <HI>unerring</HI> providence, but they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣red
againe as much in not <HI>acknowledging</HI> this in∣fallible
<HI>providence,</HI> oft-times to hold the meane
betweene Chance or Fortune, and absolute ne∣cessitie;
or not to order and moderate contingen∣cie
it selfe. From the same originall, some have
thought it to be the most safe and compendious
course for rooting out errour and superstition, to
overthrow the <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tecedent,</HI> when their commissi∣on
directs them onely to deny or refute the <HI>conse∣quence.</HI>
As not a few, no lesse affraid (and the feare
<PB N="180" REF="221"/>
it selfe is just) to grant merit of workes, then the
Stoicks were to admit of <HI>Chance,</HI> have taken away
all contingency in humane actions, save onely
with reference to second causes. Wherein they
seeme to invert that rule of Tyrannicall policie:
<HI>He is a foole that kills the Father, and leaves his
braits behind to revenge his blood.</HI> These take
away the <HI>harmelesse</HI> Parents for the <HI>faultie</HI> issues
sake, seeking to destroy true and Orthodoxall <HI>an∣tecedents</HI>
for the incommodious consequences
which others have falsely fathered upon them.
The reclaiming of men from this one Errour is
my present and scope.</P>
<P>2 For the better effecting whereof, we will sub∣scribe
at length unto their general Maxime, <HI>[That
all things are necessary in respect of Gods decree,]</HI> up∣on
condition they wil not extend it beyond its <HI>na∣turall</HI>
and proper <HI>subject,</HI> or not take <HI>decree</HI> in the
<HI>Stoicall,</HI> but in a <HI>civill</HI> sense. Now hee that saith
[All things are necessary in respect of Gods de∣cree,]
cannot in <HI>civill</HI> construction bee conceived
to meane any more then thus; <HI>All</HI> things which
God hath decreed are necessary. The question
then is, whether every thing that is, may truly bee
said to be the <HI>object,</HI> or part of the object of Gods
decree. To which question our answer must be ne∣gative.
For those things onely are properly said
to be decreed, which are enacted and appointed
for better ordering and moderating such things as
either by <HI>nature, custome,</HI> or ill example, are apt to
grow worse, or may be amended by good educa∣tion,
wholesome advice or discipline. Every de∣cree
<PB N="181" REF="221"/>
of man supposeth the subject or party whom
it immediately concernes, to be capable of <HI>perswa∣sion</HI>
to <HI>good</HI> or <HI>evill,</HI> to be alterable in his inclina∣tions,
through feare of punishment, or hope of re∣ward.
Magistrates or <HI>Corporations</HI> take order that
mad men or dogs should doe no harme; yet are
not these creatures the proper subject of their de∣crees
or sanctions. They do not tie <HI>Mastives</HI> by
penall laws not to bite, they do not bind <HI>mad men</HI>
to good behaviour: but they i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>joyn men of reason
and understanding to muzzle M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stives lest they
bite; to keepe <HI>mad men</HI> or franticks, close, lest they
should doe mischiefe by going abroad. Now the
Divine decree concerning the ordering of man, is
the rule or patterne of all humane decrees, and
therefore supposeth somewhat in man, which
makes him more capable of the divine <HI>sanction,</HI>
than <HI>reasonlesse</HI> or <HI>inanimate</HI> creatures are. This
capacity of the reasonable creature or man, consists
in freedome of choise or contingency, in his acti∣ons
or resolutions. The donation of this freedome
upon man, is an act of Gods <HI>free bounty,</HI> and is pre∣supposed
as the proper subject to the <HI>divine decree,</HI>
or to all acts or awards of divine justice or mercy.
The proper and <HI>formall</HI> object of the same decree,
is, the moderation of this <HI>contingency</HI> or freedome
of man, by awarding the issues or consequences,
in <HI>mercy,</HI> justice, or bounty, exactly proportioned
to the nature and manner of his choise and resolu∣tion.
For illustrating the truth of our intended con∣clusion,
let us take the Epigrammatists<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Cha. 20.</NOTE> relation,
or that idaea of <HI>Chance</HI> or <HI>Fortune,</HI> which hee hath
<PB N="182" REF="222"/>
pictured, for a true story. It was not necessary in
respect of the divine decree, that the one should be
so extreame <HI>poore,</HI> or the other so miserably <HI>rich,</HI>
as to come within the compasse of that <HI>snare,</HI> wher∣in
the latter was taken. The meanes by which the
one came to that depth of poverty or melancholly
passions, wherewith hee had almost beene stifled,
and the other to that height of covetousnesse, from
which he fell headlong into despaire, were contin∣gent.
Neither were driven into such excesse of
passion or distemper by irresistible necessity. But
taking them as now they have made themselves;
that the one should be led <HI>unto</HI> temptation, the o∣ther
<HI>into</HI> it; fell not out by chance, but by the espe∣ciall
disposition of the Divine providence. The
great <HI>Tempter</HI> intended mischiefe to the one, but
failed, God having yet a blessing in store for him.
To the other, perhaps he intended not this parti∣cular
harme, untill opportunity did offer it. So
that the inriching of the one by a chance rare and
unusuall, in respect of man, was necessary in respect
of Gods decree of mercy and fatherly providence;
the delivering of the other unto Sathan, was like∣wise
<HI>necessary,</HI> in respect of Gods justice.</P>
<P>3 Now if such events, as to the apprehension of
meere naturall men <HI>come by chance,</HI> be necessary in
respect of the divine decree: disasters by common
consent reputed fatall, must by efficacy of the same
decree be divorced from contingency, with which
formerly they had connexion. For though <HI>For∣tune,</HI>
as well as <HI>Fate,</HI> be a branch or particle of the
proper object of the divine decree; yet as they have
<PB N="183" REF="222"/>
reference to man, this difference may in the last
place be observed betwixt then: Those things fall
out by meere <HI>chance</HI> or fortune, whose procurati∣on
or prevention hath not beene thought of at all
by man, or but sleightly, before they happen:
Those by <HI>fate,</HI> which have beene often and seri∣ously
thought of, but either farre exceed all expec∣tation,
or frustrate sollicitous care or forecast. Oft∣times
the unexpected accomplishment of one
mans expectation defeates the industrious hopes or
anxious contrivance of another, and such events
are in a twofold sense termed fatall.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. 23.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the degrees of necessity, and of the originall of in∣evitable
or absolute necessity.</HEAD>
<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>VEre the maine question hitherto
disputed, thus proposed, <HI>Whe∣ther
all things were only so farre
necessary, so farre contingent, as
it pleased the Omnipotent to ap∣point:
or whether the successe or
issue of humane intentions or contrivances, were so
far avoydable or unavoydable, as he hath made them
by his decree:</HI> I should have Infidels only for mine
adversaries: Christians, I am perswaded, will
move no questions about his power or ability, but
only about his will or pleasure, for determining all
things. And who can deny that Gods Law or co∣venant
for effecting some things, is more strict and
peremptory, then for effecting others. The Pro∣phet
supposed his covenant for day and night to
bee more certaine and invariable, than his cove∣nant
for the <HI>former</HI> and <HI>latter raine.</HI> And yet the
Law which he hath appointed for the most glori∣ous
creatures in the Firmament, is not like the law
of the Medes and Persians. It was dispensed with∣all
all at <HI>Iosuahs</HI> suit, and may againe be dispensed with
at his pleasure. The motion of the Sun and Moone,
is not perpetually necessary in respect of his de∣cree.
The seasons of seed time, harvest, and the
disposition of these lower Regions (in which <HI>For∣tune</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="223"/>
may seeme to have placed her wheele, and
<HI>Chance</HI> erected his tottering throane) may become
certaine and constant to such as constantly observe
his holy Covenants: <HI>If you walke in my statutes,
then will I give you rain in due season.</HI> Levit. 26. 4. &amp;c
Such was the wisedome of the Lawes given unto
this people, that by observing them, they might
have <HI>changed</HI> the disposition of the Ayre, <HI>altered</HI>
the influence of the Heavens, and have had <HI>domi∣nion</HI>
over the Starres.</P>
<P>2 Constancy of assent or adherēce unto these fun∣damental
truths of religion, wold fasten our minds
unto a point of inestimable use (as wel forreforming
or curing maladies of State▪ as of private life) of∣ten
in this Treatise intimated, but not fully decla∣red.
The point is this; maine events which at this
instant are meerely contingent, and may easily bee
prevented by diversity of practices, not onely pos∣sible
but acceptable by the divine appointment,
may in succession or revolution of time, become
more necessary, and at length truly <HI>fatall,</HI> alto∣gether
unavoydable. Absolutely necessary from
all eternities, nothing can truly be reputed, besides
the Deity, and the internall operations of the ever
blessed Trinity. Many things which from the be∣ginning
of time had but the first degrees of possibi∣lity,
(their contraries or incompatible opposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es
being in the highest degree of probability,) have
by the continued sinister sway of mans thoughts
and practices, beene drawne from meere possibili∣ties
to be more then probable, and unto the first de∣gree
of necessity: yet at the first not absolutely or
<PB N="186" REF="224"/>
irresistibly necessary. Some meanes there may be,
though but a few left of many, and those not easie
to be put in practice, for preventing them. The e∣vents
of greater consequences which stood thus,
were with the Heathens accounted <HI>Fata minora:</HI>
For Fates (as we said before) admit the selfe same
division or degrees that <HI>necessity</HI> doth. The same
events by omission of practices appointed by the
divine decree for their prevention, become altoge∣ther
irresistible and absolutely necessary in respect
of any meanes possible for averting them: yet not
absolutely necessary from eternitie, but absolutely
necessary only from that point of time, wherein
the eternall decree or providence did cut off all
contrary possibilities, which before were concur∣rent
with the possibility of their being. And events
thus utterly bestript of all contingency, or al possi∣bility
of being recalled or avoyded, were by the
Heathens ascribed [Fato majori] <HI>to greater Fates.</HI>
The <HI>symptomes</HI> or <HI>characters</HI> of events becomming
thus irresistibly &amp; absolutely <HI>necessary,</HI> come<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In the Treatise of Prodigies &amp; of their usefull ob∣servation.</NOTE> else∣where
(by Gods assistance) to be deciphered. Here
it sufficeth to advertise the Reader, that as divers
things besides, so necessitie may be enstyled <HI>abso∣lute</HI>
many waies, but two especially. Some things
are said to be absolutely necessarie, that is, altoge∣ther
inevitable, albeit this necessitie or inevitable∣nesse
did accrue from some occasions or set points
of time lately past. As many diseases, in their na∣ture
curable, and easie to have beene cured by ordi∣narie
medicines (if they had beene administred in
time,) do, by some few daies ill diet, by carelesse
<PB N="187" REF="224"/>
attendance, or casuall relapse, become altogether
incurable, by any after-care or helpe of physick.
Other events there be, which were absolutely ne∣cessarie
in respect of all times: their exhibition or
production could not by any policie of man have
beene prevented. So our Saviours death was abso∣lutely
necessary from the beginning of the World,
but whether absolutely necessary from eternity, or
absolutely necessary, without supposall of <HI>Adams</HI>
fall (which was not necessary) shall not here be di∣sputed.
Certaine it is, that nothing decreed by
God, can be so absolutely necessary as the Divine
Nature, or blessed Trinity is. Many errors have
found opportunity to mingle themselves with di∣vine
truth for want of a commodious distinction
or explication of this indistinct and confused terme
<HI>Absolute:</HI> the anatomy of it were worth the paines
of the Learned. Evident it is, that some things
which are not to day, may to morrow be, in their
kind, <HI>absolute.</HI></P>
<P>3 We truly say, that the summe of mony wher∣in
one man stands bound unto another, is absolute∣ly
due from the time of the forfaiture, or non-per∣formance
of the condition: that is, there is no plea
left in Law, no course or meanes of Iustice to a∣voyd
the payment of it. Yet was not the same sum
absolutely due from the first date of the bond; the
performance of the Condition in due time had
prevented the losse, which negligence or breach of
promise hath now made <HI>necessary</HI> and <HI>irrecoverable.</HI>
Moneys lent upon no other consideration, but up∣on
meere good will, to be repayd whensoever the
<PB N="188" REF="225"/>
party lending shall demand them; are <HI>absolutely</HI>
due, from the date of the recognizance, and for
that which is absolutely due, there is a necessitie
of payment or satisfaction.</P>
<P>4. Some <HI>disasterous</HI> events become, by divine
providence, <HI>irresistibly necessarie</HI> long before they
be actually accomplished, or inflicted: such was
the destruction of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> of <HI>Senacherib,</HI> the deso∣lation
of <HI>Iudah</HI> and <HI>Ierusalem</HI> by <HI>Titus.</HI> Others be∣come
<HI>fatally</HI> irresistible within some few dayes or
houres before they happen, other not till the very
moment wherein they are awarded either for some
grievous sinne then committed, or for some remar∣kable
document of Gods justice. Some againe are
for a long time totally <HI>irresistible</HI> and unpreventa∣ble;
others <HI>resistible quoad</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Cha. 24. parag. 9. &amp; 10.</NOTE> <HI>tantum,</HI> though not
<HI>quoad totum,</HI> that is, part of the evils might be pre∣vented,
though not the whole. All that we have
said concerning the alteration of possibilities, or
contingencies, or change of <HI>events</HI> contingent in∣to
<HI>necessary,</HI> may easily be conceived, without any
surmise of alteration in the Omnipotent, or in his
everlasting decree. The least degree of <HI>possibility</HI>
or <HI>contingency,</HI> is as necessarily derived from<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Nos cala∣mitatum nostrarum authores s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mus.

absolute <HI>irresistible</HI> will, as <HI>necessity</HI> it selfe in the
highest degree. It is impossible for <HI>possibility</HI> to
<PB N="189" REF="225"/>
have any right to <HI>actuall being</HI> without his speciall
appointment. To think that <HI>Fate, Chance,</HI> or <HI>For∣tune,</HI>
should <HI>nestle</HI> in some certaine periods of time,
or be brought forth by <HI>revolutiōs</HI> of the heavens, is
altogether heathenish. But neither doth Scripture
insinuate, nor can reason justly suspect any danger
in avouching, that the Almighty suffers that <HI>con∣tingency</HI>
or <HI>multiplicity</HI> of possibilities betweene
good and evill, or the severall degrees of evill,
wherewith hee hath endued the reasonable crea∣ture,
to <HI>explicate</HI> or <HI>contract</HI> it selfe in every mo∣ment
of time. And according to the nature of the
<HI>free</HI> motions of man, the irresistible decree brings
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such events or <HI>issues,</HI> as were truly possible
from eternity, but become necessary by <HI>revolutions,</HI>
not of the heavens, but of mans hart and thoughts;
publike plague or calamities become necessary, or
inevitable by these meanes onely. We must ever
remember that God hath not so decreed all things
before they come, or the manner how they shall
come, as that he doth not yet decree them. For he
continually decrees as well <HI>necessity</HI> as <HI>contingency,</HI>
and brings forth effects as well <HI>contingent</HI> as <HI>neces∣sary,</HI>
from this present houre; both being some∣times
meerly possible. The truth of this our last
assertion, may be demonstrated from our former
principle: <HI>If one part of a disjunctive proposition be
denied or faile, the other may be necessarily inferred,</HI>
though neither bee absolutely and determinately
necessary, but become such by consequence, or up∣on
supposition of the others failing. Many things
which in respect of our present purpose or resolu∣tion
<PB N="190" REF="228"/>
are free or contingent, may within a short
while after become altogether necessary and una∣voydable,
without any alteration or change in us.
Suppose a Iudge should be tied by oath to execute
justice upon a malefactor within eight dayes; there
is no necessity that he should performe his vow the
first, second, third or fourth day. The execution
or not execution of Iustice, is during the first seven
daies, free and contingent, without any breach or
violation of oath: but omitting the opportunities,
which the first seven dayes have offered, the exe∣cution
of Iustice upon the eighth day, is as necessa∣rie,
as his <HI>honesty</HI> or <HI>fidelity;</HI> as necessary, as if hee
had beene tied by oath to execute it upon that day
alone. The parts of indefinite time, or of the mat∣ter
promised or threatned by man, may be farre
more than this instance implies. So that the per∣formance
of those duties or promises, which for a
long time was free and arbitrarie, and might have
beene performed in different measure, becomes at
length absolutely necessary, and necessary to such a
determinate degree. The parts of Gods disjun∣ctive
decree, and the degrees as well of every mat∣ter
decreed by him, as of the <HI>time</HI> allotted for the
execution of it, may be <HI>numberlesse</HI> in respect of
us. And man by not entertaining the opportuni∣ties,
which by severall <HI>times</HI> have beene allotted
him, for reducing his possibilities of doing Gods
antecedent will into act, may forfeit the very pos∣sibilities
themselves for ever, or for a long time.
And by continuance of such neglect of many parts
or kindes of successe, all truly possible, in respect of
<PB N="191" REF="228"/>
the eternal decree; <HI>that</HI> only shall in the end be∣come
necessary, which he least desires, which his
soule shall most de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est. In respect of some future
events not as yet become necessary, the eternall de∣cree
leaves fewer branches of contrary contingen∣cies
or possibilities, in respect of others more.
Their multitude may expire or revive every mo∣ment,
according to the diversity of mens waies, on
which Gods will is alwaies done by means <HI>infinite,</HI>
at least to man incomprehensible.</P>
<P>4 The incarnation of our blessed Saviour, was
in the opinion of some of the Ancients, absolutely
necessary before the creation of mankind, &amp; should
in time <HI>infallibly</HI> have been accomplished for con∣firming
or augmenting that happy estate wherein
<HI>Adam</HI> was created; if so he had continued sted∣fast
in it untill the time appointed by God for his
change or translation. But however the Schooles
may determine or <HI>wave</HI> this question (I must con∣fesse,
neither very usefull nor in this place much ne∣cessary)
there was no necessity questionlesse, that
the <HI>second Adam</HI> should become a <HI>bloudy sacrifice</HI>
for our sinnes, unlesse the first <HI>Adam</HI> had sinned:
but after he, by his actuall transgression, had utter∣ly
cut off that <HI>possibility</HI> of perseverance, which the
eternall decree had bestowed upon him, the <HI>humi∣liation</HI>
and bitter <HI>passion</HI> of the <HI>Sonne</HI> of God, be∣came
as <HI>necessary</HI> in respect of Gods mercy and
bounty towards man, and of his infinite justice
which (notwithstanding his infinite mercy) was
to be fully satisfied, as his incarnation. After <HI>Cain</HI>
had despised Gods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and had slaine his bro∣ther
<PB N="192" REF="226"/>
<HI>Abel,</HI> it was necessary the Messias should
proceed from <HI>Seth;</HI> yet not then so necessary, that
he should be the sonne of <HI>Abraham,</HI> as the Son of
<HI>Seth.</HI> Others lineally descended from <HI>Seth,</HI> might
have forfeited their reall possibilities, or ordinary
hopes of attaining unto this glorie. At the least,
when God first made his promise to the Woman
and her seed, the birth of <HI>Abraham</HI> was not in re∣spect
of the eternall decree so necessary, as <HI>Christs</HI>
birth was. It was possible to have written <HI>Terah</HI> as
childlesse as <HI>Iechoniah,</HI> after his mariage with <HI>A∣brahams</HI>
mother. But after the same God had pas∣sed
that promise unto <HI>Abraham</HI> and confirmed
it by solemne oath, <HI>In thy seed shall al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the nations of
the earth be blessed:</HI> It was thenceforth altogether
as necessary, that our Redeemer should be the seed
of <HI>Abraham,</HI> as of the <HI>Woman:</HI> Yet not then so ne∣cessary,
that he should bee the sonne of <HI>Iudah,</HI> or
that <HI>Iudah</HI> should have a sonne called <HI>Iesse,</HI> or that
<HI>Iesse</HI> should have a son called <HI>David,</HI> a man after
Gods owne heart. That glory, which long after
Gods oath to <HI>Abraham,</HI> befell the Tribe of <HI>Iudah,</HI>
was (for ought we know or can object unto the
contrary) a part of that dignity; whose possibility
was once really possessed by <HI>Reuben,</HI> though utter∣ly
forfeited by his misdemeanour. But after <HI>Iacob</HI>
had prophesied, that the Scepter should <HI>not depart
from Iudah,</HI> till <HI>Shilo</HI> come, or rather after the Lord
had <HI>sworne</HI> not to <HI>faile David</HI> in bestowing the
prerogative promised to <HI>Iudah</HI> upon his seed, the
necessity becomes as great, that our High Priest,
after the Order of <HI>Melchisedeck,</HI> should bee the
<PB N="193" REF="226"/>
sonne of <HI>David</HI> as the son of Man, or seed of <HI>A∣braham.</HI>
Now if we can perswade our selves, that
God either speakes or sweares as he truly intends,
or that mortall man may certainly know where to
have <HI>him,</HI> or what to trust to: wee must beleeve
and acknowledge those events concerning which
he hath <HI>sworne</HI> not to <HI>repent,</HI> to be farre more ne∣cessary
in respect of the irresistible decree, from
the first interposition of such oath; then those ordi∣nary
blessings or cursings, which hee seriously
threat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth or promiseth, but disjunctively, &amp; with
expresse reservation of their repentance whom he
threatneth, or of their defection whom he incoura∣geth
by his promises: yet such was his covenant
of life and death with his people, such was his de∣cree
concerning the prosperity or calamity of <HI>Da∣vids</HI>

course of that eternall providence, by whose irre∣sistible

<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>OMER was not so blinded with the
heathenish misconceit of Fate, as
not-to-see more wayes to death
than one. In <HI>Achilles</HI> he described
two courses of life, the one shorter

<L>My life was long, but with no Fame,</L>
<L>Or praise to be repay'd.</L></Q>
<P>Now as one poyson sometimes expels another:
so this opinion of double Fate, (if men be disposed
to use this terme) takes away the malignity of that
error, which holds all events to be <HI>fatall;</HI> albeit of
such twofolded fates or successe, the one part or
the other must by absolute necessity be fulfilled, ac∣cording
to the parties <HI>choise,</HI> unto whom they are
<HI>awarded.</HI> The <HI>body</HI> of that which <HI>Homer shadowed</HI>
in <HI>Achilles,</HI> is evidently contained in Gods fore∣mentioned
covenant with Israell, and sealed unto
us by manifest experience in <HI>Davids</HI> line. For of
Gods speciall providence over the seed of <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
or the Iewish nation in generall, we have trea∣ted
at large in the first Booke of the Comments
upon the Apostles Creed. The contrary <HI>Fates</HI> of
<HI>Davids</HI> kingdome in succeeding ages, seeme to
wrastle &amp; strive, as <HI>Iacob</HI> and <HI>Esau</HI> did in the womb,
or to countersway each other, like two opposite
<HI>scales</HI> unequally ballanced, by turnes. That thus it
<HI>fared</HI> with <HI>Davids</HI> Kingdome, doth not argue
Gods decree concerning it to have beene mutable,
but rather immutably to have <HI>elevated</HI> &amp; <HI>depressed</HI>
<PB N="196" REF="231"/>
both Prince and People, according to the degrees
of their mutability in turning to him or from him.</P>
<P>2 <HI>Salomon</HI> had the largest talent of wealth, and
the greatest measure of wit to use it, that any earth∣ly
King either before or after him had. His possi∣bilities
to increase his kingdome, and propagate
greatnesse to his posterity, were much greater than
any earthly Monarch since him might expect. Ma∣ny
parts of Gods glorious promises made to <HI>Da∣vid,</HI>
were literally meant of him, which were never
literally fulfilled in him, or in his naturall linage;
because they did not performe the conditions,
which God required, that they might bee more
capable of his extraordinary undeserved favours.
The Covenant with <HI>David</HI> is expressed <HI>Psal. 89.
I have found David my servant: with my holy oyle
have I anointed him. With whom my hand shall bee
established: mine arme also shall strengthen him. The
enemy also shall not exact upon him: nor the sonne of
wickednesse afflict him. And I will beat downe his
foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.</HI>
This promise pertaines to <HI>David</HI> and to his suc∣cessors:
but however the promise was on Gods
part unalterable, yet the prerogative promised was
subject unto change on contingency. For so a little
after the Psalmist distinguisheth betwixt <HI>Davids</HI>
seed and <HI>Davids</HI> sonnes. <HI>His seed will I make to en∣dure
for ever, and his throne as the dayes of Heaven.</HI>
This he speakes not of many, but of one, to wit, of
Christ, to whom onely the Kingdome of <HI>David</HI>
was predestinated. Of such as were ordained to
this Kingdome, he speakes in the plurall, not abso∣lutely
<PB N="197" REF="231"/>
but conditionally: <HI>If his children forsake my
Law, and walke not in my judgements; if they breake
my Statutes, and keepe not my Commandements:
Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and
their iniquity with stripes.</HI> The tenour then of Gods
Covenant with <HI>David</HI> as it concerned Christ was
absolute, but as it concernes <HI>Davids</HI> other sonnes,
it was disjunctive, or conditionall. If any shall
question why God for many generations did deale
no better with <HI>Davids</HI> successors, than with the
successors of other Kings, the answer from the te∣nour
of the Covenant is plaine, <HI>They forsooke his
Lawes, and would not walke in his Iudgements.</HI> Psal.
89. vers. 32. <HI>and thus breaking his Statutes, their
visitation was altogether unevitable,</HI> not on a sud∣den,
but by degrees. The Lords arme even in <HI>Sa∣lomons</HI>
time was stretched out, ready to <HI>fetch</HI> the
blow, which after his death fell upon his son <HI>Reho∣boam,</HI>
as heire to his <HI>chastisements.</HI> The blow was
sudden and smart; for of twelve Tribes, ten were
rent from his Kingdome by <HI>Ieroboam.</HI> The wounds
Inflicted by the Egyptian upon <HI>Iudah</HI> and <HI>Benja∣min,</HI>
and upon <HI>Ierusalem</HI> her selfe, were grievous,
though as yet not uncurable. So grievous as might
give that people plainly to understand, that the
prosperity of <HI>Davids</HI> earthly Kingdome was not
like the dayes of heaven, nor the glory of <HI>Salomons</HI>
throne like <HI>the Sunne</HI> in the Firmament, altogether
priviledged from change, or mutability. But al∣beit
the motion of the <HI>creature,</HI> appointed to exe∣cute
Gods wrath, were sudden, yet the waight of
Ierusalems burthen was not permanent, because
<PB N="198" REF="232"/>
shee was not as yet frozen in sinne.</P>
<P>3 Of <HI>Rehoboams</HI> successors some were good,
and these by their penitency and heroicall <HI>reforma∣tion,</HI>
set <HI>back</HI> the Diall of such dismall <HI>Fates,</HI> as still
did threaten them: many were bad, and did draw
Gods plagues upon themselves and their people.
And whilest the <HI>blow</HI> of Gods stretched out arme,
is diverted and borne off by the fervent prayers
of godly <HI>Princes;</HI> the waight of the whole Nations
burthen, is much increased by the iniquity of the
people. Either the number of the supplicants was
not equall to the number of the delinquents; or
the fervency of their prayer and repentance, not so
constant, as the others delight in sin and wicked∣nesse.
The waight of their <HI>sinister Fates,</HI> by this
meanes secretly and insensibly increasing (even
whilest their motion was restrained or abated) <HI>in∣creased</HI>
the swiftnesse or violence of the motion,
when by permission of the Divine Decree, they
had liberty to take their wonted course. <HI>Ioas</HI> and
<HI>Achas</HI> pulled them on so fast, that <HI>Micha</HI> threat∣ned
judgement, not against the King and Nobles
onely, but against City and Temple, in such a thun∣dring
voice, as if desolation had even then besieged
the City round about, and utter destruction was
ready to enter in at the breach: <HI>Therefore shall Sion
for your sake be plowed as a Field, and Ierusalem shall
become heapes, and the mountaine of the house, as the
high places of the Forest. Micha 3. ver. 12.</HI> Spake he
this of his owne times, or of some others follow∣ing?
was it in respect of the Eternall Decree, alto∣gether
<HI>impossible</HI> for this dreadfull sentence to have
<PB N="199" REF="232"/>
beene forthwith put in execution? Indeed many
of their Magistrates and Politicians, most of their
Priests and Prophets, untill this very instant had
said to the like purpose: <HI>Is not the Lord among us,
none evill can come upon us. vers. 11.</HI> This vaine
confidence presumptuously and falsly grounded
upon the immutability of Gods promises, made the
doome menaced by <HI>Micha</HI> more necessary and
<HI>fatall</HI> at this time, than otherwise it would have
beene; though to such as understood the tenour
of Gods Covenant with his people, neither at
this time nor many yeares after, altogether un∣evitable.</P>
<P>4 The good King <HI>Hezekiah</HI> knew the Lord did
not threaten in jest, and for this reason his feare was
hearty, and his prayers earnest: <HI>Did he not feare
the Lord, and besought the face of the Lord? Ier. 26.
ver. 19.</HI> But did this his feare or hearty prayes im∣paire
the present possibility or necessity of the
plagues threatned? Yes, <HI>The Lord repented him.</HI> Of
what? that he had denounced all this evill against
Ierusalem, or intreated <HI>Hezekiah</HI> so roughly by his
Prophet <HI>Micha?</HI> no: <HI>But the Lord repented him
of the evill which he had denounced against him and
meant to execute.</HI> For who <HI>repents</HI> himselfe of that
which he did not so much as truly intend? Is God
then as man that he should repent? It is impossible
that there should be any <HI>change</HI> of purpose in God,
&amp; herein he is most unlike to man, or the son of mā,
whose repentance alwayes includes some internall
alteratiō of <HI>wil</HI> or <HI>purpose,</HI> not of the matter purpo∣sed
only. Our best intentions of <HI>good</HI> to others, of∣ten
<PB N="200" REF="233"/>
expire upon particular respects, and cannot be
revived againe, albeit we neither had just occasion
to take dislike, nor the same reasons to continue it,
which we had to take it. Through the inconstan∣cie
of our nature we loath to morrow what we like
to day: our affections alter without any change in
the matter affected by us. Far otherwise it is with
God, whose will or purpose is still <HI>immutable;</HI> and
yet exactly fitteth every <HI>change</HI> or <HI>mutation</HI> in the
<HI>creature.</HI> To have punished Ierusalem continuing
her wonted course (but sixe moneths longer after
the Prophet had thus warned her) with such mise∣ries
as <HI>Senacherib</HI> had menaced, was one part of
the eternall and unchangeable decree: another
part of the same decree (no lesse immutable) was
to avert these plagues from Ierusalem truly repen∣ting
upon their denunciation. No former wicked∣nesse
could alienate his love from her, or make him
recall the blessings promised to <HI>David,</HI> so long as
this people was so affected, as in that covenant was
required.</P>
<P>5 The <HI>possibility</HI> of the desolation menaced by
<HI>Micha,</HI> was, for the present, as great, as the As∣syrian
was potent. It might truly have beene said
of this City, in respect of his army, what one saith
of Navigators:</P>
<Q>Est tua tam prope mors, quàm prope cernis aquam.</Q>
<P>That extraordinary power wherewith the Lord
had armed this Tyrant to take vengeance upon his
neighbour nations, might well make the present
<PB N="201" REF="233"/>
avoydance of the plagues menaced by <HI>Micha,</HI>
seeme almost <HI>impossible.</HI> But good <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> by
turning with all his heart, and all his soule unto the
Lord, unto whom all things are possible, did not
only remove destruction threatned from the City
and Temple, but caused it to turne upon the de∣stroyer.
Ierusalem and Iudah, by the unfained pe∣nitence
of <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> became the object of
Gods <HI>antecedent will,</HI> and fell under the former
part of Gods Covenant with <HI>David: The enemy
shall not exact upon him, nor the sonne of wickednesse
afflict him. And I will beat downe his foes before his
face, and plague them that hate him. Psal 89. vers.
22, 23.</HI> The Assyrian by going beyond his com∣mission,
in daring not <HI>Hezekiah</HI> only, but the Lord
of Hosts, unto whose protection <HI>Hezekiah</HI> had
fled, becomes the object of Gods <HI>consequent will,</HI>
which by divine appointment, he was at that time
to execute upon Ierusalem; but upon Ierusalem
fallen away by disobedience, not upon Ierusalem
returning in heart unto her God.</P>
<P>6 That this people might have some time of
breathing and respite to gather themselves for the
better accomplishing of so great a worke, as <HI>Heze∣kiah</HI>
had begun; the Lord in his wisdome so dis∣posed
that <HI>Tirhakah King of Cush</HI> should make for∣ward
to entertaine <HI>Senacherib</HI> with battaile at that
very instant, wherein he had purposed to give the
on set upon Ierusalem. This unexpected removall
of present terror, was (no doubt) a sure <HI>pledge</HI> un∣to
the people for strengthning their relyance on
Gods promise, for <HI>setling</HI> their hearts and continu∣ing
<PB N="202" REF="234"/>
their constancy in fervent prayers, during the
time of the enemies absence. And seeing the force
of Egypt and Cush were not sufficient to dissipate
<HI>Senacheribs</HI> mighty army, perhaps not able to hold
him play any longer; the Lord sends <HI>Hezekiah</HI> and
his people deliverance from heaven: <HI>Then the
Angell of the Lord went forth, and smote in the Camp
of the Assyrians, a hundreth fourescore and five thou∣sand:
and when they arose, early in the morning, be∣hold
they were all dead corpses. Isaiah, 37. vers. 36.</HI>
The noise of this great overthrow was as the joy∣full
sound of a Iubile unto Ierusalem, and did por∣tend
another more admirable and victorious Iu∣bile
to bee accomplished in the same place; of
which<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In the Treatise of Christs an∣swer to <HI>Iohn.</HI></NOTE> elsewhere. This for the present might
witnesse to <HI>Hezekiah</HI> and the people, that rather
then one tittle of Gods Covenant with <HI>David</HI>
should fal to the ground, the host of heaven should
leave their station, and keepe garrison on earth. A
little after this miraculous deliverance, the Sun is
compelled to goe fifteene degrees backwards, for
setting forward the course of <HI>Hezekiah</HI> his life,
whom <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Fate</HI> had now, in the worlds
sight, arrested. God hereby testified unto Prince
and People, that if they would continue such in
<HI>health,</HI> as they were in <HI>sicknesse,</HI> so well-minded in
peace and prosperity, as they had beene in strait
siege, or other distresse of war: Ierusalems good
dayes might become as certaine and constant, as
the dayes of heaven; seeing that great light, which
was appointed from the beginning to rule the day,
did now give place to <HI>Hezekiahs</HI> prayers. But most
<PB N="203" REF="234"/>
of this people were most unlike their Prince, albeit
even he, after he had received those two miracu∣lous
pledges of Gods loue, <HI>did not render according
to the reward bestowed upon him.</HI> 2 Chron. 32. v. 25.
<HI>For his heart was lifted up, therefore there was wrath
upon him, and upon Iudah and Ierusalem. Notwith∣standing,
Hezekiah humbled himselfe for the pride of
his heart (both he and the inhabitants of Ierusalem:)
so that the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in
the dayes of Hezekiah.</HI></P>
<P>7 After the yoake of <HI>Ashur</HI> was taken from off
this peoples neck, many of them became wanton,
others secure, as not suspecting that <HI>a Cockatrice
should spring out of this Serpents root, that his fruit
should be a fiery flying Serpent. Isai. 14. v. 29.</HI> Vnto
<HI>Hezekiah</HI> himselfe, though a most wise and prudent
King, the Babylonian tyranny, being now in his in∣fancy,
did seeme by nature mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mild and gentle,
than the Assyrian had beene. And not content to
entertaine the King of Babylons Ambassadors with
curtesies sutable to their congratulations, he shew∣ed
them his treasury and all the good things wher∣with
the Lord had blessed him: willing (perhaps)
to give their master and the world to wit, that not∣withstanding
the former wars and exactions, hee
was no begger; but a fit confederate for neighbour
Princes, to <HI>curbe</HI> the insolency of the Assyrian,
whose strength though much abated by the ter∣rible
blow, which the Angell of the Lord had gi∣ven
<HI>Senacheribs</HI> host, was not quite broken till ma∣ny
yeares after. But the Prophet knew this fawn∣ing
whelpe to be of wolvish kinde, and discovered
<PB N="204" REF="235"/>
those implanted seeds of cruelty in him, which
when they came to be ripe, would be more noy∣some
to the Kings and Princes of Iudah, than his
predecessor the Assyrian had beene. <HI>Isaiah said un∣to
Hezekiah, Heare the word of the Lord: Behold,
the dayes come, that all that is in thy house, and that
which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day,
shall be caried unto Babylon: nothing shall bee left,
saith the Lord. And of thy sonnes that shall issue
from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take a∣way,
and they shall bee Eunuches in the palace of
the King of Babylon.</HI> 2 King. Chapter 20. vers.
17, 18.</P>
<P>8 Any Heathen which had held <HI>Esaias</HI> for an
undoubted <HI>Sooth-sayer,</HI> would instantly have con∣cluded
hence, that the captivity of <HI>Hezekiahs</HI> suc∣cessors,
and all the miseries which the Babylonian
afterwards brought upon Iudah and Ierusalem,
were absolutely <HI>fatall,</HI> altogether impossible to be
avoided. And many good Christians (perhaps)
will question, whether the plagues here threatned,
were not from this point of time, necessary in re∣spect
of the Divine Decree. To answer this que∣stion
by interrogation: Why should not the spirit
of the Prophet <HI>Esay</HI> be as truly subject to the for∣mer
propheticall rule, as <HI>Micahs</HI> was? Now God,
according to that rule, was ready to repent him of
all the evill, which he had threatned, whensoever
the people should repent them of whatsoever they
had done. The Lord had given <HI>Hezekiah</HI> and his
successors a farre larger and longer time, for pre∣venting
the evill which <HI>Esay</HI> threatned, than they
<PB N="205" REF="235"/>
had for avoiding the doome denounced by <HI>Mi∣cah.</HI>
The very tenour of the denunciation made
by <HI>Esay,</HI> shewes them a ready meanes for preven∣ting
the woe denounced; so they would have laid
it to their hearts, or followed the advise of succeed∣ing
Prophets. But <HI>mortality</HI> must needs be rife,
where variety of diseases and multitudes of unskil∣full
Empyricks do meer. The common transgres∣sions
of the people, are the epidemicall diseases of
States: and such projects as Princes or Statesmen,
without the prescript of Gods Word, or sugge∣stion
of his Providence, use for their recovery, are
like unseasonable ministration of <HI>Empyricall</HI> or <HI>old
wives medicines,</HI> to crased bodies. They usually
invite or entertaine the destruction or ruine of king∣domes,
otherwise ready to depart. Not the best
amongst the Kings of Iudah, but were smatterers
in empyricall or secular policy. Some were more,
some lesse, all too much given to put confidence
in multitude of men and store of treasure. And for
increasing this supposed <HI>sinew</HI> of Warre and nutri∣ment
of Peace, they used meanes, neither warran∣table
by Gods written Law, nor by the rule of cha∣ritie.
To prevent this mischiefe which is the root
of all evill, what perswasion could be more fit or
pertinent, than this prediction of the Prophet:
<HI>That the wealth which Hezekiah and his fathers had
heaped together,</HI> which his successors would be too
carefull to increase, would in succeeding ages steale
their children, for whom it was provided, from
them, and make them miserable captives in a for∣raigne
Land. To heape up riches we know not for
<PB N="206" REF="236"/>
whom, is a vanity; to heape them up with care and
toile to the destruction of our best private friends,
and advancement of the publike enemy, is the ex∣tremity
of folly mixt with misery. Had <HI>Hezekiah</HI>
his successors beene as ready to aske counsell of
Gods Prophets as of Politicians; these could have
instructed them, that the miseries foretold by <HI>Esay,</HI>
were <HI>fatall</HI> unto covetousnesse and unconscionable
care for posterity; yet not simply <HI>necessary</HI> after co∣vetousnesse
was much increased in <HI>Hezekiahs</HI> suc∣cessors.
For long after the going out of this decree,
whensoever the Princes of Iudah repented for
their owne oppression, and the oppression of their
fathers, the Lord <HI>repented him of the plagues</HI> de∣nounced,
and shewed himselfe ready to remove
the oppressor from them. And though in peniten∣cy
in other sinnes, did in part concur; yet continu∣ance
in violence and oppression, was the principall
string and <HI>fatall</HI> cord, by which the Princes of Iu∣dah
did draw <HI>captivity</HI> upon themselves and their
children, and <HI>desolation</HI> upon the City.</P>
<P>9 <HI>To passe over the various alternation of Iu∣dahs
and Ierusalems different fates, in the dayes of</HI>
Manasses Ammon, <HI>and</HI> Iosias, <HI>and come to</HI> Iehoikim,
Iosias <HI>sonne, in whose dayes the inveterate disease
of Iudah came to a Crisis:</HI> Did not thy Father
<HI>(saith the Prophet</HI> Ieremy <HI>to this untoward and Prince)</HI>
eate and drinke, and doe judgement and justice, and
then it was well with him? He judged the cause of the
poore and needy, then it was well with him: was not
this to know me (saith the Lord?) But thine eyes and
thy heart are not, but for thy covetousnesse, and for to
<PB N="207" REF="236"/>
shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for vio∣lence
to doe it. Therefore thus saith the Lord con∣cerning
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Iose∣phus</HI> in the history of <HI>Iehoiakim. Et Seder Olam.</HI></NOTE>Iehoiakim the son of Iosiah King of Iudah,
They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my bro∣ther,
or ah sister: they shall not lament for him, say∣ing,
Ah Lord, or ah his glory. He shall bee buried
with the buriall of an Asse, drawne and cast forth be∣yond
the gates of Ierusalem. <HI>Ier. 22. vers. 15, 16,
17, 18, 19.</HI></P>
<P>Shortly after the execution of this sentence up∣on
<HI>Iehoiakim</HI> in full measure, <HI>Ieconiah</HI> his son, with
other of the royall seed, according to <HI>Esaias</HI> for∣mer
prophesie, were caried captives unto Babell,
and all or some of them made Eunuches. How∣beit
the execution of the same decree upon <HI>Zede∣kiah</HI>
and such as were yet left behinde, was not as
yet unavoydable, or meerly <HI>fatall;</HI> but such not∣withstanding
they made it at last by continuance
of like covetousnesse and oppression.</P>
<P><HI>When the City was more narrowly besieged
by the Chaldean, than it had beene by the Assyri∣an:
the Lord of hosts calls for the Aegyptian, as
he had done for the King of Cush, to remove the
siege. The libertie and respiration which</HI> Zedekiah
<HI>and his besieged people in the meane time got, be∣ing
much greater then</HI> Hezekiah <HI>had for two years
space together; was a true pledge of Gods</HI> antece∣dent
will, <HI>which in part they had fulfilled, and
which should undoubtedly have beene fulfilled in
greater measure for their good, so they had used
this liberty to Gods glory; or gone on so well in
this time of</HI> breathing, <HI>as in their</HI> distresse <HI>they had
<PB N="208" REF="237"/>
begun.</HI> Ye were now turned, and had done right in
my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his
neighbour, and ye had made a covenant before me in
the house which is called by my name. But ye returned
and polluted my name, and caused every man his ser∣vant,
and every man his hand-maid, whom hee had
set at liberty at their pleasure, to returne; and brought
them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and
for hand-maids. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Yee
have not hearkned unto me, in proclaiming libertie
every one to his brother, and every man to his neigh∣bour:
behold I proclaime a liberty for you, saith the
Lord, to the Sword, to the Pestilence, and to the Fa∣mine:
and I will make you to be removed into all the
Kingdomes of the Earth, &amp;c. <HI>Ier. 34. v. 15, 16, 17.</HI>
And Zedekiah King of Iudah and his Princes will I
give into the hands of their enemies, and into the
hand of them that seeke their life, and into the hand
of the King of Babylons army which are gone up from
you. Behold, I will command, saith the Lord, and
cause them to returne to this City, and they shall fight
against it, and take it, and burne it with fire, and I
will make the Cities of Iudah a desolation without an
inhabitant. <HI>ver. 21, 22.</HI></P>
<P>10 Too much skill in secular policy made them
put too great confidence in the strength of Ae∣gypt:
and this confidence in the helpe of man,
made them secure, whilest they were conscious of
breaking the Covenant which their Fathers had
made, and they lately renewed with their God.
The probabilities of the Aegyptians success against
the Chaldean, were (in all politique esteeme) very
<PB N="209" REF="237"/>
great: and likely it is that the Chaldeans were
brought back againe with speed unto Ierusalem by
the speciall hand of the Almighty, that they might
execute his judgements upon this rebellious peo∣ple.
How necessary, how <HI>fatall</HI> and unevitable the
execution of his <HI>consequent</HI> will alwayes becomes,
where his <HI>antecedent</HI> will hath beene thus openly
and wilfully neglected, may best be gathered from
the same Prophets reiterated threats unto this peo∣ple,
resuming (as it seemes) their former vaine
confidence of the Chaldeans finall departure, after
his forementioned prophecy to the contrary. Ier.
37. ver. 9, 10. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, deceive not your
selves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from
us: for they shall not depart. For though ye had smit∣ten
the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against
you, and there remained but wounded men among
them; yet should they rise every man in his tent, and
burne this Citie with fire.</HI> To extinguish this <HI>flame,</HI>
or prevent the <HI>extinction</HI> of <HI>Zedekiahs</HI> royall race
and Iudahs earthly glory, there was no possibility
left, so long as they wrestled with <HI>Fates,</HI> and made
policie their strength: yet was there after this time,
a possibility, as true, as Gods promise can make
any, for escaping <HI>à tanto,</HI> though not <HI>à toto;</HI> a pos∣sibility
for <HI>Zedekiah</HI> to have kept himselfe and his
family in a better estate, then they afterwards en∣joyed;
a possibility to have left the City and
Temple standing, after death had disposed of them;
so he would at the time appointed by God, have
submitted himselfe unto the King of Babell, unto
whom he had sworne allegiance. <HI>Then said Iere∣miah
<PB N="210" REF="238"/>
unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the Lord the God
of Hostes, the God of Israel; If thou wils assuredly goe
forth unto the King of Babylons Princes, then thy
soule shall live, and this Citie shall not bee burnt with
fire, and thou shalt live and thy house. But if thou
wilt not goe forth to the King of Babylons Princes,
then shall this City bee given into the hands of the
Chaldeans, and they shall burne it with fire, and thou
shalt not escape out of their hand.</HI> Ier. 38. ver. 17, 18</P>
<P><HI>And</HI> Zedekiah <HI>the King said unto</HI> Ieremiah; I
am afraid of the Iewes that are fallen to the Chalde∣ans,
lest they deliver mee into their hand, and they
mocke me. But Ieremiah sayd, They shall not deliver
thee: obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the Lord,
which I spake unto thee: so it shall bee well unto thee,
and thy soule shall live. But if thou refuse to go forth,
this is the word which the Lord hath shewed me. And
behold, all the women that are left in the King of Iu∣dahs
house, shall bee brought forth unto the King of
Babylons Princes, and those women shall say; Thy
friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against
thee: thy feet are sunke in the mire, and they are tur∣ned
away back. So they shall bring out all thy wives,
and thy children to the Chaldeans, and thou shalt not
escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand
of the King of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this Ci∣tie
to bee burnt with fire. &amp;c. <HI>vers. 19, 20, 21,
22, 23.</HI></P>
<P>11 This last neglect of Gods <HI>antecedent will,</HI> so
often revealed for his good, procured the speedy
execution of his <HI>consequent will</HI> without all possibi∣lity
to avoid it. Not a title of <HI>Ieremies</HI> or <HI>Ezekiels</HI>

prophesie, which his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Jose∣phus</HI> in the Historie of <HI>Zedekiah.</HI></NOTE> Politicians sought to set at
variance, but is exactly fulfilled upon him, and so is
<HI>Micahs</HI> prophesie upon this Citie. The manner
how <HI>Ieremies</HI> and <HI>Ezekiels</HI> prophesie, which seeme
to contradict each other, were both fulfilled, is ad∣mirable,
and might well move a man, not well ac∣quainted
with the nature of prophecies and Gods
speciall providence, to think the <HI>Fates</HI> had plotted
his ruine. But this particular argument is prosecu∣ted
elsewhere more at large.</P>
<P>12 To recapitulate the summe of many argu∣ments
to like purposes vnto every possible choise
or resolution made by man, whether concerning
matters private or publique, there is a distinct cor∣respondent
successe allotted by the omnipotent

resolution, is as the drawing of a new lott, whose
just price or recompence, be it good or bad, is <HI>in∣stampt</HI>
upon it from eternity. And for the <HI>awar∣ding</HI>
or payment of it in due time, the whole host
of Gods creatures stand bound by the very tenour
of their beeing or dependancy upon their Maker.
Seeing all of them were made by his word, and are
continued by his meere will and pleasure; sooner
shall they forfeit their very beeing, and be resolved
into nothing, than the least tittle of Gods will, con∣cerning
any creature, should not be fulfilled; or,
that <HI>successe,</HI> be it good or bad, should not be awar∣ded

live in cold countries, and in Europe</HI> (as distinct
from Greece) <HI>are stout and hardy, but not so wise and
politick; more free then civill, much apter to be their
owne men then their neighbours masters. The Asi∣atickes</HI>
(that want no wit) <HI>are destitute of courage:
therefore they remaine in servitude and subjection
<PB N="214" REF="240"/>
unto others. The Grecians as they enjoy the middle
place for situation, so they participate with the Asi∣aticks
for wit, and colder countries for courage, in such
proportion, as enapts them to preserve their libertie,
and to beare rule and soveraignty over others.</HI> Many
Comets at their first appearance, are usually mis∣taken
for fixed Starres, reputed next in glory unto
the Moone; untill their parallax bewray their
place, and their sudden end discover their orginall
to bee corruption. Thus the brightnesse of the
Grecian Monarchy, whilest it was in <HI>rising</HI> or com∣ming
unto its <HI>height,</HI> misperswaded their hearts
whose eyes it dazeled, that it was to endure like the
daies of heaven; whereas it proved but like the gli∣string
bubbles of the morning dew, which dissolve
with the strength of those <HI>beames,</HI> that gave them
lustre. This is the onely difference: the <HI>period</HI> of
their splendor falls in the compasse of an houre, and
<HI>Comets</HI> usually continue not many months. Wher∣as
the <HI>rise</HI> and <HI>fall</HI> of Kingdomes commonly out∣reach
any one mans age or observation, and such as
follow marke the occurrences of their owne times
more then their connexion with former. Whence
it is, that secular politicians are alwayes learning,
and never attaine unto the knowledge of what they
seeke. Howbeit, <HI>Aristotle</HI> lived long enough to
have seene his error, for <HI>Alexander</HI> (I take it) did
dye before him, and with <HI>Alexanders</HI> life the light
of Macedon was extinguished, and the glory of
Greece much eclipsed and abated. And though
neither Greece nor Macedon have changed their
clime or site, yet <HI>Aristotles</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Keene

Cocks of the game,</HI> have <HI>proved</HI> as arrant <HI>Cravens</HI>

ever hatched: infamous for <HI>effeminatenesse</HI>
under the Romanes, so deeply infected with the
Asi-aticke <HI>luxury,</HI> that their very nature seemed to
be tainted with servility, and to sollicite that bar∣barous
yoake, which for a long time hath been laid
upon them. But their present estate stands in more
need of our prayers, then their fore-elders did of
our censure. To returne unto their best times.</P>
<P>2 Never had any Monarchy on Earth save one
(if happily that may be called a Monarchy) either
so speedy an erection or so sudden a dissolution, as
the Macedonian had. The true reason of its sud∣den
dissolution, as a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>san.</NOTE> Writer in this case unparti∣ally
tells us, was, because the Foundation of it was
laid by perjury. The true cause of its swift erecti∣on,
was partly the execution of Gods justice upon
the Persian, and other Nations communicants
with him in his present <HI>luxury,</HI> partly the accom∣plishing
of Gods <HI>antecedent will</HI> for the good of
his Church, as is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In the fulfilling of that pro∣phesie, <HI>Zac. 9. v. 9.</HI></NOTE> elsewhere specified. In <HI>Aristotles</HI>
time, <HI>Alexander</HI> was, as <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> had

<P>3 The incredible successe of <HI>Alexanders</HI> furious
attempts were such, as no Heathen which outlived
him, could ascribe unto policy, wealth, or strength,
or whatsoever meanes meerly humane. Amongst
others, the <HI>heroicall</HI> Romane Poet so describes his

his <HI>restlesse instinct</HI> to purchase same, but as a

<HI>spur</HI> to make him runne the race, and his sudden

<P>4▪ Some passages in this Poet may serve as a
<HI>Motto</HI> to <HI>Apelles</HI> his devise, who painted <HI>Alexan∣der</HI>
with a <HI>thunderbolt</HI> in his hand; as if hee had
beene appointed for a sudden terrour to Nations
farre and near, astonishing more places with dread
of his <HI>swift approach,</HI> then felt his stroke. But what∣soever
the Poet or Painter could expresse, was
more excellently represented by Gods Prophet,
many yeares before <HI>Alexander</HI> or <HI>Darius</HI> was born.
<HI>And as I was considering, behold, an hee Goat came
from the West on the face of the whole earth, and tou∣ched
not the ground: and the Goat had a notable horn
betweene his eyes. And hee came to the Ramme that
had two hornes, which I had seene standing before
the river, and ranne unto him in the fury of his po∣wer.
And I saw him come close unto the Ramme, and
he was moved with choler against him, and smote the
Ramme, and brake his two hornes, and there was no
power in the Ramme to stand before him, but hee cast
him downe to the ground, and stamped upon him; and
there was none that could deliver the Ramme out of
<PB N="218" REF="242"/>
his hand. Therefore the hee Goat waxed very great,
and when he was strong, the great horne was broken:
and for it came up foure notable ones, towards the
foure windes of heaven.</HI> Dan. 8. ver. 5, 6, 7, 8. What

that are not theirs. They are terrible and dreadfull:
their judgement and their dignity shall proceed of

and their horsemen shall come from far, they shall flye

<P>The true and finall reason, as well of the Assy∣rians
as the Chaldeans sudden greatnesse and suc∣cesse
in battaile, was the accomplishment of Gods
consequent will upon Israel and other neighbour
Countries, growne, by speedy increase of their
iniquitie, slaughter-ripe. Howbeit, the power it

sure pledge of Gods antecedent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide S. Hieron. in cap. Isai. 45 v. 2. &amp; 3.</NOTE> will for their

owne greater good; so they had gratefully ac∣knowledged
his goodnes in making them so great.
But when these <HI>Battaile-Axes</HI> began to lift up
themselves against him, which hewed the Nations
with them; <HI>he</HI> abated their edge and softned their
temper. Of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> whose excessive
pride had made him prouder then the rest, that O∣racle
was verified in an exquisite sense:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Psal. 49, 20.</NOTE> <HI>Man be∣ing
in honour had no understanding, but became like
the beast that perisheth.</HI> And that other remnant
of the last forecited prophecie, was literally fulfil∣led
in him, of whom it was meant; <HI>Then shall his

this his power unto his God.</HI> Habak. 1. v. 11.
And <HI>Balshashar</HI> his sonne not taking warning by
his humiliation, nor by the hand writing upon the
wall, was surprized with sudden destruction, ei∣ther
the selfe same night wherein the hand was
seene writing, or (which is more probable) the
same night of some yeare following. He had filled
the measure of his fathers sinnes, as <HI>full</HI> with ini∣quity,
as the <HI>boules</HI> wherein he caroused were with
wine; and <HI>that</HI> being full, to drinke the cup of
Gods wrath was to him at that time, <HI>necessary.</HI></P>
<P>2 Now according to the Chaldeans growth in
former iniquity, the prosperity of the Medes and
Persians did daily increase, and their successe in
warre, become every day more assured, than for∣merly
it had beene, and at length (in such a sense as
hath beene observed) altogether <HI>fatall.</HI> The fru∣gality
of their private life, and publique discipline,
specially in warre, were qualifications without

which (perhaps) the Lord would not so highly
have advanced them, or used them as his instru∣ments
in this service. But even these, and all other
morall vertues, unto which the <HI>Politician</HI> ascribes
their good successe, were proper effects of Gods
<HI>consequent will,</HI> now absolutely set to plague the
Chaldeans, and of his <HI>antecedent will</HI> for Israels re∣demption;
sure tokens withall, of his love unto
these Conquerors.</P>
<P>The Historicall syncerity of <HI>Xenophons</HI> intenti∣ons,
or literall truth of his ingenuous relations,
have not beene so much disparaged by any other
pretences what soever, (if by any other at all) as by
the heroicall sweet exemplary disposition of his
admired <HI>Cyrus,</HI> by his dexterity in consultations,
and the extraordinary speedy successe of what hee
put in execution. Whatsoever <HI>Xenophon</HI> hath said
concerning his successe, it doth not so farre exceed
the unsuspected stories of <HI>Alexanders</HI> swift growth
in <HI>fame</HI> and <HI>greatnesse,</HI> as that did the greatest in∣crease

had framed his relations of <HI>Cyrus</HI> his successe,
in linking bordering Nations to the Medes and
Persians, by the modell of some Academicall can∣vas,
or suit for some annuall office amongst fellow

Cedrosians, with many other naturall subjects to
the Babylonian, all unacquainted with the project
at the beginning, come over unto <HI>Cyrus</HI> with as
great facility and speed, as if there had beene no

(in common experience) most desperate war, than
in giving a free voice to one competitor before a∣nother

<P><HI>But</HI> Xenophon <HI>was not so meane a contempla∣tive
Scholar, as to commit so foule a solaecisme as

this had beene; albeit his pupose had beene to poe∣tize
in these narrations. Poeticall fictions must
beare a true resemblance of probability. Truths
themselves must bee set forth in their native co∣lours,

most incredible. Such was the successe of</HI>
Cyrus <HI>in the former businesse; if it were to bee de∣riued

was rather taken when it offered it selfe,
then sought by <HI>Cyrus,</HI> when he first began to cast
his trenches. However, the trenches being made,
were ready, when opportunity served, to rob the
City of the deepe streame, whose naturall course
was through the midst of it; and the streame di∣verted
from its wonted chanell, left an easie en∣trance
for <HI>Cyrus</HI> and his army, under the wals and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loodgate through which it passed. His stratagem
to make this entrance into the City now drowned
with wine, opens to us the literall meaning of di∣vers
aenigmaticall prophecies: <HI>A drought is upon
her waters, and they shall be dryed up: for it is the
Land of graven Images, and they are madde upon
their Idols. Ier. 50. v. 38.</HI> Whatsoever <HI>Cyrus</HI> might
intend, it was Ierusalems and Syons curse upon
Babylon, which gave successe unto his stratagem.
<HI>The violence done to me, and to my flesh, be upon Ba∣bylon,
shall the inhabitants of Zion say; and my blood
upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Ierusalem say.
Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I will plead thy
<PB N="239" REF="252"/>
cause, and take vengeance for thee, and I will dry up
her sea, and make her springs dry. Ier. 51. ver. 35, 36.</HI>
All these plagues here threatned, are exactly fitted
to the patternes of cruelty which <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>
had exhibited in the destruction of the holy City,
and the derision of her and other captivated Prin∣ces.
Ierusalem in the present sense and fresh me∣mory
of her griefe had thus complained: <HI>Nebu∣chadnezzar
the King of Babylon hath devoured me,
he hath crushed me, he hath made mee an empty ves∣sell:</HI>
(therefore must Babylon bee drawne dry of
water) <HI>he hath swallowed mee up like a Dragon; hee
hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me
cut.</HI> Ier. 51. vers. 34. Therefore must <HI>Babylon
become as heapes, a dwelling place for Dragons, an
astonishment, and an hissing without an Inhabitant.</HI>
vers. 37. It is significantly foretold by <HI>Habakkuk</HI>
that <HI>Nebuchadnezzar had consulted shame to his
house.</HI> Habak. 2. And it is the opinion of good in∣terpreters,
that the woe following should be parti∣culatly
directed unto him and to his family: <HI>Woe
unto him that giveth his neighbour drinke; that put∣test
thy bottle to him, and makest him drunke also;
that thou maist looke on their nakednesse. Thou art
filled with shame for glorie; drinke thou also, and let
thy foreskinne bee uncovered: the cup of the Lords
right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shamefull
spewing shall be on thy glorie.</HI> Habak. 2. vers. 15, 16.
Divers Authors of good note have left written,
whether upon any better authoritie then tradition
of the Hebrews, I know not (though that I know in
many cases worthy of respect and credence) that
<PB N="240" REF="253"/>
<HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> did use to make himselfe sport,
by making his captive Princes drunke. This and
the like insolencies the Lord avengeth upon his
sonne and people: <HI>In their heate I will make their
feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may
rejoyce, and sleepe a perpetuall sleepe, and not
awake, saith the Lord.</HI> Ier. 51. vers. 39. and when
the time appointed was come (whether that were
the first or second yeare after the hand writing
upon the wall) the Lord gave <HI>Cyrus</HI> notice of the
Babylonians intended aniversary revellings, whom
hee had now more infatuated, then they at other
times used to infatuate themselves. <HI>Cyrus</HI> his stra∣tagem
to drie up the water, either first conceived
or put in execution upon this notice of their
drunken festivall, and whatsoever purposes of his
that tooke effects, are all directed to the accom∣plishing
of Gods revealed <HI>purpose</HI> or <HI>consequent</HI>
will upon Babylon, as it were so many arrowes
to their marke. The Lord of hoasts was the Ar∣cher,
and <HI>Cyrus</HI> his bow, whose intentions a∣gainst
Babylon must therefore prosper, because,

heart was lifted, and his minde hardened in pride:
he was deposed from his Kingly throne, and they took
his glorie from him. And hee was driven from the
sonnes of men, and his heart was made like the Beasts,
and his dwelling was with the wild Asses: they fed
him with grasse like Oxen, and his body was wet with

drunke wine in them, and thou hast praysed the gods
of silver, and gold, of brasse, yron, wood and stone,
which see not, nor heare, nor know: and the GOD

not cured by him; howbeit <HI>Belshazzar</HI> was more
kinde to <HI>Daniel</HI> then to himselfe, then most great
Princes are to Gods best Prophets that reprove
them: <HI>For he commanded and they cloathed Daniel

For it is not the bestowing of a Scarlet robe, of
Court holy water, or of reall honour in greatest
measure upon Gods servants, that can couer a
scarlet sinne in Princes. The staine of blood can
never be washed off, nor the crie of the oppressed
blowne away (though the whole element of wa∣ter,
winde, &amp; ayre were at their commands) with∣out
the teares and sighs of the <HI>oppressors,</HI> whose
hearts cannot be cleansed without repentant pray∣ers.
Ierusalems sighs and teares in her sorrow
had sunke too deepe into the Almighties eares, to
be expiated without the sacrifice of many sorrow∣full
hearts and contrite spirits throughout Babel:
<HI>Israel is a scattered sheepe, the Lyons have driuen him
away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him,
and last this</HI> Nebuchadnezzar <HI>King of Babylon
hath broken his bones. Therefore thus saith the Lord
of hosts the God of Israel, behold I will punish the King
of Babylon and his Land, as I have punished the king

<P>10 But some happily will here demand, where∣in
the similitude mentioned by <HI>Ieremie,</HI> betweene

did consist? <HI>Senacharib</HI> is the onely

King of Babylon, that did parallell him in his
plagues. <HI>Senacharib</HI> was slaine by his owne sons,
<HI>Belshazzar</HI> by his naturall subjects, sometimes his

<P>One materiall circumstance there is in <HI>Herodo∣tus,</HI>
which is not so much as intimated by <HI>Xeno∣phon;</HI>
and it is this: Albeit the Babylonians could
neither have prevented <HI>Cyrus</HI> in diverting the
course of the River, nor withstood his entrance by
its chanell; yet might they with ease have stopped
his passage along the chanell, or his entrance into
any street of the Citie, had they beene mindfull to
shut those gates, which at the end of everie street
did open upon the river. But that night being con∣secrated
to revelling, the passage by water from
one part of the City to another was freely permit∣ted.
They had a solemne custome of leaving those
gates open that night, which on other nights were
to be shut. And by this meanes, destruction found
a more easie entrance into that great City.</P>
<P>12 Some modern Politicians have discoursed in
folio, against the vastnesse of Cities as most incom∣modious
for defence, taking occasion from <HI>Ari∣stotles</HI>
exceptions against Babylon, which in his
censure was a Region; no more a Citie then Pelo∣ponesus
should be, if it were walled about. But it
was not Babylons vastnesse which bred this insen∣sibility
when the day of destruction was come, that
some members of her should not so much as feele
any paine when others were utterly cut off. Should
<PB N="250" REF="258"/>
any Prince now living, in confidence of this ex∣periment,
attempt the like upon <HI>Quinzie, Moscho,</HI>
or if any other greater Cities there be in the world,
he might finde their Citizens better prepared up∣pon
few houres warning then Babylon was in
three dayes, unlesse perhaps he made his assault up∣on
<HI>Moscho</HI> upon some great Festivall, wherein her
citizens enjoy the liberty of Lacedemonian slaves,
to be beastly drunke without censure. Cities farre
lesse then Babylon, onely her matches in impiety,
have beene surprised with Babylonish stupidity,
when the ful measure of their iniquity had brought
forth the day of visitation. Carthage was
farre greater and fuller stuft with all sorts of people
when <HI>Scipio</HI> razed it, then when the Vandals tooke
it. And yet no member of it, in the former cala∣mity,
was so senselesse of their fellow-members,
or of their common mothers griefe, as the whole
body was, when most of its naturall members were
cut off by the Vandall.</P>
<P>[Fragor ut ita dixerim, extra muros &amp; intra mu∣ros
praeliorum &amp; ludicrorum confundebatur; vox mo∣rientium

fierent, quid aliud talis populus agebat, nisi ut, cum
eum Deus perdere adhuc fortasse nollet, tamen ipse ex∣igeret
ut periret. <HI>Salvianus Lib. 6.]</HI> The noise of bat∣taile
without the wals, and the noise of sporting with∣in
the walls; the voice of dying men, and the voice of
riotous or drunken men, were so mingled and confoun∣ded,
that a man could hardly have distinguished the
<PB N="251" REF="258"/>
outcries of such as fell in battaile from the noise or cry
of the multitude in the game-court. And by such do∣ings,
what did this people else, but solicite their owne
destruction at Gods hands, who otherwise would not
(haply) have destroyed them; or not at this time.
<HI>With the like stupidity was Treers taken, none of
the greatest Cities then in Europe, though one of
wealthiest amongst the Gaules, after she had beene
thrice lanced. The very Babylonish madnesse did
possesse another Citie not farre from Treers: such
a lethargie had over-spred the whole Corporati∣on,</HI>
Vt Principes illius urbis, ne tunc quidem de con∣vivijs

off their feasting and banqueting, when the enemie
did enter the City. God (as I conjecture) did purpose∣ly
manifest the reason why they perished, in that they
were doing that very thing when they perished, which
had brought them to utter destruction.</P>
<P>13 But of the causes, symptomes, or signes of
divine <HI>infatuation,</HI> elsewhere. Thus much I thought
expedient in this place for the young Readers in∣formation;
that albeit Babylon had beene much
greater in compasse, then she was, so that the mea∣sure
of her iniquity had beene lesse; the date of her
prosperity might have beene much longer. Chal∣dea
might have sate as Queene of Nations, in de∣spight
of all politicke prognostications, which
have beene framed since her overthrow. The best
<PB N="252" REF="259"/>

to States or Kingdomes, is to fixe their
bol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s upon the gates of great Cities, after they
have beene ransacked by the enemy. But Baby∣lons
iniquity being grown unto that setled height,
at which it stood in <HI>Ieremies</HI> and <HI>Daniels</HI> times;
although her strength, her wealth, provision, and
policie, had beene farre greater then they were,
and contracted into a narrower roome, than the
compasse of her walls; the date of her soueraignty
would have beene as short; the device of the Lord
would have beene performed against her by other
meanes, as sure, and speedy, as <HI>Cyrus</HI> used, if his
stratagem had beene defeated. For<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Sec∣tion 1. cha. 9 parag. 3. &amp; chap 10. parag. 2.</NOTE> strength of

<P>15 To conclude, The reason of Babels stupi∣ditie,
and whatsoever oversights the Politician can
discover in her (related by <HI>Xenophon</HI> or <HI>Herodotus)</HI>
was, that the fulfilling of <HI>Ieremies</HI> Prophesies a¦gainst
her, might become more manifest to succee∣ding
ages: <HI>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut
asunder and broken? how is Babylon become a desola∣tion
among the nations? I have layd a snare for thee,
and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not
aware: thou are founde and also caught, because
<PB N="256" REF="261"/>
thou hast striven against the Lord. The Lord hath o∣pened
his armorie, &amp; hath brought forth the weapons
of his indignation; for this is the worke of the Lord
God of hoasts, in the land of the Caldeans. Come a∣gainst
her from the utmost border, open her storehou∣ses,
cast her up as heapes, and destroy her utterly, let
nothing of her bee left.</HI> Ier. 50. vers. 23, 24, 25, 26.
For she had carried away all that was in <HI>Ezekias</HI>
house, all that his father had laid up in store, no∣thing
was left, as <HI>Esaiah</HI> had foretold. c. 59. v. 36.
the exact fulfilling of whose Prophecie is registred
by the sacred Historian. 2 Chron. 6. verse 18. The
sudden surprizall of the Citie and Court of Baby∣lon
made the <HI>finding of the treasure of Darkenesse
and the riches of secret places,</HI> which the Lord by
his Prophet had promised to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> more easie,
then if his entrance at that time had beene suspe∣cted
or feared: for so the besieged might have had
leisure to have hid their treasure where the enemy
should hardly have found it.</P>
<P>16 But what speciall comfort is this to Sion,
that <HI>Cyrus</HI> had done to Babylon, as Babylon had
done to her. This might satiate or somewhat al∣lay
the <HI>boyling heat</HI> of a revengefull minde. But
is the miserie of an enemy of like use unto Gods
people, as was the Brazen serpent? Can the sight
of it cure their griefe, or beget true happinesse
in such as looke on it? It is very probable that
Babylons spoiles did helpe to reedifie Ierusalem.
And albeit, the God of <HI>Sion,</HI> had other meanes in
store (more by many, then man can number or
conceive) for reducing his people into their owne
<PB N="257" REF="261"/>
Land; we may, notwithstanding, without censure
of curiositie, safely conjecture, that the disgraces
w<SUP>ch</SUP> <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> &amp; his successors has done

of their speciall favour and grace with <HI>Cyrus.</HI> Of

shewing his treasures unto the Babylonians, it was
one part that of his sonnes some should bee Eu∣nuches

make the Persians Eunuches, or trust the Caldeans
about his bodie. <HI>Daniel</HI> and other his fellowes of
the royall seed of Iudah, being made such unto his

<HI>Machiavel</HI> is of a contrary minde, perswa∣ded
thereto, by such a reason, as argues he had not
God or his providence in his thoughts; that his
thoughts were not his owne, when he conceived
it: so dissonant it is to truth and his owne politick
principles. His words are these; <HI>If no other State
did ever compasse such a mighty Empire as Rome did,
why should this be attributed to Fortune, rather then
to good lawes and discipline?</HI></P>
<P>2 With <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Machiavel</HI> it fares just so
in this controversie, as it usually doth with other
controversors; each of them hath the truth under
his levell, whiles he oppugnes the adverse opinion;
both of them overshoot it whilst they deliver their
owne. <HI>Plutarch</HI> rightly denies the morall or civill
goodnesse, whether of Romane lawes or lives, to
have brought forth their greatnesse. Hee erreth
as much in adjudging all that to <HI>Roman fortune,</HI>
whereto <HI>Roman vertue</HI> had no just title. Notwith∣standing
if by <HI>Fortune</HI> hee meant any certaine la∣tent
cause more then humane, which did convay
success to the <HI>current</HI> of Roman policies, by secret
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
and hidden passages; his meaning is better then his
manner of expressing it. To thinke thus charita∣bly
of this ingenuous Philosopher, wee have rea∣son,
as knowing him to be a perfect enemy, aswell
to Epicurean chance, as to Stoycall Fate: and
therefore no adversary of Divine Providence. In
favour of <HI>Machiavels</HI> opinion, who deserves no
favour himselfe, thus much on the other side
might be said; <HI>If the</HI> auncient Romans had beene
as vaine as the Graecians, as luxurious as the Asi∣aticks,
as perfidious as the Carthagineans, as un∣civill
and barbarours as many nations, which they
conquered: they should not have beene so con∣stantly
fortunate in their enterprises at home, and
abroad, as <HI>Livie</HI> and <HI>Plutarch</HI> had observed them
to bee. That is, in our language, <HI>Divine Provi∣dence</HI>
would not have <HI>destined</HI> them unto that
greatnesse, unto which at length they grew, if
they had beene alwayes, or for the most part, as
bad, as in the period of their prosperitie, they pro∣ved.
For albeit God be debtor unto none; yet
the abandant riches of his bountie, will no suffer
him to leave morall vertues or constant execution
of Lawes <HI>comparativly</HI> good, vnrewarded with
blessings temporall. All this, notwithstanding
will not inferre, what <HI>Machiavell</HI> undertooke to
prove that the Romans did raise themselves, more
by vertue, then they were raised by Fortune; if wee
take Fortune (as in all probabilitie <HI>Plutarch</HI> did)
for an hidden fountaine, secretly feeding those
courses which the Romans tooke for their good,
with successe and speed farre above their expecta∣tion.
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
Vnder this indefinite latitude of unknowne
causes, the Divine Providence or <HI>coelestic fortuna</HI>
(as the Pythagorians terme it) may bee compre∣hended,
and this divine providence or celestiall
<HI>Fortune</HI> it was, which raised the Romans: they
did not raise themselves by their vertues. For wee
do not use to say that Princes favorites do advance
themselves, albeit Princes would not advāce them
to such great dignities as they enjoy, unless they
were in some measure qualified unto their liking.</P>
<P>3 Some nations have beene, others might have
beene more observant of better Lawes then the
Romans knew, and have used the same discipline
of peace and warre, even all their policies, with
greater sinceritie of good intentions then they
did; &amp; yet not have propagated their soveraignty
ouer others, halfe so farre, as the Romane Empire
was (by Gods speciall Providence) propagated.

are no such meritorious causes of tempo∣rall
prosperitie or Dominion, as may binde God
in justice, to dispense the one in greatest plentie,
where the other most aboundeth. Without these
qualifications the Romans had not beene capable
of such prosperitie, as God in bountie bestowed
upon them; but the true positive cause of their
extraordinary greatnesse, was the speciall service,
whereto his wisedome had appointed them. The

the correspondency or proportion, which tem∣porall

receiving the seed of his Gospell.</P>
<P>4 When the measure of that <HI>prosperitie,</HI> which
GOD for these and like purposes had allotted

probability either of <HI>Xenophons</HI> stories concerning
<HI>Cyrus,</HI> or of <HI>Curtius, Arianus,</HI> or other writers of

these barbarous Nations in these westerne coun∣tries?

<P>6 The report which these roving Hunters had
made to their Countrimen of that pleasant Land,
into whose confines the chased <HI>Hart</HI> had led them,
did invite the chiefe <HI>heads</HI> of their <HI>Clans,</HI> with their
severall <HI>rascalities,</HI> to flock into Europe like beg∣gers
dismist out of a prison, invited to a solemne
banquet. And their hunger-starved appetites, be∣ing

whet their wits and arme their spirits, to attempt
greater matters then they could conceive before.

of that Country, which from them was

army, whose Leaders presumed, they were
more safely guarded against the sudden assault of
their barbarous enemies for one night, by the Ri∣ver
of <HI>Danow</HI> which ranne betweene them; then
they could be by any wall or trench. And in this
presumption they rested as secure for that night,
of the Hunnes, as the Babylonians were of <HI>Cyrus.</HI>
It is very likely, that <HI>Detricus</HI> Generall for the Ro∣mance,
and <HI>Matrinus, alias Martinus,</HI> (or <HI>Ma∣crinus)</HI>

or both had read how <HI>Cyrus</HI> had divided the River

But that the like should be attempted upon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See chap∣ter 26. pa∣rag. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Da∣now</HI>

they knew it impossible. And what other

being utterly destitute of Ship or Boat, they could
not suspect. But they bought the knowledge of
their new invention a great deale too deare; with
the losse of the better part of their armie, which

now past, might in some moderne politicians
judgement easily have beene prevented, did so les∣sen
the Roman forces, that albeit they became
cōquerors in the next conflict, yet purchased they
victorie with the losse of so many souldiers, that
they were not able to stand before the multitude
of their furious enemies in the third encounter:
And to try them the fourth time, they had no cou∣rage.
The <HI>stumpe</HI> of that arrow, which <HI>Detricus</HI>
carried in his forehead to Rome, in witnesse that
he had confronted his enemies, and was not
wounded in the backe, did pierce the hearts of
some and daunt the spirits of other Romans. And
the fresh bleeding experiments of these Hunnes
incredible fury, might well occasion, that genera∣tion
and their children, to flatter their cowardly
fancies, with forged tales, as if it were no dispa∣ragement
to the Romans (though as yet in highest

Romane Empire was decreed by Fate; and with refe∣rence
to this end, as Rome could not in her growing
age be overthrowne, so it was expedient that she should
often be oppressed and afflicted, that her Statesmen
might become more wary and wise, for procuring that
greatnesse which Fates had decreed to accomplish by
them. <HI>Wherefore, that all these might take place:</HI>
the Fates <HI>(which as he grants, use meanes conveni∣ent
for effecting their purpose)</HI> had put Camillus to
exile, not to death; suffered the City to bee taken by
the Gaules, but not the Capitoll: and that the Citie
might be taken with lesse adoe, they had likewise or∣dained
that the greatest part of the Romane army, be∣ing
discomfited by the Gaules, should not retire to
Rome, but flye to Veios. To knit up all <HI>(as he speakes)</HI>
<PB N="271" REF="268"/>
in a bundell, it was the ordinance of Fates, that the
Romanes should for this turne use neither their won∣ted
wit, nor discretion, for averting the evills which
befell them, and yet have all things made ready to
their hands, for defending the Capitoll and recove∣ring
of the City. By the forecast of Fates, not of the
Romanes, it was, that exiled Camillus, who was no way
guilty of the wrongs which the Senate had done unto
the Gaules, no way obnoxious unto them, but free
from all obligements, should bee at Ardea with one
army, and expected at Veios by another, that they
might with joynt forces assault the Gaules, when they
least expected, and so recover the City.</P>
<P>8 Had <HI>Machiavel</HI> told us what hee meant by
<HI>Fates</HI> or <HI>Fortune,</HI> wee might either quickly agree
with him, or easily confute him, as disagreeing
most from himselfe: whatsoever hee meant by

have craved pardon of <HI>Plutarch</HI> for contradicting

Heathen writer, it would no way misbeseeme him
sometime so to speak, as men might suspect him to
be a Christian. But not to question in what sig∣nification
he used the words <HI>Fates</HI> or <HI>Fortune;</HI> the
reall <HI>attributes</HI> which he gives to <HI>Fate</HI> or <HI>Fortune,</HI>
cannot belong to any power in heaven or earth,

That power onely can doe all these, which know∣eth

<HI>men cannot avoid the necessitie of fate, but rather fa∣cilitate

to undoe the contrivances or contextures of destinie,
that by how much the more they struggle with them,
they weave and knit them faster.</HI> But shall state-pi∣lots

<PB N="274" REF="270"/>
wayes of <HI>Fates</HI> to be so obscure, that they cannot
be knowne, if neither <HI>knowne</HI> nor <HI>unknowne,</HI> they
can bee avoided▪ It would inspire our indea∣vours
with greater alacrity, and our indeavours
would be <HI>blessed</HI> with better successe, were wee
taught (as the truth is) that such events as Politici∣ans
terme <HI>fatall,</HI> are in their nature, alterable,
though not by us, or by any humane skill or poli∣cie,
yet by him whose almighty ayd, is alwayes
ready for us, so we seeke it with due humilitie. But
<HI>Machiavel</HI> (if I mistake him not) was once of opi∣nion,
that <HI>Fates</HI> and <HI>Fortune</HI> interpose their autho∣rity
only in some more principall humane affaires;
he acknowledgeth no generall providence over
all. The generall Maxime whence hee falsely de∣rives
his fruitlesse inference, is, <HI>That Gods Decree</HI>
(whereof Fates good or bad, are necessary bran∣ches)
<HI>is altogether immutable.</HI> The most necessary,
immediate, and most usefull consequent of which
<HI>truth,</HI> is this, As long as the parties against whom
he decrees evill, continue the same; the evill de∣creed,
is as immutable as his decree, and men by
seeking to avoid it by their wit or strength, doe
draw it more speedily, or more heavily upon them.
For, it is impossible, that humane power should
not bee foiled, whilest it opposeth it selfe against
<HI>Omnipotency;</HI> or the devices of humane <HI>wisedome</HI>
not be defeated, whilest they counterplot <HI>Wisdome
infinite.</HI> But though in the Almighty, or in his
decree, there be no shadow of change; yet as <HI>Da∣niel</HI>
speakes, <HI>he changeth times and seasons;</HI> and in
that his <HI>mercy</HI> is <HI>immutable,</HI> he is alwayes ready to
<PB N="275" REF="270"/>
repent him of the <HI>evills</HI> forethreatned, when men

<P>10 The very instance whence <HI>Machiavel</HI> fra∣med
his forementioned Aphorisme, will bee a fit
example for illustrating our present rule. The
Romanes (as he observes) were usually most reli∣gious
observers of the Law of nations, and whilest
they continued thus, Gods blessings did rest upon
their policies: But at the time when the Gaules
inuaded Italy; the <HI>Fahii,</HI> being sent Embassadours
in a Treaty of peace, unaduisedly put on the girdle
of warre, and slew a standard-bearer of the Gaules
in defence &amp; quarrell of the <HI>Clusini,</HI> betwixt whō
they should have been indiferent arbitrators. And
in stead of just punishment (which by the Law
of nations was, to have beene delivered up unto the
Enemies whom they had wronged,) the Romans
did grace them with the office of Tribunes, at
their returne, and appointed them chiefe managers
of that warre with the Gaules, which<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Imprimis igitur ha∣benda ratio est earum rerum, quae fato ipso, seu astro∣rum in∣fluxu, eve∣nire viden∣tur, &amp; qui∣bus ut resi∣stamus, for∣tuna non permittit.

may cause the selfe same medicine, which at some
times brought health, at another time to bring
forth Death or dangerous sicknesse to one and the

originalls: <HI>As there be divers kindes of proceedings
in managing the affaires of peace or warre, with whose
diversities the dispositions of men, by nature or cu∣stome
much different, suit, some with one, some with
another: so have different times their seasons and op∣portunities.
Some times require quick dispatch, others
delay of businesse; some businesses speedy execution,
others maturity of consultation and long forecast.</HI>
Now seeing no one man is fitted for all kindes of
proceedings, nor no one kinde of proceeding can
befit all or most times, but all have their limits,
which without errour or danger they cannot trans∣gresse.
Hence it is that those men least erre, and
become most fortunate in their atchievements,
which have the <HI>hap</HI> to be imployed in such times
and seasons, as best agree with their naturall and
<HI>accustomed manner of projecting. Statefortune</HI>
then by <HI>Machiavels</HI> conclusion, is no <HI>bastard</HI>

ofspring of <HI>Time,</HI> fitly matched with the
peculiar disposition of experienced <HI>practickes.</HI> On
the contrary, publique <HI>misfortune</HI> or ill successe, is
the naturall issue of mens endeavours, when <HI>they</HI>
are undertaken in an unfit time. The onely questi∣on
then remaining, is, whether there bee <HI>any,</HI> or if
any, <HI>who</HI> is the chiefe author of all <HI>fit matches</HI> or
disagreements betweene the severall dispositions
of men, and the opportunities of times? It is a
point unquestionable, that the prime <HI>author</HI> of such
matches, is the first <HI>author</HI> of all successe, be it good
or bad, in humane affaires. The greatest amongst
<PB N="279" REF="272"/>

they please, but must bee content
with such as time affords them: nor are the wisest
of men alwaies able to make choyse of the best
which time <HI>presents.</HI> Time likewise, though thus
affording opportunities, cannot appoint the men,
that are most fit to entertain them. So that neither
is time the <HI>fountaine</HI> or <HI>author,</HI> nor can men bee
their owne Carvers of good successe. Doth this
office then belong to <HI>Goddesse Fortune?</HI> If shee
could see this, she might see all things; and were
no longer to bee reputed Fortune: <HI>wisdome</HI> and
<HI>prouidence</HI> should be her titles. It is <HI>That wisdome</HI>
by which all things were made, which disposeth
their operations. It is that <HI>Providence,</HI> which was
before all times, that dispenseth the <HI>times</HI> and <HI>op∣portunities,</HI>
that are. These sit supreame <HI>scrutators</HI>

<P>13 That we may descend to <HI>Machiavels</HI> in∣stance;
The Romanes appointed no generall with∣out
publick consultation. Whether <HI>Fabius Maxi∣mus</HI>
were chosen generall by unanimous consent
of the Senate, or with difficultie and contradicti∣on,
we have not observed, or doe not remember.

did sute with the opportunitie of those times,
wherein he was appointed to <HI>cope</HI> with <HI>Hannibal.</HI>
<PB N="280" REF="273"/>
The common rumors, which run of him through∣out
Rome, argue a generall dislike of his procee∣dings;
if lingring, might in their censures be called
proceedings rather then cowardly delay or <HI>detre∣ctation.</HI>
The best proofe he gave for a long time of
his courage, was his constant contempt of others
censures.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Non ponebat enim rumores ante salutem.</NOTE> But after, the event did as farre sur∣passe
their hopes of his slow proceedings, as

he could not have changed with the times, nor fa∣shioned
himselfe to new occasions. Hee had held
the same <HI>byas</HI> still, though on another much diffe∣rent
ground: and so might he well have lost his
late purchased fame, and Rome her prize; unlesse
there had beene more skill used in playing the
game, than the supposed Roman Gamesters pra∣ctised.
As suppose <HI>Fabius</HI> had beene sent to have
bid <HI>Hannibal</HI> play in Africk, and <HI>Scipio</HI> appointed
to keepe the goale in Italie: Rome and Carthage,
by the misplacing of these two men, might have
changed <HI>Fates</HI> and <HI>Fortunes.</HI> Rome, in all likeli∣hood,
had beene taken, when <HI>Fabius</HI> saved it; and
Carthage inriched with Romane spoiles, at the
time when <HI>Scipio</HI> ransacked it. Rome could not
have found a surer buckler to beare off <HI>Hannibals</HI>
blowes in Italy, then <HI>lingring Fabius:</HI> nor a fitter
sword to beat him in his native soile, then <HI>forward
Scipio.</HI> And yet was <HI>Fabius</HI> the most forward man
to oppose <HI>Scipio</HI> his expedition into Africk: and
it may be some of <HI>Scipio</HI> his friends had <HI>bandied</HI> as
earnestly against <HI>Fabius.</HI> Either of them liked his
owne course best: if haply either liked any other
besides. Neither of them knew, what temper was
fittest for every <HI>season;</HI> nor is it possible for the
wisedome of man to match these alwayes aright,
because albeit the temper or dispositions of men
did never alter, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the occasions or opportunities
of <HI>times</HI> are more changeable than the Moone.</P>
<P>14 The Aphorisme which <HI>Machiavel</HI> gathers
from the former discussions is not so false, as im∣perfit,
<PB N="282" REF="274"/>
and it is this: Seeing different <HI>times</HI> require
different manners of <HI>proceedings,</HI> and <HI>state-agents</HI>
cannot easily change their manner, whereto they
have beene most accustomed; it were most expe∣dient
for States to change their agents, that their
severall dispositions might more exactly <HI>sute</HI>
with the alterations of times and opportunities.
The facilitie of observing or practising this rule
in <HI>Aristocratis,</HI> is in his judgement, one speciall
cause why, that kinde of government is more du∣rable
then Monarchicall. For Princes will hold
their wonted wayes, they will not change their
resolutions, much lesse will they give place to o∣thers,
that are better fitted for entertaining the
opportunities or change of times.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Petrus So∣derinus, cu∣jus alias eti∣am mentio∣nē fecimus, naturâ hu∣manus erat, et patientiâ suâ multas injurias fe∣rebat, quae res salutaris fuit Reip. si∣mul at{que} ipsi quandiu tē∣pora clemē∣tiora fuere.

his wonted <HI>lenitie</HI> and <HI>patience,</HI> in times requiring
<HI>austere</HI> imperious reformation. Whereas Pope <HI>Iu∣lius</HI>
the second, plaied the Lyon all his time with
the Foxes luck: the more he was cursed for his im∣petuous
insolency, the stronger hee grew: no

had they changed, he must have fallen. But was
not <HI>Septimius Afer,</HI> for his native severitie, aswell
fitted to the impetuous disposition of the Roman
Empire when he undertook it, as any medicine can
be to the malady, for which it is by art prepared?
And yet his practise (though exactly answering
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>Machiavels</HI> rules of reformation (here and else∣where
<PB N="283" REF="274"/>

successe; hee cured some present <HI>mischiefes,</HI> but
procured more grievous, secret, and more perma∣nent
inconveniences. The barbarous nations
which longed most for Romes destruction, lear∣ned
the use and art of making the Romans wea∣pons

came to miserable ruine: not all the over∣sights
committed by any one, though the very
worst of al her Governours or Counsellors; not all

sow the seedes of so much evill and mishap, as be∣fel
her from one example of severitie, unseasonably
practised by the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Bonfin. lib. 2 dec. 1.</NOTE> King of Goathes, upon a wicked

by whose wisedome and authoritie the Goathes
had beene able so well to have matched the Huns,
as the Romanes might have stood as arbitrators
to moderate the quarrell as they saw fit, or to have
devided the prey. But the Goathes, being sud∣denly

to the Hunnes, and (upon protestations of

to be admitted as naturall subjects within the Em∣pire,
which by this meanes became exposed to a
double mischiefe. It hath the Hunnes as neare,
but more insolent and noisome neighbours, then
the Goathes had beene: and through the folly and
greedinesse of the Imperiall <HI>officers,</HI> the Goath
in short time of a former open enemy, became a
treacherous friend. The Romans <HI>nurst</HI> this young
<HI>snake</HI> in their bosome, after such an unpleasant and
untowardly fashion, as they might bee sure, hee
would be ready to use his <HI>sting,</HI> when God should
send him one. And albeit the Goath and Hun, did
naturally worse agree, then the Toade &amp; Spider:
yet in relation to the <HI>execution</HI> of Gods justice up∣on

that wheresoever the one had broken
<HI>skinne,</HI> the other was ready to infuse his poyson;
the one alwaies ready to inlarge the <HI>wounds,</HI> which
the other had made, before they closed. Howbeit,
when both these enemies had done the worst to
Rome that they intended, (for both of them had
power in respect of any help that man could make,
to do her as much harm, as they listed) yet the Pro∣phets
speech concerning Israel, was remarkably
true of her, <HI>Perditio tua ex te O Roma,</HI> Romes de∣struction
was from her selfe. Her very enemies
would have healed her, but Babylon-like shee
would not be healed. <HI>Alaricus</HI> the Goath had
taken the Citie, but made conscience of defacing

it: he spared the suppliants for the Temples sake.
<HI>Attilas</HI> was kindly intreated by Pope <HI>Leo</HI> not to
visit it; the rather thereto perswaded, because
God had visited <HI>Alaricus</HI> for polluting it. It was
the crie of the noble <HI>Aetius</HI> his blood treacherous∣ly

<HEAD>CHAP. 28.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Why God is called the Lord of Hosts, or the Lord
mighty in Battaile. Of his speciall providence in
managing Warres.</HEAD>
<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>LBEIT the sole authority of
Scripture without the assigne∣ment
of any reason, be a warrant
alsufficient for us to enstyle our
God the Lord of <HI>Hosts:</HI> yet
why he is so often in Scripture
thus enstyled, as by a most speciall and peculiar at∣tribute,
these reasons may without offence bee gi∣ven.
<HI>His peculiar hand</HI> is not in any subject of hu∣mane
contemplation more conspicuous, then in
the managing of Warres. Why it should bee
more conspicuous in this then in other busi∣nesses,
wherein men are much imployed,
the reason is plaine: for <HI>Contingences</HI> are no
where more ticklish than in Warre, not is their
number in any other subject so incomprehensible
to the wit of man. It is hard to use wit and valour
both at once; hard to spie an errour upon the first
<PB N="289" REF="277"/>
commission of it, harder to redeeme the time, or
regaine opportunities lost. It is a grosse errour
which hath insinuated it selfe into some Politicians
thoughts, if wee may judge of their thoughts by
their writings; that the chances which may fall
out contrary to Warriours expectations, are not
so many but that they may be forecast or numbred.
It is the Politicians errour likewise, (though would
to God it were his alone) to think all occurrences
which are casuall in respect of man, to be from the
first occasions of warre begun, so determined by
him, which gives successe in battaile, as that victo∣ry
must in deed and truth (though to men she seeme
not so) incline to one party more than to the other.
These casualties of War, or doubtfull inclinations
of victorie, are in succession infinite. Their possibi∣lities
one way or other, may every moment in∣crease
from misdemeanours either of them which
fight the battailes, or of the parties for whom they
fight. The fairest probabilitie of good successe
may be <HI>abated</HI> from every good act or reformati∣on
of the adversarie. Gods eternall freedome ei∣ther
in determining new occurrences, or altering
the combinations of others already extant, cannot
be prejudiced by any Act past. He hath not so be∣fore
all time decreed them, that hee doth not still
decree them, at his pleasure, as well during all the
time of warre and fight, as before. <HI>Ita accidit</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lazius.</NOTE> <HI>sae∣penumero,
ut fortuna ad utrum{que} victoriam transfe∣rat,
quò Bellum extrahatur, animos{que} nunc horum,
nunc illorum accendat. So it oftentimes falls out, that
Fortune makes faire profer of victory to both sides,
<PB N="290" REF="278"/>
and one while incourageth this partie, another while
that, by which meanes warres are usually prolonged.</HI>
Now whatsoever in these cases befals men either
beyond their expectation, or contrary to their fore∣cast,
is counted <HI>fortunate,</HI> if it be for their good; or
<HI>fatall,</HI> if it be for their harme. Hence men not on∣ly
of most accurate booke-learning amongst the
Romanes, but of best experience in matters of war,
have given more to <HI>Fortune,</HI> then by-standers or
Historicall Relators usually acknowledge to bee
her due.</P>
<P>Had <HI>Caesar</HI> upon a diligent and accurate survey
of the <HI>meanes,</HI> by which he got his victories, allot∣ted
<HI>Fortune</HI> her just part in <HI>severall,</HI> or told us truly
how much fell out beyond or above his expectati∣on,
how much just according to his reckoning:
the world (I think) would have beene of the same
minde with <HI>Machiavel</HI> in his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Cha. 27. §. 7.</NOTE> forementioned
contemplations of Romes surprisal by the Gaules,
which was, <HI>That the most victorious</HI> do not deserve
much glory either for wit or valour, nor the con∣quered much dispraise for the contrarie imperfec∣tions;
seeing <HI>Fate</HI> or <HI>Fortune</HI> have alwayes the
chiefest stroke as well in the exaltation of the one,
as in the dejection of the other. Notwithstanding
it is no part of mine, whatsoever it was of <HI>Machia∣vels</HI>
meaning, to have any man deprived of that
commendation which is due to him in respect of
other men. And it is not the least <HI>title</HI> unto true
praise, to be in <HI>favour</HI> with the supreame <HI>disposer</HI> of
Martiall successe. In respect of him the <HI>victorious</HI>
have no cause to boast, but rather to condemne
<PB N="291" REF="278"/>
their sloath and negligence in that the fruites of
their successe, was no better then usually it proves,
they having so good assistance, and sure pledges of
divine favour.</P>
<P>2 Wheresoever <HI>Cicero, Caesar, Vegetius,</HI> or o∣ther
heathens, could suspect or descrie the secret
assistance of fate or fortune, specially in matters
more remarkeable, as are the usuall consequents of
warre; there we may without solecisme say, the
finger of the Lord of hoasts did worke. For if
the least wound that is given or taken in fight, doe
not make it selfe, but is made by the vigilant and
working hand of man; shall not the chiefe stroke or
sway of battaile, which usually falls without War∣riers
comprehension, lead us to a direct, a certaine
and positive cause? Now if this cause were other∣waies
unknown, by what name could we more pro∣perly
call it, then by the Lord of <HI>hoasts,</HI> or great
Moderator of warre.</P>
<P>If wee may guesse at Gods working in all, by
the manifestation of his speciall hand in some: I
am perswaded there was never any great battaile
fought since the world began, much lesse any fa∣mous
warre accomplished with such facilitie or
speed, but that if it had pleased the Historians to
expresse all circumstances of speciall moments, or
could the reader survey such as they expresse, with
as diligent and curious eyes, as one Artificer will
anothers worke: the consultations of their chiefe
<HI>managers,</HI> &amp; the executions w<SUP>ch</SUP> seem to have most
dependance on them; would beare no better pro∣portion
w<SUP>th</SUP> their entire successe, then the day labo∣rers
<PB N="292" REF="279"/>
work doth with a curious edifice, or then the
Pioners paines doth w<SUP>th</SUP> the <HI>defence</HI> or <HI>expugnation</HI>
of strōg forts or Castles. And yet even in the matu∣rest
deliberations or most exact consultations of
warre; related by ordinary historians, the finall de∣termination,
may for the most part be resolved in∣to
some speciall Divine instinct: the execution of
that which men by such instinct determine and re∣solve
upon, essentially depends upon the dispositi∣on
of Gods peculiar providence, who hath an au∣thentique
negative in the use of every meanes,
which men make choice of; albeit in using them
he admit men, as his coworkers, but not as sha∣rers
in production of the principall effect or end.
He alone bestoweth victorie where hee pleaseth,
by what meanes or whose <HI>agency</HI> hee pleaseth, but
not alwayes with victorie and successe, unlesse
such as be his agents or instruments in the execu∣tion
of his consequent will upon others, be ready
to doe his antecedent will or pleasure themselves.</P>
<P>3 This is a subject whose fuller explication
would require a larger volume, then this whole
Treatise in my intendment shall be. I will there∣fore
instance especially in one battaile, and another
warre, of the greatest consequences, that the histo∣ries
of these three hundred yeares past present un∣to
us. The first shall be in that fierce and violent
conflict at Grūwald betweene <HI>Iagello</HI> or <HI>Vladislaus</HI>
King of Poland and Lituania, and the <HI>Crucigeri</HI>
or Knights of Prussia, about the yeare one thou∣sand
foure hundred. Should a Politician or
Souldier, that will beleeve no more, then hee sees
<PB N="293" REF="279"/>
grounds for out of his owne Art, have seene, the
mighty preparation and couragious resolution of
both parties, hee would haply have demanded a
signe of Gods providence, and said in his heart, Let
us see either of these two Armies take flight upon
a conceipted noise of Chariots or Horsemen, or
an imagination of an Army not really existent:
or what <HI>Gedeon</HI> is hee now alive, that dare ad∣venture
on the weaker of them, with three hun∣dred
men, although hee had thrice three hun∣dred
Trumpeters to encourage them. We will
not therefore presse any with beleefe of Mi∣racles
in these later times, but rather perswade
them with us to acknowledge, that those extraor∣dinary
<HI>manifestations</HI> of power more then naturall,
in battailes fought for Israell and Iudah by <HI>Gedeon</HI>
or <HI>Sampson,</HI> by the Angels, by the Hoast of Hea∣ven,
or by inferiour Elements, were not more pre∣gnant
documents of Gods immediate hand in ma∣naging
warres, nor better proofes of his just <HI>title</HI>
to be the Lord of Hosts; than the contrivances of
ordinary causes and occurrences in martiall affaires
of moderne times, doth or might afford to all such
as rightly survey them. To make a mighty armie
fall by the free and unimpeached exercise of their
owne valour and strength, can be no lesse wonder∣full
to unpartiall eyes, than to scatter them by fire
and lightning, than to beat them downe by mighty
hailestones from heaven. To cause the stronger
and more skilfull in warre to faint, without dimi∣nishing
of their courage and strength, is no lesse
the Lords doing, than if their hearts had beene
<PB N="294" REF="280"/>
surprised with a <HI>panick</HI> terrour, or their armes sud∣denly
deprived of life and motion, as <HI>Ieroboams</HI>
was. Yet this was the case of the Prussian Knights
of the Crosse, and the Germane Forces which as∣sisted
them against <HI>Iagello.</HI></P>
<P>4 The conduct of the right wing of <HI>Iagelloes</HI>
Army, which did consist of Lituanians, was com∣mended
to his brother <HI>Vitoudus,</HI> not out of any
foresight of advantage, but in honour of his per∣son,
or of that Nation; which was perhaps an o∣versight
in point of warre. However, this wing
was fiercely assaulted by the opposite wing of the
Germane Armie, which was a great deale the
stronger, especially for horsemen. God by his se∣cret
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide Var∣sevicii pa∣ral. in vita Iagell.</NOTE>providence did so dispose that this advantage
should redound unto their greater overthrow. For
the Lituanians being the farre weaker part of <HI>Ia∣gello</HI>
his Army, both for want of skill and of Ar∣mour,
after a furious encounter fled the faster: and
the Germane wing, which had put them to flight,
not suspecting but that their other wing had beene
as able to match the Polonian, as they had beene
to defeat the Lituanian; pursued the victorie so
long and so farre, that they were neither able ful∣ly
to succour the other wing being scattered and
broken by the Polonians, before their returne, nor
to flye from their enemies with that speed they de∣sired;
as being over wearied with the former
chase. Of the Germans, by this oversight and pre∣sumption,
fiftie thousand were slaine, and (as some
relate) almost as many taken prisoners. They had
put their confidence in the valour, skill and mul∣titude
<PB N="295" REF="280"/>
of their Armie, which did consist of an
hundred and fortie thousand choice souldiers.
The good King <HI>Iagello</HI> his trust was in his praiers
to God; and in the presumption of his Enemy,
which had beene so triumphant before the victo∣ry,
so certaine of victorie before the joyning of the
battaile; that they would not give <HI>Iagello</HI> leave to
say his prayers, or doe his wonted service unto
God, but sent him two swords in mockerie, one
for himselfe, and another for his brother <HI>Vitou∣dus,</HI>
as if they had wanted weapons to defend
themselves; profering him withall, that if the
place wherein hee then was, were too strait for
ordering his men they would goe back, as in con∣tempt
and scorne they did, and make him roome.
This insolent message was by the religious King
embraced, as a welcome prognostique that they
should give him place against their wils. And so
it fell out, that they were not able to defend them∣selves
within their trenches; their Tents and cari∣ages
became a prey to Polonians, being so well
fraught with all manner of provision, not for ne∣cessitie
onely, but for pleasure, that <HI>Iagello</HI> caused
a great number of Wine-vessels to bee burst in
pieces, lest his souldiers should be overcome with
plenty of wine, after they had overcome their po∣tent
enemies, or at lest be hindred from further
pursuite of victorie. There a man might have seen
a strange spectacle, a flood or stream not of blood
or wine, but as if it had bin of gore by the mixture
of the wine and the blood alike violently shed in
the Germane Camp. The gaudinesse of their Ar∣mour
<PB N="296" REF="281"/>
would not suffer such as escaped by flight,
toly hid in the fennes or reeds into which they
ranne. This was the issue of their unhallowed
confidence, which had in their Tents abundance
of Torches and of chaines; the one provided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or
leading the Nobles of Poland Captives, the o∣ther
for firing their Cities.</P>
<P>5 There is a storie mentioned by <HI>Salvianus,</HI> ex∣actly
paralleld to the former, for the different d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣positions
of the parties conflictant, and for the con∣trary
successe which befell their contrary demea∣nours
before the battaile. The conflict was be∣twixt
the Goathes and the Gaules. The Goathes
were a kinde of Christians, but Arrians, through
default of their Instructors. The Gaules were
Catholiques, as good as Rome had any in those
dayes; so were the Prussian Knights: <HI>Iagello</HI> was a
late convert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Christian, and very devout in his
kinde, yet not quite purged from some Heathe∣nish
inbred superstition. It was a custome with
him, to turne thrice round about, and to breake a
straw in three pieces before he went abroad. How
much more acceptable or lesse displeasing unto
God, how much more availeable in the day of bat∣tell
un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained humilitie, fear &amp; devotion, (though in
part tainted with e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roneous opinion, and supersti∣tion)
are, than confidence in the puritie of opini∣ons,
or profession of Orthodoxall religion, with∣out
correspondency of practise, cannot better be
expressed than it is by<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Non ita Gothi, non ita Vuanda∣li, qui &amp; in discrimine positi opem a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eo postu∣lant, &amp; prosperitatis suae munus divinis no∣minibus ap∣pellant.

In quo quidem pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter ipsam rerum infelicitatem, praesens judicium Dei patuit, ut quicquid facturum se usurparat, ipse pate∣retur. &amp;c. <HI>Salvian. lib. 7.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Salvianus. That saying
of our Saviour,</HI> Hee that exalts himselfe shall bee
brought lowe, <HI>was evidently experienced in the
<PB N="297" REF="281"/>
Goaths and in us: they h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbled themselves and
were exalted; we exalted our selves and were dejected.</HI>
This our Generall found true in himselfe, being
led captive into that Citie of the Enemies, into
which he presumed he should the same day have
entred as Conquerour. Herein the judgement of
God was apparent upon him, that hee should suf∣fer,
whatsoever hee had presumed or undertaken
to doe. The King of the Goathes (as hee con∣cludes,)
fought with prayers and supplications be∣fore
he came to fight with the arme of flesh; and
he therefore went out with confidence unto Bat∣taile,
as having obtained victorie in his prayer.</P>
<P>A second parallel to the former battaile, for the
alternant inclinations of victorie▪ or sudden turning
of wofull and sad beginnings unto joyfull issue,
might bee taken from that famous battaile of
Flodden, if wee may beleeve eyther the ordina∣rie
Scottish Historie, or the constant report
of the English, which were then alive, and
tooke the Relation from the mouthes of
such as were imployed in that service, being
men of note &amp; no way partiall. In their observati∣on,
it was the extraordinary valour the of Scottish
<PB N="298" REF="282"/>
vauntguard in the very first onset or joyning of
battaile, which brought victory (otherwise doubt∣full
or declining from them) to the English. For
the sudden discomfiture and confused flight of
the English Vantguard unto the maine Battaile,
made that unfortunate King beleeve, that the Eng∣lish
Army began to reele; and out of this mistake,
as one that had prepared himselfe to follow the
chase, rather then to order his owne Battaile, hee
was encompassed by the English in that very place
(as some report) which he had beene forewarned,
but in termes generall and ambiguous, to eschue.</P>
<P>6 That great warre betweene <HI>Charles</HI> the fift,
and the confederate Princes of Germany, begun in
the yeare 1546. was more lingring. For as the Iu∣dicious
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Thuanus Anno 1546▪</NOTE>Historian observes, we shall hardly finde
any record in antiquity of two such great Armies
lying so neare one to the other, so long as these two
armies did without a ful battel. The war was mana∣ged,
as if it had bin a game at Chess, wherein divers
oversights were cōmitted on both sides; &amp; yet the
disadvantage given or taken, still so recoverable,
that the old Maxime, <HI>Non licet bis peccare in bello,</HI>
may seeme by the event of this warre, to be restrai∣ned
to <HI>praelium,</HI> rather to a set battaile then to <HI>war▪
Charles</HI> the Emperour, did in the esteeme of War∣riours,
manage his businesses more cautelously
than the Confederates did: and yet if wee should
speake in the ordinary Politician or Souldiers lan∣guage,
was more beholding to Fortune, than to
prudence or counsell of Warre. It was a great o∣versight
to expose himselfe unto such imminent
<PB N="299" REF="282"/>
danger, as he did at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Thuanus ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>Genge,</HI> out of a desire to view
his Enemies Army. For (as the Spaniards con∣fesse)
if the confederate Princes had beene as vi∣gilant
to take advantage, as he was carelesse to give
it; they might have put an end to this war, as soone
as it was begunne. It is noted likewise, as a great
oversight in them, that they did not assault him,
whilest hee was encamped about Ingolstade and
R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>isborne, expecting fresh supplies out of Italy
and the Low Countries: yet the losse of this op∣portunity
they had easily redeemed not long after,
had not their project beene disclosed to <HI>Charles,</HI>
who removed his Camp before they had notice,
and, by favour of the great windes, which that
night hapned, surprized <HI>Donaverd,</HI> a place of good
importance for his present designes; That Count
<HI>Egmond</HI> with his Netherland forces, on whose
skill and valour <HI>Charles</HI> did most relye, should e∣scape
the surprisall intended by the Landgrave,
was more from good hap and <HI>Caesar Magius</HI> his
extemporary sophisme, than from any forecast ei∣ther
of the Emperour himselfe, or of Count <HI>Eg∣mond.</HI>
For unlesse his Souldiers had been perswa∣ded
that the Landgrave was nearer to them over
night, than indeed he was; hee had beene nearer
to them, or sooner upon them in the morning, than
they could have wished. But this false Alarum, gi∣ven
by <HI>Magius,</HI> made them willing, though much
wearied, to march all night. Not long after their
safe conduct unto the maine Campe, the chiefe
Counsellors of warre were instant with <HI>Charles</HI> to
dissolve his Army for that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nter, untill the next
<PB N="300" REF="283"/>
Spring. That his resolution to the contrary, pro∣ved
so successefull, was more than in humane wis∣dome
could be forecast; so long as the successe of
<HI>Maurice</HI> Duke of Saxony, and the Bohemians
which had invaded the Territories of <HI>Iohn</HI> Duke
of Saxonie, was uncertaine. But the prevailing
power of this unexpected enemie, being a known
Professor of that Religion for whose maintenance
his noble Vncle and Father in Law had taken arms,
enforced the Confederates to divide their Army,
which could not but give advantage to <HI>Charles.</HI>
But that <HI>Henry</HI> the eight of England, and <HI>Francis</HI>
the first of France, (neither of them likely to have
stood as by-standers in this great businesse, if they
had lived) should both dye in this <HI>interim,</HI> this
was the Lords doing, not <HI>Fortunes. Charles</HI> could
not ground any resolution upon the hope of it, nor
could the confederate Princes foresee the disad∣vantage,
which from their death did redound unto
them. Yet after all these prejudices on the con∣federate
Princes behalfe, <HI>Charles</HI> his expedition
into Saxony against <HI>Iohn</HI> Prince Elector, who had
retired thither with part of the Army, to prevent
<HI>Maurice</HI> his further proceedings; was very doubt∣full
and full of danger: and yet was <HI>Charles</HI> (who
before had shewed himselfe to bee more timorous
and backward) more resolute and forward, in this
expedition, than any of his Captaines or Com∣manders.</P>
<P>7 Doubtlesse lest his Captaines, his Souldiers,
or Counsell of Warre should boast, as if their own
right hands, their policy and strength had gotten
<PB N="301" REF="283"/>
the victory; the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> the Lord mighty in
Battaile, did so dispose that the Emperour one
while should feare, where no feare was, and ano∣ther
while be couragiously wilfull or resolute, a∣gainst
his grave Counsell of Warre, and against all
probabilitie of hopefull successe. At Nordling,
when his Army was full, and his Souldiers fresh,
when the Spaniards (after some difficult passages
had beene conquered by their undaunted Resolu∣tion,)
were perswaded that victorie was hard be∣fore
them; <HI>Charles</HI> would not give them leave to
overtake it, or (as if it had beene snatched out of
their jawes) they did gnash with their teeth for
very indignation; nor was this hope of victory in
the Spaniards conceived from intemperate heate
of warre, or longing desire to fight without good
grounds of reason. For <HI>Maximilian Egmond,</HI> a
wise and well experienced Commander, was so
taken with the same perswasion, that when the
Emperour called him back, he pulled his Helmet
off his head, and for anger and indignation, threw
it with violence against the ground. Had <HI>Egmond</HI>

wills. For comming neere to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Thuanus anno 1547▪</NOTE> Mulberg, where
<HI>Iohn</HI> Prince Elector of Saxony was taken; albeit
the Duke of Alva (one at that time as notoriously
knowne for his resolution, as for his cruelty after∣wards)
and the rest of the Counsell of Warre, did
utterly mislike his intended passage, over the Ri∣ver
of E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve that day, as an attempt too adven∣trous
and desperate, which might yeeld great ad∣vantage
to his enemy; no perswasion could move
or weaken his resolution, but fight he would upon
that very day upon what termes soever. And it af∣terwards
appeared that unlesse he had put this his
unseasonable desire of battaile (as to them it see∣med)
in present execution, he might long have wai∣ted,
before he had laid hold on the like opportuni∣tie
againe. For some few houres start, might ei∣ther
have secured the Duke of Saxony from a ne∣cessity
of battaile, or assured him of victory, if hee
had beene enforced to fight. The next morning,
after his overthrow, the Emperour met with new
supplies, which had <HI>received</HI> the Duke in a well-fenced
place, whereas it was Caesars good fortune
to take the Duke the day before, beyond all expe∣ctation,
in such a place, as he could not fight upon
equall termes, nor make from him but by a dis∣gracefull
flight.</P>
<P>8 <HI>Alva</HI> out of his experience and skill might
foresee much hazard and danger in his Masters ad∣ventrous
resolution to passe over an unknowne Ri∣ver
in such haste; and his Master, out of some hu∣mour
or restlesse instinct, might be pusht forwards
to fight that day, without apprehension of any
<PB N="303" REF="284"/>
just reason why: but who besides him alone, which
appointeth the occurrences and opportunities of
time, could foresee or forecast, that the Duke of
<HI>Alva,</HI> being sent on a sudden to seek a guide, should
forthwith light on a <HI>Man,</HI> from whom some of the
Duke of Saxonies followers (a few dayes before)
had taken two Colts, and made him ready and
willing in hope of revenge, or recovery of his loss,
to discover an unknowne passage of that uncouth
River. They had reason to enstyle him, as they
did, <HI>Dux via:</HI> for he stood the Emperour in more
stead, than any ten Captaines in his Army, he be∣ing
resolved to try the fortune of Battaile that day.
Thus the Lord of Hoasts, as skilfull as mighty in
battaile, can turne and winde the whole fabrick of
Warre with the least finger of his hand, and over∣throw
or establish the cunningest projects of grea∣test
Princes, and their Counsels of Watre, by the
experience and information of a silly▪ Countrey
Swaine. Captaines may consult, but he determines;
they throw the Dice, he appoints the chance; they
may set their men as it pleaseth them, but he in the
issue will play the game as it pleaseth Him. When
we see great Statesmen, or subtile Politicians more
grossely infatuated in some particulars of greatest
consequence, then ordinary men usually are; this
is a sure token, that the wisdome which they for∣merly
used, was not their owne: but when we see
them wittingly cunning to worke their owne o∣verthrow,
this is an argument that there is one wi∣ser
then they, which sometimes gives wisedome,
sometimes onely <HI>lends</HI> it so, as he will require sa∣tisfaction
<PB N="304" REF="285"/>
for the mis-imployment of it. And it is
not so great a wonder, to see a wise man infatua∣ted,
or utterly deprived of wisedome, as to see his
wit and skill continually imployed in weaving a
net, to insnare himselfe in, and such as rely upon
his projects and power.</P>
<P>9 Hitherto <HI>Charles</HI> the fift had the fortune of
good Dice, and played the fore-game exceeding
well. But seeing Religion lay at the stake, God in∣structs
others to play the after-game a great deale
better against him; albeit he had two great Coun∣sellors,
the one for matters of State, the other for
Warre, to wit, the Duke of Alva, and <HI>Granvel</HI> the
Chancellor, as by-standers to helpe him. The sum
of their advice, was to account severity the best
fruits of victory; and to keepe them under by
strong hand, whom hee had conquered; and to
bring them in by cunning, which had yet some op∣portunity
to stand out against him. His first over∣sight,
was in committing the ever-renowned Duke
of Saxony, to the custody of a Spaniard, to <HI>Al∣fonsus
Vives,</HI> brother to the famous <HI>Ludovicus.</HI>
This bred great alienation of affection and discon∣tent
in some Nobles of Germany, of whose fide∣litie
and good service in this Warre, he had proofe
sufficient. But more mightily overseene he was, in
the cunning draught of those Articles, upon which
the Landgrave of <HI>Hessen</HI> did yeeld himselfe, not as
a Prisoner, but as a reconciled friend, or Subject, as
he presumed. The Emperour and his Counsell,
had wit enough to take this man prisoner, but not
to foresee the blot, which would hereupon follow,
<PB N="305" REF="285"/>
not to the stayning onely of the Emperours
honour, but to the hazard of the maine game,
and utter losse of his late Conquest. They
did not consider that <HI>Maurice</HI> of Saxonie,
sonne in Law to the <HI>Landgrave,</HI> was as subtill as
valorous, and being as ambitious as subtill, would
meditate as full a requitall of this reall disgrace and
delusion, (he being interested in the reconcile∣ment)
as hee had done of a friendly but sharpe
check, given by his Vncle and Guardian (the now
captive Duke of Saxonie) for being too prodigall
of his patrimony in his nonage. But <HI>Maurice</HI>
his disposition and abilities, were happily un∣knowne
unto the Emperour: and it was not usu∣all,
for a forward young Captaine, not above
twentie six yeares of age, to be of as deepe a reach
in matters of State, as his gray headed and most ex∣perienced
Counsellors. The more patient hee
was for the present, the more deeply hee layed his
plot, the more vigilant hee was to entertaine all
opportunities which should be offered for the re∣demption
of his Father in Law, and the libertie
of his Countrie. The making of <HI>Maurice</HI> Prince
Elector in his captive Vncles stead, did adde much
to his power: the Spanyards securitie and inso∣lency
expressed in their printed bookes of the
conquest in Germanie as of some meaner pro∣vince,
or appendix to their affected Monarchie,
did much exasperate the Germane Princes especi∣ally,
all but of Brandeburgh hitherto a faithfull
adherent unto <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, and a trusty friend
and companion unto <HI>Maurice,</HI> to whom he was
<PB N="306" REF="286"/>
now more neerely li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kt by the sure tye of common
discontent. The first opportunitie, which <HI>Mau∣rice</HI>
had for effecting his long concealed plot, was
the manifestation of <HI>Charles</HI> his purpose for redu∣cing
the Romish religion into the free States and
Cities of Germanie (which had abandoned it) con∣trary
to his former promises, when hee solicited
their ayde against the Duke of Saxonie and <HI>Land∣grave</HI>
of Hessen, not as the chiefe maintainers or
patrons of reformed religion, but as rebels against
his imperiall Majestie. This unexpected purpose
of <HI>Charles</HI> was most clearely bewrayed in the siege
of Magdeburge, against which Citie, no occasion
of hostility could be pretended, besides her Citi∣zens
resolution to maintaine that religion, which
by publique Authoritie had beene established.
The whole body of Germany besides, was in a
manner so drowned and choaked, that libertie (es∣pecially
in points of religion) could scantly draw
breath, save onely through <HI>Flaccus Illyricus▪</HI> his
penne. For subduing this Citie, which for a
while had held out stoutly against others set to be∣sige
it, <HI>Maurice</HI> of Saxony was adjudged the fit∣test
man, who being imployed in this service,
gaines opportunity by protraction of the warre
to make leagues as well with the French King as
with some Princes and States of Germany: but af∣ter
many suspitions and jealousies taken against
him, so cunningly goes on with his project, that
he came upon <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour on such a
sudden manner at Inchborrouh, as made him and
his Courtiers, with the forraine Embassadours
<PB N="307" REF="286"/>
there attending, to leave the Supper which had
beene provided for them unto <HI>Maurice</HI> and his
company. There was a horse-liter and torches pro∣vided
for the Emperour himselfe with some few
attendants, but such scarcity of horses for the rest,
that a man might have seene that common resem∣blance
of Princes, of Nobles, and common peo∣ple,
to a company of <HI>Chesse men</HI> promiscuously
put up into a cō<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on bag, when the game is ended,
really acted in the confused flight of this great Em∣perours
amazed Court. Dukes, Earles, &amp; Lords,
great Commanders in Warre, common Souldiers
and Kitchin Boyes, were glad to trudge it on foot
in the mire hand in hand; a Duke or Earle not dis∣daining
to support or helpe up one of the blacke
Guard ready to fall, lest he himselfe might fall in
the mire, and have none to helpe him. This was
the issue of the greatest Warre which Germany
had seene or knowne since the dayes of <HI>Charles</HI> the
Great; in the managing and prosequution where∣of
more excellent Commanders were imployed
by <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, than any Prince in Christen∣dome
since hath had to imploy.</P>
<P>10 Vnto many is given power and wit suffici∣ent
for compassing the conquest of their potent
enemies, unto whom the wisedome of using the
victorie aright (which they oftentimes purchased
at too deare a rate) is denyed. The same Lord of
Hoasts which put his hooke into <HI>Senacheribs</HI> no∣strills,
and thereby dragged this furious Monster,
which had ranged farre and neere to devoure o∣thers,
into his owne Land; there to fall by his
<PB N="308" REF="287"/>
owne bowells in the house of his false gods; had
all this while led <HI>Charles</HI> the fift (a Prince of more
calme and moderate spirit,) as it were in a silken
string, yet strong enough to bring this roving pro∣jector
back againe within the Rheine, where he is
now to encounter with the French. And being
thus overwearied in the Germane Warre, the
Duke of Guise at the siege of Metz, beates his
Souldiers out of heart and breath, and makes
<HI>Charles</HI> himselfe thus to pant: <HI>Iam me desertum &amp;
circa me nullos viros video; Now I see I am a man
forsaken, and have no men about me.</HI> Few there
were besides himselfe, that were willing to have
the siege continued any longer: and one of his
common Souldiers, out of the bitternesse of his
discontented soule and diseased body, calls him the
sonne of a mad woman to his face, for continuing
it so long. But whether his undertaking or prose∣quuting
this siege, did relish more of his mothers
disposition, than of his owne; let Warriours judge:
he never shewed more wisedome in any enterprise
before, then he did in this; that he sought not from
this time, to wooe his wonted fortunes, by wrest∣ling
with Fates. But after he perceived the Lord
of Hoasts did not goe out with his Armies, as be∣fore
he had done; he willingly puts off his imperi∣all
Robes with his Armour, and betakes himselfe
to a private retired life. How much happier in this
resolution, than either the <HI>Davus</HI> or <HI>Diabolus Ger∣maniae,</HI>
than the often mentioned <HI>Maurice</HI> of
Saxony, surnamed the Victorious, or the turbu∣lent
<HI>Albert</HI> of Brandeburgh, which had brought
<PB N="309" REF="287"/>
him into these straits! As these two Princes in all
their undertakings, in their secret confederacies,
whether for <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, or against him, had
aymed more at their private ends, than at the pub∣lique
weale of Germany: so it pleased the Lord of
Hoasts (after he had by their joynt forces, so tur∣ned
the seales of the Germane Warre, as is before
set downe) to settle the publique peace, by their
<HI>fatall</HI> discord. So I terme it, partly because they

did take up victory upon exchange of life;
having so much use of sense and memory, as to have
his Enemies colours presented to his eyes, now
ready to be closed up in perpetuall darknesse. This
was the end of this victorious Prince, which had
outstripe the greatest Statesmen of those times in
maturitie of wit, and deepnesse of judgement, in
matters Martiall or Civill, before his body was
come to its full growth: in so much that Policy
(whom <HI>Caesars</HI> in their greatnesse are oft-times for∣ced
to serve) did seeme to attend on him, enabling
him to atchieve those projects with an heroicall
carelesse resolution and majestique grace, for the
purchase of which, many powerfull Monarchs
have beene often drawne to use untowardly shifts
and slye coll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sions, odious and contemptible to
their inferiours. He was the only man of his age
(as one writes of him) that had the skill to take oc∣casion
(when it offered it selfe) by the very point,
and to carve opportunities out of perplexities. Yet
for all this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad no skill or forecast to prevent; no

dashed the masterpiece of his projects, when it was
come to the very height, and ready to fall upon the

to blesse the day of this Princes death, then the day
of their victory over the Duke of Saxony his uncle.
For if he had lived but a little longer, the wings of
Austria and Spaine had (in all probability) beene
cut a great deale shorter throughtout Germany and
<PB N="311" REF="288"/>
the Low-Countries, than since they have beene,
by the confederacy which the French King and he
had made lately for ruinating <HI>Charles</HI> the fift. But

stand, though by the sudden fall of the Confe∣derates.</P>
<P>11 To reflect a little upon the more speciall in∣terpositions
of Gods providence in moderating
the proceedings and issues of this warre. The Ro∣manists
have small cause to brag (though many of
them doe so) of <HI>Charles</HI> his victorie over the two
confederate Princes, as of some speciall token of
Gods favour to their Church and religion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In the life of <HI>Charles</HI> the fift.</NOTE> <HI>Chy∣treus,</HI>
a most unpartiall Writer, and well acquain∣ted
with the State of Germany as then it stood,
and with the severall dispositions of the chiefe
confederates; ingenuously confesseth as a speciall
argument of Gods favour towards the professors
of the reformed Religion throughout Germany,
that the Duke of Saxony and Landgrave of Hessen
had not the victory which they expected over the
Emperour. Hee might have more reason thus to
write, then I know or now remember: but cer∣tainly
their agreement during the time of the war,
was not altogether so good, as to promise any
lasting concord or sure establishment of true
Christian peace throughout the severall Provin∣ces
of Germany, if they had prevailed. <HI>Sherteli∣us,</HI>
who commanded in chiefe for the free Cities,
did (as some write) forsake the Campe, as being
wearie of their wranglings. However their
<PB N="312" REF="289"/>
few yeares captiuitie, was a fatherly chastisement,
no plague or token of Gods wrath against them.
As the unjust detention of the Landgrave, brought
greater dishonour to the Emperour <HI>Charles,</HI> then
any one Act that ever he did: so the Duke of Sa∣xonie
wonne himselfe more honour by his du∣rance,
then the Emperour could bestow upon
him. Victorie in battaile, abundance of wealth,
and titles of honour, are gifts and blessings from
the Lord; yet of which Pagans and Infidels are ca∣pable;
and such, as many Heathen have scorned
or not affected. But for a Prince by birth, which
had beene continually borne upon the wings of
better Fortune, alwayes reputed the chiefe stay
and pillar of his Country; to endure captivity in
an uncouth Court, with such constancy of minde,
as could turne the intended contempt and scorne
of his witty enemies, into kindnesse and admira∣tion,
and cause such as had led him captive, not on∣ly
to pitie but to honour him, and propagate his
fame unto posterity. This was a blessing peculiar
to Gods Saints. That character which forraigne
Writers have put upon him, will hardly befit any
that is not a Christian inwardly and in heart; [Ne∣que
in prosperis elatum, neque in adversis deje∣ctum
sui hostes unquam vidêre:] <HI>His enemies did
never see him either puft up with prosperitie, or de∣jected
with adversity.</HI> But was it not the greater
pitie, (if we may speake after the manner of most
men, and as many Germanes in those times did,)
that so noble a Prince should be punished with the
perpetuall losse of his Electorall dignity? Yet even
<PB N="313" REF="289"/>
this (that we may with veneration rather admire
than question the secret wayes of Gods provi∣dence)
was no losse, but gaine unto Gods Church,
and the publique weale of Saxony, which he more
sought, than his owne ends or commodities. For
by his falling into <HI>Charles</HI> his hands, the Electorall
dignity of Saxony fell into another Collaterall
line, which proved as beneficiall and favourable to
good learning and Reformed Religion, as any o∣ther
Princely Family of Germany in those times.

his nature, and friendship or

who is the onely Author of all true peace,
but not the Author onely of peace. Sometimes
hee kindles unquenchable dissentions where the

<P>2 Later Chronicles will hardly afford any ex∣ample
of worse consort betweene neighbour Prin∣ces,
than was betweene <HI>Charles</HI> of Burgundy, and
<HI>Lewes</HI> of France; whether wee respect the contra∣rietie
of their naturall dispositions, or the incom∣possibilitie
of their projects or engagements. Na∣ture
had planted, and policie had nourished a kinde
of Antipathy betwixt them. And yet how quickly
<PB N="315" REF="290"/>
and unexpectedly did these two great Princes (af∣ter
irreconcileable variances) close and agree toge∣ther
to crush the wise, the rich, and martiall Earle
of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> then High Constable of France. He
that had beene of both these Princes Courts, and
of both their Counsels, hath left it observed, that
they could never bee brought in all their life time
to concurre in any other action or project besides
this: albeit they had often greater motives to en∣tertaine
peace betweene themselves, than provo∣cations
to conspire against this Earle. Perhaps
his experience of their ill consort made him more
confident than otherwise hee would have beene;
though confident he might have beene upon bet∣ter
grounds than most great Subjects or inferiour
Princes can be, if wit, if wealth, if policie, if marti∣all
power or authority could secure any from the

<P>3 The best use which <HI>Machiavel</HI> or his Scholars
make of this Potentates mishap, is to forewarne
great Subjects or inferiour Princes not to inter∣pose

This good Authors Comment upon this accident
is so full and lively, as it will not admit any para∣phrase
of mine, without wrong, not onely to him,
but to the Reader. Onely of one clause pertinent
as well to the Discourse following, as to that or the
like passage of sacred Writ, <HI>[As every man sowes, so
shall he reape,]</HI> I must give the Reader speciall no∣tice.
This Earle was alwayes delighted to sow the
seeds of warre, war being (as he and the World
thought) the chiefe field or surest ground of his
glory, and he ends his thus honoured life with a
bloody and unglorious death. This was by Gods
appointment the most naturall crop and proper
harvest of such a seed-time as he had made. Yet
was not the finger of God more remarkable in
knitting these two Princes, which al their life times
had stood (as we say) at the staffes end, than in loo∣sing
the strict link of mutuall amity between other
ancient Friends, and sworne Confederates; albeit
the Politician seeke in this case, as in the former,
altogether to cover or obliterate all impression of
it. For it is his manner or humour, as was obser∣ved
<PB N="317" REF="291"/>
before, to bring as much <HI>grist</HI> as he can, and
more then he ought, to his owne <HI>Mill;</HI> to entitle
such partiall and subordinate meanes, as fall within
the compasse of his profession, sole or prime causes
of those effects which are immediately produced
by <HI>Divine Providence.</HI></P>
<P>4 He spake merrily that said, <HI>A man could not
bestow his almes worse than on blinde men, seeing they
could finde in their hearts to see their best benefactors
hanged.</HI> But it hath beene delivered in good ear∣nest
as a cautelous rule by some politique <HI>Discour∣sers,</HI>
that the most thanklesse office any great Per∣sonage
can doe to his dearest friend, were to make
him King. It is a lesson of every dayes teaching,
<HI>The greater men grow, the more they scorne to bee
thought to be beholden unto others.</HI> The very sight
of such as they have beene more beholding unto,
than they can handsomely requite, seemes to up∣braid
ambitious minds. Hee is a meane Historian
that cannot instance in divers upstart Princes,
which could not long suffer the heads of those
men, whose hands had put Crownes on theirs,
unto which they had no lawful title, to stand where
nature had given them lawfull possession, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i.) upon
their owners shoulders. Politique rules or Apho∣rismes
grounded upon historicall observations of
this kinde, are not altogether without use. But
the doctrine inveiled in Poeticall fictions, is in this
and many other cases more Catholique than the
Historians or Politicians observation. Vsuall it is
with the Poets when they represent the originall
and progresse of tragicall dissentions betweene
<PB N="318" REF="292"/>
<HI>quondam</HI> friends; in the first place to dispatch the
Furies abroad with fire-brands in their hands to
kindle or blow the coales of cruell and (without
the mutuall blood of the Actors) unquenchable
hatred. And to speake the truth without fiction,
it seemes scarce possible that such light sparkles of
humane anger as are usually the first seeds of quar∣rels
betweene neighbour Princes or confederate
States, should grow unto such raging and devou∣ring
flames as they often doe, unlesse some spirit
more potent than the spirit or breath of man did
blow them. Now if by Furies the Poets meane in∣fernall
Fiends or evill Spirits, their language doth
not varie much from the ancient dialect of Canaan.
<HI>God</HI> (saith the Author of the Booke of Iudges, cap.
9. ver. 23, 24.) <HI>sent an evill spirit betweene Abime∣lech
and the men of Schechem: and the men of She∣chem
dealt treacherously with Abimelech: That the
cruelty done to the threescore and ten sonnes of Ierub∣baal
might come, and their blood be layd upon Abi∣melech
their brother which flew them, and upon the
men of Shechem which ayded him in the killing of his
brethren.</HI> The mutuall disasters of both parties re∣lated
in the verses following, is but the just award
of <HI>lothams</HI> imprecation. vers. 19, 20. <HI>If yee then
have dealt truly and sincerely with Ierubbaal, and
with his house this day, then rejoyce ye in Abimelech,
and let him also rejoyce in you. But if not, let fire
come out from Abimelech, and devoure the men of
Shechem, and the house of Millo: and let fire come
out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of
Millo, and devoure Abimelech.</HI></P>

5 It would be more easie than safe, out of the
Histories of times ancient and moderne, dome∣stique
and forraine, to parallell this last instance so
exactly as well for successe as practise, as might be
sufficient, if not to perswade the irreligious Politi∣cian,
yet to leave him without excuse for not being
perswaded, that there is an immortall King of
Kings and Lord of Lords, from whose jurisdiction
no corner of the Earth can be exempted; an ever∣lastingly

the inventions of mans heart with a stedfast eye,
and measures their actions with a constant hand;
one that visiteth the same irregularities by the

leaving the collection of parallell examples or ex∣periments

<HEAD>CHAP. 30.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Gods speciall providence in defeating cunning
plots and conspiracies, and in accomplishing ex∣traordinary
matters by meanes ordinary.</HEAD>
<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen it is said that <HI>In God we live,
wee move, and have our beeing,</HI>
this is not to be understood on∣ly
of <HI>being</HI> or life naturall, or of
motion properly so called, but
is to be extended unto life and
operations purely <HI>intellectuall.</HI> So that the incom∣prehensible
<HI>Nature</HI> in respect of our apprehensions,
is as properly an <HI>agent superartificiall,</HI> as <HI>supernatu∣rall.</HI>
All the skill wherewith any intelligent Crea∣ture
is or can be endowed, all the devises and pro∣jects
of mens hearts, are as essentially subordinate
to his incomprehensible wisedome, or counsell of
his will, as the life, being, and motions of things
naturall, are to his <HI>creative, conservative,</HI> or <HI>coope∣rative
power.</HI> Howbeit this subordination of the
rationall creatures cogitations to his infinite wise∣dome,
doth no way deprive it of all liberty or free∣dome,
in projecting, devising or consulting; but
onely of <HI>power</HI> to appoint successe unto its owne
projects or devises. Thus much, to my apprehen∣sion,
is included in the wise Kings Maxime,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Pro. 19. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Many
devises are in the heart of man: but the counsell of
the Lord, that shall stand.</HI> This freedome or liberty
of mans wil in devising or projecting, and the want
of all liberty or power to <HI>allot</HI> successe unto his
<PB N="321" REF="293"/>
projects, doth more truly argue, that which the
Latines call <HI>servum arbitrium,</HI> that is, <HI>mans servi∣tude
so misery and sinne,</HI> than if he had no more li∣berty
in the one case than in the other. The more
ample the spheare of his liberty in projecting or
devising, is, or (by divine permission) may be; the
more admirable doth the <HI>Counsell</HI> of the Lord ap∣peare
in directing and ordering his free courses,
most <HI>infallibly</HI> unto such ends as hee appoints, by
meanes for their kinde, ordinary and naturall. And
if we would diligently consider the works of God
in our dayes, they are as apt to establish true be∣leefe
unto the rules of Christianity set downe in
Scripture, as were the Miracles of former ages,
wherein Gods extraordinary power was most
seene: yea the ordinary events of our times, are
more apt for this purpose in this age, than use of
miracles could be. For the manifestations of Gods
most extraordinary power, cease, by very frequen∣cie,
to be miraculous; and men (such is the curio∣sity
of corrupted nature) would suspect, that such
events (were they frequent or continuall) did pro∣ceed
from some alteration in the course of nature,
rather than from any voluntary exercise of extra∣ordinary
power in the God of nature. But the con∣tinuance
of these ordinary events, which the all-seeing
wisedome of our God daily and hourely
brings to passe, is most apt to confirme the faith of
such as rightly consider them. For by their succes∣sive
variety, the amplitude of his unsearchable
wisdome is daily more and more discovered, and
by their frequency the hidden fountaine of his
<PB N="322" REF="294"/>
Counsell, whence this multiplicity flowes, ap∣peares
more clearly to be inexhaustible. Only the
right observation or live-apprehension of these his
works of wisedome, is not so easie and obvious un∣to
such as minde earthly things, as his workes of
extraordinary power are. For such works amate
the sense, and make entrance into the soule, as it
were by force; whereas the effects of his Wise∣dome
or Counsell, make no impression upon the
sense, but upon the understanding only, nor upon
it, save onely in quiet and deliberate thoughts. For
this reason, true faith was first to be planted and in∣grafted
in the Church by Miracles, but to be nou∣rished
and strengthned in succeeding ages, by con∣templation
of his providence. The limits of this
present contemplation, shall be by example or
instance to shew in what manner the wisedome
of God doth sometimes defeat the cunningest con∣trivances
or deepest plots of Politicians, and some∣times
accomplish matters of greatest consequence
by meanes or occurrences light and slender in the
esteeme of men. But how weake or slender soever
they bee for their particular nature, or in them∣selves,
yet the combination or contexture of them
must needs be strong, because it is woven by the
finger of God.</P>
<P>2 What plot could have been invented against
any land or people, more deadly, then that of <HI>Ha∣mans</HI>
against the people of God, storied <HI>Ester 3.
8, 9.</HI> His information against them was bitter, and
easie to finde entrance into an <HI>absolute Monarchs</HI>
eares, whose words must be a Law to all, especi∣ally
<PB N="323" REF="294"/>
to his captivate and conquered subjects. And
the Iewes on the other side more likely to change
their lives, than the lawes of their God, for any
Princes pleasure. What hope (in humane sight)
for <HI>Mordecai</HI> to finde any favour, when as <HI>He</HI> was
to execute this bloody Law, whose particular
spleene and revengefull mind against <HI>Mordecai,</HI> had
<HI>for his sake</HI> procured it, in most absolute forme a∣gainst
the whole Iewish Nation? You will say,
that <HI>Ester</HI> lately received to greatest favour with
the King, and now made consort of his bed, might
prevaile much. And for a barbarous King to shew
mercy, at his Queenes entreaty, unto such as had
done him so good service, as <HI>Mordecai</HI> had done
<HI>Assuerus,</HI> is but an ordinary thing. I confesse as
much, that many occurrences, which seem to con∣spire
for <HI>Mordecai</HI> and his peoples deliverance, are
not extraordinary. For a King in his cups, to take
a displeasure at his former Queene, that would not
consent unto his folly; or for his displeasure unto
the divorced, to shew greater love unto his late
espoused Queene, is a matter neither strange nor
unusuall: but that Queene <HI>Vashti</HI> should bee dis∣placed,
and <HI>Ester</HI> (unknowne to bee of the captive
Hebrewes kinde) admitted to be <HI>Assuerus</HI> his mate,
just at that time, when <HI>Haman,</HI> the Iewes sworne
enemy, was exalted next to the King and Queene
in dignity; this can only be ascribed to him, who,
as the wise sonne of <HI>Syrach</HI> speakes, hath made all
things <HI>double, one against another, Ecclus, 42. v. 24.</HI>
Againe, that the King, the very night before hee
came to the banquet which <HI>Ester</HI> had prepared,
<PB N="324" REF="295"/>
should take no rest; this was the Keeper of Israels
vigilant care over his people, who neither slum∣bers
nor sleepes, whilest his enemies are a plotting
mischiefe against them. Againe, that the King ta∣king
no rest should seeke to solace his restlesse
thoughts by reading the Chronicles, that reading
them hee should light on that place, wherein the
now distressed <HI>Mordecaies</HI> faithfull service, in be∣wraying
the treason intended against his person, by
<HI>Bigtan</HI> and <HI>Teresh</HI> his Eunuches, was registred: All
this doubtlesse, was only from his wisedome, that
hath the disposition of al the <HI>lots,</HI> much more of all
the plots which man can cast. Many other occur∣rences
might here be considered, no one of which
considered apart, from the rest, but is ordinary and
usuall; and yet the entire frame or composture of
them, such as cannot bee referred to any but his
<HI>workmanship,</HI> who hath created all things in <HI>num∣ber,
waight,</HI> and <HI>measure.</HI></P>
<P>Yet a Politician that should have read this story
in the Persian Chronicles, could at the first sight
have discovered a great oversight in <HI>Haman,</HI> in not
putting sooner in execution this his absolute com∣mission;
<HI>Semper nocuit differre paratis.</HI> Perhaps
this conditionall proposition may bee true, that if
he had executed his Commission with speed, the
Iewes had fared worse; but for this cause the Lord
did not suffer him to entertaine this resolution.
Yet, let us see whether <HI>haste</HI> in execution could
accomplish the like designes against a State in
<HI>like</HI> case.</P>
<P>3 <HI>Fliscus</HI> that nobly descended and potent <HI>Ge∣noesi,</HI>
<PB N="325" REF="295"/>
with his <HI>familiar Verina,</HI> had enacted as cru∣ell
a Law against the <HI>Dorian</HI> Family, and the other
Nobility of Genoa; which they had resolved to
have writen, first with characters of blood upon
their pretended enemies brests, &amp; after their death,
to have condemned them by proclamation, when
as <HI>Fliscus</HI> through popularity should have got the
Diadem.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Thuanum anno. 1547</NOTE> Their plot for effecting their enemies
death and their owne advancement, was layed as
exactly as policy could devise; their <HI>practise</HI> and
execution of meanes invented, was more exact
then the patterne which <HI>Machiavel</HI> gives for like
designes. First, because store of armour and muni∣tion
was necessary for such an action, and provision
of such store of munition would be suspicious for a
private man to undertake in a <HI>popular</HI> and <HI>factious</HI>
State; <HI>Fliscus</HI> perswades young <HI>Doria</HI> (whose
death he especially sought) to be his partner in set∣ting
out a Man of Warre against the Turkes. <HI>Do∣ria</HI>
kindly accepts the offer, altogether ignorant of
the others intent, which was by this colour to fur∣nish
himselfe with armour and munition out of the
Countrie for <HI>Doriaes</HI> overthrow. And being once
furnished with such tragicall attire, without suspi∣tion
of any tragedy to ensue: for to provide him∣selfe
of sutable actors; hee invites a multitude of
the Commons to a night feast, where in stead of
thanksgiving before meat, hee makes a patheticall
oration, exhorting them to banquet it that night
in the Nobilities blood, assuring them that they
should bee their owne carvers for ever after, of
the good things of that Citie. Some for love to
<PB N="326" REF="296"/>
<HI>Fliscus,</HI> others for hate to the <HI>Nobility,</HI> some for
feare of present danger, and others for hope of
greater dignities; for one cause or other, all at
length, save two (who desired to be spared for their
faint hearts) offer themselves to <HI>Fliscus</HI> his service.
And by their forwardnesse, the City gates, next to
the <HI>key,</HI> whose <HI>command</HI> made most for their pur∣pose,
are presently surprised: yet not without some
noise, which comming unto <HI>Doriaes</HI> eare, makes
him suspect that his Mariners were quarrelling;
and rifing out of his bed to <HI>compose</HI> the supposed
quarrell by his presence, he falls immediately into
his enemies hands before he was sought for. But
however this yong gallant had committed no <HI>actu∣all</HI>
crime, that by course of humane law, deserved
a violent death by such executioners; yet the right
hand of the Lord had found him out, for consen∣ting
by <HI>Piracy</HI> to disturbe the publique peace lately
concluded betwixt <HI>Charles</HI> the fift and the Turke:
which peace the Genoezes amongst others, the
Dorian faction above other Genoezes, but especi∣ally
this young <HI>Doria</HI> &amp; his Fathers house (which
had stood for <HI>Caesar</HI> against the French) were bound
in conscience to observe. But leaving the cause of
his death unto the righteous Iudge: his sudden end
in any Politicians judgement was a good begin∣ning
to <HI>Fliscus</HI> mischievous designes. And what
more could <HI>Machiavel</HI> have in the next place given
in charge, but that the Gallies which made some
stirre at the noise, should with all speed bee boor∣ded
to make all sure, untill the Tragedy were fully
acted. This <HI>Fliscus</HI> sought to put in execution with
<PB N="327" REF="296"/>
as great speed as <HI>Machiavel</HI> in like case could have
wished. But haste (as wee say) makes waste: his
forward minde had made him forget, that his <HI>body</HI>
was not so nimble in armour, as out of it; not so
apt either to avoid a slip, or to recover himselfe
when he began to slide. By his hasty treading up∣on
a loose plank (as if the snare had been set for his
soule by the Almighties hand) he, and one or two
of his companions, fell some yard or two short of
their purpose, and drowned themselves and their
plot, even whilest it was come to such perfection,
that the younger <HI>Fliscus</HI> yet hoped to make him∣selfe
Duke of Genoa, as haply he might have done,
if the Lord had lent him so much wit as to have
concealed his elder brothers death, scarce knowne
to any till he bewrayed it to such as enquired for
him, in hope to finish all instantly by his presence.
But they partly amazed with the elder brothers
sudden disaster, and seeing no sufficiency in the
younger, to satisfie their expectation, dissolve the
rout, and ceasing to project the ruine of others, be∣gin
every one to seek the best meanes for his owne
safety. Thus hath this politique Gentleman <HI>con∣sulted
shame unto his house,</HI> his stately Palace is de∣molished,
and his Noble Family almost extinct.
Yet were all the conditions which greatest plot∣masters
require in such projects, exactly observed
in this: the plot it selfe as acurate as could by the
reach of man be devised, their counsell communi∣cated
but to a few at the first, the execution of it so
speedy, that the appointed actors could have no
leisure to deliberate whether it were better to re∣lent,
<PB N="328" REF="297"/>
or goe forwards; and yet the successe more
dismal and sudden, than their enemies could expect
or wish. Thus <HI>Machiavels</HI> rules have their ex∣ceptions,
but the Prophets Calendar is never out
of date; <HI>Non est viri dirigere gressus ejus.</HI> Not <HI>Ma∣chiavel</HI>
himselfe had he been present, could so have
directed <HI>Fliscus</HI> his steps, that his treadings should
not slip; yea, he should have fallen, though <HI>Ma∣chiavel</HI>
had held the plank. For his iniquity had
overgrown his plot, and being come to ful height,
it strikes upon that immutable &amp; irresistible doome
which God by <HI>Moses</HI> had pronounced, Deut. 32.
v. 35. <HI>Vengeance and recompence are mine, their
feet shall slide in due time, and the day of their destru∣ction
is at hand, and the things that shall come upon
them, make haste.</HI> These men we spake of, hastned
their owne destruction, by making too much haste
to destroy others.</P>
<P>4 Perhaps the Politician will reply: As <HI>Haman</HI>
was too slow, so <HI>Fliscus</HI> was too hasty, and should
have observed the contrary rule,
<Q>Differ; habent parvae commoda magna morae.</Q>
Suppose this hot-spur were <HI>revived,</HI> to re-act his
former or the like cunning plot, and for his better
remembrance should take the <HI>Dolphin</HI> and <HI>Harrow</HI>
for his devise, with this inscription, <HI>Festina lente;</HI>
it were not possible his speed should be better, so
long as his intentions were as bad, or worse then
they had beene; and his adversaries no worse then
they were, when he conspired their death.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="297"/>
To omit more examples ancient or foraigne:
the fresh memory of the Powder treason eclipseth
all that have gone before it. No Politician can
justly accuse the Actors of this intended Tragedy,
either of <HI>Hamans</HI> too long delay, or of <HI>Fliscus</HI> his
haste. Such maturity and secrecie they used in their
actions and consultations, as none on earth could
have used more, considering the many lets and im∣pediments
which did crosse their projects. Hell it
selfe had gone so long with this hideous monster,
that it was weary and well content to make an ab∣ortive
brood, as fearing the <HI>pangs</HI> that must have
accompanied the full delivery of what had beene
conceived within her bowels, would be unsuffera∣ble.
But <HI>Achitophel</HI> had wit at will, to plot a trea∣son
to his Soveraignes overthrow; yet herein <HI>blin∣ded</HI>
by <HI>him,</HI> that gave him sight in other projects,
that he could not forecast what harmes might be∣fall
him by <HI>Absoloms</HI> folly. And though the <HI>Arch∣plotter</HI>
were <HI>Vir profundae dissimulationis,</HI> one that
could give traiterous counsell, as the destroying
Angell of the Lord, and hide his counsell as deep as
Hell; though he had this extraordinary quality in
him, of making his friends so sure unto him, that
they would adventure both body and soule at any
time for his sake: yet thus farre infatuated he was,
as not to consider, that some of them which were
so willing to worke a publique mischiefe for his
pleasure, might also have a desire to secure their
private friends from danger, by giving them some
generall or ambiguous admonition, albeit against
their oaths of secrecie. That one of them should
<PB N="330" REF="298"/>
seeke to admonish his Honourable friend of the in∣stant
danger, was a thing not extraordinary, ex∣cept
in this, that so much good nature could be left
in his brest, that could consent unto his Countries
ruine. That a man of the Iesuites instruction, should
finde an evasion in an oath, which he held lawfull,
is a matter usuall. And who knowes whether hee
that permits evill, because he knowes to turne it
unto good, did not at this time make use of the Ie∣suites
doctrine of playing fast and loose with his
sacred and dreadfull name, to animate this Disco∣verer
to dispense with that solemne oath of secre∣cy
which he had taken, and afterward to forsweare
the fact so deeply. I do not think he durst have ad∣ventured
upon either, without some <HI>secret mentall
reservation.</HI> But without all question, it was his
<HI>counsell</HI> which moderateth the maine devises of
mans heart, that moved him to expresse his minde
in such <HI>termes,</HI> as might represent or call the fathers
disaster, unto the remembrance of his royall sonne,
whom nature had taught to make jealous constru∣ctions
of every speech, word, or circumstance,
that might revive the memory of the intendments
against his father, and to forecast all possible inter∣pretations
of all occurrences, which might por∣tend
or intimate the like designes against himselfe.
As the sincerity of his royall heart and conscious∣nesse
of clemency towards all, especially towards
that faction which deserved none; had brought
our Soveraigne asleepe in security: so the collecti∣ons
which he made out of the disclosers aenigma∣tical
admonitions, were such as a man would make,
<PB N="331" REF="298"/>
that had heard the Letter read in a dreame or slum∣ber,
not such as so wise and learned a Prince would
in other cases have made in his vigilant and waking
thoughts. But from what cause soever the dreame
came, the interpretation was from the Lord, and
<HI>Let it be unto the Kings enemies for ever.</HI> The event
hath proved the discloser to have beene a false Pro∣phet,
and to have spoken presumptuously when he
said, that <HI>God and man had concurred to punish the
iniquity of those times,</HI> by such a <HI>blow</HI> as he meant.
We must with the true Prophet make confession:
<HI>Not unto us Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name
give the glorie.</HI> It was not God and man, but God
alone, that did sute and order the severall occurren∣ces
by which the intended blow was prevented. It
was not God, but the devill, that did intend it.</P>
<P>5 That the Iewes in the dayes of <HI>Mordecai,</HI>
that the Genoezes within this age, that this Land
and people within our memory, have not become
a prey unto their malicious enemies, was meerely
from the counsell of the Lord, which must stand,
for our good, if we decline not unto evill. It is not
the breath or vapour of Hell, that can undermine
our State, or shake our Princes Throne; whilest
God is with us. But if he be against us, what can be
for us? If he doe but speake the word, even the
least word of mortall man, whose breath is in his
nostrils, shall be sufficient to <HI>blow up</HI> or overturne
a Kingdome.</P>
<P>If subjects should rebell, as often as Princes
breake jests upon them, they might worke their
owne greater real disgrace, and wrong both them∣selves
<PB N="332" REF="299"/>
and their posterities farre more in deed, than
the other had done in words. But opportunitie
makes a theefe, and want of opportunitie oftimes
keepes great mindes much discontent, from rebel∣lion.
But when it shall please him that hath reser∣ved
the perfect knowledge of times and seasons to
himselfe, not to dispose their opportunities to any
Land or peoples good; a womans unseasonable
word may breed mightiest Empires greater reall
mischiefe, than Emperours Swords for many ge∣nerations
can redresse. So it fell out, when <HI>Iustin</HI>
the Emperour had removed <HI>Narses</HI> the Eunuch
from his <HI>regency</HI> of <HI>State</HI> upon importunate accusa∣tions,
which, for the present, he could not put off,

and of his encouraging of this King to revenge his

He did not so much as dreame of <HI>Nesto∣rius</HI>
or his heresie. And <HI>Sergius</HI> the Monke, when
he began to maintaine that heresie at Constanti∣nople,
did think as little of Arabian Sorcery. Af∣ter
these two, by Satans instigation, and Gods per∣mission,
had made a medley of Iewish <HI>infidelity</HI> and
Grecian <HI>heresie,</HI> as if it had beene a garment of
English <HI>wool</HI> and out landish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>int; they least thought
of any mutinie towards, in <HI>Heraclius</HI> his camp for
want of pay. The Romane <HI>Quaestor</HI> was altoge∣ther
ignorant of <HI>Mahomets</HI> visions or his new coi∣ned
Lawes, when he thus disgracefully intreated
the Arabians or Sarazens: <HI>There is scarce sufficient
provision for the Romane and Grecian Souldiers, and
must this rascality of Dogs be so importunately impu∣dent,
in demanding their pay? Sed habet &amp; Musca
splenem.</HI> These poore Barbarians were such hungry
Dogs, as looked to be cherished where they <HI>faw∣ned,</HI>
<PB N="334" REF="300"/>
and could be content to change many masters,
rather then be continually <HI>raited</HI> thus. Now albeit
the Romane <HI>Quaestor</HI> did thus uncourteously dis∣misse
them, without a pasport or direction whither
to goe: yet the Lord by his harsh language did
<HI>hisse</HI> for these Hornets, unto <HI>Mahomets</HI> Campe;
who had beene lately foiled by the Persian, untill
these fugitives raised him up, and made him Lord
of Aegypt. Thus of the heresie of <HI>Sergius</HI> (by birth
an Italian, by profession a <HI>Monke)</HI> and of <HI>Ma∣homets</HI>
sorcery, and of these Sarazens mutiny, hath
the Divine Providence, made up a triple cord,
which cannot to this day be broken, having conti∣nued
almost these thousand years, as a <HI>fatall</HI> scourge
to Christendome.</P>
<P>7 A meere Politican, that considers the causes
of <HI>Iustinus</HI> his losse, by the discontent of <HI>Narses,</HI> or
of <HI>Heraclius</HI> his prejudice by these Sarazens revolt,
would from both draw that Aphorisme which di∣vers
have done, from a trusty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Camera∣rius ex Fer∣rono.</NOTE> Gascoignes an∣swer
unto <HI>Charles</HI> the 7. French King. The Apho∣risme
is that Princes must beware what speeches
they use unto great Souldiers or men of valour,
seeing <HI>that</HI> Gascoigne ingenuously told his Lord
and Master, that for a foule disgrace he could turne
Traytor, though all the riches of France, though
the French Kingdome it selfe would not suffice for
a bribe to make him prove false, or to corrupt his
loyall minde. The Rule or Aphorisme is in many
cases good. Yet if this and all other like caveats
were strictly observed, and other matters not a∣mended;
he that at his appointed time turnes dis∣gracefull
<PB N="335" REF="300"/>
speeches unto the speakers overthrow,
can make the mildest words, which <HI>Generalls</HI>
or other Confederates in Armes can utter, for
accomplishing their joynt purposes, to effect
their owne ruine, and delivery of their ene∣mies.</P>
<P>8 It is a knowne story of a Family or faction in
<HI>Perusium,</HI> who having gathered a competent ar∣mie
of their Allies, to surprise the citie from which
they had beene lately banished; made their forci∣ble
entrance into it by night, but sting all the chains
that otherwise would have hindred the passage of
the horsemen, untill they came unto the Market
stead or chiefe place to bee surprized. But here
their <HI>Hercules,</HI> wanting roome (by reason of the
presse) to fetch a full blow with his club, for bur∣sting
that chaine, much stronger (in all likelihood)
than the rest, cries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Guic∣ciardine <HI>and</HI> Ma∣chiavel, lo∣cis citatis.</NOTE> <HI>Back, back,</HI> unto those that
were next unto him, and they the like unto such as
were behinde them, untill the same words had run
like an <HI>eccho</HI> to the hindmost ranks or reere; who
imagining that those in the front had descried
some danger, resolved to be the first in retiring, as
they had beene the last in entring: and hence they
in the front perceiving themselves suddenly desti∣tuted
of their company, give their enterprize for
lost, which one blow more, or one word lesse, had
presently effected. But perpetuall exile was by
Divine justice the enterprisers due; and though
iron chaines may be burst by the strength of man,
yet the <HI>Counsell of the Lord, that shall stand,</HI> more
firme than walls of brasse, or rocks of Adamant;
<PB N="336" REF="301"/>
that his enemies at the appointed time may fall
before it.</P>
<P>The onely use which the Politician hath made
of this and like experiments, is this: First, that Ge∣neralls
should bee very wary what words should
passe throughout their army, and for this purpose
to keepe servants, women, or other talkative or
clamorous creatures, farre from the army, when
any service is toward. Secondly, to accustome
their Souldiers, onely to respect their Comman∣ders
speeches, and to account of others as winde,
that blowes afarre off. These caveats were given
above 70 yeares agoe; and yet have greater forces
than these Italians had, beene upon as light occasi∣ons
defeated in their intended surprisalls of Cities
by night, after they had blowne open their Gates
with <HI>Petars.</HI> However, the admonition hath its
use and seasons, though oftentimes observed with∣out
successe, because it is too much relyed upon.
<HI>Mordecai</HI> spake with confidence unto <HI>Ester; If
thou holdest thy peace at this time, comfort and deli∣verance
shall appeare unto the Iew out of another
place;</HI> because as he supposed, the counsell of God
was for their good. But though <HI>Souldiers</HI> should
hold their peace, and Generalls speake nothing but
what the Politician should <HI>prompt,</HI> yet shall destru∣ction
come upon them upon other occasions; if the
counsell of the Lord bee once against them. Yea
though the parties disagreeing should lay all en∣mity
aside, and consult for the establishing of
peace, yet shall they conclude in blood, if the Lord
of Hosts be displeased with them.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="301"/>
9 A fit instance to this purpose is registred, as
<HI>Camerarius</HI> tels us in foraigne Annalls, though not
intimated by our English Historians, who had as
much reason as any other to have recorded it, if
the story had beene true. But seeing they have o∣mitted
it, I will not expect the Readers historicall
assent unto it, but only commend it unto him as an
example for illustrating the probability of the last
observation. The English and French Army be∣ing
ready to joyn battell in Normandy, the French
Captaines perswade their King to intreat a parley
with the King of England, that so all matters might
be compromised without further harme or dan∣ger
to either partie. The place agreed upon for
the parley was a ruinated Chappell, a little distant
from both armies. A friendly compromise was by
both Kings resolved upon to be further ratified up∣on
deliberation of their severall Counsells. But
before their parting, a huge Snake, whether stir∣red
up by the noise of their attendants which wai∣ted
without, or upon other occasions, seemed by
her hissing and swelling necke to make towards
them. Both of them alike afraid, draw their swords,
and yet neither willing to trust other within the
walls, run out with their naked Swords in their
hands: their attendants upon this sight misdeem∣ing
some outfall in the Chappell betweene them,
doe the like; and the Armies upon this view joyne
battaile, and could not bee recalled, untill much
blood on both parties was, and more had beene
spilt, unlesse the night had come vpon them.</P>
<P>10 Be this, as it may be, a true story, or a fiction:
<PB N="338" REF="302"/>
the possibility of such unexpected occurrences (all
which are at the Almighties disposition) are infi∣nite,
and cannot be comprehended, much lesse pre∣vented
by the wit of man which is but finite. So
that although the plots and devises of mans heart
be many, yet hath the Lord more counterplots
perpetually in store, and therefore of all counsells,
<HI>the counsell of the Lord it shall stand.</HI></P>
<P>Whilest I reade some speculative Politicians,
that seeke by observing the errors of former times
in managing civill affaires or projects, to rectifie or
correct their oversights, and take upon them to
make an Ephimerides of future events: their Dis∣courses
in my slender observation, argue a greater
ignorance in them, of divine Providence, than their
practises would in the Mathematicks, that would
labour out of a surd number to extract a perfect
square. He that knowes the rules of Arithmeticall
division, might in every <HI>working</HI> or attempt of re∣solving
a full number into its proper <HI>square,</HI> come
nearer and nearer to the square number, and yet be
sure not to finde it, though he spent <HI>Nestors</HI> yeares
in dividing and subdividing the same number, or
resolving fractions into fractions. The reason is
this, how little soever a surd number exceeds the
next square, yet the overplus is in division infinite.
And so are the events which the Politician seeks to
rectifie or determine of, and therefore not certain∣ly
rectifiable or determinable; save onely by him
whose wisdome is actually infinite. It is an errour
incident to little children to think they might ea∣sily
shake hands with the <HI>man</HI> in the Moone, or
<PB N="339" REF="302"/>
with <HI>Endymion</HI> kisse the Moone it selfe, if they
were upon the next hill where it seemes to them
to set: and if you bring them thither, they think
they came but a little too late; if they could bee
now at the next hill where they see it goe downe,
they imagine they might doe so yet. Such for all
the world is the practicall Politicians errour, the
cause of both in proportion the same. Children
are thus deceived, because they imagine no di∣stance
betweene heaven and earth, or betweene
heaven and that part of earth which terminates
their sight. And so the secular Politicians minde,
reacheth no farther than the hemisphere of his
owne facultie. Either he knowes not, or considers
not, how farre the height and depth of his wise∣dome
and counsell that sits in the heavens, and
rules the earth; exceeds the utmost bounds or ho¦rizon
of his foresight and limited skill: in this only
different from the childe, that his wit is more swift
and nimble than the others body, so that he is not
so soone weary of his pursuit. But if hee misse of
his purpose at the first, he hopes at his next flight
to speed, and thus in seeking after true felicity
(which was hard by him, when hee beganne his
course) he runnes round all the dayes of his life,
even as he is led by him that daily compasseth the
earth. Better might Painters hope, by looking on
the multitude of men now living, to draw accurate
pictures of such as shal be in the Age to come; than
any Politician can expect, either by observation of
former times, or experience of his owne, to pre∣scribe
exact rules for managing of future projects.
<PB N="340" REF="303"/>
For if we consider the whole frame or compositi∣on
of circumstances, or all the ingredients, (if I
may so speake) of every event; there is as great a
varietie in humane actions, as there is in mens fa∣ces.
Never were there two events of moment up∣on
earth altogether alike; each differs from other,
either in the substance, number, or quality of oc∣currences,
or in the proportion of their consonan∣cie
or dissonancy unto the counsell of the Lord; as
there is no visage but differs from another, if not
in colour or complexion, yet in shape or figure. I
have beene perhaps rather too long, then too bold
in decyphering the vanity of this proud Criticke,
which accuseth Christianity of cowardize in acti∣ons,
and devotion of stupiditie and dulnesse in con∣sultation
of State. But so might Bats and Owles
condemne the Eagle of blindnesse, were tryall of
sight to be made in that part of twilight, wherein
darknesse hath gotten the victory of light. Some
men not able to discern a friend from a foe, at three
paces distance in the open Sunne, will reade their
<HI>Pater noster</HI> written in the compasse of a shilling
by moone shine, much better than others clearer
sighted, can reade a Proclamation print. The pur∣blinde
see best by night, yet not therefore better
sighted than others are, because the absolute triall
of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight is best made by day. So is the meere Poli∣tician
more quick fighted, than Gods children in
matters permitted by divine providence, to the
managing of the Prince of darknesse. For albeit
the righteous Lord do in no case permit, or dis∣pense
with perjury, fraud, or violence; yet he suf∣fers
<PB N="341" REF="303"/>
many events to be compassed by all or some of
these, or worse meanes. Now when matters usu∣ally
managed by speciall providence, come by di∣vine
permission once to catching; hee that makes
least conscience of his wayes, will shew most wit
and resolution. For whatsoever falls to Satans
disposalls, shall assuredly bee collated on him that
will adventure most. It is his trade and profession
to lend <HI>wit, might,</HI> and <HI>cunning,</HI> for satisfying pre∣sent
desires, upon the mortgage of soules and con∣sciences.
And his Scholar or Client (the politique
Atheist) perceiving fraud and violence to prosper
well in some particulars, imagines these or like
meanes throughly multiplied to be able to conquer
all things, which he most desires. But when Sa∣tans
commission is recalled, or his power by Gods
providence contracted; the cunningest intentions
or violent practises of Politicians, prove much like
to a peremptory warrant out of date, which being
directed to one County is served in another. Both
indanger the party prosecuting, and turne to the
advantage of the prosecuted. I conclude this

agrieved by them; by the sighes and grones of the fa∣therlesse

than any witnesses of fact, more powerfull then any
Atturney or Advocate, before the supreme tribunall
of God. So good and gratious a Iudge is He, and so
compassionate to the oppressed, that even in this life he
often punisheth Kings for their sakes, so evidently
and so remarkably, as there can be no place for doubt
amongst the observant, that he is a most just avenger
of humane impietie. But most Princes <HI>(as the same
Author notes)</HI> are so unexperienced, so inconsiderate
that whiles prosperous fortune smiles upon them, they
feare no stormes, no punishment, no conviction. And
<PB N="345" REF="305"/>
for want of this feare, which is the beginning of wise∣dome,
God suddenly raiseth up some adversary or o∣ther,
when they least suspect.</P>
<P>Affliction in some kinde or other is the surest
friend, the most trusty Counsellor, that any Prince
can use; for of all the rest of his retinue, it onely
knoweth not how to flatter. And affliction or ca∣lamity
of the same kinde, which they have unde∣servedly
brought upon others (when <HI>that</HI> befalls
them) is the most sincere, most powerfull Prea∣cher
that enters in at any Court gate, for bringing
Potentates to the knowledge of God and of his
Lawes, or to acknowledge him to be as well the
Iudge of Iudges, as Lord of Lords.</P>
<P>2 For as Iustice cannot be done upon private
offenders but by the warrant of supreame autho∣ritie;
so when wee see such judgements befall su∣preme
Magistrates themselves, as to the <HI>notions</HI> of
naturall reason are just and right, and as it were ex∣actly
fitted to that which they have done to o∣thers;
this clearly argues there is a Supreme Tribu∣nal
in heaven, which hath more soveraigne Autho∣ritie
over the highest Thrones and Principalities
on earth, than they have over the meanest subject

to say by heart, <HI>Threescore and ten Kings
having their thumbes and their great toes cut off, ga∣thered

God hath requited me. Iudg. 1. 7.</HI> This Tyrants of∣fences
had beene many and grosse, more barbarous
than many Princes in this age would (perhaps)
commit; yet an usuall practice upon the conque∣red

slavery, in thus fitting their hands for the oar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and
disenabling them to use the Pike, or other like in∣strument
of warre. However; more at this day
would be ready, upon like provocation or custome
to deale as boysterously with their vanquisht foes,
as <HI>Adonibezech</HI> did with his, rather than to make
the like ingenuous confession; though God did
call their sinnes to minde by such sensible remem∣brances,
as awaked him. This I have generally ob∣served,
that lighter touches of Gods afflicting
hand, did more affect the outragious people of the
old world (unlesse such as were delivered up into
a reprobate sense) than his severe blowes do ma∣ny
amongst us, which have the reputation of mo∣derate,
of civill, yea of sanctified men. The minds
of most men are so blinded and choakt with cares
of this world, that they looke no further than into
second causes; and hence (like idiots) they suspect
such blowes as are reached them from heaven, to
be given by such as are next unto them. But even
amongst such as look farre enough beyond second
<PB N="347" REF="306"/>
causes; amongst such as see God in his word, and
daily heare his promises, some there bee which ei∣ther
distinguish too nicely between Gods tempo∣rall
punishments, and his fatherly chastisements,
or else make not right application of this distincti∣on
to their owne particular. From the one or o∣ther
mistake, (perhaps from both) whatsoever af∣fliction
befalls them, after they have taken speciall
notice of their regeneration, is entertained as a
meere loving correction, sent for no other end
than to worke for their future good, not as a touch
of Gods punitive justice requiring serious repen∣tance
for some particular sinnes past. But whatso∣ever
may be thought of the distinction it selfe, this
application of it, was not in use amongst the ancient
Saints and people of God.</P>
<P>4 Few moderne Spirits of ingenuous birth and
breeding, but would scorne to be suspected of such
rude and vast behaviour, as some of <HI>Iacobs</HI> Sonnes
used towards their Father, others towards <HI>Ioseph,</HI>
or the Shechemites. And yet, how quickly doth
the feare, rather than the sufferance of lighter af∣fliction
than <HI>Ioseph</HI> suffered at their hands, call their
offences against <HI>him</HI> to their remembrance. They
knew themselves to bee as free from the crime
wherewith he charged them, as he was from <HI>merit</HI>
of death, when they put him into the pit, or from
desert of bondage, when they sold him to the Ma∣dianites.
Notwithstanding, his very not being so
flexible to their requests, as their instant occasions
required, (though nothing so inexorable as they
had been to him in his extremity, when they knew
<PB N="348" REF="307"/>
him (as now they do not) to be their brother) cau∣sed
them to make this mutuall confession one to a∣nother,
<HI>[We are verily guilty concerning our brother,
in that wee saw the anguish of his soule when hee be∣sought
us, and we would not heare: therefore is this
anguish come upon us. Gen. 42. 21.]</HI> This speedy re∣lentance
upon this warning, is an assured testimo∣nie,
that the feare of God and of his just judge∣ments,
did in some measure lodge in all their harts;
but most abundantly, now, in <HI>Reubens,</HI> whose for∣mer
sinnes against his father, did equalize, if not
superabound his brethrens sinnes against young
<HI>Ioseph,</HI> of whose miscariage he was least guilty. For
unto the rest confessing their sinnes, as was set
downe before in the next verse, hee thus replyes;
<HI>Spake I not unto you, saying, doe not finne against the
childe, and ye would not heare? therefore behold also
his blood is required.</HI> Yet was this confession utte∣red

not make knowne unto his Physitian, whose dis∣pleasure
he feared more than any thing else, besides
death; which was the only cause why he so much
feared his displeasure. And is it not (as the wise
King speakes) a vanity of vanities, or more than so,
a misery of miseries, that the feare of this last <HI>point</HI>
or close of life, should make great men slaves, for
the most part of their lives, and bring a necessity
upon them, of fearing every one with more than
a slavish feare, that may in probability be concei∣ved
as an instrument or messenger of its approach.
Now this King was so excessively afraid of death,
that he had given it in strict charge unto his friends
and followers, not to give him warning of this his
last <HI>enemy,</HI> by <HI>name,</HI> whensoever it should (to their
seeming) approach: but to exhort him onely to a
confession or expiation of his sinnes. Yet was it
his ill hap or <HI>fate,</HI> after he had set his house in order,

raysed with new hopes of recovery, to have death
rung into his eares by his servants, after such an

<P>3 If we could unpartially weigh the quality and
condition of the parties, who were thus uncivilly
and unseasonably bold with him, in the one scale of
just estimation, and the greatnesse of his person, his
natively timorous disposition and accustomance in
the other; the disparity would move us to bee of
<HI>Cominaeus</HI> his minde in this point; That this unto∣ward
remembrance or denunciation of death, was
more bitter and grievous unto <HI>Lewis,</HI> than the
sharp message of death, which he had sent by Com∣missioners,
unto those two great Peeres of France,
the Duke of <HI>Nemours,</HI> and the Earle of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI>
giving them but a short <HI>respite</HI> to <HI>marshall</HI> their
thoughts, and <HI>order</HI> their consciences before their

which they could not feare so much as <HI>Lewis</HI> did.
As this great King had done unto these great sub∣jects,

through consciousnesse of this his rigorous dealing

the iron cages were for their mediocrity. They
were not more desirous to see these close prisons
opened, or to heare of the day of their deliverance
from them, than he was carefull to cause the iron.

them (upon speciall occasions) to be opened. His
miserable Captives were not afraid of passengers,

guard to secure them: <HI>Lewis</HI> caused certaine Ar∣chers
to keep Centinell as well by day as by night,
to shoot at all that came neere his Castle gates, o∣therwise
than by his special command or appoint∣ment.
In fine, he was more afraid to be delivered
out of his Prison, by the Nobility of France, than
his Captives were to be put in such cages▪ That
which he feared from his Nobility, was not death
or violence, but his deposition or removall from
the present government, from which many wise
Princes in their declining age, have with honour
and <HI>security</HI> sequestred themselves.</P>
<P>5 Whether <HI>Lewis</HI> in entertaining the invention
of <HI>iron cages,</HI> and the use which he made of them,
or the Cardinall, which to please his severe humor,
first invented them, were more faultie, I cannot
tell, nor will I dispute; the rule of retaliation was
more conspicuously remarkable in the Cardinall.
For as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ominaeus</HI> tells us (who himselfe had lodged
<PB N="354" REF="310"/>
eight months in one of them) the Cardinall was
by <HI>Lewis command</HI> detained prisoner (fourteene
yeeres together) in the first that was made. It was
well observed, whether by a Christian or Heathen,
I now remember not,</P>

heart, there were no God: for so he might hope to escape
that vengeance which whilest he thinks of a God or
justice divine, hangs over his head uncessantly threat∣ning
to fall upon him. But hee that suffers wrong, is
willing to beleeve there is a God, and heartily wisheth
it so to be, that by his assistance he may bee supported
against the evills, which he suffers. It is for this rea∣son
<HI>(saith this Philosopher)</HI> expedient that such as
grieve and afflict others, should have experience of
the like affliction, to the end that being taught by
their owne losse or grievance, they might learne that
truth, which being blinded by avarice or other unru∣ly
desire, they could not see before. And this truth or
good lesson they may easily learne, so they will under∣goe
the mulct or punishment due to their offence, with
submission or patience.</P>
<P>6 Albeit the Cardinall had beene a flat Atheist
before, or one at least that had not God in his
thoughts, whilest he sought to please the rigorous
humour of this King, with an invention so displea∣sing
unto others; yet after experience had taught
him how exactly that misery had befalne himselfe,
which by his furtherance had befalne many, or was
likely to befall them; hee did (no question) often
wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h in his heart, that the rule of retaliation, wher∣with
he was visited, might be constant and unpar∣tiall;
that King <HI>Lewis</HI> himselfe might not bee ex∣empted
from its visitation. Now unto what rule
or law could so great a King bee subject, besides
that one everliving rule or eternall Law it selfe?
He that heartily wisheth Iustice might bee done on
such, as have full power and authority to doe it,
<PB N="356" REF="311"/>
but will not doe it; doth <HI>implicitely,</HI> yet <HI>necessarily</HI>
acknowledge a Law or Iudge supreame, <HI>Iustice</HI> it
selfe; so is God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Multos ipse, per omnem vitam, per∣petuo metu et solicitudi∣ne excruci∣averat: &amp; nunc ecce videmus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ū ad con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imilē plane modū affligi.

than God, who is <HI>mercy</HI> it selfe. Many may cast
the feare of God out of their thoughts; but none
all <HI>notions</HI> of divine Iustice out of their hearts.
These notions or apprehensions of an <HI>everliving</HI>
rule of <HI>equity, mercy,</HI> and <HI>justice,</HI> are so deeply roo∣ted
in the consciences of all, and are themselves of
such an immortall nature, as they can never be so
utterly extinguished in any, but that affliction will
inspire them with fresh life and motion, and make
them breathe out supplications to the supreme
Iudge, either for mercy towards themselves or for
justice upon other.</P>
<P>7 The particular evills which <HI>Lewis,</HI> by Divine
Iustice, in this life, suffred (haply) had never come
to the exact <HI>notice</HI> of posterity, unlesse <HI>Cominaeus</HI>
his wits, had beene set on worke to observe them,
by his experience or foresufferance of the like e∣vills
from <HI>Lewis,</HI> or by his procurement. Besides
this Authors imprisonment eight months in the
iron <HI>Cage;</HI> another evill there was, wherein no an∣cient
servant or follower of this King, but had a
large portion. For, he had either a naturall inclina∣tion,
or a disposition acquired by custome, to hold
them, whom he did not formally sentence to any
set punishment, in a perpetuall feare or anxiety of
<PB N="357" REF="311"/>
minde. Now the consciousnesse of this his dispo∣sition
and customary practice in his best and able
dayes, did (as it were) binde him over to indure
the like torments in his feeble and declining yeares.
<Q><HI>Metus pessimus Tyrannus,</HI> To live in perpetuall
feare, is to live under the most cruell Tyranny,</Q>
that can bee. And unto this Tyranny greatest
Tyrants are more subject and more obnoxious,
than their inferiours can be to them. For though
it be possible for one man to keepe many thousands
in perpetuall awe and feare, yet is it not so much
for every man (of so many) in his owne particu∣lar
to feare <HI>one</HI> man, (how greatly soever) as it is
for <HI>one</HI> man (how great soever) to stand in feare,
but of halfe so many. Yet can no man be so great
or so well guarded, as not to have often and just
occasion to feare some harme or other, from eve∣rie
one, whom he hath made to feare him more
than is fitting. Whence, he that seekes to sowe
the seedes of feare in the hearts of others, doth
but thereby (as it were) consecrate his owne
heart or brest to be the receptacle or store-house
of the multiplied increase or crop. For even in this
case that saying is most true, <HI>As every one sowes,
so shall he reape.</HI></P>
<P>What other issue could be expected from <HI>Lewis</HI>
his rigid practise upon others, and his owne na∣tive
timorous and ignoble disposition, than such
tormenting jealousies and perplexities, as <HI>Comi∣naeus</HI>
tells us in his old age did seize upon him, and
enforce him to feare the vertue and worth of his
dearest friends, not daring to trust sonne or daugh∣ter,
<PB N="358" REF="312"/>
or sonne in law. Now it is more than a Purga∣torie,
even an Hell upon earth, for a man which
can take no joy in himselfe, to deprive himselfe of

all comfort from him.

<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Vt however <HI>Lewis</HI> of France were

the manner of <HI>retribution,</HI> the righ∣teous
Lord did observe a kinde of Geometricall
proportion. The affliction or visitation it selfe, was
the just award of punitive Iustice: &amp; yet the <HI>form</HI> of
proceeding bears the <HI>character</HI> of humane distribu∣tive
Iustice, which hath usually some respect to the
dignity of the persons <HI>awarded.</HI> So humane Laws,
w<SUP>ch</SUP> punish capital crimes with death, are dispensed
with, by the favour of the Prince, for the manner
of death. <HI>That,</HI> is not so ignominious or dishono∣rable
in the execution upō <HI>Nobles,</HI> as upō inferiors
involved in the same capitall crime, or treason;
no not, albeit the <HI>Nobles</HI> be principalls, and inferi∣ours
but accessories or assistants. But this favou∣rable
kind of punishment for the externall forme,
God doth not alwaies use towards Princes. If ma∣ny
times he may seeme to beare respect or favour
unto their place or persons, this ariseth not from
their greatnesse, but from some other causes best
knowne unto himselfe. His judgements upon
Princes and other Potentates, are often executed,
according to the most strict arithmeticall propor∣tion
that can be required in the rule of Retaliation
upon equalls, as well for the manner as for the mat∣ter
<PB N="360" REF="313"/>
of punishment. And although God in this life
never plagueth any according to the full measure of
their offences committed against himselfe: yet he
often visiteth Kings and Monarks, with a fuller vi∣sible
measure of calamity, than they have brought
upon others, and with calamity of the same kinde.
Though <HI>Pharaoh</HI> had beene the greatest Monark,
and his Court the most glorious seat of Nobility
(till their time) on earth: yet because hee and his
Nobles had plotted cruelty against the innocent,
without relentance or remorse, the dignity of his
or their persons procures no mitigation either for
the matter or manner of punishment. Their dues
are fully paid them (as we say) in kinde; the guilt∣lesse
blood of poore Hebrew infants is rendred
seven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old into the bosome of the Aegyptian No∣bility
and men of Warre.</P>
<P>2 Never did any State or Kingdome, since the
foundation of the world were laid, receive so ter∣rible
a wound within its owne territories, in one
day, as at this time Egypt did, but females did in
some measure feele the smart. Yet in this last, as in
the former plagues, no Egyptian woman had cause
to lament for her selfe, for her sister, or daughter;
but many for their husbāds, their brothers or sons.
What was the reason? The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Exod. 1. 15. &amp;c.</NOTE> Egyptian Mid-wives
(and they were women) if no other of their sex be∣sides,
had beene more merciful to the infant males
of the Hebrewes, than the Egyptian men had been.
And as they had done, so hath the Lord requited
the one and rewarded the other. To the mercilesse
Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iers, Politicians, and men of Warre, he hath
<PB N="361" REF="313"/>
rendred <HI>vengeance</HI> and <HI>judgement,</HI> without mercy,
and punished them with miserable and ignomini∣ous
death, shewing compassion on the weaker and
more pitifull sex.</P>
<P>3 It was a rare document of divine justice to or∣daine,
&amp; of divine wisdome so to contrive, that the
dogges should lap King <HI>Ahabs</HI> blood in the same
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 King. 21. 19.</NOTE>place, where they had lapped the blood of <HI>Na∣both</HI>
(stoned to death through his connivance or

with mercy, and of the great Kings speciall
grace or favour unto this gracelesse King of Israel,
that the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Kin. 22. 18.</NOTE> dogs which lapped his blood should not
so much as touch his body. Being slaine in battell,
his death was honourable, as the world accounteth
honour, yet was it not so much the dignity of his
royall person, as his humiliation upon the Prophets
<HI>chalenge,</HI> which made him capable of this favour;
but not a dram either of disgrace or misery from
which <HI>Ahab</HI> was by Gods mercy in part released,

<HI>Naboth</HI> to be stoned to death by the men of his ci∣tie:
and at <HI>Iehues call,</HI> her body is dashed against the
stones by her owne servants.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kin. 9. 33.</NOTE> The dogs lapped <HI>Na∣boths</HI>
blood, but they devoured <HI>Iezabels</HI> flesh: she
had beene shamelesly cruell in her life, and she hath
a most shamefull and a most fearfull death. Nor
would the all-seeing Iudge suffer that respect to be
<PB N="362" REF="314"/>
done to her corps, which her cruell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 King. 9. 34.</NOTE> executioner
intended, upon remembrance that she had beene
daughter to a King. It was I must confesse a ruefull
case, and yet a judgement, more righteous than
rufull, that she which had issued from royall womb,
she from whose wombe had issued royall proge∣nie,
(for she had beene <HI>respectively</HI> lawfull daughter,
lawfull wife, and lawful mother unto three Kings)
should be entombed, ere her corps were cold, in
the entrailes of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> dogs, should have no better buri∣al
than the dead Ass or other carion; albeit she died
in her owne royall palace. But thus the Almighties
arme sometimes reacheth greatest Princes even in
this life heavier blowes, than they can give unto
their poorest subjects. But where the blow or mat∣ter
of punishment which falls on them is much
lighter, the wound or torment may be more grie∣vous,
as was observed before, than their furie can
procure unto their despised brethren.</P>
<P>4 But neither doth the sacred relation concer∣ning
<HI>Pharaohs</HI> overthrow, or <HI>Iezabels</HI> death con∣taine
a more perspicuous, ocular demonstration
of Divine Iustice executed according to the ri∣gour
of Retaliation, than hath beene represented or
rather really acted upon a publike Stage within the
memory of some now living. The subject of this
rufull spectacle was <HI>Henry</HI> the second French King
of that name. The accident is not recorded by
Gods Spirit, yet the experiment (as unpartiall
Writers, which I take it were eye witnesses of it,
have related) is as exactly parallell to the rules of
Gods Spirit, and affords as good instruction for
<PB N="363" REF="314"/>
moderne Princes, as examples in the Sacred Sto∣ry,
did to posterity. This youthfull King in the
beginning of his reigne, had licenced others to
feed their eyes with the sight of a deadly Duell, au∣thorized
by him in favour of <HI>Vivonus</HI> to the dis∣grace
and prejudice (as the Court of France expec∣ted)
of <HI>Chabotius:</HI> whose hands notwithstanding
the Lord did strengthen, to kill the Favourite, who
after many bitter provocations had drawne him
within the Lists, more against his will, than an old
Beare is brought to the stake. The death of <HI>Vivo∣nus</HI>
though most just, doth no way excuse the bar∣barous
injustice of this King, who hath this justice
done upon him: hee had made a sport of shedding
blood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Thua∣num ad fi∣nem lib. 20.</NOTE> and he himselfe is slaine in <HI>Ludicro certami∣ne,</HI>
running at Tilt: and slaine by that hand which
had beene his instrument to apprehend those No∣ble
and religious Gentlemen, which had been late∣ly
imprisoned, and in whose misery the Court of
France did then rejoyce: and adding gall to worm∣wood,
solemnized these and the like triumphant
shewes or sportings in their sight: yet was it not
Count <HI>Montgomeries</HI> hand, but the right hand of
the Lord, which did at one and the same instant un∣ty
the Kings Bever, and guide the splinter or glance
of <HI>Montgomeries</HI> Speare into that eye, which had
beheld a Duell, that could not be determined with∣out
the death of the one or other combatant (both
being Frenchmen, &amp; his natural subjects) with such
delight, as yong Gallants do ordinary prizes, or o∣ther
like spectacles of recreation. Of <HI>Vivonus</HI> his
death, few or none but Frenchmen were eye-wit∣nesses;
<PB N="364" REF="315"/>
but of this Kings tragicall triumph, Spain &amp;
Germany with other countries were spectators by
their <HI>proxies</HI> or Ambassadors. As if the Lord would
have these thē present to cary this message to their
masters to be by thē directed to the rest of Christiā
Princes. <HI>Discite</HI> justitiā moniti &amp; non temnere divos.</P>
<Q>Take warning by this Princes Fate, Not to approve what God doth hate.</Q>
<P>God is no accepter of persons: in respect of the ex∣ecution
of his most righteous law; as is the people,
so is the Prince: his word must be alike fulfilled in
both; not only subjects that kill one another, but
Princes (be they Kings or Monarks) that authorize
murder, or suffer their subjects blood to be unjustly
spilt, by man shall their blood be spilt; if other exe∣cutioners
faile, even by the hand of their dearest

<P>5 The caveat, which from the untimely death of
this Earle, a judgement inflicted by divine justice,
not so much for this, (though this were pretended
by the Queen Mother and Dowager to take away
his life) as for other offences, hath beene elsewhere
commended to yong gallants or Princes servants,

<Q><L>Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</L>
<L>Amongst men, none more happy is than he,</L>
<L>That can his owne by others harmes foresee:</L></Q>
it might have wrought better effects for the bodi∣ly
or temporall good of his harmlesse sonnes, than
any <HI>dirge</HI> could, after his death, procure unto his
soule. Few Chronicles else will exhibit such a con∣tinued
pedigree of unhallowed policies ill successe,
as our owne Annalls of those times doe.</P>
<P>2 Vnto <HI>Richard</HI> the second and his misleaders,
it seemed a branch of plausible policy to banish his
<PB N="367" REF="316"/>
cozen (<HI>Henry</HI> of Bullinbrook) this land; the vicinity
of whose heroicall spirit was an heart-sore to this
degenerate Prince. But what successe did the
Counsell of the Lord award unto this jealous de∣vise?
<HI>Bullinbrook</HI> by his presence amongst foraine
Nations (which scarce knew him before) gained
so much honour, and so much love with the chiefe
Peeres of this Realme (which had knowne him
before) by his absence, that <HI>Richard</HI> the second
was taken in his owne feare, and his Crowne set
upon <HI>Bullingbrookes</HI> head, with generall applause.
But the lesse right he had unto it; the greater was
his jealousie, lest <HI>Richard</HI> the second, or some other
more principall stemme of the royall Stock might
take it off againe. The only meanes, as he thought,
for securing himselfe from this feare, and for set∣ling
the Crowne upon the House of Lancaster,
was, to put the poore deposed King to death;
whose errours deserved pitie and compassion from
every true English heart, if not for his Grandfa∣thers,
yet for his heroicall Fathers sake, that <HI>Gideon</HI>
which had brought so much honour to the Eng∣lish
Nation. And after <HI>Richards</HI> death, the ma∣ster-piece
of his policy was, to suffer <HI>Mortimer</HI> the
lawfull heyre unto the Duke of Clarence, and now
unto the English Crowne, to live a miserable
Captive under the enemy, who had more reason
to revenge himselfe upon the English by <HI>Mortimers</HI>
death, than <HI>Bullinbrook</HI> had to murther <HI>Richard</HI> the
second. This soule sinne of <HI>Bullinbrooke</HI> was visited
upon the third generation. His grandchilde and
heyre, <HI>Henry</HI> the sixt, a man more free from staine
<PB N="368" REF="317"/>
of guiltlesse blood, than either <HI>Richard</HI> the second
or <HI>Bullinbrooke</HI> had beene, is cruelly murthered by
<HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, a stemme of <HI>Mortimers</HI> stock,
and of <HI>Lionel</HI> Duke of Clarence. For though God
hath sworne not to punish the children for their
fathers offences; yet he hath professed it, as a rule
of his eternall justice, to visit the sinnes of fathers
upon the children. And from the equity of this
rule, many Princely Races have utterly determi∣ned
and expired, in the dayes of such Princes as
were most free from the actuall sinnes of their
Ancestors, which were the causes of their expira∣tion;
as is in other Meditations shewed at large.</P>
<P>3 But though it were just with God to visit
<HI>Bullinbrookes</HI> sinne on <HI>Henry</HI> the sixt: did <HI>Edward</HI>
the fourth commit no injustice by doing <HI>that</HI>
which God would have done? yes; he did there∣fore
most unjustly, because he did doe that, which
God would not have done by him. And therefore
the Counsell of the Lord, which overthrew the
bloody devises of <HI>Bullinbrooke</HI> for setling the
Crowne of this Kingdome on himselfe and his
heyre males, did more speedily overthrow the de∣vise
of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth. God visits his sinne in
the next generation upon his lovely and harmlesse
Sonnes in their nonage, before the <HI>devises</HI> of their
hearts were capable of any evill or mischiefe to∣wards
men, and did visit them by the hands of
their bloody uncle <HI>Richard</HI> the third, who, by their
Fathers appointment, had practised butchery up∣on
the House of Lancaster, that he might become
a more skilfull slaughterman of the House of York.

Thus did blood touch blood, and for a long time
run in the blood of his royall race, untill the issue
was staunched by the blood of the cruell Tyrant

<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S it is generally more safe to

the iniquity of times present:
so to <HI>trace</HI> the <HI>prints</HI> of Divine

to mens enormities, will be lesse offen∣sive,
whilest this search is made abroad, than it
would be, were it or the like made neerer hand, or
at home. Yet were it well, and it might goe much
better with this Land and People, if every <HI>ancient,</HI>
every <HI>noble,</HI> or private Family, specially such as
have had much dealings with other men, would
make the like search within their owne <HI>pale.</HI> Few
Families there be of greater note, but either have
or might have had undoubted experience of some
visitations upon them, according to the rule of
<PB N="370" REF="318"/>
<HI>Counterpassion,</HI> within two or three descents. That
most private men doe not finde experiments of this
rule in themselves, <HI>this</HI> falls out for want of obser∣vation,
or because they keepe not a true Register
of their owne doings or sufferings. No man can
plead any personall exemption from this <HI>Canon,</HI>
by reason of his righteousnesse or integrity; none
can altogether secure his posterity, that some one
or other of his sinnes shall not bee visited upon
them. Nor can it justly be accounted any taxe or
prejudice, unto any Family, to undergoe with pa∣tience,
that mulct, which the righteous Iudge hath
laid upon them. To murmure or grudge at our
owne or others visitation, whose welfare we wish
or tender, is blame-worthy with God and good
men. And albeit this <HI>distemper</HI> be not (onely) me∣ritorious
of death; yet is it this, which for the most
part brings a necessity of dying upon such, as have
otherwise deserved death, whether bodily or spiri∣tuall.
For no man, which with patience and humi∣lity,
acknowledgeth the equity or justice of his pu∣nishment,
as it proceeds from God, but will, in
some measure, recall himselfe, or inhibit his pro∣gresse
in that sinne, the smart of whose punishment
he feeles. And unto every degree of sincere revo∣cation
or repentance, some degree of mitigation is
awarded. The best meanes for instilling the Spirit
either of meeknesse or patience, in suffering for of∣fences
past, or of <HI>feare</HI> to offend in the like kinde
againe, will be to take the punishments or cor∣rections
of Gods Saints, into serious conside∣ration.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="318"/>
2▪ If for the manifestation of Gods justice, it must
be done unto his dearest Saints, as they have done
unto others, either whilest they themselves were
his enemies, or made him their enemy, after their
reconcilement had beene wrought: what may
they looke for in the end which still continue ad∣versaries
to the truth. <HI>David</HI> was a man after
Gods owne heart (excepting the case of <HI>Vriah,)</HI>
yet not therefore free from disgrace, danger, or
harme, after the Prophet had solemnly <HI>denounced
his pardon; Thy sinnes are forgiven thee:</HI> In respect
of the adultery committed by <HI>Bathsheba, Absolons</HI>
offence against his Father <HI>David,</HI> was much grea∣ter
than <HI>Davids</HI> had beene against <HI>Vriah. The one
was done in</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 16. 21.</NOTE> <HI>secret, the other in the open Sunne.</HI> The
death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 12. 12</NOTE> if not of <HI>Bathshebaes</HI> childe, yet of his Son
<HI>Absolon,</HI> was more bitter unto <HI>David,</HI> than his
owne death could have beene. So much he con∣fesseth
himselfe, and testifies the truth of his con∣fession
with his teares. <HI>And the King was moved,
and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept;
and as he went, thus hee said, O my sonne Absolom,
my sonne, my sonne Absolom: would God I had dyed
for thee, O Absolom my sonne, my sonne. 2 King. 18.
33.</HI> So that here was more than a full <HI>retaliation,</HI> if
we consider his offence, as it had reference onely
unto <HI>Vriah.</HI> For one mans life is as much worth as
anothers, and <HI>Vriah</HI> lost but one life, <HI>David</HI> was
to suffer the losse of two. Yet this is not all that the
Prophet had to say to him for this offence; for so
he saith, <HI>2 Sam. 12. 9. Thou hast killed Vriah the
Hittite with the sword, &amp; hast taken his wife to be thy
<PB N="372" REF="319"/>
wife, and hast slaine him with the sword of the chil∣dren
of Ammon. Now therefore the sword shall never
depart from thine house, because thou hast despised
me, and taken the wife of Vrias the Hittite to bee
thy wife.</HI></P>
<P>3 But when it is said that <HI>David was a man af∣ter
Gods owne heart, excepting the matter of Vriah,</HI>
this exception includes, if not an interruption in
the bond of grace, by which he had beene intirely
linked unto Gods favour, yet some wound or
breach in the estate of his <HI>wonted</HI> favour and <HI>liking</HI>
with God. And no marvell, if that sinne which
made this breach, and for a time removed the <HI>fence</HI>
of Gods favourable protection, were visited upon
his person and upon his posterity. But are the sins
which men commit, whilst they are Gods enemies
thus visited upon any, after their full admission in∣to
the estate and favour of Gods sonnes, or whilest
the <HI>bond</HI> of their <HI>reconciliation</HI> remaines unwoun∣ded
and entire? We doe not reade of any grosser
sinnes committed by Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> after our Saviour
had effectually called him. We may without breach
of charity, perswade our selves, that he was as free
from that time forward, from wronging any man,
Iew or Gentile, as <HI>Samuel</HI> had beene from wrong∣ing
Israel. Saint <HI>Stephen,</HI> at his death, prayed for
him, not against him. But though <HI>hee</HI> freely for∣gave
him, yet will not the righteous Iudge suffer
the wrongs, which he had done, unto this blessed
Martyr, passe without some solemn remembrance.
Those which stoned Saint <HI>Stephen,</HI> laid downe
their garments at <HI>Pauls</HI> feet; and his willingnesse
<PB N="373" REF="319"/>
to take charge of them, argues he was consenting
to his death:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saint <HI>Paul</HI> acknow∣ledgeth his consent unto Saint <HI>Stephens</HI> death, ei∣ther as ex∣presly gi∣ven by him or as inclu∣ded in his willingness to keep the garments of such as stoned him to death.</NOTE> so I thinke was not <HI>Barnabas.</HI> And
for this reason, we doe not reade that <HI>Barnabas</HI> was
stoned, as <HI>Paul</HI> was, by the Iewes which came from
Antioch and Iconium unto Lystra and Derbe; al∣beit
both had beene alike offensive for preaching
the Gospell at Iconium; where the same<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Acts 14. 5, 6.</NOTE> vio∣lence
had beene likewise joyntly attempted against
both. Vpon the <HI>matter</HI> then betwixt Saint <HI>Paul</HI>
and Saint <HI>Stephen</HI> (albeit Saint <HI>Stephen</HI> make him∣selfe
no partie) this is the onely difference; <HI>Stephen
dyed</HI> by the hands of his persecutors, so did not
<HI>Paul.</HI> Yet, it seemes, the righteous Lord suffered
these malignant Iewes to doe as much unto Saint
<HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts 22. 20.</HI> And when the blood of thy mar∣tyr <HI>Stephen</HI> was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the rayment of them that slew him:</NOTE> as had beene done by his consent unto Saint
<HI>Stephen,</HI> even as much as they themselves desired,
which did despite him no lesse than their countri∣men
and brethren in iniquity, had done S. <HI>Stephen.
For they drew him out of the Citie, supposing he had
beene dead. Howbeit as the Disciples stood round a∣bout
him, he rose up and came into the Citie, and the
next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. Acts
14. 19, 20. Paul</HI> (wee may conclude) was more
extraordinarily preserved by God, not lesse rigo∣rously
dealt withall by the Iewes, than Saint <HI>Ste∣phen</HI>
had beene. That he was extraordinarily pre∣served,
we have reason to beleeve, because he was
appointed to be a patterne of suffring more vio∣lence
than this, from the time of his calling. That
he was appointed to bee a patterne of suffering e∣vills,
we must beleeve, because God himselfe doth
expresly testifie as much, at the time of his calling,
<PB N="374" REF="320"/>
unto <HI>Ananius,</HI> who was to ratifie his calling so
farre as the notice of it concerned the visible
Church. For when <HI>Ananias</HI> did demurre upon
his admission into the Church, <HI>The Lord said unto
him, goe thy way: for he is a chosen vessell unto mee,
to beare my name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and
the children of Israel. For I will shew him, how great
things he must suffer for my names sake. Act. 9. 15, 16</HI>
And yet (perhaps) Saint <HI>Paul</HI> had not been made
such a spectacle to the world of <HI>suffrance</HI> or perse∣cutions,
unlesse he had persecuted more than Saint
<HI>Stephen;</HI> unlesse hee had made havocke of the
Church.</P>
<P>4 It is not probable, that these Iewes had any
minde to punish <HI>Paul</HI> for his offence against <HI>Ste∣phen;</HI>
of which if they had any notice or remem∣brance,
this would have made them more ready to
pardon him, for preaching the Gospel at this time,
than to put him to death for persecuting such, as
had preached it before. Their resolution to stone
him, at this time, rather than beat him with rods,
as their usuall manner was, argues that their wills,
though otherwise free (more than enough) to doe
mischiefe, were, by the all-seeing Providence, de∣termined
or guided in the manner of practising
mischiefe. To say, <HI>the Author of beeing,</HI> and <HI>Foun∣taine
of goodnesse,</HI> did instill this <HI>spirit</HI> of fury and
malice, into the hearts of these Iewes, or did, by
any decree, absolutely necessitate them to con∣ceive
so full a measure of mischiefe, as now posses∣sed
them, were (I take it) to swerve from the <HI>forme
of wholsome words,</HI> &amp; would give <HI>some</HI> advantage to
<PB N="375" REF="320"/>
the adversaries of truth. It was Sathan &amp; thēselves,
which had charged their brests with this extraor∣dinary
measure of fury and malice. But these, be∣ing
so overcharged, as that without some vent or
other they were ready to burst; <HI>He,</HI> who is as well
the supreme moderator of mens thoughts and re∣solutions,
as Iudge of their actions, did not onely
permit or suffer, but direct, appoint, and order, that
they should <HI>exonerate</HI> or <HI>discharge</HI> their furious
malice upon Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> not upon <HI>Barnabas;</HI> and
upon Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> by that peculiar kinde of vio∣lence,
which now they practise, rather than by
any other, unto which they were more accu∣stomed.</P>

amendment, will fall upon us. It is a saying a∣mongst
the later Iewes, <HI>Volvitur meritum in diem

pursue the fact which deserves it, nor instantly
overtake the party which committed such fact; yet
it resteth not, <HI>but roules</HI> about untill it meet with
them or their posterity at the same point of time,
wherein it was deserved. The Temple by their

day of the same month, upon which <HI>Moses</HI> had bro∣ken
the Tables. Though so it were <HI>de facto,</HI> yet
this <HI>revolution</HI> infers not this destruction to be fa∣tall.
It might have beene, at both times, preven∣ted,
had that generation wherein it hapned, beene
as zealous of Gods glory, as <HI>Moses</HI> had been; or
had they held idolatry or hypocrisie in as great de∣testation
as <HI>Moses</HI> had done. Some foraigne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide Thu∣anum.</NOTE> wri∣ters
have observed, that the hope of this Land,
whilest he lived, <HI>Edward</HI> the sixt, did dye upon the
selfe same day (after revolution of some yeares) in
which his Father had put Sir <HI>Thomas Moore</HI> to
death, a man otherwise faulty, yet so true a pattern
of morall justice, as it cannot seeme strange, if the
righteous Iudge did take speciall notice of King
<HI>Henries</HI> dealing with him, and insert the day of his
<HI>death</HI> in his everlasting Calendar, to be after <HI>signed</HI>
with the untimely death of King <HI>Henries</HI> only Son.
How the sins of parents are often punished in their
harmlesse, or lesse harmfull posterity, is elsewhere
discussed. I will not interrupt this Discourse, with
any digression concerning <HI>Divine equity</HI> in this
point, nor with any Apology for these curious ob¦servations,

matters of fact, or punishments answerable to of∣fences,

the Romans and the Corinthians, or Achai∣ans,
managed by <HI>Metellus</HI> and <HI>Critolaus.</HI> The Hi∣story,
though briefe (as being but an appendix of
his intended Topography) is fraught with many
remarkable circumstances, pointing out unto us a
Divine Provid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce; of which, two (concerning the
selected band of Arcadia put to flight, but with
more honour than the rest of <HI>Critolaus</HI> army) are
more specially parallell to the rule of retaliation.
These Arcadians after the foile, retyred safe (to
the number of a thousand) unto <HI>Elatea,</HI> a City of
the Phocenses; where they found <HI>good welcome</HI> at
the first, upon some <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermes</HI> of ancient confederacy
or alliance. But the sudden noise of <HI>Critolaus</HI> and
his companies overthrow, dissolved the links of
former amity. The poore Arcadians were com∣manded,
by the State of Phocis, forthwith to re∣linquish
Elatea; and, in their returne to Pelopon∣nesus,
meeting unexpectedly with <HI>Metellus</HI> forces,
were all slaine by the Romans, in the selfe same
place, in which their fore-elders had forsaken the
Grecian <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>guers,</HI> or con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>derates against <HI>Philip</HI>
of Macedon. Honest Countrimen see Meteors
or other appearances, as perfectly as Philosophers
do; but they often erre in guessing at the <HI>place</HI> or
<HI>subject</HI> where in the <HI>appearance</HI> is made. Thus many
imagine the Sunne to be reddish, in a foggy mor∣ning;
when as the rednesse is in the ayre. So did
this heathen Antiquary, expresly and fully discern
the power of Divine Iustice in this event; from the
circumstance of the persons (a race of truce-brea∣kers)
and from the place of their discomfiture. His
<PB N="380" REF="323"/>
eyesight or apprehension herein, was as cleare as
any Christians. Wherein then consists his error?
In attributing this award of Divine Iustice unto
the Gods of Greece. But did any <HI>Southsayer</HI> of
Greece foretell, that the fathers <HI>breach of truce</HI>
should be thus visited upon their children as <HI>Elias</HI>
foretold, that <HI>the dogs should lap Ahabs blood, and
eate Iezebel and their childrens flesh,</HI> in the same
place where they had lapt the blood of <HI>Naboth,</HI>
whom <HI>Iezebel</HI> had caused to be stoned to death?
The identity of Iustice done upon divers people
and Nations, rightly argues that the God of Israel,
did then rule and <HI>execute judgement unto the ends
of the world;</HI> although he did not deale so with any
Nation, <HI>as he did with Israel; neither had the Hea∣then
knowledge of his Lawes,</HI> much lesse such distinct
foreknowledge of his judgements or visitations as
was usuall in Israel; unlesse it were in some cases

of this prodigious fearefull accident. And
if <HI>consecration dinners</HI> were then in use, (as doubt∣lesse
they were, when Kings sonnes and brothers
thought it no scorne to be consecrated Bishops)
<HI>Respondent ultima primis; Strachyquaz</HI> did better
brooke his name after his death, than at his birth

day. The realitie answering to his name,
and portended by it, he left behinde him: The din∣ner

<HI>a banquet of dread or horrour</HI> to all spectators, a
feast of whose d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ies few (I thinke) would eate.
And thus much doth the name <HI>Strachyquaz</HI> in the
Bohemia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> language import; A name imposed up∣on
this unfortunate person, at his birth, in trium∣phant
memorie of that bloody <HI>banquet,</HI> unto
which his father <HI>Bolestaus</HI> the first, had invited
<HI>Wenceslaus</HI> the King his Elder brother, with intent
to murther him, as he did; taking opportunitie to
accomplish this impietie, in the Temple of God,
where this King (afterwards Sainted) was at his
midnights devotions.</P>
<P>5. To sit as <HI>Coroners</HI> upon the soules of men de∣ceased,
is a thing which I have ever misliked,
though sometimes practised by men, otherwise of
deserved esteeme. And whosoever in this case will
take upon him to sit as Iudge, my request shall bee
not to serve upon the Iury. Yet if my opinion
were in this particular demanded, <Q>[Whether this

man dying (as the story presumes) of a Deuill, the
manner of his death were any certaine progno∣sticke,
or probable presumption of his damnati∣on]</Q>
my verdit should goe <HI>in mitiorem partem,</HI>
That, thus to dye of a Devill, unlesse his former
life had beene devillish, (which the historie
no way intimates) doth no more argue his dam∣nation,
than the untimely death of <HI>Ieroboams</HI>
Child, did argue him to have beene guiltie of his
Parents actuall sinnes; in the manner of whose
death; notwithstanding, as wel as in <HI>Strachyquaz</HI> his
tragicall end, the sinnes of their Parents were re∣markeably
visited, according to that rule of Iu∣stice,
which now we treat of, that is, by way of
counterpassion, in respect, if not of <HI>time,</HI> yet of
the places wherein they were visited. That <HI>Iero∣boams</HI>
child dyed in Gods favour, the text instructs
us. 1 King. 14. 13. <HI>All</HI> Israel shall mourne for him
and bury him: for hee onely of Ieroboam shall come
to the grave, because in him there is found some good
thing toward the Lord God of Israel, &amp;c.</P>
<P>6 But to returne to <HI>Strachyquaz:</HI> the maner of
whose death, (as is apparent) was more fearefull
and prodigious, yet no signe of damnation. For
as there is (vates praeteritorum &amp; futurorum) <HI>a
branch of prophesie in discovering times past,</HI> as well
as events to come; so there may bee, and oft-times
are prodigious and portentuous accidents, which
point at nothing (de futuro, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a retro) <HI>which looke
backwards, not forwards.</HI> The best use or <HI>significa∣tion</HI>
of this fearefull disaster was to advertise the
present generation, and their successors, that the
<PB N="383" REF="324"/>
execrable and sacrilegious murder, committed by
<HI>Boleslaus,</HI> father to <HI>Strachyquaz,</HI> was not <HI>expiated</HI>
as yet, but to be vis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d upon more generations
without heartie repentance and confession of this
wicked usurpers, and his complices sinnes, where∣with
the land of <HI>Boheme</HI> had beene polluted. The
first borne of Egypt, was slaine for their fathers
offences against the infant males of the He∣brewes;
And <HI>Strachyquaz</HI> dyed this fearefull
death by the visitation of his fathers sinnes upon
him? But he might (perhaps) have lived much
longer, and have dyed in peace, had he lived accor∣ding
to that rule whose profession hee had taken
upon him; that is, if hee had continued (as hee
once resolved to doe) a true p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nitentiarie, and
not affected to be a prelate. For, if God would
not suffer his Temple to be built by <HI>David</HI> (a man
otherwise after his owne heart) onely because hee
had beene a man of warre: wee may, from the
morall Analogie of this sacred embleme, collect
that the same holy Lord would not suffer the
sonne of that malignant cruell Pagan Fratricide,
which had imbrued his hands in the blood of his
Priests, and murthered his annointed King in the
holy place, to beare rule over his house, or
Church. This his unseasonable ambitious humor,
without any other actuall remarkable crime, might
in Divine Iustice exact some print of the supreame
Iudges indignation. All this (notwithstanding)
being granted; doth not prove, there was no good
thing found in the partie, that was thus punished,
as well as in <HI>Ieroboams</HI> child. It was a fauour to
<PB N="384" REF="325"/>
the one, that he dyed in peace, though in his infan∣cie,
and it might be some matter of honour or fa∣vour
to the other, that he had Christian buriall in
the Church, wherein hee died; and that hee was
not made a <HI>prey</HI> to the fowles of the ayre. But this
wee speake skeptique wise, what became of <HI>Stra∣chyquaz</HI>
after his fearefull end, we leave it for the
eternall Iudge to determine.</P>
<P>7 Whatsoever became of him, the death of his
grandmother <HI>Drahomira,</HI> was much more terri∣ble:
as she had lived, so she dyed, a malitious blas∣phemous
Pagan; a cruell bloody step-dame to
Christs infant Church, in that Kingdome. The
storie (I know) will unto many seeme strange,
yet in my observation very capable of credit; if we
consider the exigence of those times, and the then
desperate state of <HI>Boheme.</HI> Christianity and paga∣nisme
lay then at stake, whether should be entertai∣ned,
whether expelled: the Pagans by their uncon∣feionable
policie (which aymes at nothing but
some private end, alwayes readie to hazard what∣soever
lyes within their levell, rather then misse of
it) had so cunningly played the foregame, and, by
their bloody plots, removed so many principall
men out of the way, that there was no possibilitie
left, save onely in the Almighties <HI>immediate hand,</HI>
to make any thing of the aftergame. Now in case
of such desperate extremities (specially when they
happen during the infancie of any particular
Church) it cannot to mee seeme incredible, if the
good spirit of God doe <HI>out vy</HI> those prodigious
cruelties, which Sathan deviseth against the Saints,
<PB N="385" REF="325"/>
by sudden miraculous executions upon their A∣ctors,
Sathans instruments. The Tragedy of <HI>Dra∣homira</HI>

whereby they have reproached my people, and magni∣fied
themselves against their border. <HI>Therefore,</HI> as
I live saith the Lord of Hosts the God of Israel, surely
<PB N="392" REF="329"/>
Moab shall bee as Sodome, and the children of Am∣mon
as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles and
saltpies, and a perpetuall desolation, the residue of my
people shall spoile them, and the remnant of my people
shall possesse them. This shall they have for their
pride, because they have reproched and magnified
themselves against the people of the Lord of hoasts.
The Lord will bee terrible unto them: for hee
will famish all the gods of the earth, and men shall
worship him, every one from his place, even all the
Iles of the heathen. <HI>So farre wide were Moab and
Edom in their divinations, when they said,</HI> the
house of Iudah is like unto all the Heathen. <HI>(Ezek. 25.
8.) that all the yles of the Gentiles were to be∣come,
such as the house of Iudah had beene, that
is, professed worshippers of the true God, who had
now appointed to make himselfe known, to all the
world, by his judgements upon these proud Hea∣thens,
which for their blasphemies have now for∣feited
their nationall interest in this blessing here
promised to the Iles of the Gentiles, for they cea∣sed
to bee Nations.</HI></P>
<P>5 Whiles Gods plagues are thus fitly suited to
the matter or manner of mens sins: the longer the
punishments themselves are delayed, the surer do∣cument
they may afford unto the observant, that
there is a watchfull eye of an alseeing Providence,
without whose presence no fact can bee commit∣ted;
an attentive eare which never shuts, alwayes
readie, alwayes able to take notice of every word
that can bee spoken, and to register proud blasphe∣mous
boastings in the indelible characters of an
<PB N="393" REF="329"/>
everlasting booke. It is an observation worth the
noting, which a learned Commentator hath made
upon the place last cited out of <HI>Zephaniah.</HI> [Ver∣bum
audivi suam Emphasim habet] <HI>These words</HI>
[I have heard] <HI>are emphaticall,</HI> They intimate as
much unto us, as if in the name of the Lord, the
Prophet had said, <Q>Though Moab saw not me, yet
I heard him (for I was present with him) when
hee pronounced the coast of Israel waste. And
what I heard I cannot forget, nor will I forgive:
according to his intentions against Israel at the
time appointed, will I doe to him.</Q></P>
<P>6 The cryers of Edom against Ierusalem when
Ierusalem was drowned with her childrens teares,
(which yet could not quench the fire then kindled
in her pallaces) were more bitter then the cry of
Edom and Ammon against Iudah had beene.
<HI>[Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.]</HI>
The scope at which their wishes did ayme, was
that Ierusalem and the Temple, might so be demo∣lished
that they should never be raised againe. And
according to this scantling of their malicious
wish, the Psalmist proportions that imprecation
against Edom, which in the issue proved a Prophe∣sie:
<HI>Remember O Lord the Children of Edom, in
the day of Ierusalem, who said, rase it, rase it, &amp;c.</HI>
The more full expression or ratification of this im∣plicit
prophesie, we have in another Prophet, who
lived about eighty yeares after the Edomites had
uttered that accursed cry against Ierusalem: <HI>I have
loved you saith the Lord, yet ye say, wherein hast thou
loved us? was not</HI> Esau Iacobs <HI>brother, saith the
<PB N="394" REF="330"/>
Lord? yet I loved</HI> Iacob, <HI>and I hated</HI> Esau, <HI>and layd
his mountaines and his heritage waste for the Dra∣gons
of the wildernesse. Whereas Edom saith, wee are
impoverished, wee will returne and build the desolate
places: Thus saith the Lord of hoasts, they shall
build but I will throw downe, and they shall call them,
the border of wickednesse, and the people against
whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.</HI> Mal. 1.
2, &amp;c. Some good expositors have from the lit∣terall
sense of this place collected, that Edom, not
long after the Babilonish captivitie, did utterly
cease to be a Nation. And whether any of <HI>Esaus</HI>
posteritie bee left upon the face of the Earth, some
have questioned, and (to my remembrance) deter∣mined
for the Negative. These (whatsoever be∣sides)
were the Effects of Gods professed hate to
<HI>Esau.</HI> But there is a seed or Nation yet on earth,
which shall at the time appointed be made parta∣kers
of his blessing so often promised to Ierusa∣lem,
and enjoy the fruites of his professed love to
<HI>Iacob.</HI></P>
<P>7 These Prophetical passages cōcerning <HI>Ammon,
Moab,</HI> and <HI>Edom,</HI> afford many usefull speculations,
did either these times afford us freedome, or this
place opportunitie to dilate upon them. But lea∣ving
the rest unto the juditious Readers owne col∣lection,
out of the seuerall Expositors of the places
by mee quoted, I shall onely request him to take
this one admonition from mee, <Q>[Not to rejoyce,
much lesse to triumph in any others calamitie, al∣though
hee knew it to be the speciall award of di∣vine
justice, or a condigne punishment purpose∣ly
<PB N="395" REF="330"/>
suted by the All seeing Providence to some
peculiar sinne.]</Q> <HI>Edom</HI> and <HI>Babylon</HI> knew that <HI>Ie∣rusalem</HI>
and <HI>Iudah</HI> were justly punished for their
offences against the righteous Lord, and them∣selves
to be the appointed executioners of his ju∣stice:
yet all this doth no way excuse them, for
their presumption in the manner of execution. <HI>My
people have beene lost sheepe, their Shepheards have
caused them to goe astray, &amp;c. All that found them
have devoured them, and their adversaries said, Wee
offend not, because they have sinned against the Lord,
the habitation of Iustice, even the Lord, the hope of
their Fathers.</HI> Yet all this acquits not <HI>Babylon</HI> from
guilt of Gods judgments in spoyling Gods people:
for so it followes; <HI>Remove out of the midst of Ba∣bylon,
and goe forth out of the Land of the Caldeans,
and be as the hee-goats before the flockes. Ier. 50.
6, 7, 8.</HI> And againe, <HI>Verse 10, 11. Caldea shall be a
spoile; all that spoyle her shall be satisfied, saith the
Lord, because yee were glad, because yee rejoyced, ô yee
destroyers of mine heritage.</HI> Not onely the practise,
or reall intention of mischiefe, but the delight, or
joy, which men take in the calamitie of others by
whomsoever it bee procured or intended, doth
make men lyable to the rule of Retaliation.
For every degree of delight or joy in others
misery, includes a breach of that fundamentall
Law of equitie, [Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri
ne feceris] <HI>VVhatsoever wee would not have done
vnto our selves, wee should bee vnwilling to doe,
or to see done vnto others.]</HI> And all visitation by
the rule of Counterpassion, as it concernes
<PB N="396" REF="331"/>
wrongs intended or done by one man to ano∣ther,
is but a resarcination or making up of that
breach, which hath beene made in the fundamen∣tall
Law of equitie, that is, <HI>of doing as wee would be
done unto.</HI></P>
<P>8 But besides the wrongs which Potentates or
priuate men practise upon, or intend to others,
there is a peculiar disposition, which makes men li∣able
to the iudgements which they feare, or at least
hasten the execution of iudgements otherwise de∣served.
And that is a tempting God by the curi∣ositie
of superstitious feare, or by dissimulation.
An instance to this purpose (and that is all which at
this time I meane to use) we have in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 King. 14. 1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>Ieroboam</HI> and
his <HI>wife,</HI> who went disguised unto the Prophet <HI>Ahi∣jah,</HI>
(as if it had beene unto some cunning man) to
know what should become of her young sonne <HI>A∣bijah</HI>
then visited with sicknesse. The doome or pu∣nishment
doth so well befit the temptation, that
the circumstances of the time and place, &amp;c. wher∣in
the discovery of her dissembling was by the spi∣rit
revealed unto the Prophet, may seeme to have
suggested unto him the time of the Childes death,
with other circumstances. The Prophets eies were
dimme, that he could not discerne her by sight, but
the Lord so supplyed this defect, that hee knew
her by the sound of her feete, before shee came
in at the doore. <HI>The</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">vers. 5. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Lord said unto Ahijah,
Behold the wife of Ieroboam commeth to aske a thing
of thee for her sonne, for hee is sicke. Thus and
thus shalt thou say unto her, for it shall bee when
shee commeth in, that shee will faine herselfe to bee
<PB N="397" REF="331"/>
another woman. And it was so, when Ahijah heard
the sound of her feete as shee came in at the doore,
that hee said; Come in thou wife of Ieroboam, why
fainest thou thy selfe to be another? for I am sent
unto thee with heavie tidings, &amp;c. Arise thou there∣fore,
get thee to thine owne house; and when thy feet
enter into the Citie, the childe shall dye, &amp;c. And</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vers. 17.</NOTE>Ieroboams wife arose, and departed and came <HI>to
Tirzah: and when shee came to the threshold of the
doore, the childe dyed.</HI> But of that peculiar branch
of Divine Providence, which takes men in the
nets of their owne superstitious feare or imagina∣tions,
wee shall have fitter occasion to speake in
the Treatise of Prodigies or Divine Fore-war∣nings.</P>

of Gods remarkable judgements mani∣fested

<P>1 <SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>ID GOD alwayes fit his
plagues to exorbitant or
out-crying sinnes imme∣diately
after their com∣mission,
men would sus∣pect
that hee did distrust
his memory. Should hee
deferre all as long as hee
doth sundry, for many
yeares, and some speciall ones till the second,
third, or fourth generation; this would tempt
us in the <HI>interim</HI> to thinke hee tooke just notice
of none: <HI>Because sentence against an evill worke
is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the

Ecclesiastes 8. 11. But the same Preacher to
counterpoyze the sway of this inbred tempta∣tion,
addeth; <HI>Though a sinner doe evill an hun∣dred
times, and God prolongeth his dayes, yet I
know that it shall bee well with them that feare the
Lord, and doe reverence before him. But it shall
not be so well to the wicked; neyther shall hee pro∣long
his dayes, hee shall bee like a shadow, because he
feareth not before God,</HI> Verse 12, 13. Besides this
<PB N="399" REF="332"/>
authoritie of the Preacher (concerning the deter∣minate
extent or meaning of whose words. I will
not here dispute) wee have a propheticall gene∣rall
Rule, which never faileth in it selfe, nor to
the apprehension of the observant. How migh∣tily
soever iniquitie abounds in any Citie, Land,
or Countrey, <HI>yet the just Lord is in the midst there∣of:
hee will not doe iniquitie. Every morning doth
hee bring his judgement to light, hee faileth not;
but the unjust knoweth no shame.</HI> Zephaniah 3.
vers. 5.</P>
<P>2 But these sacred as well as other Maximes,
have their peculiar subjects, in which they are
more remarkably verified at out time then at an∣other.
The extraordinarie documents of Gods
punitive justice, had beene no doubt more rise in
<HI>Iudah</HI> about <HI>Zephanies</HI> time, than in former ages.
And amongst moderne Christian States, none
have beene so fertile as the Kingdome of <HI>Hunga∣rie,</HI>
since it stood upon the same termes with the
<HI>Turke,</HI> that <HI>Iudah</HI> in <HI>Zephanies</HI> dayes did with the
<HI>Chaldaean.</HI> I will give the Reader onely a hint
or taste from one or two particulars, to set his me∣ditations
(if it shall please him) on working to
observe the like out of the Histories of that Coun∣trey.</P>
<P>3 Amongst all the persons of better place,
or same mentioned in those Histories, could there
bee found but tenne (as for ought I know there
may bee more) whose Legends eyther in, respect
of wrongs done to others by them, or of wrongs
<PB N="390" REF="333"/>
done to them by others, might afford so many
pregnant proofes of Divine Retaliation, as doth
the Legend of Fryer <HI>George</HI> or (as <HI>Thuanus</HI> calls
him) <HI>Martinusius:</HI> the Prophets Proposition
<HI>[Every morning hee bringeth forth judgement to
light]</HI> might by exact Logicall Induction be pro∣ved
to have beene universally true in that King∣dome
for more than tenne yeares together. This
man by his valorous wit had advanced himselfe
from a Turne-spit, or Cole-carrier to be a Car∣dinall:
otherwise for his temporall dignitie and
authoritie, full Peere to most Princes of Chri∣stendome;
no way inferiour to many Kings, save
onely in want of Royall Title. In the height of
his prosperitie he had entertained one <HI>Marc An∣thony
de Ferraro,</HI> Secretarie to <HI>Castaldie,</HI> Lieu∣tenant
to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Emperour in those parts,
as a secret Intelligencer to betray his Master, but
was in the end miserably betrayed by him. For
this Assassinate (<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Hac vero arte conju∣rati in Ge∣orgij cubi∣culum irru∣perūt: Mar∣cus Anto∣nius Ferra∣rius, Castal do ab Epi∣stolis homo prostitutae audacia jam abaliquo tempore tantam cum Georgio familiaritatem contraxerat, dum se berum pro∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re simulat, ut cubiculorijs ejus proptereà factus noti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, quavis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ad ipsum ad∣miteretur. <HI>Thuanus lib. 9.</HI></NOTE> <HI>(Ferrarius)</HI> having at all houres

<PB N="401" REF="333"/>
This Fryer or Cardinall <HI>(Marlinusius)</HI> had plaid
the Hypocrite (as was then presumed) with his
Christian neighbours, being either in affection
to his owne country, or for his private ends, more
engaged to the Turke. And Captaine <HI>Lopez,</HI> with
the Spanish Harquebuzes designed by <HI>Ferdinand</HI>
and <HI>Castaldie</HI> to assist Marquesse <HI>Pallavicino</HI> for ef∣fecting
this plot, were permitted, without suspi∣tion
of hostility into the Castle, being apparelled
in Turkish weeds or long gownes, under which
they covered their Harquebuzes, and such other
armour, as they thought expedient for this feat.</P>
<P>4 His death though bloody and cruell in the
highest degree did not so deeply affect unpartiall
hearts, either with pity toward him, or with indig∣nation
at his murderers, as the strange and unusu∣all
neglect of his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">And so this assem∣bly was discomfi∣ted, every man ta∣king his neerest &amp; safest way, leaving their Ma∣sters dead body to be a prey and spoile unburied.

which either through partialitie or credulitie, have
professed a delectation of his tyrannicall life, upon
higher termes than hee deserved. His enemies it
seemes, were so carefull to effect their intended
plot, and his friends so affrighted with his sudden
disaster, that his dead bodie remained many daies
together above ground, unburied, or uncovered,
with the blood frozen upon it; so stiffe with cold
<PB N="402" REF="334"/>
that it might rather seeme to have beene a blurred
or besmeared statue of stone, or marble, than a dead
man. A fit relique for a sacrilegious Palace; such
was the Castle wherein hee was murthered, for
whose erection he had demolished an ancient
Church and Monasterie of religious persons. And
whether it were, that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Si natura negat, facit indignatio versum.</NOTE> indignation doth some∣times
make men as well peeces of Prophets, as of

<L>As if his house, should his Sepulcher bee.</L></Q>
<P>5 Though Gods judgements upon this man
were (as all his are) most just; yet were they un∣justly
done by these Assassinates. They were Gods
instruments, but the devills agents, in acting this
plot: and by doing to this Cardinall as hee had
done to others, they themselves become lyable, in
this life, to the rigour of the indispensable Law,
<HI>As they have done to him, so must it be done to them.</HI>
Gods will is fulfilled upon them, as the devills will
was fulfilled by them. Hee was a murderer from
<PB N="403" REF="334"/>
the beginning, and they are his sonnes. And,
though they afterwards disperse themselves
throughout divers Kingdomes or Nations, yet the
cry of this Cardinals blood doth still pursue them.
Which way soever they wander; the Almighties
<HI>net</HI> is spred out for them, and being still hunted af∣ter
by Gods judgements, all of them are driven at
length into it. <HI>This wee are sure of</HI> (saith the fore∣mentioned

<HI>that all those which were Actors of his death, in time
fell into great misfortunes. The Marquesse</HI> Sforce,

<PB N="404" REF="335"/>
this fact was there, wherein <HI>Ferdinand</HI> did not
lose soting either in Hungary or in Transylvania;
wherein the Turke did not sensibly incroach upon
Christendome, and gaine advantage against Chri∣stians?
The just comparison betweene the misery
of Iudah in <HI>Zedechiaes</HI> dayes, and of Hungary un∣der

these two noble Kings and their adherents misca∣riage,

Treatises. Onely to shut vp this exemplification
of the Prophets assertion verified in peculiar sort
in Hungary: what example of Divine Iustice, ei∣ther
more pregnant or more durable was ever
manifested in Iudea, than was to bee seene every
morning for more then twenty yeares together in
the fields of Moacz, where the <HI>horse</HI> and his <HI>royall
rider</HI> (King <HI>Lewis)</HI> found a miserable grave before
they were quite dead; but where the bones of such
as were slaine in that unfortunate battaile, lay un∣buryed
in such abundance as did exhibit a wofull
spectacle to every Christian passengers eye, from
the yeare 1526. untill the time of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Quidex eo speran∣dum sit, sa∣tis eum do∣cent superi∣orum tem∣porum ex∣empla, ac∣ceptae ad Nicopoli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, &amp; ad Var∣nam clades, absentes{que} adhuc <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>i∣bus caeserū Christiano∣rum ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Busbeq. epist. 4.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Busbequius</HI>

just cause to insert that lamentation into their Li∣turgie,

have they given to be meate unto the fowles
of the heaven, the flesh of thy Saints unto the beasts
of the earth, their blood have they shed like water,
&amp; there was none to burie them.</HI> Ps. 79. 2, 3. The pitti∣full
women of Iudea did eate their Children, when
<HI>Titus</HI> besieged Ierusalem. The women of Hun∣garie
(no lesse mercifull (as may be presumed) than
other Christian women are, buried their Chil∣dren
alive, lest their timorous outcryes might be∣wray
the place of their abode, or latitation, when
<HI>Soliman</HI> and his <HI>furious</HI> helhounds did so greedily
hunt after their lives. The people of Hungary
would not take example from the miseries which
had befallen Iudea, nor breake off those sinnes
which brought this miserie upon them: GOD
grant the Prophets and Seers of this kingdome,
eyes to discerne, and this whole people, one and
other, patient hearts to heare those sinnes, whe∣ther
of practise, or opinion discovered, which
threaten the like judgements unto this Land, as
have befallen the Kingdome of Hungarie, one of
the most flourishing Kingdomes in the Christian
world, within a few yeares before its ruine.</P>
