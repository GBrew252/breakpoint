<HEAD>A REFLECTION upon <HI>Le Grand Dictionaire Historique,</HI> &amp;c. OR, THE <HI>Great Historical Dictionary</HI> OF LEWIS MORERY, D. D. Printed at UTRECHT 1692. with the <HI>Supplement</HI> of <HI>J. Le Clerc,</HI> D. D. in Four TOMES in <HI>Folio, French;</HI> AND <HI>An Account of this Edition of the following BOOK.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Great Historical Dictionary of <HI>Monsievr Morery,</HI> was an unexpected Work to come from a Person, who understood not any <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Hebrew;</HI> and had but an indifferent knowledge of <HI>Latin.</HI> For it will be al∣lowed, amidst such a multiplicity of Subjects, to contain many very in∣genious things. Yet I desire not to commend him for the Invention he ascribes to the <HI>Chinese</HI> of the Province of <HI>Xamsi: who boyl their Victuals</HI> (he says) <HI>over Pits of Subterraneous Fires, proceeding from the Bowels of the Earth: Which, to make the Fire burn the quicker and stronger, they contract at the Mouths in such a manner, as only to leave room for the Caldron to stand.</HI> For though the <HI>Chinese</HI> are famous over the World for their <HI>Inventions;</HI> yet the Wit of <HI>this</HI> hath so little in it of the Wisdom of their <HI>Other,</HI> or Common Sense, that it supersedes the Civility of the least pretence to approve of it. Neither yet is it possible for me to be reconciled to his Account of a Tribe of the <HI>Troglae∣dytes;</HI> dwelling continually in the Caverns of a Mountain, in the Island of <HI>Malta;</HI> near to a House of <HI>Pleasure,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Great Master</HI> of the Order of the <HI>Knights</HI> there. A tall, robust, long-liv'd, inhospitable people, as he describes them: <HI>Who speak altogether the pure</HI> Arabick <HI>Language, in which they are instructed, as to matters of Religion, by the</HI> Ma∣ronites <HI>that come to</HI> Malta. For there appears no more Probability of an <HI>Arabian</HI> Race of <HI>Christian Troglaedytes</HI> at <HI>Malta,</HI> than of a Nation of <HI>Pygmies</HI> in the Neighbourhood of the <HI>Nile.</HI> Therefore in a word, <HI>Monsieur Morery,</HI> as he hath his Excellencies, so he hath his great Faults too: And it seems to be none of the least remarkable of the Latter, That let a thing be never so Fabulous in <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Herodotus,</HI> or the Histories of the old <HI>Greeks;</HI> never so extravagantly reported by the Modern Books of Voyages and Discoveries, or the Common <HI>Memoires</HI> of the Times; yet he mixes it with his purer Geography. Which hath given me continual reason to admire the Patience and La∣bour of his <HI>Pen:</HI> but I disagree with his Fancy, if he thought such Collections pleasing to Men of Sense; and with his Judgment, if he thought them true.</P>
<P>In his Geography of the Kingdom and Counties of <HI>England,</HI> there is no body but must be offended with him upon other Accounts. The principal of our Rivers (next the <HI>Thames</HI>) the <HI>Severn,</HI> the <HI>Trent,</HI> the <HI>Humber,</HI> the <HI>Medway,</HI> the <HI>Derwent,</HI> &amp;c. None of them have their Names with Descriptions in his Work. <HI>Peterborough, Wells, Cambridge, Shrewsbury, Richmond,</HI> and <HI>Rippon,</HI> are wholly omitted out of our Chief Towns and Ci∣ties. <HI>Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Cheshire, Shropshire</HI> and <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> out of our Counties. And all the Description that he gives to <HI>Eleven</HI> of our <HI>Counties</HI> more, with the Capital Towns thereunto belonging, will be justly rehearsed in about Eleven Lines. <HI>To</HI> South∣hampton,
<PB REF="3"/>
he says, <HI>a Town and County in the South of</HI> England, <HI>with a Port to the Sea. To</HI> Stafford, <HI>a Town and County of</HI> England, <HI>towards the middle of the Kingdom. To</HI> Sur∣rey, <HI>a County in the South part of</HI> England. <HI>To</HI> Sussex, <HI>a County in the South of</HI> England, <HI>whereof</HI> Chichester <HI>is the Capital. To</HI> Warwick, <HI>a Town and County of</HI> England. <HI>To</HI> Westmorland, <HI>a County in the North of</HI> England, <HI>which was a part of the Country of the an∣cient</HI> Brigantes. <HI>To</HI> Huntingdon <HI>and</HI> Leicestershires, he adds the Names of the Rivers <HI>Ouse</HI> and <HI>Stower,</HI> with two or three Towns. <HI>To</HI> Middlesex, <HI>a small County in the East of</HI> England, <HI>included in the ancient Kingdom of the</HI> East Saxons, <HI>and only considerable for</HI> Lon∣don <HI>its Capital. To</HI> Rutland, <HI>a County in the middle of</HI> England, <HI>but little considerable, having no more than one Town called</HI> Oakcham <HI>in it. To</HI> Suffolk, <HI>a Town and County in the East of</HI> England. This is <HI>Monsieur Morery</HI>'s way of describing a next Neighbor Kingdom, and one of the most Powerful in the World. Which is the least that a <HI>Geographer</HI> says, of the most distant and obscure Provinces of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> or the unknown Regi∣ons of the <HI>Asiatick Tartary.</HI> And though he may be something larger upon <HI>London, Ro∣chester, Bristol,</HI> and now and then a County; yet he does it with so little Care and Art, so <HI>ungeographically</HI> in comparison to his Illustration of other Countries; that take his Accounts of <HI>England</HI> all together (with which those of <HI>Scotland, Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> are done after the like manner) and they will be found the crudest and meanest and the most Contemptible part of his Volumes.</P>
<P>I need take no Notice of his <HI>Mistakes</HI> about <HI>Rutland</HI> and <HI>Suffolk;</HI> which occur even in those <HI>diminitive Sketches</HI> that he gives them, and are already sensible to every running Eye. He is no less mistaken about the Bishoprick of <HI>Coventry</HI> and <HI>Lichfield. A Bishoprick</HI> (says he) <HI>about the year 656. was established at</HI> Lichfield. <HI>And there being another Bishop∣rick afterwards establish'd at</HI> Coventry, <HI>these two Bishopricks in time became united in one.</HI> Whereas it never from the beginning was otherwise than <HI>one and the same</HI> Bishoprick; primarily established at <HI>Lichfield</HI> in 656: Next removed to <HI>Chester</HI> in 1067; or as others, in 1075. From <HI>Chester,</HI> removed to <HI>Coventry</HI> in 1088: and from <HI>Coventry</HI> returned to <HI>Lichfield</HI> again in 1186. Whereupon followed an Agreement under Bishop <HI>Alexander de Savensby</HI> (who succeeded to the See in 1220), that the Episcopal Style should be deri∣ved from both <HI>Coventry</HI> and <HI>Lichfield,</HI> yet with the Precedence to <HI>Coventry. Mons. Mo∣rery</HI> is no less mistaken in the ancient Seat of the Bishops of <HI>Lincoln;</HI> which was <HI>Dorchester</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> situated at the Confluence of the <HI>Thame</HI> and the <HI>Isis.</HI> For he hath the fortune, not only to attribute it to <HI>Dorchester</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> upon the River <HI>Frome;</HI> but to quote <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury</HI> for the same, to aggravate the matter, in mistaking both his Author and the place together. It is very pleasant to observe in his Account of <HI>Nor∣thumberland,</HI> what an extent he gives to it. <HI>All</HI> Northumberland (says he) <HI>compre∣hends six Counties;</HI> York, Durham, Lancaster, Westmorland, Cumberland <HI>and</HI> Northum∣berland. To which he ought to have added the South parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> too, as far as <HI>Edenborough;</HI> if he knew no other, than that the Limits of <HI>Northumberland</HI> now remain in the same State, as they were eleven hundred years ago, in the time of <HI>Saxon Heptarchy.</HI> Perhaps a Stranger will continually admire at the meaning of such Words as <HI>Lerbie, Barthe, Lanclastre, Torriger,</HI> &amp;c. He may be pleased to know therefore, that <HI>Monsieur Morery</HI> is not much to be trusted for the Right <HI>Proper Names</HI> of Places or Per∣sons (Antient or Modern), out of his own Country. Yet neither can our Nation blame him for it, more than another. His <HI>Misnomers</HI> are most Universal: and the meaning of those mentioned, is <HI>Irebye</HI> in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> the <HI>Bath, Lancashire,</HI> and the anti∣ent Britain <HI>Vortiger.</HI> It is more strange to see him <HI>Misplace</HI> the Houses of <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> in the <HI>Abbey</HI> of <HI>Westminster;</HI> and to see Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI> of <HI>Cambridge</HI> attributed throughout his Character to the Chairs and Preferments of <HI>Oxford;</HI> and Dr. <HI>Stilling∣fleet</HI> quoted with the Title of the present Bishop of <HI>Winchester.</HI> Yet there is a stranger and a more admirable Passage still, expecting to be also remembred here; which says, in illustrating the occasion and manner of the Descent of the Troops from <HI>Holland</HI> in 1688. <HI>that they were landed at</HI> Torbay <HI>in</HI> Wales.</P>
<P>It is true, these particular Defects and Errours import no more, than the unskilfulness of the Author, in the Geography and History of <HI>England;</HI> whereof the disparagement redounds to himself only, with <HI>Monsieur Le Clerc</HI> his late Editor at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> who certainly is the Father of a share. But if <HI>M. Morery</HI> hath happened to be as unfortunate as <HI>Maimbourg</HI> and <HI>Varillas,</HI> in mistaking in Particulars relating to <HI>England;</HI> He is also as <HI>injurious</HI> as <HI>Sca∣liger</HI> and <HI>Sorbiere</HI> in some of his General Characters of it. It is fit, I should repeat his Words. First, he bestows a line or two of commendation upon the Gentry and Nobility, who perfect their Natural Parts and Educations by Travel and Conversation with Stran∣gers, <HI>(Voc. Angleterre) But on the Contrary</HI> (he adds) <HI>the People of</HI> England, <HI>are cruel, inso∣lent,</HI>
<PB REF="3"/>
<HI>brutal, seditious, Enemies to Strangers. The abundance of all the Necessaries of life produced by their Country with little pain, renders them proud and negligent. They have not the same Industry, nor the same Address to Works and Manufactures, as their Neigh∣bours and other People; who are made to love labour, and be industrious, by necessity and the sterility of their Country. It hath been long since said,</HI></P>
<Q>Anglica Gens est Optima flens, sed pessima ridens.</Q>
<P><HI>To be persuaded of the Truth whereof, one need only consider the Evils that</HI> England <HI>hath suffered these thirty or forty years, by the Transport and the Malice of its sour, querulous, opiniative, and dissembling Spirits.—The Men of Letters often compose their Works with a Pipe of Tobacco in their hands.—The Citizens and Peasants delight in the fighting of Bears and Bulls, Cock-fighting, and Wrestling; which agree with their Inclinations, which are a little cruel.—The Women go without Ceremony to the Taverns. The Gallants carry their Mistresses to them; to pleasure whom the Treat must be concluded with the fighting of Bears and Bulls, Cock-fighting and Wrestling, and many times with all those three together.</HI> By saying all three together, he imagines we fight the Bears and Bulls with one another. Now as my Grandfather <HI>Heylyn</HI> answers to the like Calumnies of <HI>Scaliger,</HI> by <HI>the shoot∣ing of the Bow, we may easily guess the quality of the Archer.</HI></P>
<P>If the People of <HI>France</HI> lived with all the Innocency and the Freedom of the <HI>Golden Age,</HI> their Censures might have been allowed to pass with the Authority of <HI>Oracles.</HI> But as it is their unhappiness to be Slaves to the Rack, and the Wheel, and the Galleys; who have filled the Universe with the Outcries of their Persecutions at Home, and their Devastations abroad; and can never be forgotten for the blood of <HI>Henry</HI> III. and IV. the <HI>Barracades</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> and the <HI>Nuptials</HI> of S. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s <HI>Eve;</HI> before they begin the Cry of <HI>Cruelty</HI> and <HI>Seditiousness</HI> upon another Nation; let them remember that Divine Character of a Man, who <HI>quarrels with a Mote in his Brothers Eye, whilst he hath a Beam in his own.</HI> If I know any thing of the Native <HI>English</HI> Temper, <HI>Cruelty</HI> is the very <HI>Antipodes</HI> to it. There is nothing more odious in History amongst us, than the Memory of a Prince, who stains his Reign with Blood. As our Government is a Monarchy without <HI>Tyranny,</HI> it requires our Obedience without <HI>Servility. Torture</HI> is excluded our Laws with an abhorrence; not only as a Servility unfit for Christians, but a Barbarity unfit for Men. And that famous ancient comparison of <HI>Angli tan∣quam Angeli,</HI> shines most especially in the beauty of their minds; composed of <HI>Simpli∣city, Integrity, Modesty, Mercy, Open</HI> and <HI>Free-heartedness, Peace, Gratitude, Generosity, Gal∣lantry</HI> and <HI>Love;</HI> which are all comprehended in one Word, they call <HI>Good Nature,</HI> so appropriated by God to them and their Language, that it scarce admits of a direct Translation into any other. The <HI>true Reading</HI> of the Verse, that is quoted by <HI>Monsieur Morery,</HI> is by an Abuse corrupted and turned into <HI>Anglica gens.</HI> Otherwise it is</P>
<Q>Rustica gens est Optima flens, sed Pessima ridens.</Q>
<P>And understands the Peasantry, not of Ours, or any Particular Nation, but all in Com∣mon. Though the Sense and Equity of it neither so is any better than the Poetry: And I dare be confident the <HI>Rhiming Monk</HI> that wrote it, never knew in himself what <HI>La∣bour</HI> and <HI>Oppression</HI> means. Whilst the Peasant by the condition of his Being <HI>carries a Cross,</HI> to add to the weight whereof is barbarous in <HI>Oppressing</HI> the <HI>Oppressed.</HI> It is no small sign of a Disposition contrary to <HI>Brutal, Insolent, Querulous</HI> and <HI>Cruel,</HI> that <HI>England</HI> is to a Proverb the <HI>Paradise of the Tender Sex.</HI> For whom <HI>Monsieur Morery</HI> hath prepared such a <HI>Treat</HI> of <HI>Sports,</HI> as hath I believe at least one excellence in it, <HI>Not to be Common.</HI> He ought to have excused those Sports from <HI>Cruelty</HI> in <HI>their favours</HI> too; and to have known, that the particular pleasure of the Peasantry therein, is only to see the courage of their Beasts, or laugh at Cowardise even in Beasts. But for <HI>the Evils which</HI> England (he says) <HI>hath suffered these thirty or forty years,</HI> or more, it is very unjust to forget the Praises of all the Persons that were innocent of them, and to draw the Character of the whole Nation from the Crimes of the guilty only. Who so far as they forsook <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Virtues</HI> abovementioned, degenerated from the Native Spirits of <HI>English∣men.</HI> Whilst fearing beyond reason, and immoderately persecuting a <HI>Phantosme</HI> of <HI>Cru∣elty</HI> in others, they begat the <HI>Monster</HI> amongst themselves. So odious is the apprehen∣sion of <HI>Cruelty, Slavery,</HI> and <HI>Brutality</HI> here; that the <HI>Evils of England</HI> have been occa∣sioned by nothing more, than a false fear taken at their Names.</P>
<P>His other Character of the People of <HI>England,</HI> is, that they are <HI>Enemies to Strangers.</HI> For which, I never could learn a better Argument, than that of <HI>Mons. Sorbieres;</HI> (see Dr. <HI>Sprats</HI> Observations upon the Voyages of <HI>Mons. Sorbiere;</HI>) because he was rudely called <HI>Monsieur,</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
and not respected in the quality of <HI>Historiographer Royal</HI> to the K. of <HI>France,</HI> by the <HI>Children and Schoolboys of Dover.</HI> For long before the reception of the <HI>French Protestants,</HI> the numbers of Strangers at <HI>Norwich, Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> were computed to be more than constantly resided at any twenty Cities, either of <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> or <HI>Italy.</HI> Virtue, Merit and Civility in Persons of a Foreign Country, like the Commodities imported thence, charm the hearts of the <HI>English;</HI> and have a greater value set upon them, than the equal products of our own. So far are we from being inclined to be <HI>Enemies to Strangers,</HI> that we are ambitious to be Friends to Strangers, even till we are Enemies to our selves. It is for <HI>their</HI> benefit, that in the Court of <HI>Admiralty</HI> we con∣stantly retain the use of the <HI>Civil Law;</HI> and have enlarged it with the addition of those admirable Laws of <HI>Oleron,</HI> published by our King <HI>Richard</HI> I. which have equalized the Fame and Justice, as to Marine causes, of the ancient <HI>Laws</HI> of the <HI>Rhodians.</HI> And how very careful both our <HI>Common</HI> and <HI>Statute Laws</HI> are, in doing the exactest justice in all <HI>Pleas</HI> betwixt <HI>Strangers</HI> and <HI>Denizens,</HI> or the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Strangers;</HI> I need only appeal to the <HI>Inquest</HI> of <HI>Medietas Linguae,</HI> given by the <HI>Statutes</HI> of the 27. and 28. of <HI>Edw.</HI> III.</P>
<P>Another Part of his Disgraces of the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> is, their <HI>Pride and Negligence, want of Industry, and of a Genius to Works and Manufactures, occasioned by their relyance upon the fertility of their Country.</HI> I must observe he joyns their <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>want of Industry</HI> very ill together: For if ever they pretend to be proud of any thing, it is of the Effects of their Industry, and the Works of their Hands. Their Plantations in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and Commerce thither; Their <HI>African, Levant, East-Indian, Russia, Groenland, Hud∣sons Bay, Spanish, French, Hamborough,</HI> and <HI>Merchant Adventurers</HI> Companies, for other <HI>Foreign</HI> Commerce: At Home, their Inclosures and Tillage; the New Rivers of the <HI>Fenns,</HI> the Coal Mines of the North, the Lead Mines of <HI>Derby,</HI> and the Tin Mines of <HI>Cornwall;</HI> the Orchards of <HI>Hereford,</HI> and the Plough-lands of other Counties: Their Manufactures in Clothes, Stuffs, Linnen, Iron, Copper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Quantities of their Commodities transported yearly beyond Sea; Their Discoveries in the <HI>Mecha∣nick</HI> Arts, and their Perfection in the <HI>Learned;</HI> Their Books in all the Faculties and Sciences, upon all sorts of Subjects; Their Restauration of <HI>London</HI> in three years, which was supposed to be the Work of an Age; Their Ships of Trade and War; their Riches, their Knowledge, their Power by Land and Sea: All these, as they are the undeniable Demonstrations of a most <HI>Ingenious</HI> and <HI>Industrious</HI> People from the meanest to the highest quality; so they are justly verified of the <HI>English</HI> in the view of the World. Who notwithstanding insult over no <HI>Foreign State;</HI> neither detract from the Praises of any greater Trade: But if they <HI>value</HI> and <HI>caress</HI> themselves upon the happy Effects of their Industry, it is a <HI>Virtuous</HI> Pride that is so well grounded.</P>
<P>When <HI>Monsieur Sorbiere</HI> travelled into <HI>England,</HI> he could not but take notice of the <HI>Convenient form of the Bridge at</HI> Rochester, <HI>for being so contrived, that the Mens Hats can∣not be blown over it.</HI> We have altogether as worthy an Observation here of <HI>Mons. Morery;</HI> that the <HI>Men of Letters in</HI> England <HI>often compose their Works with a Pipe of Tobacco in their hands.</HI> Whereby I truly, with regard both to the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Men of Letters, am as fully satisfied, that the Fancies of particular Persons, and sometimes of Nations are un∣accountable; as when I remember that the sage and noble <HI>Egyptians</HI> of old (and from them the <HI>Israelites</HI>) set such a high value upon <HI>Garlick</HI> and <HI>Onions,</HI> as to honour them with a place in the number of their <HI>Titular Deities.</HI> For if any <HI>English</HI> Man of Letters is so addicted to the <HI>Weed,</HI> to write and smoak together; yet the Fancy of <HI>Monsieur Morery</HI> seems no less unaccountable; first to employ his Observation upon such trivial and insignificant particulars; and next to print them in a Voluminous Work, amidst the general Character of one of the most illustrious Kingdoms in the World.</P>
<P>If all the rest of his <HI>Geography</HI> had been conformable to this of <HI>England,</HI> there had been no occasion to use him in an unpleasing Labour that hath happened to be obtained from me. Particularly as to his own Country, he spares no Pains nor Eloquence to adorn it. And to be sure, he suppresses the ancient Glory of the Atchievments of the Victorious <HI>English</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> as much as possibly he can. Indeed the Interests of the <HI>French</HI> Crown, and the Use that <HI>Mons. Pompone</HI> made (sometime <HI>Secretary</HI> of <HI>State</HI> to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV.) of the Obligations he laid upon the Author, are visible; not in that only, but in the great care that is taken in rehearsing the Titles, Pretences and Dependences of the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> as if they did desire to entitle it to all the Ancient <HI>Gallia,</HI> according as it was bounded in the times of <HI>Julius Caesar.</HI> I have followed him throughout his four Tomes from Place to Place; leaving his <HI>Adulterinae Meroes,</HI> the <HI>Infinite Trash</HI> that is in him, as undisturbed as <HI>Ashes</HI> of the <HI>Dead;</HI> to take what is purely Geographical and Chronological, proper, and easie, and short, according to the Quality and Genius of

the following Dictionary. Which is therefore in this Edition not only enlarged with the <HI>Antient</HI> Geography, and all such other Descriptions of Places, as occur in the <HI>French</HI> Work, above what it was possible to contain in the Editions of this <HI>Dictionary</HI> in lesser Volumes; and also with some Improvements made in the Geography of <HI>England</HI> in the like manner: But I have further taken care to supply the Defects of the Descriptions themselves, in those Editions, with whatever accrued that was really necessary to suggest a more perfect knowledge of each Respective Place. The <HI>Duodecimo</HI> ascribed to Monsieur <HI>Du Vall,</HI> (Geographer to the <HI>French</HI> King) and printed the fourth time in <HI>English</HI> 1681. with the Title of a Geographical Dictio∣nary, was rather a Geographical <HI>Nomenclature,</HI> than a <HI>Dictionary.</HI> It was <HI>Begun</HI> to be made properly into a <HI>Dictionary</HI> by Mr. <HI>Edmund Bohun,</HI> at the Perswasion and Charge of the Proprietor of the Copy. And undoubtedly, whatever the Faults of Mr. <HI>Bohun</HI>'s Octavo are; yet it will always remain an useful Book, and a light Companion (as he proposeth), for Travellers: when, such is the Necessity and Pleasure of a piece of this Nature in the hands of all; that the very <HI>Nomenclature</HI> of <HI>Du Vall</HI> is entertaining still. But the advancing of this Work to an <HI>Absolute Perfection</HI> is a matter of a higher Con∣sideration: which requires the diligence of many Years, and the succession perhaps of many Hands, and must be content to proceed by Degrees. And tho the labour in en∣countring oftentimes a dry and difficult Soyl is unpleasing and deterring; which caused Mr. <HI>Bohun</HI> to declare, <HI>he never desired to do it a second time;</HI> yet as it is like to redound as well to the Honour of the <HI>English</HI> Language, as the Universal benefit of Learning amongst us; it will abide an encouragement to consider, that every <HI>Mite</HI> bestowed upon this <HI>Corban</HI> is Meritorious; and every Endeavor towards the Completing so great a Good may be placed in the number of Publick Services; for which reason, I am not only satisfied with my own contributing a Share thereto; but am obliged also to tell the World, that the Table of <HI>Measures</HI> was adjusted to my Hand by the Ingenious Mr. <HI>Halley.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of Divers MEASURES.</HEAD>
<P>THE Measures of differing Nations, and especially those of the Distan∣ces of Places, being very various, it was necessary to premise something about them, that the <HI>English</HI> Reader might not be at a loss when he meets with them in the following Work.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Mile by Statute Law consists of 5280 <HI>London</HI> Feet, or 1760 Yards, and eight Furlongs. Of these Miles the Experiments of <HI>Mr. Norwood</HI> and <HI>Mr. Picart,</HI> do demonstrate 69, and somewhat more, to be a Degree of the Earths Surface; tho till lately a Degree has been reckoned but 60 <HI>English</HI> Miles.</P>
<P>A Marine League is the twentieth part of a Degree, and most Nations agree to reckon so for Distances at Sea.</P>
<P>A <HI>French</HI> League is the twenty fifth part of a Degree, being nearly two <HI>English</HI> Miles and three quarters.</P>
<P>A <HI>German</HI> Mile is reckoned to be the fifteenth part of a Degree, or better than four <HI>English</HI> Miles.</P>
<P>A <HI>Dutch</HI> Mile, such as are now used in <HI>Holland,</HI> is by the Experiment of <HI>Snellius,</HI> nearest the nineteenth part of a Degree, being about three <HI>English</HI> Miles and a half.</P>
<P>An <HI>Italian</HI> Mile is mille passus, or a thousand Paces of five <HI>Roman</HI> Feet each; and the <HI>Roman</HI> Foot being ⅖ of an Inch less than the <HI>London</HI> Foot, or as 29 to 30, it follows that nearest 76 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles are a Degree. And the <HI>Turkish</HI> Miles are reputed equal to the <HI>Italian.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Danes, Swedes,</HI> and <HI>Hungarians</HI> make long Miles, being about a <HI>German</HI> Mile and half, or at least five or six English Miles. The Polish Miles are nearly equal to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Miles, and reckoned about 20 to a Degree.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Miles are longer than the <HI>English,</HI> by about half, and are not defined by any certain measure, that I can learn.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> League is estimated at four <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, and are reckoned 17 and a half to a Degree.</P>
<P>The <HI>Russians</HI> use a short Measure they call <HI>Vorst,</HI> which is little more than three quarters of an <HI>English</HI> Mile.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabian</HI> Mile, both Ancient and Modern, is about an <HI>English</HI> Mile and a quarter.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>As to the Measures of the Ancients,</HEAD>
<P>The old <HI>Roman</HI> Mile was nearly equal to the present <HI>Italian</HI> Mile, described al∣ready, and was divided into eight <HI>Stadia,</HI> or Furlongs, of 625 <HI>Roman</HI> Feet each.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> measured by <HI>Stadia</HI> only, consisting of 600 <HI>Greek</HI> Feet, or 100 <HI>Orgyiae;</HI> eight of these made the <HI>Roman</HI> Mile, the <HI>Greek</HI> Foot being to the <HI>Ro∣man,</HI> as 25 to 24, nearly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persian</HI> League or <HI>Parasanga,</HI> was much about a <HI>Spanish</HI> League, being 30 Stadia, or three <HI>Italian</HI> Miles and three quarters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Schoenus</HI> or <HI>Egyptian</HI> League was of two sorts, the greater of 60 <HI>Stadia,</HI> and the lesser of 40, the one of five, the other seven and a half <HI>Italian</HI> Miles.</P>

But in this Interval, be∣tween their becoming a free and a subject People, they raised themselves to a greater degree of Glory by Learning, than ever they could have required by Arms, without it. <HI>Solon,</HI> who lived a little before the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Captivity, and became the <HI>Athenian</HI> Legislator about the <HI>3359th</HI> year of the World, laid the Foundations of this, which <HI>Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Xenophon, Thucydides, Demosthenes, Isocrates,</HI> and the rest that followed, raised to such an height, that <HI>Athens</HI> was truly more the Mistress of the World on the account of Arts, than ever <HI>Rome</HI> was on the score of her Arms; and tho both their times are past, yet <HI>A∣thens, being Dead, speaketh still</HI> in her <HI>Philosophers, Orators</HI> and <HI>Historians.</HI> To pursue her Fate, she rose out of her Ashes after the <HI>Syllian</HI> Ruin by the favour of the <HI>Romans;</HI> and flourished, till <HI>Alaricus</HI> the <HI>Goth,</HI> laid her in the Dust, under the Reign of <HI>Va∣lens,</HI> about the year of Christ 378.

<P><HI>Azores,</HI> commonly call'd by <HI>English-men</HI> the <HI>Ca∣nary</HI> Islands, are 7 Islands in the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, not unknown to the Antients; and by <HI>Pliny, Solinus,</HI> and others, mentioned under the name of the <HI>Fortunate Islands;</HI> and tho they differ as to the number, yet all agree, <HI>Canaria</HI> was one of them; but which is most wonderful, the knowledge of them was perfectly lost till 1330. when a Ship being distressed by Weather, discovered them; and it is not agreed whether it was an <HI>English, French,</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship. In 1334. the <HI>Portuguese</HI> attempted to conquer these Islands, and were beaten off.

<P><HI>Babylon,</HI> one of the most famous Cities of the antient World, celebrated both in Sacred and Profane Story.

Generally believed to have been built by <HI>Nim∣rod,</HI> the Grand-child of <HI>Noah,</HI> soon after the <HI>De∣luge;</HI> and to have been a continuation of <HI>Babel,</HI> so called, because <HI>the Lord did there confound the Lan∣guage of all the Earth,</HI> Gen. 11. 9. This City was antiently incompassed with Walls of Brick, which made a Circuit of 385 Stadia's, or 48 <HI>English</HI> Miles. They were so broad at the top, that two Chariots might meet, and pass, without any hindrance; and they are said to be 100 Cubits high; so that this was one of the seven Wonders that amazed the old World. This City was the Capital of the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Empire; and tho <HI>Nabonassar</HI> ruin'd that Empire, yet he for∣sook it not; but his Son <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> very much increased and inlarged it, as appears <HI>Dan.</HI> 4. 30.

See <HI>Bochart.</HI> Geogr. Sacr. lib. 4. c. 15. It is very hard now to know assuredly so much as where it stood.

The Cathedral is dedicated by the name of S. <HI>Daniel,</HI> who was Bishop here about the Year 516. From which time to the 11th. Cen∣tury that <HI>Hernaeus</HI> filled the See, we have no Account of the succession. In 1496. <HI>Henry Deane,</HI> Bishop, repair'd the Cathedral after it had been defaced by the Rebel <HI>Owen Glendower.</HI> In 1541. <HI>Arthur Bulkeley</HI> Bishop, reduced the Bishoprick to a low Condition by unworthy sales and alienations. The Diocese con∣tains the County of <HI>Carnarvan,</HI> with parts of <HI>Den∣bigh, Merioneth</HI> and <HI>Montgomery,</HI> and the whole Isle of <HI>Anglesey.</HI></P>

In some things they are <HI>Mahometan▪</HI> like; in others, divided amongst themselves into Sects, greater or less, almost innumerable, according as they affect their particular Superstitions.

This River divides the Pro∣vince of <HI>Ʋlster</HI> into two parts: but Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> is rather of Opinion, that the <HI>Latin</HI> Name belongs to the <HI>Swilly,</HI> another great River in the same Province, but a little more to the West than this.</P>
<P><HI>Bantam,</HI> a very great City, and a famous Mart and Sea Port in the Island of <HI>Java</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and the Capital of a Kingdom of the same Name. This City is seated at the foot of an Hill, 18 Leagues from the City of <HI>Batavia</HI> towards the West, upon a narrow Passage call'd the Streights of <HI>Bantam,</HI> right over against the Island of <HI>Sumatra.</HI> It has a very good Harbor belonging to it called the <HI>Sound,</HI> and was much frequented by the <HI>European</HI> Merchants, especially the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch.</HI> The Kingdom of <HI>Jacatra</HI> is subject to this Prince, and he has of∣ten made War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> with reasonable good Success, till about the Year 1684. A Son of the King of <HI>Bantam</HI> rebelling against his Father, called the <HI>Dutch</HI> to his Assistance, by which means the <HI>Dutch</HI> possessed themselves of <HI>Bantam,</HI> seized the <HI>English</HI> Factory and their Effects, and made themselves sole Masters of that Trade. The Controversie be∣tween them and the <HI>English</HI> not being determined to this day.

<P><HI>Barbadoes,</HI> one of the most considerable Planta∣tions which the <HI>English</HI> have upon the <HI>Caribby</HI> Islands: it lies in 13. d. 20. m. Northern Lat. and 321. of Long▪ about 8 Leagues in length, and 5 in breadth, and inhabited by 50000. <HI>English,</HI> besides <HI>Negros,</HI> who are three times their number. This Island was first discovered to the <HI>English</HI> by Sir <HI>William Cur∣teen,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>James</HI> I. but was then wholly desolate. The <HI>English</HI> soon after Planted it, and were driven at first to great Extremities; because Ships came very rarely and slowly thither from <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> till having about the Year 1627. raised some <HI>Tobacco, Indico, Cotton-Wool</HI> and <HI>Fustick-Wood,</HI> and after that falling into the <HI>Sugar</HI> Trade, its Reputation and Wealth increased. And this Colony which for a long time subsisted by the courtesie or negligence of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> grew so strong and numerous, that all their after Attempts signified nothing. Their <HI>Sugars,</HI> which at first were coarse, and would quick∣ly melt if not spent, are now improved to a great Perfection. This Island is not well Watered with Rivers, or fresh Springs; yet lying now, they want not that Element, being supplied by Pools, Ponds, and Cisterns. It is very fruitful, and enjoys a perpe∣tual Summer: Hot, but cooled by the Briezes which rise with the Sun, and blow fresher as the Sun gets higher. The chief Town of this Island is S. <HI>Michaels,</HI> situate at the bottom of <HI>Carlisle Bay,</HI> in the South∣ern part of the Island, where Ships have a very secure Harbor.</P>
<P><HI>Barbara,</HI> a small Village in the Island of <HI>Sicily;</HI> but once a City of great Fame, and much taken no∣tice of by <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Writers, under the se∣veral names of <HI>Aegesta, Egesta, Acesta</HI> and <HI>Segesta,</HI> &amp;c.

Here was a most flourishing Church till the 5 Century; in the begin∣ing of which, the <HI>Vandals</HI> then <HI>Arians,</HI> entered it, and brought in their Heresie with them: but that which more effectually contributed to the ruin of Christianity here, was the Conquest of it by the <HI>Moors</HI> in 647, when one <HI>Hucha</HI> a famous General (whom <HI>Osmen,</HI> the Third <HI>Caliph</HI> of the <HI>Saracens,</HI> imployed to that purpose) finally expell'd the <HI>Ro∣mans;</HI> and ever since the <HI>Moors</HI> have possessed it; who being the most enraged Enemies of Christianity that ever professed the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Law, have so far extirpated Christianity, that there is very few, (if any) of the Inhabitants of this vast Tract of Land, which profess it.</P>

Now the Principal City of <HI>Switzerland.</HI> It has its name from <HI>Basiliana</HI> the Mother of <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate: but <HI>Valesius</HI> thinks the name rather taken from the River on which it stands, which he supposeth was then so call'd. It has a pleasant Situation, and is adorned with many mag∣nificent Structures, and Churches; watered by many sweet Fountains, blessed with an healthful Air, a va∣liant People, and plenty of all things.

Pope. The same Council established the pragmatick Sanction, that the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church received in 1438. in the presence of <HI>Charles</HI> VII. This City taught the rest of the <HI>Cantons</HI> the way of Leaguing and Unit∣ing: for the Pope having excommunicated <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Bavarian,</HI> Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> the City of <HI>Basil</HI> persevered in the Service of that Prince, and was for it excommunicated too: whereupon they threw the Popes Legat into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and to secure them∣selves, entered into a League with <HI>Zurich,</HI> and <HI>Bearn,</HI> and other of the Principal Cities, in 1327. This City embraced the Reformation in 1529. It is one of the most celebrated Universities in Christendom, which was opened here by <HI>Pius</HI> II. <HI>Ann. Dom.</HI> 1459.

<P><HI>Benares,</HI> A famous City of <HI>Indostan</HI> (or the Empire of the great <HI>Mogul</HI>) upon the <HI>Ganges,</HI> in a very good Country. It is the <HI>Ʋniversity of the Indies;</HI> the general School for <HI>Philosophy, Physick, Astrology,</HI> and <HI>Pagan Divinity,</HI> that serves all the Gentry and all the ingenious of these Parts. Here the <HI>Bramans</HI> and the <HI>Pendets,</HI> that is, the great Doctors of Paganisme, are attended, not as in <HI>Europe</HI> indeed in Colleges, but in their Houses and Gardens, with multitudes of Scholars that study with them many years. They learn first the Divine Language, call'd <HI>Hanscrit</HI> in which they say the holy Books of the Law were written that God gave to <HI>Brama</HI> their Prophet. Of this Language we have an Al∣phabet in <HI>Kircher.</HI> It is quite different from the ordinary <HI>Indian,</HI> and much more ancient; so that none understand it but their learned Men. Next, they read an Abridgment, they call <HI>Purane,</HI> of the Books of their Law; and so pass to <HI>Philosophy.</HI> In <HI>Philosophy,</HI> though they know nothing of the Learning of <HI>Greece,</HI> they argue much to the same effect with <HI>Plato, Aristotle, Democritus</HI> and <HI>Epi∣curus;</HI> and are divided in a manner into the same Sects as they, only with more Confusion of Thought, with Fables. <HI>Astrology</HI> they are mightily inclin'd to, had they but somemore lights into that Science. Their <HI>Physick</HI> is for the most part Receipts: But for <HI>Anatomy,</HI> they are in no Condition to know it, be∣cause they will not presume to cut up the body either of man or Beast. Some years since the Do∣ctors of this place held a famous <HI>Cabal,</HI> which made the more noise upon the account that they gain'd the Son of the Great <HI>Mogul</HI> to their Opinion.

It is the cheif City of the Can∣ton of <HI>Bern,</HI> which is one of the largest Cantons, and was added to the rest in 1353.

In 1287. this City was besieged by <HI>Rodolphus</HI> of <HI>Habspurg.</HI> They suffered much also from <HI>Albertus,</HI> who had a set Battle with them near their Walls in 1291. wherein they lost many Men, but had better Success against the Earl of <HI>Savoy</HI> the same year. In 1346. they re∣newed their League with <HI>Freiburg,</HI> after which fol∣lowed the Perpetual League in 1353. whereby it ob∣tained the second place amongst the Cantons. In 1528. it imbraced the Reformation, and thereupon passed a Law against mercenary Service in foreign Wars. It stands about 13 Miles from <HI>Bazil</HI> to the South, 4 from <HI>Freiburg</HI> to the North, and about 20 from <HI>Geneva</HI> to the North-East. This Canton is so well replenished with Gentry, handsom Towns, good Castles and Villages, that you may compare it almost to one continued City: and as for the Civil Govern∣ment of it, it is managed by two Councils of Sena∣tors

<P><HI>Bohemia,</HI> a great Kingdom in <HI>Germany</HI> belong∣ing to the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> which though it is al∣most encompassed by the <HI>German</HI> Territories, yet is properly no part of <HI>Germany.</HI> It has a distinct and different Language, and been a separate Kingdom e∣ver since the year 1086. Bounded on the North and West by the Dukedom of <HI>Saxony,</HI> on the East by <HI>Hungary,</HI> and on the South by <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Austria:</HI> containing almost 40 Towns and Cities in it that they call Royal, whereof <HI>Prague</HI> is the Capital. This Kingdom maintained great Wars with the <HI>Caroline</HI> Race of Kings, till about the year 894. <HI>Borzivoius</HI> Duke of <HI>Moravia,</HI> becoming Prince also of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> procured their imbracing the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith univer∣sally.

another Accession of the <HI>Waldenses;</HI> insomuch that in 1467. there was 200 Churches of this Persuasion in <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Moravia.</HI> In the year 1536, they imbraced <HI>Luther</HI>'s Reformation: 1564, they obtained from <HI>Maximilian</HI> that Liberty which <HI>Ferdinand</HI> I. had deny'd them; which lasted but one Year. In 1575. they obtained their Liberty again, which was confirm'd in the Year 1611. by <HI>Rodolphus</HI> II. <HI>Matthias</HI> the next Emperor not maintaining these Grants, they chose <HI>Frederick</HI> Elector Palatine King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and Crown'd him at <HI>Prague</HI> in 1619. This caused a War with the House of <HI>Austria:</HI> The Elector being eject∣ed by force of Arms in the Year 1620, for 30 Years following, <HI>Germany</HI> became an <HI>Acheldama,</HI> a Field of Blood; and the Reformation was ruined by an Edict made in 1630. And the House of <HI>Austria</HI> in <HI>Germa∣ny</HI> was in almost equal danger. <HI>Albertus</HI> Duke of <HI>Austria</HI> obtained this Crown by Election in the Year 1437. And in the Year 1526, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria</HI> was freely elected after the former Branch had been discontinu'd; since which time there has been no Interruption but that unfortunate one made by <HI>Frederick</HI> Elector Palatine; so that it is become, by the Strength of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> and the Weak∣ness of the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> an Hereditary Kingdom to the House of <HI>Austria.</HI> The King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> is the first secular Elector of the Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> though it be no part of the Empire.</P>

The Successors of this Prince augment∣ed this City, and strengthened it with new Fortisica∣tions. <HI>Solyman</HI> II. Emperor of the <HI>Turks</HI> took it first in 1526. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> retook it the next Year after.

In 1475. it was taken by <HI>Mahomet the Great;</HI> ever since it has been in the hands of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and though by them much ruin'd, is still the principal Place in that Demy-Island. The <HI>Turks</HI> govern it by a <HI>Bashaw</HI> they send thither; and although the <HI>Tartars</HI> can possess them∣selves of it when they please, yet they chuse rather to leave it in his hands than to take it into their own. The <HI>Venetians</HI> have often sollicited a free Commerce with it for the Benefit of its Commodities: but the Port has constantly refused to suffer their Vessels to pass into the Black Sea for Reasons of State. They reckon about 4000 Houses of <HI>Mahometans, Tartars,</HI> and <HI>Christians;</HI> whereof some <HI>Latins, Greeks,</HI> and some <HI>Armenians,</HI> to the Number of about 800, who are obliged to wear a Distinction from the rest in their Bonnets.</P>

The Inhabitants are so barbarous, that they are called by this Name from their rude way of living, which signifies the Lawless People; they were all heretofore Man-eaters, and ma∣ny of them continue such to this day. They call them∣selves Hottentots. Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Man, who was in these Parts, will scarce allow them to be perfect Men; and saith they sell Man's Flesh in the Shambles.

The Pa∣triarch of <HI>Alexandria</HI> resides here, who has six an∣tient <HI>Greek</HI> Churches in the place; there are many more belonging to the <HI>Cophtites;</HI> for whose Convi∣ction in the business of <HI>Nestorianisme,</HI> a Council was held here in 1582. by the order of Pope <HI>Gre∣gory</HI> XIII. but without effect, tho the Patriarch of the <HI>Cophtites</HI> had been first gain'd over to the Perswasion of the <HI>Latens.</HI> They have an Aqueduct of 350 Arches, which brings the water from the River to the Town.

<P><HI>Carthago, <HI>Carthage,</HI></HI> call'd by the <HI>Grecians</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, was once the most famous and potent City in <HI>Africa,</HI> and the Rival of <HI>Rome;</HI> generally suppo∣sed to be built by Queen <HI>Dido,</HI> a <HI>Tyrian</HI> Princess, <HI>An.

But then <HI>Justin</HI> makes it to be built before <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Appian</HI> before the Ru∣in of <HI>Troy,</HI> and this is now thought the more pro∣bable Opinion. The Learned <HI>Vossius</HI> in his Book <HI>de Magnitudine Ʋrbium,</HI> is confident that it was not only built before the <HI>Trojan</HI> War, but in its greatest Dignity, Extent and Power before that time; and that <HI>Dido</HI> was only the Repairer of it, and that it was much older than <HI>Tyre</HI> itself. But however certain it is, that it was a <HI>Phaenician</HI> Colony. It subjected by degrees, not only all <HI>Lybia,</HI> but a great part of the adjacent Islands, and the greatest part of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Sicily.</HI> It sustained 3 sharp Wars with <HI>Rome,</HI> the first lasted 24 years, the second 18, and had ended in the Ruin of <HI>Rome,</HI> if the <HI>Carihaginians</HI> had but sup∣plied their General effectually, and in time.

Yet it was made a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony, and rebuilt under the <HI>Gracchi,</HI> 25 years after the Ruin of it; and was, as <HI>Vell. Pater∣culus</HI> affirms, the first Colony the <HI>Romans</HI> sent out of <HI>Italy.</HI> After this it flourished greatly, and the Primate of it had 125 Suffragan Bishops under him. A Council held here in the year 348. condemned the Rebaptization of such as were baptized by Hereticks. And divers others were here assembled in the Primi∣tive Ages, sometimes by the Catholick▪ Prelates, some∣times by the Schismaticks and Hereticks, as they are called in the Languages of their respective Commu∣nities. <HI>An.

About the year 632, it fell into the hands of the <HI>Saracens,</HI> who made it Tributary only; before the year 684, they took it again, and treated the Inhabitants with great cruelty. About 690, <HI>Ju∣stinian</HI> II. recovered it again from them. About the year 703, the <HI>Saracens</HI> returned the third time, and made a third Conquest of it, ever since which time they have enjoyed it to the total ruin of Christianity, and when in 1269. it was again retaken by <HI>Lewis</HI> IX. the <HI>Saracens</HI> soon recovered it, and totally ruined it▪ This City lies 15 Miles West from <HI>Tunis;</HI> Long. 34. 50.

Thus it became the Metropolis of <HI>Achaia:</HI> in after-times it had <HI>Despots,</HI> or Princes of its own, from whom it passed to the <HI>Vene∣tians</HI> by their Grant. But in 1458. <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. dis∣possed that Republick of this Noble City; and they have since treated it with so much <HI>Tarkish</HI> cruelty, that there are not many Houses in it, inhabited by poor Men, rather out of necessity, than choice.

<P><HI>Daman</HI> or <HI>Damaon,</HI> a celebrated Port on the West of <HI>Malabar</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Guzurate,</HI> upon the Coast of the Gulph of <HI>Cambaia,</HI> twenty Leagues from <HI>Surate,</HI> in 20. deg. of Northern Latitude: in the hands of the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> who built it, and have so strongly fortified it, that the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> in vain of late besieged it with forty thousand men.</P>
<P><HI>Damascus,</HI> is the principal and the most ancient Town in <HI>Syria:</HI> seated in a Plain upon the <HI>Chry∣sorrhoas,</HI> or a River called the <HI>Golden Stream</HI> by the Ancients; surrounded with Mountains, one hundred and forty Miles from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to the South, and <HI>Antioch</HI> to the North. This City is so ancient, that it is not known when or by whom it was built; but it is mentioned by <HI>Abraham.</HI> In the succeeding Ages of the World, it followed the Fate of <HI>Syria,</HI> succes∣sively subject to all the four great Empires, and fa∣mous under all. But then the Conversion of S. <HI>Paul,</HI> which happened in part near and in part within this City, is one of the greatest things that has in the Course of so many Ages befallen it. This was also one of the first great Cities the <HI>Saracens</HI> took from the <HI>Romans,</HI> after a Siege of six Months, in 636. by <HI>O∣mar</HI> the Successor of <HI>Abubecher.</HI> In 813. it was made the Seat of one of their <HI>Califs. Babylon</HI> being the second, and <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> the third. <HI>Conra∣dus</HI> III. Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> attempted in 1147. to reduce it, without any good Success, by reason of the Divisions amongst the Christians in the Holy Land. In 1298. it was taken by <HI>Cassan</HI> the <HI>Turk,</HI> and 30000 <HI>Saracens</HI> slain; but the <HI>Saracens</HI> soon after recove∣red it. About 1395. it became a Prey to that <HI>Flagel∣lum Dei,</HI> (<HI>Tamerlane</HI>) the great <HI>Scythian</HI> Conque∣ror: After this it was subject to the Sultans of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> till <HI>Selim</HI> I. about 1514. subjected it to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, under which it still is. This City is an Archbishop's See under the Patriarch of <HI>Antioch;</HI> the Seat of one of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Visiers; in a fruitful Val∣ley, so extreamly pleasant withal, as amongst many Writers to gain the Title of the <HI>Paradise of the World.</HI> Yet not mightily inhabited of later times; being more visited by Pilgrims of the Turkish and Christian Reli∣gions, than by Merchants. The Current of the Trade running by <HI>Aleppo,</HI> fifty Miles more North. It is now called by the <HI>Turks Scham.</HI> Long. 69. 00. Lat. 33. 00.</P>

<P><HI>Damiata,</HI> a City of <HI>Egypt,</HI> upon one of the more Eastern Mouths of the <HI>Nile:</HI> Anciently called <HI>Tamia∣tis</HI> or <HI>Damiata,</HI> and now by the <HI>Arabians Damiat.</HI> This City stands on the opposite Shoar to <HI>Pelusium,</HI> and grew out of the Ruins of it. Taken by the Christians in 1218. But in 1221. they were forced to restore it, being involved in such Miseries by the Waters that were let loose upon them, that they must otherwise have perished. After this it was reta∣ken by <HI>Lewis</HI> IX. in 1249. who being afterwards taken Prisoner by the <HI>Sultan,</HI> was forced to restore it as his Ransom; after which the <HI>Saracens</HI> burnt it. This is an Archbishops See under the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria;</HI> and now a great, well peopled City, and one of the Keys of that Country. Long. 63. 20. Lat. 31. 10.</P>

So watered by two other Rivers, the <HI>Rodaun</HI> and the <HI>Motlau;</HI> towards the South and West it has some Hills, which in 1656. were first fortified against the <HI>Swedes.</HI> This City is Imperial and Free, belonging originally to the Empire. <HI>Primislaus</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> in 1295. first walled it against the Knights of the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Order, as <HI>Cromerus</HI> saith, <HI>lib.</HI> 11. After this it was betrayed to the Marquess of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> by one <HI>Peter Chancellor</HI> of <HI>Pomerania,</HI> who being in wrath with <HI>Ʋladislaus Lochicus</HI> his Master, King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Castle thereupon surprised by the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Order, (who pretended to assist <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI>) they demanded a vast Sum of Money, which the Citi∣zens refusing to pay, they proceeded to take the Ci∣ty, to plunder and slay great Numbers of the Inha∣bitants. In 1310. <HI>Sigismundus Augustus</HI> took away half the Customs upon their Disrespect to his Ambas∣sador, who was sent to quiet them, then in Tumult and Disorder: He reserved also the greater Causes to the Determination of the Diet of <HI>Poland,</HI> contrary to the Privilege granted by <HI>Casimirus</HI> his Predecessor. In 1569. <HI>Stephanus</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> proscrib'd them, for taking part with the House of <HI>Austria</HI> against him; which Quarrel was ended by the Mediation of the Neighbouring Princes. In 1597. <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> IV. had also some Controversies with this City about their Im∣posts. The Protestant Religion is imbraced here, the Roman Catholick tolerated. No Man is admitted into the Senate, except he be a <HI>Luthoran.</HI> In 1596. the Senate granted the Jesuits the Monastery of S. <HI>Bridget,</HI> and S. <HI>Maries</HI> Church; but the City op∣posed it so vigorously, that three Days after they were forced to recall their Edict. In 1657. this City was forced to burn her own Suburbs to prevent their being taken by the <HI>Swedes.</HI> It lies in Long 41. 30. Lat. 54. 20.</P>

At <HI>Leucy</HI> it entereth <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and a little fur∣ther from the South receiveth the <HI>Leck,</HI> which passeth by <HI>Ausprugh;</HI> and still continuing its Course as far as <HI>Regensburgh,</HI> it then turns and runs more Easterly to the Confines of <HI>Austria,</HI> where at <HI>Passaw</HI> it enter∣tains the vast River <HI>Inn,</HI> which comes from <HI>Inspruck,</HI> and brings many other with it; from hence it goeth to <HI>Vienna,</HI> where it makes an Island; then washeth the Walls of <HI>Presburgh</HI> the Capital of the <HI>Ʋpper Hungary,</HI> where it divides and makes the Island of <HI>Schut:</HI> at <HI>Comora</HI> it unites again, and goes on to <HI>Gran,</HI> bending its Course more Southerly; from whence it passeth to <HI>Buda</HI> the Capital of all <HI>Hunga∣ry,</HI> where it makes two other Islands, one above <HI>Bu∣da,</HI> and another a little below <HI>Colocza.</HI> The <HI>Sara∣witz,</HI> which comes from <HI>Alba-Regalis,</HI> falls into it from the West; then the <HI>Drave</HI> at <HI>Esseck;</HI> then the <HI>Tibiscus</HI> a vast River of <HI>Ʋpper Hungary</HI> from the East; and the <HI>Save</HI> again on the West by <HI>Belgrade,</HI> which is the first Town of <HI>Servia:</HI> from hence its Course is more East, having <HI>Moldavia, VValachia,</HI> and <HI>Bialogrod</HI> on the North, <HI>Servia</HI> and <HI>Bulgaria</HI> on the South; where it makes many Isles, and then entereth the <HI>Euxine</HI> or <HI>Black</HI> Sea by three great Outlets; the two more Northerly, being as it were reunited in the very Entry of them into the Sea. Dr. <HI>Edward Browne,</HI> in his Travels, saith; That at <HI>Crainburgh,</HI> not far distant from the Head, it appea∣red a considerable Stream; a little after from the City <HI>Ʋlm</HI> in <HI>Suevia,</HI> where it beginneth to be Navigable, it continues a long Course; passing by <HI>Ingolstad, Ra∣tisbone, Straubing, Passaw, Lintz</HI> and <HI>Vienna,</HI> un∣to <HI>Presburgh;</HI> from whence through <HI>Hungary</HI> it makes a Course of above three hundred Miles, before it passes by <HI>Belgrade.</HI> It drinks in above sixty con∣siderable Rivers; and in a sober Account performs a Course of above 1500 Miles, from its Rise to its Fall. This River has had many Naval Fights upon it between the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Christians.</HI> At one time there were twenty Galliots, eighty small Pinnaces, and little less than a hundred Ships of Burthen employed upon it, in a Siege of <HI>Buda.</HI> At the Siege of <HI>Belgrade, Mahomet</HI> the Great brought two hundred Ships and Galleys up the Stream; the <HI>Hungarians</HI> sent so many from <HI>Buda</HI> down the Stream, that after a sharp En∣counter, the <HI>Hungarians</HI> took twenty, and forced the rest on shoar near the Camp; so that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was forced to burn them to prevent their being taken by the Christians. This perhaps is more than can be said of any other River in the World. It abounds in good Fish, as Trouts, Perches, large and delicious Carps, exceeding (saith Dr. <HI>Browne</HI>) any I have seen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> some of which is every Year salted, and sent into other Parts. This River, to conclude, was for many Ages the Boundary on this Side of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Empire, and against the barbarous Nations; ac∣cordingly the <HI>Roman</HI> Legions had their Stations upon its Banks: they were the Founders of many of the Cities; and many memorable Actions in those early Days happened near it, sometimes between the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> themselves, and sometimes between them and the <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>

After which the Temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> was so consumed in a Storm of Thunder and Lightning, that in S. <HI>Chrysostom's</HI> time only one Pillar, now nothing is remaining thereof.

The River <HI>Derwent</HI> divides it into two Parts, run∣ning North and South, and at last falls into <HI>Trent,</HI> which is its Southern Boundary. That Part which lies East of <HI>Derwent</HI> is plain and fruitful; the We∣stern Parts are more mountainous and barren, but a∣bound in Mines of Lead, Iron, Coals, and afford good Pasture for Sheep. In the South-East Part of this County upon the River <HI>Derwent,</HI> lieth the City of <HI>Derby,</HI> which first takes its Name from the River, and then lends it to the County: A fine, rich, well∣traded City. On the East Side it has <HI>Derwent,</HI> cove∣red by a Stone-Bridge; on the South it hath a clear Rivolet called <HI>Mertenbrook:</HI> and within it five Pa∣rish-Churches. <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Stanley</HI> was created Earl of <HI>Darby</HI> in 1486. by <HI>Henry</HI> VII. in the first Year of his Reign. The present <HI>VVilliam Stanley,</HI> who is the ninth Earl of this Family (and the fourth of <HI>England</HI>) succeeded <HI>Charles</HI> his Father in 1672.

<P><HI>Darda,</HI> a strong Fort at the North end of the Bridge of <HI>Esseck,</HI> built by the <HI>Turks</HI> in 1686. and taken by the <HI>Germans</HI> when they burnt the Bridge: Retaken by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> in 1687. and de∣signed to be fortified, but soon after deserted rather, that the <HI>Turks</HI> might have a free Passage to their ruin, as came to pass <HI>Aug.</HI> 12. 1687. when they received the greatest Overthrow near this Place, which has be∣fallen them in this last Century.

<P>The <HI>Dardanelles, <HI>Dardanium, Dardania,</HI></HI> are two Castles built by <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. The one in <HI>Europe,</HI> where anciently stood <HI>Cestos;</HI> the other in <HI>Asia,</HI> in the place of <HI>Abidos,</HI> upon the streightest part of the <HI>Helespont.</HI> They stand two hundred Miles South of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> as being the Keys of that City. The famous <HI>Monsieur Thevenot,</HI> who saw them in 1655. thus describes them (as he is translated). That which is in <HI>Romania,</HI> on the Side of <HI>Europe,</HI> is built in a triangular Form, at the Foot of an Hill, which com∣mands and covers it; where there is a little Town. This Castle hath three Towers covered with Lead, whereof two are towards the Land, and the third which is the biggest, upon the Harbor. It hath (said he) as I could discern with a Perspective-Glass, about twenty Port-holes▪ level with the Water; in which, besides what I could observe by my Glasses, I was as∣sured that a Man might easily creep into some of the Guns, they were of such a prodigious Bore. The o∣ther on the <HI>Asia</HI> Side is in a Plain, and seemed to me to be almost square. It hath three Towers on each Side, and a Dungeon or Platform in the Middle, but not so many Port-holes as the other. These Castles are of no Strength to Landward, being only designed against Ships, as Mr. <HI>Sandys</HI> and all observe; but they were kept by strong Garrisons. This Place is famous for the Loves of <HI>Hero</HI> and <HI>Leander,</HI> the Pas∣sage of <HI>Xerxes</HI> by a Bridge of Boats, the Passage of the <HI>Turks</HI> a little above these Castles; and of later times for three Naval Victories obtained here by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> in 1655, 1656, and 1657. Since that the <HI>Turks</HI> have built two other Castles, which bear just upon the entrance of the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> about three Miles more South than the old <HI>Dardanelles.</HI> That on <HI>Asia</HI> Side lieth not above two Miles from <HI>Troas</HI> upon a flat Ground. That on <HI>Europe,</HI> on the side of a Hill, with round Towers, and several Ascents after the old Fashion, as Mr. <HI>VVheeler</HI> observes; which, he saith, were built since Mr. <HI>Sandys's</HI> time, and in all probabi∣lity since 1655. upon the Occasion of those <HI>Venetian</HI> Victories. The <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Lepanto</HI> and <HI>Patras,</HI> at the entrance of the Bay or Gulph of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> the <HI>Dar∣danelles,</HI> by way of Allusion. There are two other such Castles call'd the <HI>Dardanelles</HI> of the Gulph of <HI>Larta</HI> in <HI>Epirus,</HI> eighty <HI>English</HI> Miles North-West from <HI>Lepanto.</HI></P>

Towards this River stands the City <HI>Darha</HI> in <HI>Darha</HI> properly so called, which is one of the three Parts this Country is divided into: the others being <HI>Itata</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Teslete.</HI> This Country lies between the Kingdom of <HI>Morocco, Tesset,</HI> and <HI>Segellomessa;</HI> under the Obedience of the King of <HI>Teslete,</HI> who is a Tributary to the Emperor of <HI>Morocco.</HI> It abounds particularly with excellent Palm-Trees.</P>

The <HI>Danish</HI> Writers derive its Name, and pre∣tend to give a Catalogue of their Kings, from <HI>Dan</HI> the Son of <HI>Jacob.</HI> It is a cold Climate, but fruitful enough in Corn, Cattle and Fish; and the greatest Revenue of the Crown comes from the Toll that is payed for pas∣sing the <HI>Sound.</HI></P>

P. <HI>Eugenius</HI> III. made it an Archbishops See, with the Title and Ju∣risdiction of a Primacy. <HI>Henry</HI> II. having Conquered <HI>Ireland,</HI> sent hither from <HI>Bristol</HI> a Colony: where∣by it began to Flourish more and more, and became the Capital of the Kingdom, the Seat of the Lieu∣tenant, the Courts of Justice, and their Parliaments: strengthened with a Castle on the East side, built by <HI>Henry Loundres</HI> a Bishop in 1220. and near it there was a Royal Palace built by <HI>Henry</HI> II. King of <HI>England.</HI> It has a College for Students, which is an University of it self, founded by Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in in 1591. This was attempted before by <HI>Alexander Bicknor</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Dublin,</HI> who in 1320. ob∣tained from the Pope a Bull for it; but the trouble∣some times that followed, defeated that good design then; at the North Gate is a Bridge of hewen Stone, built by King <HI>John.</HI> It has a Cathedral of great anti∣quity, Dedicated to S. <HI>Patrick,</HI> the Apostle of the <HI>Irish</HI> Nation, and built at several times; in which are a Dean, two Archdeacons, and twenty two Pre∣bendaries: there is another fair Collegiate Church in the City, called Christs Church, built in 1012. and about thirteen Parochial ones. In more ancient times this City was Governed by a Provost; but in 1409. <HI>Henry</HI> IV. granted them License to choose every year a Mayor, and two Bailiffs, changed into Sheriffs by <HI>Edward</HI> IV. thus far <HI>Cambden.</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> II. honored them with a Lord Mayor. This City escaping the fury of the Massacre, was besieged by the Parlia∣ment Forces; and by the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> by the Kings Order, delivered to the <HI>English,</HI> rather than the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebels; for they were now united against their King: and when afterwards <HI>June</HI> 21. 1649. he in∣deavoured to recover it, his Army was broken by a Sally, and totally defeated; and this City continued in their Hands till 1660. It has been extraordina∣rily enlarged in its Buildings in the twenty years last past.</P>

The Duke of <HI>Schomberg</HI> continued with his Army here from <HI>Sept.</HI> 12. 1689, to <HI>Novemb.</HI> 8. that he retired into Winter Quarters. There was a Battel in the mean time pre∣sented by King <HI>James</HI> II; but that General thought not fit to accept it.

Sixty Sail of Ships, which lay then in the Harbour, yielded too: after which <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and S. <HI>Andrews,</HI> which only re∣mained to the <HI>Covenanters,</HI> yielded upon the first Summons.</P>

In the Year of the World 3512. being much streightned by its Fugitives, it had re∣course to the Assistance of the <HI>Corinthians:</HI> but the <HI>Corcyreans</HI> taking part with those Exiles, the <HI>Corin∣thians</HI> were beaten; which drew on an <HI>Athenian</HI> War, and that the <HI>Peloponnesian.</HI> This City fell first with the rest of <HI>Greece</HI> under the Power of the Kings of <HI>Macedonia;</HI> and together with <HI>Macedonia</HI> was subject to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who made it a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony. In the times of the Civil War between <HI>Cae∣sar</HI> and <HI>Pompey,</HI> it was the Seat of great Actions: for <HI>Pompey</HI> chose it, and it was the only prosperous Scene of that Party; and had proved the ruin of <HI>Caesar,</HI> if <HI>Pompey</HI> had pursued his first successes with vigor. Not long before, it had given entertainment to <HI>Cicero</HI> in his Exile; and appears every where favourable to the Republicans. It was also a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony, but when setled I cannot now find. In the times of Christia∣nity it became an Archbishops See under the Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> as it is still; in the later times of the <HI>Greek</HI> Empire it had Princes of the <HI>Caroline</HI> Line of <HI>France,</HI> from whom it passed to the <HI>Venetians;</HI> and from them it was taken by <HI>Mahomet</HI> III. But the <HI>Venetians</HI> Sacked it in 1554. by their Fleet. Long. 44. 20. Lat. 41. 42.</P>
<P><HI>Duren, <HI>Dura, Duria, Marcodurum,</HI></HI> a City in the Dukedom of <HI>Juliers</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> upon the River <HI>Roer,</HI> not two Miles from <HI>Gulick</HI> to the South, and five from <HI>Cologne</HI> to the West. This was the ancient <HI>Marcodurum,</HI> in the opinion of <HI>Cluverius,</HI> and all the other Geographers; made a Free Imperial City by <HI>Charles</HI> IV. Emperor of <HI>Germany. Charles</HI> V. being incensed against <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Cleves,</HI> (who had married <HI>Mary,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>William▪</HI> the last Duke of <HI>Juliers;</HI> and Leagued▪ with the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Francis</HI> I. against him) in 1545. entred the Dukedom of <HI>Juliers,</HI> and after a sharp Siege took this City and burnt it: it has been reduced into sub∣jection again, and is now under the Duke of <HI>New∣bourg,</HI> by the Treaty of <HI>Faisans</HI> in 1659.

<P><HI>Durham, <HI>Dunehelmum,</HI></HI> a City and County Pala∣tine in the North of <HI>England.</HI> The City is seated up∣on the River <HI>Ware,</HI> in a Peninsula made by this Ri∣ver, which washeth three sides of it, and gives pas∣sage into it by three Bridges. The ground of it is a natural Hill, which contributes no less than the River to the strength and pleasantness of its situation: also secured by a Wall, and a Castle in the midst of it; the Cathedral (being a Bishops See, under the Arch∣bishop of <HI>York</HI>) is towards the South side of the City, and of great beauty. This City is yet of no great Antiquity, being built or rather begun by the <HI>Monks</HI> of <HI>Dindisfarn,</HI> in 995. before which it was a Wood, and then not cleared without difficulty. In the times of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror it was imployed by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> as a place of Refuge against him; but they were soon forced to betake themselves to <HI>Scotland</HI> for their greater security. <HI>VVilliam</HI> the Conqueror being possessed of it, built the Castle for a Curb to these Northern parts, and a security against the <HI>Scots.</HI> The present Cathedral was began about the same time by <HI>VVilliam de Careleph</HI> then Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> and finished by his Successor. This City gave great Pro∣tection to the <HI>English</HI> in 1346, when <HI>David Bruce,</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> harrassed the Nothern parts, whilst <HI>Edward</HI> III. besieged <HI>Calais:</HI> but the said <HI>Bruce</HI> was soon after overthrown in Battel, and taken Priso∣ner at <HI>Nevills Cross.</HI> In the times of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. the Bishoprick was dissolved by Act of Parliament, and given to that Prince; but Q. <HI>Mary</HI> dissolved that Statute, and restored the Bishoprick with all its Fran∣chises. In 1640. in the beginning of the Rebellion, it fell after <HI>Newbury</HI> Fight into the hands of the <HI>Scots;</HI> and being left by them the year following, it followed the fate of the War, as the Parties prevailed upon each other. Long. 22. 00. Lat. 54. 57.</P>
<P>The County or Bishoprick of Durham, is bounded on the North and West by the River <HI>Derwent,</HI> which separates it from <HI>Northumberland;</HI> on the South by the River <HI>Tees,</HI> which parts it from <HI>Westmorland</HI> West,

and <HI>York</HI> to the South; and on the East it has the Sea. The West is full of Mines of Iron; the Valleys are fruitful here also, and on the Eastern side the Coun∣try is very fruitful of Grass, Corn and Sea-Coal. Though all the <HI>English</HI> Kings were liberal to this Church upon the account of S. <HI>Cuthbert;</HI> yet <HI>Gu∣thrun</HI> the <HI>Dane</HI> was the first that granted this Bi∣shoprick o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> County to the Church of <HI>Durham;</HI> which was afterward confirmed by <HI>Canutus,</HI> another <HI>Danish</HI> Prince, and by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror; ever since which time, it has been accounted a <HI>County Pala∣tine.</HI> Dr. <HI>Nathaniel Crew,</HI> the present Bishop of this Diocese, (being the LXX. in number from S. <HI>Aida∣nus</HI>) was translated from <HI>Oxford</HI> hither in the year 1674.</P>

<P><HI>Egypt, <HI>Aegyptus,</HI></HI> called by the Inhabitants <HI>Chi∣bili,</HI> by the <HI>Arabians, Bardamasser;</HI> by the <HI>Turks, Misir,</HI> (which is very near the <HI>Hebrew, Mis∣raim</HI>); by the <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards l' Egitto;</HI> by the <HI>Germans, Egypten;</HI> Is the first, the most fruitful, most ancient, most celebrated King∣dom of all <HI>Africa:</HI> on the North it has the <HI>Medi∣terranean</HI> Sea; on the East <HI>Arabia Deserta,</HI> and the <HI>Red</HI> Sea; on the South <HI>Aethiopia;</HI> on the West <HI>Cy∣rene,</HI> and the Deserts of <HI>Lybia.</HI> The River <HI>Nile</HI> running the whole length of it, and towards the <HI>Me∣diterranean</HI> Sea dividing it self into many Branches, is the only cause of its Fertility, by overflowing it every year in the Month of <HI>June.</HI> It is, saith <HI>Cluve∣rius,</HI> from the City of <HI>Pelusium,</HI> to the Cataracts of the <HI>Nile,</HI> one hundred and fifty Miles: from the same place to <HI>Conza</HI> in the West, it is one hundred Miles broad; in some places towards the South (as Mr. <HI>San∣dys</HI> saith) above <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> it is for a long Tract consined between barren Mountains, in many scarce four, in few above eight Miles broad. But then he extends it from North to South five hundred and sixty Miles, and in breadth one hundred and forty <HI>English</HI> Miles at the North end. Long. from 60. d. to 67. South Lat. from 22. to 31. This Country was peopled by <HI>Misraim</HI> the Son of <HI>Chus,</HI> the Grandchild of <HI>Noah</HI> by <HI>Ham;</HI> and maintained its Liberty under Princes of its own, till God gave them into the hands of <HI>Nebu∣chadonosor</HI> in the year of the World 3365. five years after the ruine of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> by the same Prince. Yet that Empire lying far off, and being much shaken by intestine Divisions, they recovered their Liberty again. <HI>Cambyses</HI> reduced them the second time in the year of the World 3425. <HI>Xerxes</HI> conquered them about the year 3473. And yet <HI>Artaxerxes Ochus</HI> was necessi∣tated to reduce them again; for they set up Princes of their own, and beat his Generals: so he went in Per∣son; and having driven their King into <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> he levelled their strongest Fortifications, and made them so weak and helpless, that they have been in Servi∣tude ever since. This Prince began his Reign in 3587. Reigned twenty three years, and conquered them in 3602. <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> became their Master next in 3620. to whom they most willingly submitted, out of a detestation of the <HI>Persian</HI> Go∣vernment. <HI>Ptolomy</HI> the Son of <HI>Lagus</HI> began his Reign over them in 3626. and <HI>Cleopatra</HI> the last of his Posterity, destroyed her self to avoid Captivity, in the year of the World 3920. eighteen years before the Birth of our Saviour. From thence forward they were under the <HI>Romans.</HI> This wretched Nation cal∣led in at length <HI>Haymaria</HI> III. of the <HI>Saracen Califfs,</HI> and by his help cast out the <HI>Greek</HI> Garrisons about 862. In 1163. another Race succeeded, called the <HI>Turkish</HI> Kings, or <HI>Califfs;</HI> which ended in 1245. when the <HI>Mamalucks</HI> (or Slaves of that Race) depo∣sed their Masters, and erected an Elective Kingdom out of their own Body: the Prince whereof was for many Ages chosen out of a number of Men, who be∣gan in Slavery, and whose Profession was War; they were in some sort the <HI>Janizaries</HI> of that Age. <HI>To∣nombeius</HI> II. the last of them in 1517. was forced to submit to the prevailing Valour and Fortune of <HI>Sely∣mus,</HI> one of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Princes, under whom that Nation still groans. And now let any man compare the ancient and present Maps of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and his Eyes will shew him in one minute, the difference between the ancient and the later Government. The fruitful and populous Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> styled by the <HI>Romans</HI> the <HI>Granary of their Empire,</HI> that was of old overspred with Cities and Towns, being now almost desolate, and all its ancient Glory, Magnificence, Riches and People, buried in Rubbish and Ruins: Names of Places that have no Inhabitants, or Pictures of Beasts and Antiquities, is almost all that is to be found here. <HI>Grandcairo, Alexandria, Rossetta</HI> and <HI>Damiata,</HI> are the only considerable places left of three thousand Towns that <HI>Strabo</HI> says there were in his time; and of the eighteen thousand that Antiquity beheld in the Ages before. Christianity is almost totally extirpated here, as it is in <HI>Barbary:</HI> and whereas the ancient <HI>Egyptians</HI> acquired a mighty reputation over all the <HI>East,</HI> by their good Literature, which drew the <HI>Philo∣sophers</HI> of <HI>Greece</HI> to travel to them; and particularly <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Eudoxus,</HI> to live amongst them thirteen years; the <HI>Egyptians</HI> being the famed Inventors of most of the <HI>Sciences,</HI> expressed after an admirable manner in <HI>Hieroglyphieks,</HI> which with their <HI>Lunar</HI> years, their Deities, the long <HI>Dynasties</HI> of their Kings, their Customs of <HI>Polygamy,</HI> Government, and Worship, so charming to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> have been the subjects of the Pens of the Learned in divers Ages; Now an universal Ignorance and Barbarity possesses their Coun∣try. But I must not be long in so short a Work.</P>

It was divided by the <HI>Romans</HI> into five Parts, by the <HI>Saxons</HI> into seven Kingdoms, and now into forty one Shires or Counties: In which the Parishes amount to about ten thousand. The Air is very Temperate, both in Winter and Summer, being warmed in the one, and cooled in the other by the Sea-Vapors; the Soil for the most part very fruitful; watered with three hundred twenty five Rivers. The Inhabitants, Valiant and Industrious. And as Nature has given it whatever is absolutely necessary to the Life of Man; so the Natives by their Trade and Commerce, bring in from abroad, what may be had throughout the World, for Convenience, Delight, Magnificence, and Ornament. It has also the best Government, and the best constituted Religion, of any Nation in the World; and as much Learning, Civility, Arts and Trade as any other. Our Fleets excel at Sea, our Foot at Land, those of all other Nations. In short, we want nothing to make us happy, but Gratitude to God, and Union amongst our selves. This Island be∣came first known to the <HI>Romans,</HI> about fifty years be∣fore the Birth of Christ. <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> entered it with a Fleet in the Year of the World 3895. and renewed his Attempt the year following; but the Civil Wars breaking out between him and <HI>Pomper,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> made little Progress here, (though they kept their Ground) till the Reign of <HI>Claudius;</HI> who entered <HI>Britain</HI> in Person, and staying not long, his General, <HI>Aulus Plautius,</HI> carried on the War; so that he took in the greatest part of this Island, now called <HI>England,</HI> and under him <HI>Vespasian</HI> learned the Art of War. <HI>Di∣dius Avitus</HI> succeeded as General, and <HI>Nero</HI> as Empe∣ror; under whom the <HI>Romans</HI> were in great Danger of an utter Extirpation from the <HI>Britains:</HI> But this Storm blowing over, they conquered all they cared for, as far the <HI>Fyrths</HI> of <HI>Galloway</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> only their ordinary and standing Bounds were between <HI>Newcastle</HI> and <HI>Carlisle.</HI> They conti∣nued their Possession till the year of Christ 433. and then withdrew to desend their nearer Dominions on the Continent, against the prevailing barbarous Nor∣thern Nations. In 449. the <HI>Saxons</HI> were called in to help the <HI>Britains</HI> against the <HI>Picts,</HI> (those Nations that had never been subject to the <HI>Romans,</HI> in the North of <HI>Britain.</HI>) In 455. <HI>Hengist,</HI> their General, set up the Kingdom of <HI>Kent,</HI> and began the Conquest of the <HI>British.</HI> By the year 819. the Heptarchy, or seven Kingdoms of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> united in one, under <HI>Egbert</HI> King of the <HI>West-Saxons;</HI> which Union re∣ceived its utmost Perfection under <HI>Alfrid,</HI> about 873. The <HI>Danes,</HI> who had given Occasion to this Union, pursuing their Depredations, at last conquered the <HI>Saxons</HI> in 1018. and set up <HI>Sweno,</HI> a Prince of their own. In 1042. <HI>Edward the Confessor</HI> restored the <HI>Saxon</HI> Line, which was broken by <HI>William</HI> the Con∣queror in 1066. But the Blood was again restored by <HI>Henry</HI> II. in 1155. <HI>Edward</HI> I. united <HI>Wales,</HI> in 1246. K. <HI>Henry</HI> II. began, and K. <HI>John</HI> finished the Conquest of <HI>Ireland,</HI> about the Year 1184. in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> I. his Brother. In the year 1602. <HI>James</HI> I. K. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> succeeding Qu <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> of Blessed Memory, united <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England.</HI> And the great Rebellion in 1640. ended in 1660. by the Re∣stitution of <HI>Charles,</HI> the Merciful and Just.

This City is so ancient, that it is generally believed to have been built by the <HI>Amazons.</HI> It stood at first on too low a Ground; and therefore suffering much by Inundations, <HI>Lysimachus,</HI> one of the Successors of <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> removed it into that place where it now is, and called it <HI>Arsinoe,</HI> by the Name of his Wife; but after his Death, it reassumed its anci∣ent Name. <HI>Pliny</HI> calls the Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> here built, <HI>Admirationem Graecae Magnificentiae, The Wonder of the</HI> Grecian <HI>Magnificence:</HI> and reckons it amongst the Wonders of the World: this was burnt by <HI>Erostratus,</HI> to perpetuate the Memory of his Name, that night <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> was born, in the one hundred and sixth <HI>Olympiad,</HI> and the three hundred ninety eighth year of <HI>Rome, i. e.</HI> three hundred fifty six years before <HI>Christ.</HI> Two hundred and twen∣ty years more afterwards were spent in rebuilding it, with the utmost Magnificence, at the charges of all the Provinces of <HI>Asia Minor.

In or near this place, <HI>Constantius</HI> defeated <HI>Magnen∣tius</HI> the Usurper, and Murtherer of <HI>Constantine</HI> II. in 359. The Town is great and populous, by reason of the Trade and Commerce on the account of the Passage. But not strong, and therefore the <HI>Turks</HI> have of late bestowed much cost and pains in for∣tifying it. In 1537. <HI>Solyman the Magnificent,</HI> as∣saulted it without Success. But that which is the great wonder, is the Bridge over the <HI>Drave,</HI> and the Marshes on both sides: this Bridge is five Miles over, having Rails on both sides, and Towers of Wood at every quarter of a Mile: built by <HI>Solyman the Mag∣nificent</HI> in 1521. so soon as ever he had taken <HI>Bel∣grade:</HI> it is so broad, that three Wagons may go a breast, and all built of Oaken Timber. Count <HI>Nicholas Serini</HI> burnt part of it in 1664. which necessitated the <HI>Turks</HI> to build that part a little nearer the <HI>Danube,</HI> because they could not without great charges and difficulty pluck up the remainder of the Trees which the Water had preserved from the Fire. By this Bridge all the <HI>Turkish</HI> Armies use to pass between <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Constantinople:</HI> near here, the unfortunate <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>Hungary</HI> in 1526 was defeated, in attempting to stop <HI>Solyman's</HI> passage into his Kingdom. Count <HI>Lesly, Aug.</HI> 15. 1685. burnt it the second time, and possessed himself of the Town of <HI>Esseck;</HI> but the Castle holding out, he blew up their Magazines, plundered the Town, and left it. In 1686. the <HI>Turks</HI> began to build this Bridge after another way, by driving rows of Trees into the Earth, and filling up the space with Earth, that it might not be so subject to be ruined by Fire: but the Duke of <HI>Lorrain, June</HI> 15. 1687. put an end to this Work; drove the <HI>Turks</HI> over the <HI>Drave,</HI> and in a few days in∣tirely ruined what eight thousand men had been many Months a building. Pursuing his design, and passing the <HI>Drave</HI> to take <HI>Esseck,</HI> he found the Prime <HI>Visier</HI> there posted with all the Forces he could raise very advantageously, with the <HI>Danube</HI> on the left, a Wood on the right, the Town and <HI>Drave</HI> behind, and a <HI>Morass</HI> before him; between which and his Camp, was a Dike twenty foot deep, forty broad, and two Miles long, strengthened with Palisadoes and Redoubts, with sixty thousand men within it, and one hundred Cannon: whereupon the Duke retreated, <HI>June</HI> 20. and repassed the <HI>Drave</HI> at <HI>Siclos.</HI> See <HI>Mohatz.</HI> Af∣ter the unfortunate taking of <HI>Belgrade</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI>

<P><HI>Etna, <HI>Aetna,</HI></HI> a Mountain in the East of <HI>Sicily,</HI> which perpetually belcheth out Fire and Smoak: cal∣led by the <HI>Italians, il Mongibello;</HI> by the <HI>French, Le Mont Gibel;</HI> by the <HI>Arabians, Gibel;</HI> that is, the Mountain. It is the greatest as well as the most known Mountain in all <HI>Sicily,</HI> in the Diocese of <HI>Ca∣tanea,</HI> nine Miles high, and fifty in compass; and at the opening or Mouth of it at the top, twenty four fur∣longs wide. The South side is planted with Vines, the North overgrown with Woods; on the East from the Top of it to <HI>Catanea</HI> it is all cultivated, and em∣ployed to one use or another. At some times it ra∣geth more than at others: particularly in 1169. 1329. (when it had not flamed of many years before,) 1408. 1444. 1447. 1536. 1554. 1566. 1579. At which last time it damaged <HI>Catanea,</HI> and its Fields, more than usual. But the greatest Rage was in 1669, when it sent out four Rivers of melted Earth, Stones and Rocks; which from the top descended down its sides, through the Fields, into the Sea; and there maintained their Torrent a Mile in the Waters, before they were able to tame these raving and furious Sons of <HI>Vulcan.</HI> Not only the City of <HI>Catanea</HI> ap∣prehended a sudden and inevitable Ruine, but Men thought the whole Island of <HI>Sicily</HI> would have been destroyed; and that by degrees the Fire would have melted the whole Rock, upon which the Island is founded: however, it destroyed fifteen Castles or great Houses, and did an inestimable Mischief.

<P><HI>Euphrates,</HI> though I have discoursed shortly of this River already in the word <HI>Aferat,</HI> yet because I then wanted some Books that were necessary to give a full account of it, I will here enlarge upon what I there omitted. The first City of Note it washeth, is <HI>Baberd;</HI> the second <HI>Ezrum,</HI> so far as it runs West; then it turns South, and passeth by <HI>Arzingan</HI> and <HI>Maaraz,</HI> where it takes in <HI>Cobaqueb;</HI> and over a∣gainst <HI>Ʋrpha,</HI> it receives a River which comes from <HI>Aleppo;</HI> so passing <HI>Bir, Rasseca, Belis, Chabuca,</HI> as far as <HI>Alchabar,</HI> it takes in from the East <HI>Soaid;</HI> and a little lower at <HI>Waset</HI> and <HI>Olim,</HI> falls into the <HI>Tigris:</HI> thus our latest Maps describe the Course of this vast River. The Learned <HI>Bochartus</HI> saith out of <HI>Pliny, Lib.</HI> 5. <HI>Cap.</HI> 26. that eighty three Miles beneath <HI>Zeug∣ma,</HI> at <HI>Massicen,</HI> the <HI>Euphrates</HI> is divided; and on the left hand (the East) it goes into <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> by <HI>Selucia,</HI> a little beneath which, it entereth the <HI>Ti∣gris. Ptolomy Lib.</HI> 5. <HI>Cap.</HI> 18. agrees with <HI>Pliny</HI> in this: then he mentions another Branch by the Name of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>the Kings River, or Cut:</HI> which by the <HI>Arabians</HI> is called <HI>Amelic;</HI> and by <HI>Am∣mianus, Naar-Malcha;</HI> which he interprets too the <HI>King's River, Lib.</HI> 24. which <HI>Abidenus</HI> saith, was digged by the Order of <HI>Nabuchodonozor. Pliny</HI> tells us, the reason of this Cut was to prevent the Drow∣ning of <HI>Babylon</HI> in great Floods. More to the South was a third Branch, which went into the <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Sur,</HI> upon which the great <HI>Babylon</HI> stood by the con∣fession of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> though in his Maps it is placed on the second. There was a fourth Branch went to the West, called <HI>Kulpa,</HI> now <HI>Cufa,</HI> about the Name of which they are not agreed; but the use of it was to fill a vast Lake on the West of <HI>Babylon.</HI> Now as to these Branches, the <HI>Arabian</HI> Geographers agree in these Divisions as still extant. And yet that Branch which went through <HI>Babylon, Theodoret</HI> saith, was very small, and perhaps now intirely lost. The first and second of the Eastern Branches are represented in our later Maps; and the Western Branch at <HI>Cufa;</HI> which appear all like Rivers running into the <HI>Eu∣phrates,</HI> when as indeed they are Branches going out of it. The first is that which the Maps call <HI>Zab Major;</HI> the second has no Name, but it ought to pass streight to <HI>Bagdet;</HI> and that which is now the main Stream, seems to have forced its way in a new Channel, after the other was lost and dammed up by Time: the Lakes also to the West which were designed to re∣ceive the Waters in times of great Inundations, are filled up by the Mud and Sand, brought down by the River. However that Branch that runs to <HI>Cufa,</HI> ne∣ver comes to any Sea, but is lost in the Sands of <HI>Arabia;</HI> and has turned the fruitful Plains of <HI>Baby∣lon</HI> into a mere <HI>Morass</HI> or <HI>Bogg,</HI> unpassable, unin∣habitable. This is the sum of what Mr. <HI>Bochart</HI> has related more at large. Both <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> agree, that it yearly overflows as the <HI>Nile</HI> does, and much about the same time; which Inundation has the same effect, as to the sertility of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> that the over∣flowing of the <HI>Nile</HI> has upon <HI>Egypt.</HI> M. <HI>Thevenot</HI> who crossed it at <HI>Bir,</HI> saith, it is in <HI>Semur</HI> not big∣ger

<P><HI>Europe, <HI>Europa,</HI></HI> is the least, but most celebrated of the four general parts of the World, as to Arts, Commerce, Religion, Government and War. It was the Prediction of <HI>Noah,</HI> (the second Founder of Mankind) that <HI>Japhet</HI> (the Father of the <HI>Europe∣ans</HI>) should dwell in the Tents of <HI>Shem.</HI> And al∣though the first Church, and the two first General Monarchies fell to the share of <HI>Shem's</HI> Posterity; yet the two last and the best and noblest state of the Church, fell to the <HI>Japhets;</HI> by which that ancient Oracle was fulfilled. At this day whilst the Posteri∣ty of <HI>Shem,</HI> (the <HI>Asiaticks</HI>) lie buried in Ignorance, Slavery and Superstition; the Posterity of <HI>Japhet</HI> is innobled: the chiefest and the best Empires, the best Religion, Learning and Arts adorn the Tents or dwelling of <HI>Japhet:</HI> whilst the Ships of <HI>Chittim</HI> afflict <HI>Eber</HI> and <HI>Asher,</HI> not only to Trade, but to Ride Sovereigns in their Seas; and afflict them more by the Envy of their Wealth and Riches, than by their Power and Martial Valor, though they have felt that too. <HI>Europe,</HI> is bounded on the East by <HI>Asia,</HI> on the North by the <HI>Frozen</HI> Sea, on the West by the <HI>At∣lantick,</HI> and on the South by the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> The only difficulty is in stating the Eastern Bounds: beginning therefore at the South, where the Bounds are plainer, it is agreed that the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> the <HI>Black</HI> Sea or <HI>Euxine,</HI> the <HI>Palus Moeotis,</HI> or Eastern Bay of <HI>Crim Tartary,</HI> (called by the <HI>French, la Mer de Zabacche,</HI>) the <HI>Tanais,</HI> now the <HI>Don,</HI> the <HI>Wolga,</HI> the <HI>Rooswa,</HI> the <HI>Tofda,</HI> and the vast River of <HI>Obb,</HI> are the truest Bounds on the Eastern side. In those vast Countries of <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>Russia,</HI> scarce at all known to the Ancients, though the <HI>Tanais,</HI> the <HI>Wolga,</HI> (as far as its Course is North and South) and the <HI>Obb,</HI> are the best and most visible Bounds; yet there is a great distance between the <HI>Tanais</HI> and the <HI>Wolga;</HI> and a much greater between the <HI>Wolga</HI> and the <HI>Obb;</HI> but between the <HI>Rooswa</HI> and the <HI>Tofda,</HI> very little: but in this every Man must be left at liberty. <HI>Europe</HI> is now divided into the Kingdoms of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland, Bohemia, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Ger∣many, Greece, Holland,</HI> or the <HI>Low Countries, Hun∣gary, Italy, Moscovy</HI> or <HI>Russia, Poland, Portugal, Sa∣voy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tartary,</HI> the <HI>Tur∣kish</HI> Empire, the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> and some few con∣siderable Islands depending upon these.

by Desarts or unknown Countries, from which it is separated by the Lake and River <HI>Ʋla Tresk:</HI> on the West it has the <HI>Botner</HI> Sea, a Branch of the <HI>Baltick;</HI> on the South the Bay of <HI>Finland,</HI> another Branch of it; and on the East, the Dominions of the Great Duke of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> It contains several very great Pro∣vinces, as <HI>Ciania, Tavasthia, Nylandia, Carelia, Sa∣volaxia,</HI> and <HI>Finland</HI> properly so called; which is the most Southern and most noble. <HI>Aboa</HI> a Town upon the River <HI>Aurojoki,</HI> over against the Isle of <HI>Aland,</HI> is the Capital of this Kingdom▪ and the Seat of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Viceroy. This Kingdom was first conquered to the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> in 1384, by <HI>Erick</HI> one of their Kings. In 1571, the <HI>Muscovites</HI> intending a Conquest fell into it with a Savageness and Cruelty hard to be expressed, or believed; but were recalled by an Irruption of the <HI>Tartars</HI> upon their own Countries. It is called by the Inhabitants and <HI>Swedes, Finner;</HI> by the <HI>Danes, Finder;</HI> by the <HI>Germans,</HI> Fennen; by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> Finlander. <HI>Cluverius</HI> saith, it is a considerable part of the King∣dom of <HI>Sweden;</HI> and that it is fruitful, and affords excellent Pasturage.</P>
<P><HI>Finmark, <HI>Finmarchia,</HI></HI> called by the Inhabitants <HI>Taakemarch</HI> and <HI>Finmark,</HI> is a Province of the Kingdom of <HI>Norway,</HI> on the Western Ocean. The Southern part of it is subject to the <HI>Danes;</HI> the Nor∣thern to the <HI>Swedes.</HI> This Country is barren, rocky, covered with dreadful Woods, full of Bears and Wolves, and other ravenous Beasts: the Inhabitants till of late lived in <HI>Summer,</HI> like the <HI>Nomades,</HI> wan∣dring from place to place, as the convenience of Wa∣ter and Pasture invited them. The Princes under whom they now are, to reduce them from this va∣grant way of living, granted the Lands to the first Occupant, by which means some parts are improved; but the more barren can be used no other way, and therefore are left still in common. The Inhabitants are a mongrel sort of Christians, extreamly ignorant and barbarous; infamous for Witchcraft, revengeful beyond belief, and as rugged as the Country they in∣habit.</P>
<P><HI>Fionda,</HI> a small Village on the Shoars of the <HI>Me∣diterranean</HI> Sea, in the Lesser <HI>Asia,</HI> in the Confines of <HI>Lycia</HI> and <HI>Pamphylia;</HI> which in the <HI>Roman</HI> times was called <HI>Phaselis,</HI> and before <HI>Pityussa:</HI> it lies East of the <HI>Chelidonian</HI> Rocks, and West of Mount <HI>Ma∣sicytus,</HI> two hundred and twenty <HI>English</HI> Miles from the most Western Cape of <HI>Cyprus.</HI> A Bishops See, under the Archbishop of <HI>Myra,</HI> now <HI>Stramita:</HI> but so very small, that little notice is taken of it in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter Maps.</P>

<P><HI>Flanders, <HI>Flandria,</HI></HI> by the Natives call'd <HI>Vlaen∣deren,</HI> is the greatest and noblest of those Seventeen Provinces called the <HI>Low Countries:</HI> Bounded on the East with <HI>Hainault</HI> and <HI>Brabant;</HI> on the West with the <HI>British</HI> Ocean; on the North with the Seas of <HI>Zealand;</HI> and on the South in part by <HI>Artois,</HI> and in part by <HI>Hainault</HI> and <HI>Picardy:</HI> of which <HI>Artois</HI> was at first a part, and after five or six descents, re∣united again to it. This Province, saith <HI>Ortelius,</HI> is most excellent Pasture, especially towards the West. It affords excellent Kine, and warlike Horses; and abounds in Butter, Cheese, and excellent Wheat. The People are much given to Merchandize and Cloath∣ing; their Linnen (having plenty of Flax and Hemp) exceeds all other Countries; and as to Woollen, they having the Wooll from <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> improve it by their industry to a wonder, and then supply all the World with the Product. But in this the zeal of <HI>Philip</HI> II. King of <HI>Spain,</HI> has altered the state of things in a great degree. This Province has twenty eight walled Towns or Cities, a thousand one hun∣dred and fifty Villages; besides Forts, Castles, and Noble Mens Houses; and a great number of Abbeys, Priories, Colleges, and Monasteries. It has five Vis∣counties, three Principalities, four Ports, and thirty one Chatellanies. The principal of which in <HI>Ortelius</HI> his time was <HI>Gaunt.</HI> This great Province was divided into three Parts; 1. <HI>Flanders Flammengant,</HI> bound∣ed on the East by the Imperial <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the <HI>Scheld;</HI> on the West by the <HI>British</HI> Seas; on the North by the Seas of <HI>Zealand;</HI> and on the South with <HI>Artois</HI> and <HI>Flanders Gallicant;</HI> the principal City of which was <HI>Gaunt.</HI> 2. <HI>Imperial Flanders,</HI> so called, because it was a Fee of the Empire; divided from <HI>Brabant,</HI> on the East by the River <HI>Dender;</HI> and from the <HI>Gallick Flanders</HI> on the West by the <HI>Scheld;</HI> on the North it has the River <HI>Dender,</HI> and on the South <HI>Hainault;</HI> the principal Town of this is <HI>Alost,</HI> whence it is now commonly called the County of <HI>Alost.</HI> 3. <HI>Flanders Gallicant,</HI> so called, because the <HI>French</HI> Tongue was heretofore most spo∣ken in it. This has <HI>Hainault</HI> on the East, <HI>Artois</HI> on the South, the <HI>British</HI> Sea on the West, and <HI>Flanders Flammigant</HI> on the North; from which it is parted by the River <HI>Leye;</HI> the chiefest Town is <HI>L'isle, Insula.</HI> First united to <HI>France</HI> by <HI>Dagobert</HI> one of their Kings; by whom about 621. it was granted to <HI>Liderick de Buque,</HI> with the Title of Forester. In 864. it was granted to <HI>Baldwin</HI> I. by the Title of Earl of <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Sovereignty being reserved to <HI>France,</HI> whose Homagers these Earls were. This Earldom by the Marriage of <HI>Philip</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> with <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter of <HI>Lewis de Ma∣latin</HI> Earl of <HI>Flanders</HI> in 1369. came into the House
<PB N="144" REF="78"/>
of <HI>Burgundy;</HI> and so to the House of <HI>Austria</HI> by the Marriage of <HI>Mary</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>Charles</HI> the Hardy, to <HI>Maximilian</HI> Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> in 1476. in which Family it still is. This though the prime Earldom of all <HI>Europe,</HI> yet was a Homager to the Crown of <HI>France;</HI> till <HI>Charles</HI> V. having taken <HI>Francis</HI> I. his Prisoner in the Battel of <HI>Pavy</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> by a Treaty at <HI>Madrid,</HI> infranchised it from that Ser∣vitude. Since the time of <HI>Philip</HI> II. it has been ex∣treamly curtailed and harassed; many of the Inhabi∣tants flying then into <HI>England,</HI> not only depopula∣ted, but impoverished it by carrying away its Trade. And the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Revolting, not only added to this Calamity by a War of forty years continuance, but took from them several Towns in the Northern parts. Of later times, the <HI>French</HI> have made the same devastations on the Southern, so that not above half <HI>Flanders</HI> is now left to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and that in a weak and declining condition.</P>
<P><HI>Flassans,</HI> a small Village in <HI>Provence,</HI> in the Dio∣cese of <HI>Fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us:</HI> remark'd for giving name to an emi∣nent Poet of that Country in the thirteenth Century; as likewise in the person of <HI>Sieur de Flassans,</HI> sirna∣med the <HI>Knight of the Faith,</HI> for his zeal against the <HI>Huguenots</HI> of <HI>Provence</HI> in 1562.</P>
<P><HI>Flatholm,</HI> an Island in the <HI>Severn,</HI> over against <HI>Somersetshire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Flavigni, <HI>Flaviniacum,</HI></HI> a small Town in the Tract of <HI>Auxois</HI> in <HI>Burgundy,</HI> betwixt <HI>Dijon</HI> and <HI>Samur,</HI> upon a little River near the antient <HI>Alize.</HI> There stands an Abbey of the <HI>Benedictines</HI> in it.</P>
<P><HI>La Fleche,</HI> a Town in the Province of <HI>Anjou</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> upon the <HI>Loyre,</HI> towards the Frontiers of <HI>Maine. Henry le Grand</HI> founded a College of <HI>Je∣suits</HI> there in 1603: whose heart is interred in the same.</P>
<P><HI>Flensburg, <HI>Flensburgum,</HI></HI> a City of the Kingdom of <HI>Denmark,</HI> on the South of <HI>Jutland,</HI> upon the Bay of <HI>Flens,</HI> on the Baltick Sea, in the Dukedom of <HI>Sleswick,</HI> four <HI>German</HI> Miles West of the Isle of <HI>Alsen,</HI> and 6 from <HI>Frederichstad</HI> to the North-East. It is but small, seated on high Hills with a large Ha∣ven, and a strong Castle. The City is under the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> but the Territory which belongs to it, is under the Duke of <HI>Holstein Gottorp. Chri∣stian</HI> V. King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was born here in the year 1646.</P>
<P><HI>Flerus,</HI> a Village in the County of <HI>Namur,</HI> below <HI>Charleroy,</HI> near the <HI>Sambre;</HI> rendered remarkable by the Battel betwixt the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Armies, on <HI>July</HI> 1. 1690. fought upon the Plains thereof, with the Victory to the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fleury,</HI> or S. <HI>Benoît sur Loyre, Floriacum,</HI> a small Town which has a noble and an ancient Mona∣stery of the Order of S. <HI>Benedict,</HI> whose Body lies in∣terred therein: seated upon the <HI>Loir,</HI> nine Leagues from <HI>Orleans</HI> to the East. It stands, according to some, in <HI>Le Gastinois;</HI> to others, in the Dukedom of <HI>Orleans;</HI> and deserves to be remembred for the sake of <HI>Hugo Floriacensis,</HI> a Learned Monk of this House, who wrote a loyal and a christian Discourse concern∣ing the Origine of Monarchy, which he dedicated to <HI>Henry</HI> II. King of <HI>England;</HI> Published by <HI>Baluzius</HI> in his fourth Tome of <HI>Miscellanies.</HI> § There is ano∣ther <HI>Fleury</HI> in the Dukedom of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> upon the River <HI>Ousche;</HI> three Leagues from <HI>Dijon</HI> to the West: A third in <HI>Biere,</HI> which has a Priory; and a fourth in the Isle of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fliez, <HI>Phligadia,</HI></HI> a Mountain in <HI>Sclavonia. La∣zius</HI> placeth it in <HI>Liburnia,</HI> upon the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Flie, <HI>Flevo,</HI></HI> an Island at the Mouth of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which has a fine Haven, and a rich Town. It stands at the entrance of the <HI>Zuidersee,</HI> near the <HI>Texel.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> Fleet under Sir <HI>Robert Holms,</HI> entred this Port in 1666: burnt one hundred sixty five Sail of Ships, and took and burnt the Town of <HI>Schelling,</HI> which is the chief of that Island.</P>
<P><HI>Flintshire,</HI> one of the twelve Shires in <HI>Wales;</HI> bounded on the North with an Arm of the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea, which parts it from <HI>Cheshire,</HI> on the East of it; and on all the other Quarters, by <HI>Denbighshire.</HI> It is Hilly, but not mountainous; fruitful in Wheat and Barley, but especially Rie: upon the Northern Shoar stands Flint Castle, which gives name to the whole Shire; begun by <HI>Henry</HI> II. and finished by <HI>Edward</HI> I. wherein <HI>Richard</HI> II. renounced the Crown of <HI>En∣gland.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> claim∣ed it, and intailed a War on the <HI>English</HI> Nation, that bid fair for its Ruine. The Title of Earl of <HI>Flint</HI> belongs to the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Flix,</HI> a strong Castle upon the River <HI>Ebro</HI> in <HI>Ca∣talonia,</HI> supposed to be the old <HI>Ibera.</HI></P>
<P><HI>S. Florentin,</HI> a Town of <HI>France</HI> in <HI>Senois,</HI> in <HI>Champagne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Florence, <HI>Florentia,</HI></HI> one of the principal Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> called by <HI>Pliny, Fluentia;</HI> by the <HI>Italians, Fiorenza;</HI> and proverbially epitheted <HI>La bella,</HI> from its great beauty. The Capital of the Province of <HI>Tos∣cany</HI> and the Residence of the <HI>Great Duke.</HI> It was built by <HI>Sylla</HI>'s Soldiers in the Year of <HI>Rome</HI> 675, se∣venty six years before the Birth of our Saviour, up∣on the River <HI>Arno,</HI> which passeth through it, and is covered by four stately Bridges within the Walls. It is five, or as others say, seven Miles in compass: pa∣ved with Stone, adorned with large Streets, and state∣ly magnificent Buildings, both publick and private; to the Beauty of which the natural Ingenuity of the Citizens has contributed very much; no place having afforded more excellent <HI>Architects, Painters</HI> and <HI>Carvers,</HI> than this, as <HI>Schottus</HI> observes. It is seated in a gentle and healthful Air, upon a great and a na∣vigable River; surrounded with a delicate Plain, plea∣sant Hills, high Mountains; and abounding in what∣soever is valuable or useful; said to contain above se∣ven hundred thousand Souls. It may justly own <HI>Charles the Great</HI> for its Founder, who in 902, en∣larged, and new Walled it; adding one hundred and fifty Towers, an hundred Cubits high; from whence∣forward it began to flourish, though it suffered very much from the Factions of the <HI>Guelphs</HI> and <HI>Gibellins,</HI> that is, the <HI>Imperial</HI> and <HI>Papal Parties.</HI> This City purchased its Liberty of <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the Emperor about 1285, after which they subjected many of their Neighbours; but were never quiet from Foreign Wars, or Intestine Divisions, till they fell under a second Monarchic Government: in the interim Pope <HI>Martin</HI> V. advanced the Bishop to an Archbishop, in 1421. Nor is it less remarkable for a Council held here for uniting the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Churches; which began in 1439, and ended in 1442. Nor is the Death of <HI>Jerome Savanarola</HI> to be forgotten, who was burnt here in 1494, for reproving the Vices of those who love them too well to part with them. It surrendred it self to <HI>Charles</HI> V. in 1529, who granted it the year following to <HI>Alexander de Medi∣ces</HI> his Son in Law, with the Title of a Dukedom, under which Family it still is; enlarged in Bounds, but perhaps diminished in Wealth and People. Besides the Council I mention, there have been many other held here, which for brevity I must omit; as also the vast number of excellent Men here born; the noble Library, call'd <HI>Bibliotheca Laurentiana,</HI> which is one of the best in the whole World for Manuscripts; the excellent Pieces of Architecture, Sculpture and Paint∣ing (of which sort this City shews some Pieces drawn by <HI>John Cimabac,</HI> who about 1200, began to revive the Art of Painting in <HI>Italy,</HI> before which this Art was only exercised by <HI>Greeks</HI>) and many other Rari∣ties

plentifully enough here to be found. It has three Citadels, built by its <HI>Dukes</HI> at several times. They observe, that the politeness of the <HI>Italian</HI> Tongue shines in its greatest perfection here, tho not so well pronounced as by the <HI>Romans:</HI> whence that Country Proverb, <HI>La lingua Toscana in bocca Romana.</HI> The praise whereof is in great part to be ascrib'd to the fa∣mous <HI>Academy della Crusca,</HI> Authors of the <HI>Italian Vocabulary,</HI> established in this City.

<P><HI>Florida,</HI> a very large and fruitful Country in the North <HI>America;</HI> so called because the <HI>Spaniards</HI> dis∣covered it on <HI>Palm Sunday,</HI> which in their Language they call <HI>Parcua de Flores,</HI> in 1512. The <HI>English</HI> had before this discovered it; <HI>Sebastian Cabot,</HI> sent by <HI>Henry</HI> VII. in 1479, to find a way to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> by the West, being the very first <HI>European</HI> that landed here. But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> went further, searched throughly, and took Possession of it for the King of <HI>Spain:</HI> however, the <HI>English</HI> have renewed their old Claim, and taken Possession of the more Northern Part by the name of <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> of which I shall speak in due time. The Inhabitants call <HI>Flo∣rida, Jaquasa;</HI> it lies parallel with <HI>Castile</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and said to be of the same temper both for Air and Soil, but abundantly more fruitful. Bounded on the North-East with <HI>Virginia;</HI> on the East with <HI>Mar del Nort;</HI> on the South, and some part of the West with the Bay of <HI>Mexico;</HI> and on the rest of the West with <HI>New Gallicia,</HI> and some Countries not yet discovered. It extends from the River of <HI>Palms</HI> 25 degr. of Lat. to <HI>Rio de Secco,</HI> in Long. 34. which evidently shews▪ that it is a large Country. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have only two Castles in the Southern Parts, S. <HI>Matthew,</HI> and S. <HI>Augustin.</HI> It lies in breadth where it is narrowest thirty Miles, and in other parts an hundred: towards the North beyond <HI>Florida</HI> is <HI>Canada.</HI> The whole Country is flat; a∣bounds with Rivers, which make it over-moist; but towards the Sea it is more sandy. In 1520, and 1524, <HI>Lucas Ʋsquez</HI> invaded it to find Men to work in the Mines. In 1528, <HI>Pamphilus Narviesius</HI> travelled over it. In 1528, <HI>Ferdinandus Soto</HI> went thither after <HI>Peru</HI> was conquered, with three hundred Horse, and four hundred Foot, to look for Gold; but find∣ing none returned empty and discontented, bestow∣ing only the Name of <HI>Florida</HI> upon the Country. In 1549, <HI>Charles</HI> V. sent some Priests thither to Con∣vert the Natives; but the Natives destroyed them. Under <HI>Charles</HI> IX. of <HI>France,</HI> in 1562, <HI>Charles Ri∣bald</HI> sailed thither, made a League with the Inhabi∣tants, and built <HI>Charles</HI> Fort, setling a <HI>French</HI> Colo∣ny. And in 1564. <HI>Renatus Laudonerius</HI> was kindly treated by the Natives; which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> obser∣ving, and fearing, they surprised the <HI>French,</HI> and hanged not only the meaner sort, but many Gentle∣men too. In 1576. <HI>Dominic Gurges,</HI> a <HI>Gascoign,</HI> manned out a Ship at his own cost and charge, and retook <HI>Charles</HI> Fort, repaying the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in their own kind. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> (who were then much in the favour of the <HI>French</HI>) had like to have been too hard for him at his return. The Soil is very fruit∣ful, yields plenty of <HI>Sassafras,</HI> and may have rich Mines; but the Inhabitants take no pains to find them, and not much to Till the Earth, which yields them two Crops of Maze in each year, one in <HI>March,</HI> and another in <HI>June:</HI> this is the natural bread of the Country, by which, and Hunting only, the Natives subsist. Who are of Olive Complexions, great of Stature, go Naked, except what they are more con∣cerned to hide; naturally lovers of War, out of a re∣vengeful and unquiet Temper.</P>
<P><HI>Flumica, <HI>Crimisa,</HI></HI> a River of <HI>Calabria Citerior,</HI> which falls into the Bay of <HI>Taranto,</HI> near <HI>Capo dell' Alice;</HI> four Miles from the Promontory of <HI>Santa Maria di Leuca;</HI> which is the most South-Eastern Cape of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Europe</HI> to the West. The Cape, the Village <HI>dell' lo Zeiro,</HI> and <HI>il Capo dell' Alice,</HI> were by the ancient Geographers called <HI>Crimisa,</HI> as well as the River, though they have now three seve∣ral names.</P>
<P><HI>Flushing, <HI>Ʋlissinga, Flissinga,</HI></HI> is a Maritime Town in the Province of <HI>Zeeland</HI> in the <HI>Low Countries;</HI> seated on the Mouth of the <HI>Scheld,</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Wal∣cheren,</HI> one League from <HI>Middleburgh,</HI> upon the most Southern point of that Island. It has a very convenient Haven, and the intire Command of the <HI>Scheld;</HI> without whose License no Ship can pass up the River to <HI>Antwerp.</HI> One of the first Towns the <HI>Hollander</HI> took by surprize from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in 1572. by the diligence of <HI>Vorst</HI> a Seaman, and one <HI>Monsieur de Berland,</HI> the Bailiff thereof. Then a mean place, of no great strength or consideration; but since fortified by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to the utmost degree of human Art. This, the <HI>Briel,</HI> and Fort of <HI>Ramekins,</HI> were, in 1585. put into the hands of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as Cautionary Towns for the re∣payment of such Monies as she should expend in their Protection against the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> and the famous Sir <HI>Philip Sidney</HI> was made by her the first Governor of it. But in 1616. King <HI>James</HI> I. resigned all a∣gain into the hands of the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> is the Proprietor of this Town. It is the key of the Sea of the <HI>Low Countries.</HI> See <HI>Cadiz.</HI> § In the Island of <HI>Tabago</HI> in the Southern <HI>America,</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> built a Fortress, and call'd it <HI>New Flushing:</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> took and rased in 1677.</P>

On the East it was then bounded by the <HI>Alpes,</HI> which divide the <HI>Dau∣phiné</HI> from <HI>Piedmont;</HI> as also with <HI>Savoy, Switzer∣land, Germany,</HI> and a part of the <HI>Netherlands:</HI> on the North with the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and the <HI>British</HI> Seas: on the West with the <HI>Aquitain</HI> Ocean; on the

South with <HI>Spain,</HI> from which it is divided by the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Hills, and with the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> Then accounted in length six hundred and sixty <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, in breadth five hundred and seventy, the whole circumference being two thousand and forty. In the times of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> it was bounded on the East by the <HI>Alpes,</HI> and the <HI>Rhine,</HI> extending to the Mouth of that River, from the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Hills; so that it took in the far greatest part of what we now call the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> with all those of the <HI>German</HI> Empire which lie West of the <HI>Rhine, Switzerland</HI> and <HI>Savoy.</HI> And the great design of the present <HI>French</HI> King seems to have been the dilating of it again to the same extent: to which purpose he has spared neither Blood nor Treasure, Arts nor Labour: and perhaps if he had not been over-reached by the Jesuits, upon the design of uniting all his Subjects in one Religion by force, he might have succeeded when he was so near his point: for whereas <HI>Picardy</HI> was heretofore his Northern Province, he has taken in <HI>Artois,</HI> the greatest part of <HI>Flanders,</HI> of <HI>Hanault</HI> and <HI>Namur.</HI> Of the four Ports that did belong to <HI>Flanders,</HI> he has two, <HI>Graveling</HI> and <HI>Dunkirk:</HI> so that his Dominions extend on the Sea Shoar from <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to S. <HI>Jean de Luz</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> without any interruption. On the Eastern side he has possessed himself of the Dukedom of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> the Earldom of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> so much of <HI>Alsatia</HI> as lies on this side of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> and what his intentions towards the <HI>Switzers</HI> are, may be gues∣sed at: nor has <HI>Savoy</HI> passed, especially since the late rupture, without contributing his share to aggran∣dize him. On the South he has gained from <HI>Spain, Roussillon: Catalonia</HI> hardly missed him: all the World may remember how narrowly the <HI>United Pro∣vinces</HI> escaped him in 1673. and 1674. He has not only been a gainer in his Wars, but even in times of Peace, by his Courts of Dependences, Forts, and other Methods: So that considering the Weakness and Divi∣sions of his Neighbours, and the great Accessions he has already made; if so many thousands of his Sub∣jects, had not been driven out, or rendred useless to him, who can tell what this great Prince might not have effected before his death?

This Tract of Land was heretofore inhabited by the <HI>Gaul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> of which I shall give an account in its proper place. See <HI>Gallia.</HI> The <HI>Franks</HI> were Originally a <HI>German</HI> Nation, inha∣biting <HI>Franconia;</HI> which is still called <HI>East France,</HI> to distinguish it from this Country. This Nation joining with many other, upon the declining of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, under <HI>Pharamond,</HI> about 413. ob∣tained that part of <HI>Belgium,</HI> which contained <HI>Zut∣phen, Ʋtrecht, Over-Yssel,</HI> both the <HI>Friselands,</HI> and so much of <HI>Holland,</HI> as lies on the same side of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> but whether ever <HI>Pharamond</HI> crossed the <HI>Rhine,</HI> is uncertain. However in 420. he became their first King, and formed this Potent Monar∣chy. <HI>Clodius</HI> his Son in 433. crossed the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and took <HI>Cambray, Tournay,</HI> and all <HI>Belgium</HI> to the River <HI>Some:</HI> but he dying whilst his Children were young, commended them to <HI>Meroveus,</HI> who dispossessed them, to make himself King of the <HI>Franks,</HI> in 441. or thereabouts: <HI>Meroveus</HI> was the Author of the <HI>Me∣rovingian</HI> Line, and is by some made the first that seated in <HI>Gaul.</HI> His Son went further; and took all the <HI>Netherlands, Pioardy, Champagne,</HI> and the <HI>Isle of France,</HI> with <HI>Paris,</HI> which he made the Seat of this Empire. This Race under nineteen Princes conti∣nued to 742. when <HI>Pepin</HI> Son of <HI>Charles Martel,</HI> u∣surped upon <HI>Chilprick</HI> V. Son of <HI>Theodorick,</HI> and deposed him. The second, or <HI>Carolovinian</HI> Line, un∣der thirteen Princes, lasted till 977. when <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> put an end to it, and set up the Third. <HI>Charles</HI> IV. the fourteenth of this Race, dying in 1328. without Issue, <HI>Edward</HI> III. of <HI>England,</HI> claimed that Crown, at Son and Heir of <HI>Isabel,</HI> the Daughter of King <HI>Phi∣lip the Fair,</HI> and Sister to the three last Kings. A∣gainst him, <HI>Philip de Valois</HI> set up a Title by colour of the <HI>Salick</HI> Law, which had excluded all Females. The whole Reign of this Prince, and <HI>John</HI> his Son, was double-died in Blood by the <HI>English</HI> Valour. <HI>Charles</HI> V. by means of the <HI>English</HI> Divisions, at last expell'd them. Yet under <HI>Charles</HI> VI. the <HI>English</HI> returned with more Vigour and Rage▪ and were un∣der <HI>Henry</HI> V. in a fair way of reducing <HI>France.</HI> And he dying young, <HI>Henry</HI> VI. his Son, was crowned at <HI>Paris</HI> in 1422. But the Minority at first, and Weakness afterwards of this Prince, gave <HI>Charles</HI> VII. of <HI>France,</HI> an opportunity totally to expel the <HI>En∣glish</HI> the second time about 1449. The House of <HI>Valois</HI> ended in <HI>Henry</HI> III. slain before <HI>Paris</HI> in 1589. to whom succeeded <HI>Henry</HI> IV. the first of the House of <HI>Bourbone,</HI> and Grandfather of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. now King of <HI>France,</HI> who succeeded <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. his Fa∣ther in 1642. This is the shortest account I can give of the Bounds and History of this Kingdom; which in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> IX. was reckoned to contain above twenty Millions of people. It has in it (excluding the Conquered Countries) ten Seats of Parliament, fourteen Universities, sixteen Archbishop∣ricks, besides <HI>Avignon</HI> and <HI>Besanzon,</HI> one hundred and five Bishopricks, and fifty thousand Parishes.</P>

In very ancient times it was an Imperial and Free City; appointed for the Ele∣ction of the Emperors. <HI>Arnulphus</HI> was the first Em∣perour elected here in 887. The <HI>Mayn</HI> which pas∣seth through it, is a great and a Navigable River, ta∣king in many other noble Rivers, till it self falls into the <HI>Rhine:</HI> which makes this City a fit Centre of Trade for many parts of <HI>Germany;</HI> and their two great Marts every year contribute very much to the same. This City was called thus before the Reign of <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> upon the account of the Passage the <HI>Franks</HI> had here over the <HI>Mayn,</HI> though it was a City long before under another Name. But the Sub∣urb was called <HI>Saxen-hausen,</HI> the <HI>Dwelling of the Saxons.</HI> The Bridge is a splendid and a noble Work, supported by many Arches.

Miles in Length from West to East, and eight from North to South in breadth. Now under the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> but it suffered very much of late years from the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who in 1658. took and plundered it. In 1659. the <HI>Danes</HI> recovered the possession of it, though at the same time they lost much Cannon and Shipping, which they could never retake; and the Inhabitants were as much improverished by this Acci∣dent. It is a fruitful, pleasant, well seated Island, for the Climate it is in.</P>

The City of <HI>Formium</HI> lies not far from it, buried now in Ruines by the <HI>Saracens,</HI> to which the City of <HI>Gajetta</HI> succeeded in the Bishoprick. It lies upon the <HI>Tyrrhenian</HI> Sea, four Miles from <HI>Naples,</HI> fifty five from <HI>Rome,</HI> and fourteen from the Pope's Dominions: It has heretofore been subject to great Variety of Fortunes, but has now a strong <HI>Spanish</HI> Garrison to secure it. This was the Birth Place of Pope <HI>Gelasius</HI> II. who was therefore called <HI>Cajetanus.</HI> It is mention'd by <HI>Virgil,</HI> Aen. 7. The Haven was re∣paired by <HI>Antoninus Pius, Spart.

On the top of the Hill is a round spired Tower covered with Lead; and on the Walls are some Arms, and modern Inscriptions, which belon∣ged to the</HI> Genoese, <HI>who before the taking of</HI> Con∣stantinople, <HI>were Masters of this Place.

<P><HI>Galatia,</HI> is a Province of the <HI>Lesser Asia,</HI> called by the ancient Geographers <HI>Gallo-Graecia,</HI> from the <HI>Galls,</HI> which are stiled <HI>Galatae</HI> by the <HI>Grecians,</HI> (who, after the burning of <HI>Rome</HI> and laying <HI>Italy</HI> deso∣late, went thither and possessed it, making a mixture with the <HI>Grecians;</HI>) and the South Part of it was nam'd <HI>Galatia Salutaris.</HI> This Province is bounded on the North by <HI>Paphlagonia,</HI> sometimes taken for a Part of it; on the East by <HI>Cappadocia,</HI> on the South by <HI>Pisidia</HI> and <HI>Liaconia,</HI> on the West by <HI>Phrygia Mag∣na, Bithynia,</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> properly so taken.

Com∣postella</HI> is the Capital of this Province; <HI>Orensi,</HI> (<HI>Au∣ria,</HI>) <HI>Baiona, Corufia, Lugo, Mondoefiedo,</HI> and <HI>Tuy,</HI> are the other Cities and principal Places. The <HI>Groyne</HI> or <HI>Coronna,</HI> is the most famous of its Ports; besides which it has forty others. This Province is Moun∣tainous, enclined to Barrenness, destitute of Water, but abounding with Mines of Silver, Gold, Iron; and well stored with Wood, and good Wines; it hath also great plenty of Cattle, Game and excel∣lent Horses. The Iron they dig out of these Moun∣tains, is thought the best in the World, especially for Edge-Tools: nor are their Seas less stored with Fish. This Country was never Conquered by the <HI>Moors,</HI> though they at times made some Progress into it; and after in 985. they had repelled <HI>Almanassor,</HI> with the Loss of 70000 of his <HI>Moors,</HI> they were never in any danger of Conquest from that Nation. The <HI>Gal∣laci</HI> or <HI>Gallaici</HI> of the Ancients, under whom the <HI>Amphilochi</HI> of <HI>Justin,</HI> the <HI>Celtici</HI> of <HI>Mela,</HI> the <HI>Ta∣marices</HI> of <HI>Strabo,</HI> the <HI>Lucentii</HI> and <HI>Lucentes</HI> of <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Ptolemy</HI> have been interpreted to be com∣prehended, dwelt here.

This is not much unlike that in <HI>Spain,</HI> as to the Nature of the Soil.

<P><HI>Galilaea,</HI> a very celebrated Part of <HI>Asia,</HI> on the North of <HI>Judaea;</HI> at first the Inheritance of four of the Tribes of <HI>Israel; Asser, Naphtali, Zabulon</HI> and <HI>Issachar;</HI> the two first of which were intermixed with the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> and <HI>Syrians;</HI> and being more Nor∣thern and nearer the Fountain of <HI>Jordan,</HI> it was called <HI>Galilee of the Gentiles,</HI> or the Upper <HI>Galilee;</HI>
<PB N="156" REF="84"/>
and the other the Lower <HI>Galilee.</HI> This Country was bounded on the North by <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> from which two Nations it was divided by Mount <HI>Libanus;</HI> on the East with the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> on the South with <HI>Samaria,</HI> cut off from it by Mount <HI>Carmel;</HI> and on the West by the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea. The same was the Scene which our Blessed Saviour chose out of all the Earth, to dignifie with his Presence: in it he was conceived, lived the greatest part of his time, and wrought most of his Miracles. It is now called <HI>Belad Elbescara,</HI> that is, the <HI>Western Country;</HI> and is almost desolate, under the Dominion of the <HI>Turks.</HI> To omit so much of the Story of it as may be learned from the holy Scriptures; this Country was first brought under the <HI>Roman</HI> Vassalage by <HI>Pompey</HI> the Great, <HI>Anno Mundi</HI> 3887. sixty one Years before the Birth of Christ. They were again conquered, not without great Difficulty, by <HI>Vespasian</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> in the year of Christ 66. In all following Times it fol∣lowed the Fate of the Holy Land, or <HI>Palestine.</HI> The Country is exceeding fruitful, and in the ancient Times was extreamly populous; full of great and noble Cities; the principal of which were the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>Straton</HI> or <HI>Caesarea, Caphernaum, Tiberias, Cana, Nazareth.</HI> The Inhabitants were Men of Courage, neither fearing Death nor Poverty, nor any thing but Slavery, and of that they were infinitely impatient. But Wars, and the ill Government of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Princes, which have insulted over them ever since 637. have made it now desolate.</P>
<P><HI>Gallas, <HI>Gallanes,</HI></HI> or <HI>Giaques,</HI> a people of the Kingdom of <HI>Monomotapa,</HI> upon the Eastern Coasts of <HI>Africa,</HI> towards the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean; who, in 1537. broke into the Kingdom of <HI>Bali,</HI> and gained some Conquests over the <HI>Abyssines,</HI> in the Upper <HI>Aethiopia. Ludolphus</HI> in his <HI>Aethiopick</HI> History describes them. Their Country is bounded by the <HI>Nile</HI> to the West, <HI>Abyssinia</HI> to the North, and the Kingdom of <HI>Mono-Emugi</HI> to the East.</P>
<P><HI>Gallia,</HI> one of the greatest and best known Re∣gions of <HI>Europe</HI> to the Ancients. I have considered its present State under the Word <HI>France;</HI> and here I am to say a little of its ancient Bounds and People, be∣fore the <HI>Francks</HI> or <HI>French</HI> entered into it. These Nations were at first called <HI>Celtae,</HI> after that <HI>Galli,</HI> and by the <HI>Grecians Galatae.</HI> They possessed all that vast Tract of Land between <HI>Ancona</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Mouth of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> from the Western Ocean of <HI>Aquitain,</HI> to the <HI>Adriatick:</HI> Which was divided into <HI>Gallia Transalpina,</HI> and <HI>Gallia Cisalpina.</HI> 1. <HI>Gallia Transalpina</HI> was divided by <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> (who first conquered the greatest part of it,) into four Parts; <HI>Provincia Romana, Aquitania, Celtae</HI> or <HI>Gallia</HI> pro∣perly so called, and <HI>Belgium: All which he saith had different Tongues, Laws, Manners and Governments.</HI> 1. <HI>Provincia Romana</HI> was then bounded on the North with the Mountains of <HI>Gebenna</HI> and the River <HI>Rhoda∣nus,</HI> on the East with the <HI>Alpes,</HI> on the South with the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea and the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Hills, which di∣vided it from <HI>Spain,</HI> and on the West with the <HI>Garum∣na;</HI> the <HI>Rhodanus</HI> cutting this Province almost in the middle, after it turned to the South, and ceased to be a Boundary. This River is now called the <HI>Rhosne.</HI> 2. <HI>Aquitania,</HI> had on the North and East, the <HI>Ga∣rumna,</HI> now <HI>Garonne;</HI> on the West the Ocean, on the South <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Hills; and was the least of all the four Parts. 3. <HI>Gallia Celtica,</HI> was likewise the greatest; bounded on the North with the River <HI>Sequana,</HI> now <HI>Seyne; Matrona,</HI> now <HI>Marne;</HI> and the Mountain <HI>Vogesus,</HI> now <HI>Mont de Vauge,</HI> which parted it from <HI>Gallia Belgica;</HI> on the East it had also the <HI>Marne,</HI> the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and <HI>Alpes;</HI> on the South <HI>Provincia Romana,</HI> and <HI>Aquitania;</HI> and on the West the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Aquitain</HI> Ocean. 4. <HI>Gallia Belgica,</HI> which was the fourth Part, on the North and East had the <HI>Rhine,</HI> on the South <HI>Gallia Celtica,</HI> and on the West the <HI>British</HI> Ocean from the Mouth of the <HI>Seyne,</HI> to the South of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> This vast Tract was divided into various Nations or Tribes, which had sent their Colonies into the <HI>British</HI> Islands, and peopled all these Tracts. Yet such was the Increase, or Restlessness of this People, that at times they broke over all those Bounds which Nature had set about them, and invaded the neighbour Nations. Thus they conquer'd that part of <HI>Italy,</HI> from them call'd <HI>Gal∣lia Cisalpina;</HI> being invited over the <HI>Alpes</HI> by the sweet Wines from thence, about the times of <HI>Tarquinius Priscus,</HI> in the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 162. 588 years before Christ; <HI>Bellovesus,</HI> Son of <HI>Ambigatus,</HI> King of the <HI>Celtae,</HI> being their Leader, General, or Prince. <HI>Gal∣lia Cisalpina</HI> was the Northern Part of <HI>Italy,</HI> exten∣ding from <HI>Arsia,</HI> now <HI>L'Arsa,</HI> a River of <HI>Istria,</HI> to the <HI>Alpes;</HI> which bounded the <HI>Provincia Romana,</HI> in the <HI>Gallia Transalpina;</HI> and its borders on the North and West were the <HI>Alpes,</HI> on the South the River <HI>Rubicon,</HI> or as others say, <HI>Aesis,</HI> or as <HI>Pliny</HI> assures us <HI>Ancona,</HI> and on the East they had the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea. These People were divided into four Potent Nations, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. The <HI>Insubres,</HI> which dwelt from the <HI>Alpes</HI> to the River <HI>Arnus,</HI> now <HI>Arno,</HI> which passeth through <HI>Flo∣rence.</HI> 2.

But in the year 470. of <HI>Rome,</HI> they were finally con∣quered and extirpated by the <HI>Romans.</HI> The <HI>Boii</HI> were conquered by <HI>Flaminius,</HI> about the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 529. and being impatient of Servitude, passed over the <HI>Alpes</HI> into <HI>Germany,</HI> and possessed them∣selves of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> Upon which the <HI>Insubres,</HI> and <HI>Cenomani</HI> yielded in 431. and became subject to the <HI>Romans.</HI> The <HI>Provincia Romana,</HI> was conquered in part by <HI>Fulvius Flaccus,</HI> in 627. The Remainder in 631. by <HI>Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus;</HI> and the three other Provinces by <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> between 694. and 697. fifty three years before the Birth of our Saviour.

<P><HI>Galloway, <HI>Novantae, Gallovidia. Galdia,</HI></HI> is a large County in the South of <HI>Scotland,</HI> over against <HI>Munster</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> from which it is separated by a Channel of only fifteen <HI>Scotch</HI> Miles in breadth. Bounded on the West with the Sea; on the South with <HI>Solway Fyrth,</HI> which separates it from <HI>Cumber∣land;</HI> on the East with <HI>Nithesdale,</HI> and on the North with <HI>Carrick</HI> and <HI>Kile:</HI> it takes its name from the <HI>Welsh,</HI> who for a long time maintained this County against the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts,</HI> calling themselves <HI>Gaels;</HI> and in the Writers of the middle Ages, it is accor∣dingly called <HI>Gael-Wallia:</HI> the Country is every where swelled into Hills; better for Pasture than Corn, but well supplied with Fish, both from the Sea and Fresh-water-Lakes, of which there are many at the foot of the Hills. The principal River is the <HI>Dee,</HI> called <HI>Dea,</HI> by <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> The principal Town is <HI>Wi∣thern,</HI> (<HI>Candida Casa</HI>) which is a Bishops See, and one of the first erected in this Kingdom by <HI>Nina</HI> a <HI>Britain,</HI> the Apostle of the Nation of the <HI>Picts.</HI> Up∣on the Coast of this County, there is a narrow <HI>Isth∣mus,</HI> call'd the <HI>Mule of Galloway:</HI> it is the same with the <HI>Novantum Chersonesus</HI> of the Antients, and lies in 55 d. 10 m. of North Lat.

<P><HI>Gallway, <HI>Duaca, Gallica,</HI></HI> is a County in the West of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Conaught:</HI> bounded on the North by the County of <HI>Mayo;</HI> on the East by the River <HI>Shannon,</HI> which parts it from <HI>Roscom∣mon,</HI> and <HI>Kings County;</HI> on the South with <HI>Clare,</HI> and on the West with the <HI>Ocean;</HI> a Country fruitful both as to Corn and Pasture. Here is the Lake of <HI>Corbes,</HI> twenty Miles long, and three or four broad. § The principal City is <HI>Gallway, <HI>Galliva,</HI></HI> called by the <HI>Irish Gallive;</HI> the Capital City of the County of <HI>Gallway,</HI> and the third in the whole Kingdom of <HI>Ireland;</HI> situate near the fall of the Lake of <HI>Corbes:</HI> a neat, strong Place, built almost round, and walled with Stones; it has a Bishop's See, and a delicate and safe Harbor, called the Bay of <HI>Gallway,</HI> capable of a vast Fleet, and secured on the West, by five Islands. The fertility of the County in which it stands afford∣ing plenty of Goods for Exportation, the Inhabi∣tants of this City, in Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI>'s time, had made great Improvements by their Navigation, and much enriched themselves. This City being so remote from <HI>England,</HI> and very strong, at first in the Rebellion against King <HI>Charles</HI> I. stood a kind of Neuter, and would neither admit the <HI>Irish,</HI> nor the <HI>English:</HI> but when they saw the <HI>Irish</HI> were Masters of the greatest part of the Kingdom, it joined with them in their Rebellion: The Pope's Legate made this a kind of Seat of his Government, till about the year 48. he was besieged here by the <HI>Irish,</HI> who began then to favour the Royal Interest, which he opposed to the utmost; and at last, despairing of all Relief, he sub∣mitted and left the Island. Not long after, this was one of the first Places that paid its Obedience and Respect to the Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI> the King's Depu∣ty. But it was too late: for in 1651. <HI>Ireton</HI> having taken <HI>Limerick</HI> after a long Siege, this Town being immediately attacked by those victorious Forces un∣der the Command of Sir <HI>Charles Coot,</HI> an <HI>Oliverian</HI> Captain, and their Harbour filled with Parliament Ships of War, and no hopes of Relief, they yielded themselves to the mercy of the Rebels; who re∣venged the Injuries of a Prince, which they them∣selves had murdered, upon this wealthy, but then wretched City. <HI>Thus</HI> (saith my Author Dr. <HI>Bates</HI>) Gallway, <HI>the greatest place of Trade in all</HI> Ireland, <HI>the best fortified, abounding in noble Buildings, Riches, and plenty of Inhabitants, which had had such benefit by their Maritim Commerce, was forced to submit to the Yoke of an Enemy; after she had refused her Assistance to her Lawful Prince, in de∣nying a Supply to the Lieutenant. And as if War alone had not been a sufficient Chastisement; the Plague followed the Sword, and cut off in the space of eighteen Months, twelve thousand of the Inhabi∣tants.</HI> The <HI>Irish</HI> had the Possession of this Place, and held it out for King <HI>James</HI> II. till the last Sum∣mer, 1691.</P>

King of <HI>Spain.</HI> This is a vast, strong City; and was once as rich and populous, as unquiet and seditious, as any in the <HI>Low Countries. Erasmus</HI> saith of it in his time, that <HI>he did not think there was any one City in Christendom, that could be compared to this for Greatness, Power, Government, and the ingenuity of the Inhabitants.</HI> But the Wars and other Calamities which have ever since lain heavy upon this Country, have exhausted both its Wealth and Inhabitants; and brought this City particularly into a very languishing condition. The Strength and Situation of it, have hitherto supported it. It has a Castle built by <HI>Charles</HI> V. in 1539, who was born here in 1500, and converted an old Abbey, which it had, into a Cathedral Church. And when he built the said Castle, spared not to put to death about thirty of the principal Burghers, proscribe others, confiscate all the publick Buildings, take away their Artillery, Arms and Privileges, and condemn them in a Fine of twelve hundred thousand Crowns, for offering to put themselves under the Protection of <HI>Francis</HI> I. King

of <HI>France,</HI> by a Revolt that year; of which <HI>Francis</HI> generously rejecting their Plot, had as generously ad∣vertised him. In the Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> II. being inju∣riously treated by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> this City was one of the first that expelled the <HI>Roman</HI> Rites in 1578, and admitted the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> in 1579. and ha∣ving cast out the Garrison of <HI>Spanish</HI> Soldiers, level∣led the Citadel, and fortified the City, though then three <HI>German</HI> Miles in compass. It maintained its Liberty, till in 1585. seeing the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> murthered, and no hopes of succor from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> it submitted to the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> who rebuilt the Citadel; but the Inhabitants being wasted, the <HI>French</HI> took it in 1678, in six days, and after resto∣red it to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who are now in possession of it. This City stands at the equal distance of four Leagues from <HI>Antiverp, Brussels,</HI> and <HI>Mechlin.</HI> The learned <HI>Hostius, Sanderus,</HI> and <HI>Jodocus Badius,</HI> were Natives of it. Its ancient Inhabitants are mention∣ed by <HI>Caesar</HI> under the name of <HI>Gorduni.</HI> There are a great many Religious Houses adorning it, and se∣ven Parishes, besides the Cathedral. There is also a strong Castle called the <HI>Sas van Ghent</HI> or Castle of <HI>Gant,</HI> four Miles from hence to the North, built by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and taken by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in 1644. is still in their Possession.</P>

<P><HI>Ganges,</HI> the greatest River in the <HI>East-India,</HI> which divides that Continent into two parts: called <HI>Ganga</HI> by the Inhabitants, and the <HI>Gange</HI> by the <HI>Eu∣ropeans:</HI> it ariseth from Mount <HI>Imaus, <HI>(Dalanguer)</HI></HI> in the Confines of the Great <HI>Tartary,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Kakeres:</HI> and running Southward through the Empire of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> it watereth <HI>Sirinar, Ho∣lobassa,</HI> and <HI>Gouro;</HI> and is augmented by the Streams of <HI>Perselus, Sersily,</HI> and <HI>Tziotza,</HI> and many other Rivers in the <HI>Mogui</HI>'s Kingdom. In the Kingdom of <HI>Bengala</HI> it is divided into many Branches; and dis∣chargeth it self by five Outlets into the Bay of <HI>Ben∣gala,</HI> giving its name to a Kingdom in its Passage. It is full of Islands, covered with lovely <HI>Indian</HI> Trees, which afford Travellers great delight: The Water is esteemed Sacred by the Inhabitants: the Great <HI>Mogul</HI> will drink no other, because it is lighter than that of any other River: the <HI>Europeans</HI> boil it before they drink it, to avoid those Fluxes which otherwise it en∣clines them to. This River receiveth from the North-East, and West, an innumerable number of Brooks; and dischargeth it self into the Gulph of <HI>Bengala,</HI> at the height of 23 deg. or thereabouts. Said by <HI>Pliny,</HI> to be two Miles where it is narrowest, and five where it is broadest, having Spangles of Gold and precious Stones, mixed with its Sands; yet not therefore the <HI>Phison</HI> of <HI>Genesis,</HI> as some mistake; because it springs at the distance of twelve hundred Leagues from the <HI>Euphrates.</HI></P>

Dioscorus</HI> the <HI>Eutychian</HI> was banished to this City, by <HI>Martian</HI> the Emperor in 451. after he had been con∣demned by the Council of <HI>Chalcedon;</HI> and likewise <HI>Timotheus Aelurus,</HI> a <HI>Monk</HI> of that Faction, in 457. by the Emperor <HI>Leo;</HI> this <HI>Monk</HI> having been chosen Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria.

He tells us also, <HI>Baldwin</HI> III. King of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> having in 1145. expelled the <HI>Saracens,</HI> he, in 1148. built here a Ca∣stle. That there lives here a <HI>Sangiack.</HI> That the Port is decayed and unsafe, and of no great benefit to the Inhabitants. There is here one ancient Church, fre∣quented by the <HI>Coptic</HI> Christians; whether it be great or small, he saith nothing; but very rich it plainly is not. This City was taken from the Kings of <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> by <HI>Salladine,</HI> in 1171. This and all <HI>Palestine</HI> was recovered back to the Christians, by <HI>Frederick,</HI> Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> in 1228.

It was indeed the last Town Northward in the <HI>Provincia Romana,</HI> ac∣cording to the ancient Division of <HI>Gallia.</HI> We should have had more <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities than we have too, if this City had not in the course of so many Ages suffered very much from Enemies and Fire. In the Reign of <HI>Aurelius Antoninus,</HI> it was almost all burnt; which Prince contributed so much to the rebuilding, and bestowed such Privileges on it, that it was called <HI>Aurelia</HI> for some time from him; but upon his death reassumed its ancient name. In the irruption of the <HI>Barbarous</HI> Nations into the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, it suffer∣ed the same Calamities with other Cities something sooner, as being nearer the Frontiers; but then it met with an early Restorer in <HI>Genebald</HI> King of <HI>Bur∣gundy.</HI> About three hundred and fifty years since, it was burnt twice in seven years. It has had the Counts of <HI>Geneva,</HI> and the Dukes of <HI>Savoy</HI> at all times the great Pretenders to the Sovereignty over it; and has always defended its Privileges manfully against them. In 1412. when <HI>Amadaeus,</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> en∣deavoured to obtain a Title to this City by an exchange, <HI>Joannes à Petra Scissa,</HI> (then Bishop) and the Inha∣bitants agreed, that if any Person should consent to the Alienation of its Liberty, he should be treated like a Traytor. These and the like Traverses of their Neighbour Princes forced them in 1535. to enter in∣to a League with the <HI>Canton</HI> of <HI>Bearn,</HI> which was to last for ever; the change of Religion having then heightned their Neighbours Rage against them. In 1584. having suffered a very sharp Siege and a mise∣rable Famine, by the help of the <HI>Canton</HI> of <HI>Zurich,</HI> they prevailed so far as to force the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> and their Bishop to renounce all their Pretences. They reaped no less glory from their defeating the Noctur∣nal Scalado of <HI>Charles Emanuel,</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> in 1602. This City rejected the Ch. of <HI>Rome</HI> in 1535. Whereupon they applied the Revenue of the Bishop∣rick, with the Tithes of the Territory of <HI>Gex,</HI> to the maintenance of their own Ministry of the Reformati∣on. There has been a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Titular Bishop of <HI>Geneva</HI> ever since continued, who resides at <HI>Anne∣ci;</HI> and with other the Titular Beneficiaries within this District, obtain'd a Decree from the Parliament of <HI>Dijon</HI> (<HI>Anno</HI> 1687.) to be restored to their an∣cient Possessions▪ But without success, as for any ef∣fect it had upon the Government here: who, though they enter into no Alliance (during the present War) with the Confederate Princes, yet stand upon their Defence against <HI>France.</HI> The Preaching of <HI>Calvin, Beza</HI> and <HI>Farellus,</HI> the retreat of some <HI>English Pro∣testants</HI> hither during the Reign of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> and of others in divers times from several Countries, have <HI>distinguished</HI> the zeal of this place for the <HI>Reformati∣on.</HI> The Province of <HI>Genevois,</HI> which derives its name from it, is bounded by the Provinces of <HI>Chablais</HI> and <HI>Fossigny</HI> to the East, the <HI>Rhone</HI> to the West and in part also to the North, and with <HI>Savoy</HI> properly so called to the South.

The City <HI>Gengen,</HI> lies between <HI>Ʋlm</HI> and <HI>Norlingen,</HI> five Miles from each: the second, not above four Miles from <HI>Tubingen</HI> to the South: but <HI>Giengen</HI> is not the same Town with <HI>Gies<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingen,</HI> but lies about four Miles East of it.</P>

<P><HI>Genoua, <HI>Genua,</HI></HI> a very ancient and great City in the North of <HI>Italy,</HI> upon the <HI>Tyrrhenian</HI> Sea: it lies in the Form of a Theatre, upon the ascent of an Hill, opening its Bosom to the Sea, five or six Miles in compass; so full of stately and regular Buildings, Palaces, Churches, Monasteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that its prover∣bial Epithet in <HI>Italy,</HI> is, <HI>Genoua la superba;</HI> and so very ancient, that its Original is unknown: History makes mention of it above 1800 years ago. It is certain it was destroyed by <HI>Mago,</HI> one of <HI>Hannibal</HI>'s Commanders, when by the <HI>Alpes</HI> he entered <HI>Italy</HI> in the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 534. about two hundred and six∣teen years before the Birth of our Saviour. <HI>Cornelius Servilius,</HI> one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Consuls, ordered the re∣building it, sixteen years after its Desolation. This City in the end of the first <HI>Punick</HI> War, had greatly shaken <HI>Rome</HI> it self, as <HI>Livy</HI> relates, about the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 515. But being then subdued, and obliged, she continued ever after very faithful. In the fall of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, she had the same fate with her Neighbours; and fell under the <HI>Herules, Goths,</HI> and <HI>Lombards,</HI> or the <HI>Greek</HI> Exarches of <HI>Ravenna,</HI> as they prevailed one upon the other. In 806. <HI>Charles</HI> the Great having Conquered the <HI>Lombards,</HI> made <HI>Ade∣mar,</HI> his Kinsman, Count of <HI>Genoua;</HI> who got <HI>Cor∣fica</HI> from the <HI>Saracens,</HI> and united it to this City, which has enjoyed that Island ever since. In 935▪ the <HI>Saracens</HI> took and burnt this City, and carried all her People into Captivity; but the Duke of <HI>Venice</HI> brought them back, and rebuilt it; though others say the <HI>Genoese</HI> Fleet met these Infidels in their go∣ing home, and recovered all again after a sharp fight. After this they became in a short time by Navigations, Commerce, and Wars, more famous than ever. Being grown Wealthy, in 1133. Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> II. made this City an Archbishop's See. They deserved this Favour of the Pope, by the great Services they by their Fleets performed against the <HI>Saracens</HI> in the <HI>Holy War,</HI> (which began in the year 1096.); for which in 1101. they obtained of <HI>Baldwin</HI> III. part of the Sea-Towns that should be taken in <HI>Palestine.</HI> In the Year 1204. when the Western Christians took <HI>Constantinople</HI> from the Eastern Emperors, the <HI>Ge∣nouese</HI> had a great hand in it: <HI>Pera</HI> was assigned them for that Service, a place near <HI>Constantinople:</HI> they were then Masters of <HI>Lesbos</HI> and <HI>Chio,</HI> and seve∣ral Islands' in those Seas; and <HI>Caffa</HI> in the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> in <HI>Crim Tartary.</HI> But aiming to gain <HI>Creet</HI> too from the <HI>Venetians</HI> in 1207. there arose a War between the two States; which, joined with the <HI>Genoueses</HI> intestine Divisions, at last ruined the Greatness of this: in 1255. they reduced the <HI>Venetians</HI> to great streights, having taken <HI>Chioggia,</HI> an Island near the City; but lost all by demanding more than could be granted.
<PB N="163" REF="87"/>
In 1260. the <HI>Venetians</HI> gained another great Victory over them, taking twenty four Gallies. In 1291. the <HI>Venetians</HI> took from them <HI>Pera</HI> and <HI>Caffa.</HI> In 1293. the Tide of Fortune turned; the <HI>Venetians</HI> lost all their Fleet to the <HI>Genoueses,</HI> and another of seventy Ships in 1298. In 1314. the <HI>Genouese</HI> were beaten by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and in 1353. reduced to such Streights, that they were forced to put themselves under the Pro∣tection of the Duke of <HI>Milan;</HI> after which, though they recover'd to an Ability of Contesting with the <HI>Ve∣netians,</HI> and beat them in 1401▪ yet the <HI>Turks</HI> and their own Divisions, at last reduced them to so low an Ebb, that they were not able to set out a Fleet. Between the Years 1174. and 1339. they had four dreadful Ci∣vil Wars, or Broils in the City, which contributed very much to their ruin. In 1452. <HI>Sfortia,</HI> Duke of <HI>Mi∣lan,</HI> possess'd himself of this City. In 1563. they were cited to answer for the Expulsion or Banishment of the Marquess of <HI>Final,</HI> by <HI>Ferdinando</HI> I. Emperor of <HI>Germany. Selim</HI> the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Turks,</HI> beat their Republick out of the Isle of <HI>Chios,</HI> in the year 1571. Besides all these Mutations, the <HI>French</HI> pretend that in 1396. this Republick made o∣ver, by a formal Grant to <HI>Charles</HI> VI. of <HI>France,</HI> all the Sovereign Lordship of it, and the States depending▪ which was executed and confirmed again to <HI>Charles</HI> VII. in 1458. and from this last Date the <HI>French</HI> had the Sovereignty of the City, till 1528. when <HI>Andreas Doria,</HI> upon the Advantage of the Imprisonment of <HI>Francis</HI> I. (taken by the Forces of <HI>Charles</HI> V. at the Battle of <HI>Pavia,</HI>) restored his Country to its former Liberty. Since which, this State has had a very great Dependence on the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> by reason of his States in <HI>Italy;</HI> at all times preferring the Interests of that Kingdom before all others. This so far exaspera∣ted <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. (the now <HI>French</HI> King) that in 1674. he sent a Fleet and Bomb'd <HI>Genoua;</HI> in which Action the Ducal Palace was burnt, and many other of the noblest in the City, and an incredible mischeif done. In the end he forced them to send their Duke and four Senators to his Court to make their humble Submis∣sions to him. Not that they parted with their Liberty, for they are still a Free State; nor that they had done him any Injury, which they were to acknowledge; but either because their Ancestors had revolted above an hundred years agone, or because his most Christian Majesty would have it so. § The State of <HI>Genoua</HI> is a Part of <HI>Italy,</HI> anciently call'd <HI>Liguria;</HI> lying upon the <HI>Tyrrhenian</HI> Sea, which bounds it upon the South and West; on the East it has the Dukedom of <HI>Florence,</HI> and on the North the Dukedoms of <HI>Parma</HI> in part, and <HI>Montisferat</HI> in part, its length from East to West is one hundred and forty Miles, its breadth nevertheless very little. Yet that part of it which lies next the Sea is wonderfully fruitful by Nature, and made much more so by the Industry of the Inhabitants; and has so many Villages and fine Buildings, especially towards <HI>Genoua,</HI> that it may seem to be one continued City. It is go∣verned as a Common-Wealth under a Duke (to con∣tinue but two Years,) and two Senates or Councils. This Republick has under it <HI>Corsica</HI> and <HI>Capraia,</HI> two Islands in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea; and anciently ma∣ny other. We shall only add to this, the <HI>Italian</HI> Cen∣sure upon <HI>Genoua; Huomini senza Fide, Mare sen∣za Pesce, Monte senza Legno, è Donne senza Ver∣gogna;</HI> There are Men without Honesty, a Sea with∣out Fish, Mountains without Wood, and Women without Shame.

But great Warriers, and the invincible Enemies of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Empire, which never could subdue them; on the contrary, they at last destroyed that vast Empire, in the time appointed. <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> was the first of all the <HI>Romans,</HI> who (building a Bridge over the <HI>Rhine</HI>) entered this Country; yet with no great Success. <HI>Au∣gustus</HI> and <HI>Tiberius</HI> conquered those Nations of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> which lay between the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> but about the year of Christ 200. they too shook off the <HI>Roman</HI> Yoke; the rest were always free from it. The <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Danube,</HI> were the standing Bounds of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, beyond which it could rarely keep any thing long. That which the <HI>Romans</HI> could never effect, the <HI>Francks</HI> under <HI>Charles</HI> the Great brought to pass, and subdued <HI>Germany.</HI> This Prince, about 801. was made Emperor of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Ger∣many.</HI> It continued in his Posterity till 929. when <HI>Henry</HI> I. a <HI>Saxon,</HI> was elected by the <HI>Germans;</HI> his Family lasted till 1002. when it fell into the House of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> in the Person of <HI>Henry</HI> II.

The Count of <HI>Mansfield</HI> retook it for the Arch-Duke <HI>Matthias,</HI> in 1595. It was lost again by the Cowardize of the Garrison in 1605. the Governour being accidentally killed. Just over against it stands <HI>Barkan,</HI> to which there is a Bridge of Boats over the <HI>Danube,</HI> which to∣gether with <HI>Barkan</HI> was burnt by the Christians in 1664. In 1683. there was under the Walls of this City, a sharp Engagement between the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Germans;</HI> the latter prevailing, and taking the City of <HI>Gran</HI> also, <HI>October</HI> 23, after they▪ had beat the <HI>Turks</HI> from <HI>Vienna. July</HI> 30. 1685. the <HI>Turks</HI> again besieged this City, but were forced to retire, <HI>Aug.</HI> 16. with the loss of all their Cannon and Baggage. It stands six <HI>German</HI> Miles from <HI>Alba Regalis</HI> to the East; the same from <HI>Buda</HI> to the North, and <HI>Comora</HI> to the South; in a most fruitful and pleasant Plain. Called by the Inhabitants <HI>Stegran;</HI> by the <HI>Germans,</HI> Gran; by the <HI>Italians, Strigonia. S. Stephen</HI> King of <HI>Hungary</HI> was born here.

<P><HI>Granada, <HI>Granata, Granatum, Illiberis,</HI></HI> and <HI>Reg∣num Oranatense,</HI> a Kingdom and a City in <HI>Spain.</HI> The Kingdom of <HI>Granada</HI> lies in the South of <HI>Spain,</HI> upon the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, being heretofore the Eastern part of <HI>Hispania Boetica.</HI> Bounded on the East with the Kingdom of <HI>Murcia;</HI> on the North and West with that of <HI>Andalusia;</HI> and on the South with the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> It is full of Mountains; the greatest of which is <HI>Apu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>axara.</HI> The Soil was once very fruitful, but now desolate, and consequently in many parts barren. This Kingdom was one of the first the <HI>Moors</HI> possessed themselves of, and of the last they lost; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> not recovering it out of their Hands before 1492. <HI>Peter</HI> Son of <HI>Alphonsus,</HI> King of <HI>Castile,</HI> surprised one of their Kings and slew him in 1350. But <HI>Ferdinando</HI> in the first menti∣oned year was the Prince which God had appointed to put a final period to the Kingdom of the <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> by the expulsion of <HI>Mahomet Boabdelin,</HI> the last King of <HI>Granada,</HI> Son of <HI>Muley Assin.</HI> As this raised <HI>Spain</HI> to that greatness our Fathers saw and feared; so the expulsion of the Posterity of these <HI>Moors</HI> by <HI>Philip</HI> II. in 1571. (occasioned by a Rebellion here and in. <HI>Andalusia,</HI> upon the score of the Inquisition) began the ruin of <HI>Spain;</HI> the loss of so vast a number of Subjects (many of which though banished as <HI>Mahometans,</HI> did profess Chri∣stianity in <HI>Africa</HI> amongst the <HI>Moors</HI>) having rendered it (together with the <HI>American</HI> Plantati∣ons) weak and unable to defend it self, or to main∣tain its very distant Dominions. The principal Ci∣ties of this Kingdom are, <HI>Granada, Guadix, Baza, Ronda,</HI> and <HI>Almeria.</HI> This Kingdom is twenty five Miles in breadth, twenty three in length, and sixty in circumference. § <HI>Granada, Nova Illiberis,</HI> the Ca∣pital City of the last mentioned Kingdom (and from whence it had its Name:) is a great and most de∣lightful City as any in <HI>Spain;</HI> the Air healthful; and it has plenty of excellent Springs; so that the <HI>Moors</HI> were of opinion, Paradise was at least in that part of the Heavens which influenced this Climate. This Ci∣ty was built out of the Ruins of <HI>Illiberis,</HI> an old <HI>Roman</HI> City, in an extended form upon several Hills, (two of which are higher than any of the rest) upon the River <HI>Del Oro</HI> [<HI>Darrum</HI>], the River <HI>Xe∣nil</HI> [<HI>Singilis</HI>] flowing also not far from it on the South. This City is divided into four parts; the first is <HI>Granada,</HI> in which is the Cathedral; the se∣cond, <HI>Alhambra,</HI> beautified with the Palace of the <HI>Moorish</HI> Kings, which is extreamly Magnificent, and has a delightful Prospect; the third, <HI>Alvesia;</HI> and the fourth, <HI>Antiquerula,</HI> which for the multitude of In∣habitants, and beauty of the Buildings, is not inferior to any of the other three: the whole is twelve Miles in compass, inhabited by many excellent Artificers, especially Silk-Weavers. It has also a Bishops See, an University opened by <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> and a Parliament or Chancellary. This City was built by the <HI>Moors,</HI> who were expelled out of it, after they had possessed it 778 years, in 1462. It has twelve Gates, and a thousand and thirty Towers. In it lie buried <HI>Fer∣dinando</HI> and <HI>Isabella, Philip</HI> I. and <HI>Joanna</HI> his Queen. On the East there is a Castle built on a Hill of hewen Stone. This City stands thirty six Leagues from <HI>Sevil</HI> to the East, nineteen from <HI>Cordova</HI> to the South-East, and twelve from <HI>Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> to the South.

This City was built by <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Hol∣stein;</HI> but is now under the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> though often taken and lost by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> in their Wars with the <HI>Danes.

Made a Bishops See by Pope <HI>Paul</HI> IV: under the Archbishop of <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> in 1559. but this See was not long-liv'd, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> revolting soon af∣ter from <HI>Spain.</HI> As this City was one of the first that ejected the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> so it was the first that felt the heat of their fury: <HI>Frederick</HI> Son of the Duke <HI>de Alva,</HI> being sent with an Army in 1573. to reduce it: which proved a long and b'oody Siege eight Months. This Siege was made the more me∣morable by a Naval Victory obtained by sixty <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Ships, over an hundred <HI>Dutch</HI> ones, which for∣ced the City to surrender: as also by the Cruelty the <HI>Spaniards</HI> used after they got the Place; putting two thousand Persons to the Sword, under pretence they came from other Towns though they had given their Oath to bear Arms no more: and having in the Siege defaced the Sacred Images, <HI>therefore they were put to death, not as</HI> Harlemers, <HI>but as Sacrilegious Per∣sons.</HI> This was the last of the Actions of the Duke of <HI>Alva;</HI> being soon after recalled. This City was built (as is supposed) by <HI>Onelem,</HI> a Noble Man, from whom it had its Name. Others say, by the <HI>Friselan∣ders,</HI> about 506. It is supposed too, that here the <HI>Art of Printing was first invented.</HI> But whoever founded, or has since improved it, it is now a great, populous, rich, well fortified City, in a healthful Air; which has about it pleasant Meadows, and an adorning Wood. It was in the time of <HI>L.

It is now one of the Imperial Villages: and was heretofore under the Protection of the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> but by the Peace of <HI>Munster,</HI> it came un∣der the King of <HI>France.</HI> In 1675. it was in vain be∣sieged by the <HI>Austrian</HI> Forces: yet soon after, all its Fortifications were slighted by the <HI>French;</HI> and thereupon it suffered very much in the last <HI>German</HI> War.

<P><HI>Landtvog von Hagenaw,</HI> or the <HI>Bailiwick</HI> of <HI>Hagenaw,</HI> is almost included in <HI>Alsatia:</HI> also called the <HI>Prefecture of the Ten Imperial Cities;</HI> because there are so many in it; viz. <HI>Hagenaw, Colmar, Schel∣strat, Wissemburg, Landaw,</HI> the Upper <HI>Bhenbeim, R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sheim, Munster</HI> in <HI>Gregorienthas, Kaisersberg,</HI> and <HI>Turcheim,</HI> with their dependents. <HI>Mulhuis</HI> in <HI>Suntgow,</HI> belonged also once to this <HI>Bailiwick,</HI> which is now one of the <HI>Swiss</HI> Cantons. This <HI>Bailiwick</HI> was mortgaged to the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> by <HI>Sigis∣mund</HI> the Emperour, for fifty thousand <HI>Florens. Fer∣dinand</HI> I. paid the Debt, and united it to the Domini∣ons of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> in 1558.

Heretofore an Imperial Free Town; but being ex∣empt, it fell under the Dominion of its own Bishop; till by the Treaty of <HI>Westphalia</HI> or <HI>Munster,</HI> this Bi∣shoprick was changed into a Principality, and given to the Duke of <HI>Brandenburg.</HI> The Bishop of this Diocese embraced the <HI>Augustane</HI> Confession in 1586.</P>

It embraced the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Confession, at the first Publication of it; yet it tolerates the <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oi∣nists,</HI> and gave shelter to the <HI>English</HI> in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> who in 1554. fled hither.

They think themselves obliged hereby to be very jealous of all the motions of that King: to whom they declare their firm Resolutions to main∣tain, to the uttermost, all their Privileges and Immu∣nities whatsoever.

Very great, rich, populous, and daily growing greater. The King has here a most magnificent Palace: there belong to it three very large Suburbs. Some think the ancient Name was <HI>Hecatompylon;</HI> others, <HI>Aspa.</HI> The Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> have resided here near an hundred years: and that is it that hath given it this great increase. It stands up∣on the River <HI>Zenderoud,</HI> or <HI>Zenderu;</HI> which ariseth from the Mountain of <HI>Dimavend,</HI> and divides this City into two parts; and about five Miles beneath, is swallowed up by the Sands. It lies seventy <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Miles from <HI>Casbin</HI> to the South; eighty from <HI>Ormus</HI> to the North, and a little more from <HI>Bagdat</HI> to the East. Seated in a Plain, surrounded on all sides, at the distance of about three or four Leagues, with an high Mountain, like an Amphitheatre. Long. 86. 40. Lat. 32. 26. The Province of <HI>Hierach,</HI> in which it stands, was the ancient <HI>Parthia.</HI> This City with the Suburbs, is about eight <HI>German</HI> Miles in compass; and has twelve Gates: whereof there are but nine constantly open; it has about eighteen thou∣sand Houses, and five hundred thousand Inhabitants. The Walls and Bastions are of Brick; but ill built, ill kept, and out of repair; so that they are of no use, to secure the City. Upon the River there is a lovely Stone Bridge. This City was taken and de∣stroyed twice by <HI>Tamerlane;</HI> and about 1450, suf¦fered much from one of its own Princes. The Mosques, the <HI>Bazar,</HI> (or Market Place,) the Baths, great Mens Houses and Gardens, are the great Ornaments of it. Some of the great Houses with their Gardens, take up twenty Acres of Ground: these Gardens they adorn with Fountains, Flowers, fine Walks, and delicate Rows of Trees, both for Shades and Fruits. So that the far greatest part of this vast City is taken up by Gardens; and not peopled like ours. I have taken this short Account out of <HI>Olearius,</HI> (who in 1637, was in this City;) and <HI>Thevenot,</HI> who travelled this Kingdom since.</P>

This and the other <HI>Cinque</HI> Ports, its Mem∣bers, was to send the King twenty one Ships: each of which to have twenty one tall Men in it; who were bound to appear upon forty days Summons, and to serve fifteen days at their own Charge: but if the King desired them longer, he was to pay to the Ma∣ster and Constable Six-pence the Day, and to each Mariner three pence. The Harbor here was made by a Pere of Timber; which being destroyed by the ra∣ging Seas in 1578, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted a Con∣tribution for the Repairing of it: but the Money was misimployed, and the Work neglected; so that the Trade and Fishery of this place is since that time much decayed. The Honorable <HI>Theophilus Hastings,</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> is Baron of <HI>Hastings.</HI> This Title be∣ing given to Sir <HI>William Hastings,</HI> his Predecessor, by <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, in the second year of his Reign.

Being grown Rich, they Walled the Town, Paved their Streets, raised their chief Magistrates from a Warden to Bailiffs; at last in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. got the Honor of a Mayor, and that the Town should be a County. <HI>Charles</HI> the Martyr Treasured up here a goodly Magazine for the benefit of his Subjects: but when he came to use it <HI>April</HI> 23. 1642: he was most unworthily and undutifully excluded by Sir <HI>John Hotham;</HI> which on the twenty fifth of the same Month was by the Parliament justified: being upon the matter the first act of Hostility against that Holy Prince. <HI>Hotham,</HI> the Son, was routed <HI>April</HI> 11. 1643. at <HI>Ancaster,</HI> by Colonel <HI>Cavendish.</HI> And both Father and Son came to be Beheaded by their Fellows Rebels: the first in 1644. and the other in 1645. for intending to return to their Allegiance.

<P><HI>Hunni,</HI> the ancient Inhabitants of the Marshes of the <HI>Maeotis;</HI> who for the sake of a better Country to live in, invaded <HI>Pannonia</HI> in great numbers, and thence under <HI>Attila</HI> their King, who stiled himself the <HI>Scourge of God,</HI> marched victoriously into <HI>Germany, Italy,</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> till <HI>Aetius</HI> General of the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Meroveus</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> slew 200000 of them in one Battel in 450. Then they retired into <HI>Pannonia</HI> again, and maintain'd themselves in divers Wars.

The rest is very pleasant, fruitful of Corn, rising into Hills, and shady Groves. The whole indeed was one Forest, till <HI>Henry</HI> II. in the beginning of his Reign disforested it.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> which gives Name to the County, is seated upon the North side of the River <HI>Ouse,</HI> somewhat high; and stretcheth out it self in length to the Northward: it has four Churches in it, a fair Bridge of Stone over the River, and near it is the Mount or Plot of an ancient Castle, (now ruined,) built by <HI>Edward</HI> the Elder, in the Year 917. Which King <HI>David</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> (who had this County with the Title of an Earl, from King <HI>Stephen</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> for an Augmentation of his Estate,) in the Year 1135. enlarged with new Buildings, and Bulwarks: but <HI>Henry</HI> II. finding great Inconveniences from it, razed it to the Ground. This was a very considerable Town in the times of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, and perhaps greater than now. The first Earl of <HI>Huntingdon</HI> was <HI>Waltheof,</HI> Created in 1068. two years after the Con∣quest: he being beheaded, <HI>Simon de Lyze,</HI> (who Married <HI>Maud</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Waltheof</HI>) was made Earl in 1075. <HI>David</HI> Prince of <HI>Scotland,</HI> her second Husband, was the next Earl in 1108.

<P>The. <HI>Hyreanian</HI> Sea, <HI>Mare Hyrcanium,</HI> takes this ancient well known Name from this Province: but it is no less frequently called, both in Ancient and Mo∣dern Geographers and Historians, the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea. This Sea is called by various Names according to the Countries which do border upon it.

Its greatest extent is from North to South, (that is, from <HI>Astrachan,</HI> to <HI>Ferabath,</HI>) eight deg. of the <HI>Equator;</HI> or one hundred and twenty <HI>German</HI> Miles, or four hundred and eighty <HI>English</HI> Miles: its Breadth from the Province of <HI>Chuaresin,</HI> to the Mountains of <HI>Circassia</HI> (or <HI>Shirwan,</HI>) is six deg. or ninety <HI>German</HI> Miles, or three hundred and sixty <HI>English</HI> Miles. The Waters are in the middle as salt as those of any other Sea whatsoever; but it neither Ebbs nor Flows, as all the rest do, which have any Intercourse with the Ocean. It hath in a manner never a safe Harbor upon it: the best is <HI>Min∣kischlak,</HI> or <HI>Manguslave,</HI> on the side of the <HI>Grand Tartary.</HI> The Water is of the same colour with that of other Seas: it has but one Island in it, and that lies towards <HI>Persia,</HI> called <HI>Ensil,</HI> which has never an House in it.

It is generally very shallow, and flat; therefore in Tempests dangerous to those that Sail upon it: the <HI>Persians</HI> never trust to it, and rarely go out of sight of the Shoar.

<P><HI>Iamaica,</HI> a very great Island in North <HI>America,</HI> first discovered by <HI>Columbus,</HI> and called thus in Honor of S. <HI>James.</HI> It was found out by him in his second Voyage to <HI>America,</HI> whilst he sailed about <HI>Cuba.</HI> In his third Voyage he suffered Shipwrack upon it; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ungratefully designed to have suffered him to perish, out of pure envy; but he found the Natives more kind than they. Whereupon he landed, and fell to Plant it; building the Town of <HI>Metilla;</HI> which they deserted soon after, and built <HI>Sevil,</HI> ten Leagues more West. In 1509, the Natives rebelled against <HI>Didacus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Columbus,</HI> but were sub∣dued. In 1590, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> built S. <HI>Jago,</HI> and de∣serted <HI>Sevil.</HI> In 1638, one <HI>Jackson,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Man, with a Fleet of <HI>English</HI> Privateers, surprized and plun∣dered S. <HI>Jago;</HI> then left it to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> again. The time being come when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were to pay for their Ingratitude to <HI>Columbus,</HI> and their Cru∣elty to the Natives, (some Millions of which they had barbarously murdered;) the <HI>English,</HI> under <HI>Penn</HI> and <HI>Venables,</HI> Landed here, about twenty thousand strong, being mostly necessitous Persons, who had been un∣done by our then Tyrant, and the Times, <HI>May</HI> 3. 1655. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> unable to resist so great a force, retired into the Woods, and Fastnesses; ho∣ping to retrieve what they thus left, by a Treaty; but it proved otherwise. For part of the <HI>English</HI> fell to Plant; the rest to Privateer upon the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by which they got Wealth: and the Fame of this so in∣creased, that many going over to them, it became in a few years a very powerful Colony; now able alone to manage a War against all the Forces the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have in the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> This Island is situate be∣tween seventeen and eighteen degrees of North Lat. within the <HI>Tropicks,</HI> in the <HI>Mare del Nort;</HI> one hun∣dred and forty Leagues North of the Main Continent of <HI>America,</HI> fifteen South from <HI>Cuba,</HI> twenty West from <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and one hundred and forty from <HI>Carthagena Nova.</HI> It is of an Oval Form; one hun∣dred and seventy Miles long; seventy in breadth; and contains four or five Millions of Acres; Nine hun∣dred thousand of which were Planted in 1675. In the middle there is a lofty Chain of Mountains, which run the whole length of the Isle, from East to West; from which spring plenty of pleasant and useful Ri∣vers, to the great refreshment and convenience of the Inhabitants. It has a very rich fat Soil, black and mixed with Clay, except in the South-West Parts, where it is generally a more loose Earth: it every where answers the Planter's Care and Cost. The Air is always serene and clear; the Earth in her Summer Livery; here being a perpetual Spring. It has fre∣quent Showers of Rain, constant cooling <HI>Breezes</HI> of Wind from the East: the <HI>Dews</HI> in the Night quicken the Growth of what is Planted: so that it is the most delightful, temperate, healthful, pleasant Island of all those in the <HI>West-Indies:</HI> and will be extremely con∣siderable, when it comes to be thorowly Peopled.

The <HI>Dutch,</HI> (who Trade here) are secured with the ut∣most Caution, that they may not surprize any part of the Shoar, or build any Fort, or do any other Act whereby they may settle themselves: nor will they permit them to see more of the Country than one small Peninsula; or of the Inhabitants, than those they Trade with; and for a long time they would not permit them to Land, Buy, or Sell, till they had re∣nounced their Christianity.

<P><HI>India,</HI> is taken for a considerable part of <HI>Asia,</HI> com∣monly called the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> to distinguish it from <HI>America,</HI> which is called the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> It is thought to be the <HI>Havilah</HI> in the Holy Scriptures: by the Natives, <HI>Indostan.</HI> Bounded on the North with the <HI>Asiatick Tartary,</HI> the Mountains of <HI>Imaus,</HI> and <HI>Emodus;</HI> on the East with the Kingdom of <HI>China,</HI> on the South with the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean, and on the West with the Kingdom of <HI>Persia.</HI> This Country consists partly in a vastly extended Continent, partly in Islands, some of which are very great. That upon the Conti∣nent, is divided into three Parts. 1. The Empire of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> or North <HI>India;</HI> which is a part of <HI>India intra Gangem &amp; Indum;</HI> and more peculiarly called <HI>Indosthan;</HI> in this there are thirty five Kingdoms. 2. The Peninsula of <HI>Malabar.</HI> 3. The <HI>India extra Gangem.</HI> In the <HI>India extra Gangem,</HI> are four more considerable Kingdoms; <HI>Pegu</HI> to the West, <HI>Ava</HI> to the <HI>North, Siam</HI> to the South, and <HI>Cochinchina</HI> to the East; each of which contains many particular or lesser Kingdoms in it. The principal of the Islands are <HI>Borneo, Ceylan, Java, Sumatra, Celebes, Min∣dano, Luconia, Hainan, Pakan, Gilolo,</HI> the <HI>Moluc∣caes,</HI> and <HI>Philippine</HI> Isles. Many of these are so great, as to be divided in many Kingdoms: some of them have never been throughly discovered by the <HI>Europe∣an</HI> Nations. This Country extendeth in length from deg. 106. to 159. of Long. and from deg. 10. of Southern Latitude, to 44. of Northern. It abounds with Gold and Silver Mines, and all other sorts of Metals, but Copper and Lead; with all sorts of Cat∣tel, but Horses; with all sorts of Corn, but Wheat. So that these and Wines are almost the only things they need from other Nations, towards the Convenience, or indeed Luxury of humane Life; for this is the Store-house of Spice and Jewels, to the whole World. <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great was the first of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who Discovered and Conquered a part of this vast Region; which soon after revolted from his Successors. The

<HI>Romans</HI> never went so far; but were honoured with some Embassies from them, when they had Po∣tent Princes, as <HI>Augustus, Antoninus,</HI> and <HI>Constan∣tine.</HI> After-times wrapped them up in the Clouds again. There was a Trade driven by the way of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> between the <HI>Persian, Turkish,</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Merchants for Spice; yet there was little known of of them, till the <HI>Portuguese</HI> discovered the way by the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> in 1499. and the first Voy∣ages were made hither by them in 1500. and 1502. The principal Rivers are <HI>Indus</HI> and the <HI>Ganges.</HI> Amongst the ancient Inhabitants, the <HI>Brachmanes</HI> and <HI>Gymnosophistae</HI> for Philosophy, the <HI>Gangarides</HI> for War, were the most considerable. <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> carried his Victorious Arms hither in the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 426. and 427. (where he defeated <HI>Porus</HI> King of <HI>India</HI>). And before him, some write, <HI>Se∣miramis.</HI> There is a Tradition, that <HI>St. Tho∣mas</HI> preached Christianity here, (whence comes the Church of the <HI>Christians of St. Thomas</HI>); and that his Body, first found at <HI>Meliapour,</HI> now lyes inter∣red at <HI>Goa</HI> in a stately Church built for the pur∣pose by the Order of <HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal.</HI> In the third Century, the Philosopher <HI>Pantaenus</HI> was sent by <HI>Demetrius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Alexandria</HI> to preach to the <HI>Indians. Aedesius</HI> and <HI>Frumentius</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Constantine the Great,</HI> two Laicks travel∣ling into <HI>India,</HI> voluntarily did the same. The lat∣ter of which, was afterwards by <HI>Athanasius</HI> consecra∣ted Bishop of <HI>India.</HI> See <HI>Brachmanes, Banjans, Gymnosophistae,</HI> and <HI>Benares.</HI></P>
<P><HI>India extra Gangem,</HI> is bounded on the West by the furthest, or most Eastern Branch of the River <HI>Ganges;</HI> (which is called <HI>Antiboli</HI> from its spring unto its fall into the Ocean;) on the North, with unknown Countries; on the East with the Kingdom of <HI>China,</HI> and the Eastern Ocean; and on the South with the same Ocean. In this there are four great Kingdoms, which do not depend on the <HI>Great Mo∣gul.</HI> See the general Division.</P>

His Capital Ci∣ty is <HI>Agra.</HI> He is of the Race of <HI>Tamerlain,</HI> the Great <HI>Scythian</HI> Conquerour; and has been possessed of this Country ever since the year 1473. It is abun∣dantly rich in Gold, Silver, Precious Stones, and Mer∣chandizes. The propriety of almost all the Lands belongs to the <HI>Great Mogul:</HI> who besides, is heir to the great Lords of his Court and all Officers within his pay.</P>

After this, it was an Imperial and Free-City; but exempted in 1402. by <HI>Lewis</HI> the Emperour, and now under the <HI>Elector Palatine.</HI> Near this place S. <HI>Lewis,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> died in 840. Called <HI>Nyder Ingelheim,</HI> the <HI>Lower</HI> or <HI>Nether Ingelheim,</HI> to distinguish it from another called <HI>Over</HI> or <HI>Ʋpper <HI>Ingelheim.</HI></HI> In the years 788, 948. and 972. there were great Councils held here.</P>

<P><HI>Ingoldstad, <HI>Ingoldstadium, Aureapolis,</HI></HI> a City of <HI>Germany,</HI> in the Dukedom of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> which has a Bridge over the <HI>Danube.</HI> It was at first a Village; but exalted to the dignity and magnitude of a City by <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> Emperour of <HI>Germany.</HI> In 1546. the <HI>Protestant</HI> Arms proved unsuccessful be∣fore it. <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> the Victorious King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> was not able to take it, when he attempted it in 1632. In 1410. here was an University opened, which has obtained many Privileges and good Endow∣ments from <HI>Lewis</HI> Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and Pope <HI>Pius</HI> II. It is now under the Duke of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> This City lies three Miles from <HI>Newburgh</HI> to the East, and seven from <HI>Ratisbone</HI> to the West. The houses are almost all of Wood.</P>

The next day these Confederate Princes took the Town, plundered all they found belonging to the Emperour, and <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but spared the Towns Mens Goods and Houses. This A∣ction put an end to all the Projects of that Prince in <HI>Germany;</HI> and has established the <HI>German</HI> Liberty, then in great danger of ruin.

<P><HI>Iourdain, <HI>Jordan, Jordanes,</HI></HI> is the greatest River in the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> or <HI>Palestine;</HI> and the most cele∣brated in the Holy Scriptures: called at this day by the Inhabitants <HI>Scheriah.</HI> It ariseth in the Confines of <HI>Coelosyria,</HI> from two Fountains, (<HI>Jor</HI> and <HI>Dan,</HI>) both at the foot of Mount <HI>Libanus;</HI> four Miles above <HI>Caesarea Philippi:</HI> and running Southward, it maketh two Lakes; first that of <HI>Meroz,</HI> then that of <HI>Caper∣naum,</HI> called also the Sea of <HI>Galilee;</HI> and having wa∣tered several of the ancient Cities of the Land of <HI>Ca∣naan,</HI> (none of which are now extant,) it falls into the <HI>Dead Sea,</HI> or <HI>Lake of Sodom.</HI> It is the greatest, or rather the only River in all this Country; the rest being mere Brooks rather than Rivers. <HI>About half as broad at</HI> Jerico, <HI>as the River</HI> Seine <HI>is at</HI> Paris; <HI>very rapid, and the Water of it thick; because it passeth through fat Lands, and is very full of Fish; beset on both sides with thick and pleasant Woods.</HI> This account is given of it by Monsieur <HI>Thevenot,</HI> who saw it himself. Famous moreover to all po∣sterity, for the Children of <HI>Israel's</HI> passing it on dry ground at their entrance into <HI>Canaan,</HI> and the Pro∣phet <HI>Elijah's</HI> doing the same in company with <HI>Elisha:</HI> Our <HI>Saviour</HI> received Baptism here from the hands

It overflows in Summer with the melted Snow from Mount <HI>Libanus.</HI> But in the Winter runs a low Water: and after its Current into the <HI>Dead Sea,</HI> it is clear without mixture, for above a League together: issuing thence by a <HI>subterraneous</HI> Channel into the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Ipsala, <HI>Cypsella,</HI></HI> a City in <HI>Thrace,</HI> by the River <HI>Mela:</HI> at first a Bishops See, under the Archbishop of <HI>Trajanopoli,</HI> or <HI>Zernis;</HI> afterwards it became the Metropolis. It lies between this City to the West, twenty nine Miles, and <HI>Drusilaba</HI> to the North-East twenty six Miles: the River in our latter Maps is cal∣led <HI>Larissa;</HI> and falls into the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> over against the Isle of <HI>Lembro,</HI> just behind that Peninsula which makes the <HI>Dardanels</HI> straight.</P>
<P><HI>Ipswich, <HI>Gippo-vicus,</HI></HI> the County Town of <HI>Suf∣folk,</HI> heretofore called <HI>Gippwich:</HI> seated on the North side of the River <HI>Stour,</HI> upon the foot of a steep Hill, in somewhat a low Ground: it has a com∣modious Haven, and was heretofore a place of great Trade, with many wealthy Merchants in it, and a vast number of other people; but now decayed as to both. It was also formerly fortified with Trenches and Rampires; the loss of which, is not to be lamen∣ted; the Town being so seated, that it can never be made a place of Defence, the Hills on all sides (but the South, and South-East,) commanding it. It has fourteen Parish Churches, and a great many goodly Houses, the tokens of its former Wealth. In 991. the <HI>Danes</HI> sacked it, and nine years after repeated their Cruelty upon it. In the Reign of S. <HI>Edward,</HI> it had eight hundred Burgesses, who paid Custom to the King. There was also a Castle built here by the <HI>Normans,</HI> which <HI>Hugh Bigod,</HI> Earl of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> de∣fended against the Usurper King <HI>Stephen;</HI> but was forced to surrender at last: the ruins are now lost. Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> supposeth it to have been demolished by <HI>Henry</HI> II. when he did the same by <HI>Waleton</HI> Castle not far off. Here landed the three thousand <HI>Flemings,</HI> which the Nobility called in against <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> II. when his Son rebelled against him. In the late Rebellion, this Town stood clear of all those Ca∣lamities which involved the rest of the Nation. The Bishop of <HI>Norwich</HI> hath a House here; and the Vis∣count of <HI>Hereford</HI> another, befitting his degree and quality. The Honourable <HI>Henry Fitz-Roy,</HI> Duke of <HI>Grafton,</HI> was created Viscount <HI>Ipswich, Aug.</HI> 16. 1672. who died of the Wounds that he received in the Service of King <HI>William</HI> before <HI>Cork, Octob.</HI> 9. 1690. This Town is also a Corporation, and sends two Bur∣gesses to the Parliament. It has a Free-School, with the convenience of a good Library, and a Ho∣spital. Cardinal <HI>Wolsey</HI> was born here, and began the building of a stately College, which bears his Name to this day.</P>
<P><HI>Ireland, <HI>Hibernia, Ivernia,</HI></HI> is a great, fruitful, and noble Island on the West of <HI>Great Britain:</HI> ac∣counted in ancient time for greatness and glory, the third Island of the World; and called then the <HI>Lesser Britain. Orpheus, Aristotle,</HI> and <HI>Claudian,</HI> call it <HI>Ierna; Juvenal, Mela, Juverna; Diodorus Sicu∣lus, Iris.</HI> Others <HI>Jovernia, Overnia,</HI> and <HI>Burnia.</HI> The Natives <HI>Erin.</HI> The <HI>Welsh <HI>Yuerdon.</HI></HI> The <HI>En∣glish <HI>Ireland.</HI></HI> It is three hundred Miles long, and two hundred broad: on the East it has the tempestu∣ous <HI>Irish</HI> Sea, between it and <HI>Great Britain;</HI> on the West the <HI>Vergivian</HI> Ocean, on the North the <HI>Deucalidonian Sea,</HI> and on the South the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Ocean. Divided into four Provinces, <HI>Lein∣ster, Mounster, Ʋlster,</HI> and <HI>Connaught,</HI> which heretofore sustained the Title of as many King∣doms; comprehending in all thirty Counties, four Archbishopricks, and twelve Bishopricks. The Country is full of Woods, Hills, and Bogs. The Soil, rich and fruitful, especially as to Grass; (<HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> in the times of the Emperour <HI>Claudius,</HI> gives the very same character of it;) and therefore it has ever abounded in Cattle, which is its most Staple Com∣modity. The principal Rivers are the <HI>Shannon,</HI> the <HI>Sewer,</HI> the <HI>Barow,</HI> the <HI>Black-Water,</HI> the <HI>Shour,</HI> the <HI>Neure,</HI> the <HI>Boyne,</HI> the <HI>Leffy, &amp;c.</HI> The Capital City heretofore <HI>Armagh,</HI> now <HI>Dublin.</HI> The Air is at all times temperate; but too moist to be at all times pleasant or wholsome. The <HI>Romans</HI> in all probabi∣lity never had any footing in this Island. This Na∣tion was converted to Christianity in the fifth Centu∣ry by <HI>Palladius,</HI> and S. <HI>Patrick;</HI> especially the lat∣ter: who planted not only Religion, but so much Learning too amongst them, that in the next Age the Monks of <HI>Ireland</HI> were eminent for Holiness and Learning; and <HI>Ireland</HI> thence called, <HI>Insula Sancto∣rum,</HI> an <HI>Island of Saints.</HI> In 694. <HI>Egfrid,</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> first entered, and destroyed this Na∣tion with Fire and Sword; after this, the <HI>Danes,</HI> for thirty years together, wasted and destroyed them. After these, the <HI>Germans.</HI> After them, <HI>Edgar,</HI> the most powerful King of <HI>England,</HI> conquered a great part of <HI>Ireland.</HI> And when by Massacres and other Accidents the <HI>Irish</HI> were freed from all these Calami∣ties; there ensued Domestick Broils among themselves. In 1155. <HI>Henry</HI> II. being called in by the Natives, re∣solved on the Conquest of them; whereupon <HI>Ri∣chard Strongbow,</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> began it: in 1172. <HI>Henry</HI> II. in Person entered <HI>Ireland;</HI> and taking upon him the Stile of Sovereign Lord of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> the States and all the petty Kings submitted to him: and passed over all their Rule and Power, which was confirmed by Pope <HI>Hadrian.</HI> The Kings of <HI>England</HI> continued the Title of Lords of <HI>Ireland,</HI> till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who took first upon him the Stile and Title of King of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in 1541. which was confirmed to <HI>Mary</HI> his Daughter, by Pope <HI>Paul</HI> IV. in 1555. The <HI>Irish</HI> have ever looked upon this Conquest as a Wrong and an Usurpation, which no Act of theirs, nor Time it self could make valid. Hence, when ever <HI>England</HI> has been imbroiled, they have taken the opportunity of Revolting. In the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I. when that Prince was engaged against the <HI>Scots,</HI> one <HI>Donald O-Neal</HI> stiled himself <HI>King of</HI> Ulster; <HI>and in Right of Inheritance, the undoubted Heir of all</HI> Ireland. But when in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. the pretence of Religion was added, first the Earl of <HI>Kildare</HI> rebelled in 1537. and was presently suppressed, taken, and beheaded, with his five Uncles. In 1539. <HI>O-Neal</HI> began another Re∣bellion: but so soon as <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Sussex,</HI> Lord Lieutenant, came against him with an Army, the Gentleman grew humble, submitted, and was pardo∣ned. He flew out again in 1563. burnt the Cathedral of <HI>Armagh,</HI> and besieged <HI>Dundalk;</HI> but with no suc∣cess. In 1565. Sir <HI>Henry Sidney,</HI> Lord Lieutenant, went against him, and in a Fight broke his Forces: so that flying to the <HI>Scots,</HI> (whom he had likewise in∣jured)
<PB N="207" REF="109"/>
in 1567. he was assassinated in cold blood, and presently after attained in Parliament, and the Title of <HI>O-Neal</HI> abolished. The Earl of <HI>Desmond</HI> was the next, who in 1579. calling in the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> began another Rebellion, which ended ill for him; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being driven out the year after, and this Earl taken and slain in 1583. In 1595. <HI>Tir-Oen,</HI> who had done great Service against the Earl of <HI>Des∣mond,</HI> and was highly favoured by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> most ungratefully began a Rebellion, the most dan∣gerous of all the other; this Earl having been bred in the Queens Service, and learned Military Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cipline from the <HI>English,</HI> which he now made use of against them. In 1598. he defeated the <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Black∣water.</HI> In 1599. brought the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> to con∣descend to a Treaty with him. In 1601. he brought the <HI>Spaniards</HI> over to his Assistance, who took and garrisoned <HI>Kinsale;</HI> which was retaken by Sir <HI>Charles Blunt,</HI> (afterwards Lord <HI>Montjoy,</HI>) and the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> totally driven out: whereupon <HI>Tir-Oen</HI> submit∣ted, and was brought over by the Lord Lieutenant, to King <HI>James</HI> I. in 1603. This War lasted eight years; and might have proved fatal to the <HI>English,</HI> if God had not prevented it. After this I find no general Insurrection of the <HI>Irish</HI> till 1641. when see∣ing <HI>Charles</HI> I. engaged in War with the <HI>Scots</HI> at home, they on a sudden rose up and assassinated two hun∣dred thousand <HI>English</HI> in a few days, when no body suspected any such thing. This Insurrection began <HI>September</HI> 3. The Troubles of <HI>England</HI> gave them some respit; but in 1649. and fifty, <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> began their Chastisement so effectually, that <HI>Ireton,</HI> and those he left to carry it on, erected mournful Tro∣phies of the Divine Vengeance against them, with no great expence of Time, Blood, or Treasure: it missed but a little, that the <HI>Irish</HI> Name and Nation had been totally extirpated. <HI>Charles</HI> II. upon his Resti∣tution in 1660. shewed them more Mercy; restored such as had any pretences of Loyalty to plead for their Estates; and governed them all his time with so much Clemency, that this Nation never was in a better State since they fell under the <HI>English,</HI> than at the time of the Death of that Good Prince.</P>

<P><HI>Kent, <HI>Cantium,</HI></HI> is the most South-Eastern County of <HI>England:</HI> on the North it is bounded by the <HI>Thames,</HI> which parts it from <HI>Essex,</HI> on the East and South it has the <HI>British Sea;</HI> in part on the North, and on the West it has <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Surrey.</HI> It is in length from East to West fifty Miles, and from South to North twenty six. Divided into five <HI>Lathes</HI> (<HI>Sutton, Ayles∣ford, Soray, St. Augustine,</HI> and <HI>Shepway</HI>) wherein are four hundred and eight Parishes, and thirty Market Towns. That part which lieth towards the <HI>Thames</HI> is healthful, but not fruitful: the middle parts are both; the Southern are very fruitful, but not healthful. The <HI>Thames,</HI> the <HI>Medway,</HI> the <HI>Stower,</HI> the <HI>Tun</HI> and the <HI>Rother,</HI> besides lesser Streams, water it. Some give this Character of it: The <HI>Weald</HI> for <HI>Wood, East Kent</HI> for Corn, <HI>Rumney</HI> for Meadow; <HI>Tenham</HI> for an Orchard, <HI>Shepey</HI> and <HI>Reculver</HI> for Wheat, <HI>Thanet</HI> for Barley, and <HI>Hedcorn</HI> for Capons. This Country was first conquered by <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> (though not without Resistance) in the years of <HI>Rome</HI> 696. and 698. fifty three years before the Birth of our Sa∣viour; being forced to a double Expedition against almost this single County. As he began the Conquest of <HI>Britain</HI> here, so did the <HI>Saxons: Hengist</HI> erecting the Kingdom of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the year of Christ 456. se∣ven years after the first arrival of the <HI>Saxons.</HI> Against the <HI>Danes,</HI> the <HI>Kentish</HI> men did also great things; and with much Courage and Patience, repelled those Barbarous People. When <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour had subdued all the rest of the Nation, he was glad to come to a Composition with the Inhabitants of this County; and to grant them their ancient Liber∣ties and Customs. Whence the Laws of <HI>Gavelkind</HI> obtain here to this day. This County was also the first that imbraced the Christian Religion, from <HI>Au∣gustine</HI> the Monk, in the year 568. Accordingly <HI>Canterbury</HI> is justly the Metropolis of the whole King∣dom of <HI>England;</HI> as having been the first Fountain from whence the Christian Religion spread it self amongst the <HI>Saxons:</HI> for as for the <HI>British</HI> or <HI>Welsh,</HI> they had imbraced Christianity long before. <HI>VVilli∣am</HI> the Conquerour in 1067. created <HI>Odo,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bajeux,</HI> (his half Brother) Lord Chief Justice, and Lord Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent.</HI> In 1465. <HI>Edward</HI> IV. created <HI>Edmund Grey,</HI> Lord <HI>Ruthyn,</HI> Lord Treasurer of <HI>England;</HI> which Family still injoys this Honour; <HI>Anthony</HI> II. the present Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> being the eleventh in this Succession.

This Town was first fortified by <HI>Matthias Corvinus,</HI> King of <HI>Hunga∣ry,</HI> in 1472. against the <HI>Germans</HI> in design, but for them in effect; it having been one of the impregna∣ble Bulwarks of Christendom against the <HI>Turks,</HI> ever since they took <HI>Gran</HI> in 1542. It is a great, popu∣lous, rich City, as well as a strong one.

Very small, and almost reduced to the meanness of a Village; though it gives Name to the whole Nation in which it stands; and is the usual Seat of the <HI>Cham.</HI> § The <HI>Krim Tartars,</HI> are a Nation of <HI>Europe,</HI> boun∣ded with the <HI>Borysthenes,</HI> [<HI>Nieper</HI>] to the West: the <HI>Psola,</HI> and <HI>Desna,</HI> (two Rivers which fall into the <HI>Nieper,</HI>) the <HI>Donetz,</HI> or <HI>Lesser Tanais,</HI> and in part by the <HI>Greater Tanais,</HI> to the North: by the last River to the East also, and in part to the South: the rest of their Southern Border is made by the <HI>Euxine</HI> or <HI>Black Sea,</HI> into which the <HI>Nieper</HI> falls. The most Southern part of this Country is the <HI>Taurica Cherso∣nesus,</HI> anciently filled with Noble <HI>Greek</HI> Cities, the Principal of which was <HI>Theodosia,</HI> now <HI>Caffa;</HI> but this Hord, or Tribe of <HI>Tartary,</HI> which now possess it, coming out of <HI>Asia,</HI> have so ruined them, that there are scarce any footsteps left of their ancient Grandeur. These <HI>Tartars</HI> lead their Lives after the ancient man∣ner; having no fixed Habitations; but driving their Cattle, Wives and Children about from place to place, as Necessity and the Season of the Year require. They have only covered Wagons to preserve them from the injury of the Weather. And they accordingly value themselves upon this <HI>Nomadical</HI> way of living; as the Protectors of their Cities, and Men of such exalted Virtue, as is not to be confined within any smoaky Walls. In the interim they are extremely proud, ig∣norant, nasty and barbarous. Their Diet is Roots, Cheese, Garlick, and for the most part Horse-flesh; which they eat without Bread, and often raw: <HI>Beef</HI> and <HI>Venison</HI> being reserved for their Great Men. They value <HI>Brass</HI> and <HI>Steel,</HI> above <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver</HI> They were once Christians, but have since Apostatized to Mahometanism: yet they retain one Article of the <HI>Creed</HI> firmly, that <HI>Christ shall Judge both the quick and the dead, in the day of Judgment.</HI> Upon this account they are more favourable to the Christians that live amongst them, than any other <HI>Mahometans</HI> are. They use their own <HI>Tartarian</HI> Tongue, inter∣mixed with <HI>Arabick</HI> and <HI>Turkish;</HI> and the <HI>Chaldean</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> Characters. This Prince hath hereto∣fore been able to Arm one hundred and fifty thou∣sand of his own Subjects: and in 1571. pierced as far as the City of <HI>Mosco;</HI> and set fire on the Suburbs, which taking the City, in the space of four hours, burnt the greatest part of it, (though thirty Miles in com∣pass:) Eight hundred thousand People of all Sexes, and Ages, perishing in this Ruin. After all, the <HI>Turk</HI> treats this Prince as his Slave; at some times removes, at others Murthers him. In 1686. there was a League between the <HI>Russians</HI> and the <HI>Poles,</HI> for the Conquer∣ing this People: but the former have done no great Wonders yet with an Army of three hundred thou∣sand Men.</P>

<P><HI>Lapithae,</HI> an antient People of <HI>Thessalia,</HI> dwelling in the Country about <HI>Larissa,</HI> and the Mountain <HI>Olympus. Ovid</HI> styles them <HI>Sylvestres. Virgil</HI> as∣cribes to them the Invention of <HI>Bridles.</HI></P>

Bounded on the North with the Frozen Sea, or the North Ocean; on the West with the Kingdom of <HI>Norway;</HI> on the South with <HI>Bothnia</HI> and <HI>Finia,</HI> (two Provinces of <HI>Sweden</HI>) and on the East by the White Sea. It was heretofore divided into three Kingdoms; and is now at this day divided between three Princes, the Emperor of <HI>Moscovy,</HI> the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> of which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> has the greatest share. <HI>Johannes Schefferus</HI> lately put out a very exact Account of these Countries: towards the North and East it is extreamly Mountain∣ous and barren; but the South is more level, and well watered with Rivers and Lakes. There have been, not long since, found in it, Mines of Brass, Iron, Silver and Lead, besides divers sorts of precious Stones. As this is one of the <HI>Hyberborean</HI> People, who are buried the greatest part of the year in Snow and Darkness; so they are extreamly Rude, Igno∣rant, Poor, and Barbarous: so fearful, that they will start and be in a fright at the noise of a Leaf: infamous for Witchcraft, and Conjurations; yet Christians in Profession; and so revengeful that they will throw themselves sometimes into a River, to pe∣rish willingly with one they hate in their Arms, if they can but so destroy him. The more Northern are the most barbarous.</P>
<P><HI>Lar, <HI>Laria,</HI></HI> a great and magnificent City in that Province, of the Kingdom of <HI>Persia,</HI> which gives name to a Kingdom: seated in the Confines of <HI>Cara∣mania,</HI> upon the River <HI>Tisindon;</HI> a hundred and se∣venty Miles from <HI>Ormus</HI> to the North-East: but in the later Maps it is placed only forty <HI>German</HI> Miles from <HI>Ormus,</HI> and on the West side of the River. Monsieur <HI>Thevenot</HI> gives a large Account of this Town in the second part of his Travels, cap 4. to whom I refer the Reader. It lies Long. 93. 40. Lat. 27. 40. Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> saith, it consisted of about two thousand Houses, and had had five; but lost three thousand in an Earthquake. It is, as he saith, fa∣mous for nothing but its Castle; built at the North∣end, on an aspiring Mountain, and stored with the Cannon brought from <HI>Ormus.</HI> § The Kingdom of <HI>Lar</HI> took its name from the last mentioned City; lying near <HI>Ormus,</HI> and the entrance of the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulph. <HI>Schah Abbas,</HI> King of <HI>Persia,</HI> annexed this to the rest of his Dominions in the end of the last Century; <HI>viz.</HI> in 1596. by a Conquest of the <HI>Gue∣bres;</HI> who were before Masters of it, and were Go∣verned by a Prince of their own, stiled King of <HI>Lar;</HI> the last of which was slain by the <HI>Persians,</HI> with all his Progeny, to secure this barren and poor Kingdom to the King of <HI>Persia.</HI> The Water of this Kingdom is extream bad and unhealthful, as both <HI>Herbert</HI> and <HI>Thevenot</HI> agree: the Soil barren and sandy: and they both say also, that in this Kingdom there are a vast number of <HI>Jews.</HI> But Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> saith, That there is neither River nor Rivolet near the City of <HI>Lar,</HI> by a hundred Miles; and <HI>Thevenot,</HI> they had nothing but Cistern-Water to drink, which was sub∣ject to Corruption; which seems to confirm Mr. <HI>Her∣bert</HI>'s Report. See <HI>Herbert,</HI> pag. 52. <HI>Thevenot,</HI> Part. 2. pag. 131. § <HI>Ptolemy</HI> mentions an <HI>Arabian</HI> River, <HI>Lar;</HI> Now called <HI>Om.</HI> See <HI>Om.</HI></P>

It continued a separate Kingdom, under twenty nine Princes; till in 1228. <HI>Ferdin.</HI> III. annexed it to <HI>Castile</HI> (he being married to <HI>Beren∣guela,</HI> second Sister of <HI>Henry</HI> King of <HI>Castile;</HI>) tho in prejudice of <HI>Blanch,</HI> the eldest Sister, (mar∣ried to <HI>Lewis</HI> VIII. King of <HI>France:</HI>) which was afterward in 1267. set right by a Treaty, when <HI>Lewis</HI> IX. in consideration of a Marriage surrendered all his Right and Title, (as Son of the said <HI>Blanch,</HI>) to <HI>Alphonsus</HI> V. King of <HI>Leon</HI> and <HI>Castile. Peter de la Marca,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> in his History of <HI>Bearn,</HI> saith, this Kingdom did not begin so early as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend; and endeavours to prove it. But this is no place for Controversies.</P>

This is a Bishops See, under the Archbishop of <HI>Toures:</HI> one S. <HI>Paul</HI> being its most ancient Bishop, about the year 600, the City is often called <HI>S. Paul de Leon,</HI> from him: it is the Capital of the Territory of <HI>Leonnois,</HI> well fortified, and has also a Castle, and a safe Harbour upon the <HI>British</HI> Sea. Heretofore the Seat of the Dukes of <HI>Britagne;</HI> and the Country of the ancient <HI>Osismi</HI> or <HI>Osismii</HI> mentioned by <HI>Caesar:</HI> whence its <HI>Latin</HI> Name, besides <HI>Leona</HI> and <HI>Leonum,</HI> is <HI>Civitas Osismorum.</HI> § There is mention made of another <HI>Leon</HI> in <HI>Cappadocia</HI> in the <HI>Lesser Asia,</HI> other∣wise called <HI>Vatiza,</HI> and thought to be the <HI>Poleme∣nium</HI> of the Ancients.</P>

<P><HI>Lepanto, <HI>Naupactus, Aetolia,</HI></HI> a Sea-Port in <HI>A∣chaia,</HI> (now <HI>Livadia,</HI>) called by the <HI>Turks, <HI>Enebchti;</HI></HI> is seated in that part of <HI>Greece,</HI> which the Ancients called <HI>Aetolia,</HI> twelve Miles from <HI>Patras:</HI> the <HI>Italians</HI> gave it the name of <HI>Lepanto:</HI> it is seated not far from the entrance of the Western Bay of <HI>Co∣rinth,</HI> heretofore so called; but now from this place the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto.</HI> The City is built on the South side of a towering Mountain, formed like a Cone; on the top of which is a strong Castle, sur∣rounded with four strong Walls, set at some di∣stance one above another; between which the Inha∣bitants have their Houses. The Port is very handsom and beautiful; and may be secured by a Chain, the Mouth of it is so streight; it will hold but a few Ships, and those cannot go out and in at any time, for want of Water. It is seated in a pleasant Country, filled with delightful Gardens, yielding some of the best Wine in <HI>Greece;</HI> and has on the East side a a fine River, which serves their Mills, then their Gardens, and afterward all the City and Seamen. The <HI>Turks</HI> have six or seven Mosques in it, the <HI>Greeks</HI> two Churches, and the <HI>Jews</HI> three Synagogues. In 1408. it was under the Emperor of <HI>Greece;</HI> but being too remote (as things then stood) for him to secure it, <HI>Emanuel</HI> the Emperor, assigned it to the <HI>Venetians;</HI> who took care to fortifie it, as it is now. In 1475. <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Great, the same that took <HI>Constantinople,</HI> having gained <HI>Corinth,</HI> besieged it with an Army of thirty thousand Men; and after four Months spent before it, was forced to retire with with shame and loss. The <HI>Turks</HI> having found by this costly experiment the strength of this impor∣tant place, in 1499. made use of another me∣thod: besides a victorious Army, and a potent Fleet, to terrifie them, he imployed Bribes; corrupted <HI>Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ronimo Tropo,</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> Governour; and by a Treachery altogether unworthy of <HI>Bajazet</HI> II. (who was here in person,) possessed himself of it. In 1571. <HI>Octob.</HI> 7. in the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> from five a Clock in the morning till night, was fought the most bloody Sea Battel betwixt the <HI>Christian</HI> and the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Fleets, that ever besel the <HI>Turks</HI> since the beginning of their Empire. There, in the same Gulph, where the Emperor <HI>Augustus</HI> overthrew <HI>Marc An∣thony.</HI> The <HI>Christians</HI> lost eight thousand Men. Of the <HI>Turks,</HI> five thousand were taken prisoners, and about thirty thousand slain, with <HI>Hali Bassaw</HI> their Admiral. Of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Gallies, one hundred and thirty were taken, and above ninety others sunk, burnt, and de∣stroyed. The <HI>Generalissimo</HI> on the <HI>Christians</HI> side was <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> a Natural Brother to <HI>Philip</HI> II. King of <HI>Spain,</HI> accompanied with the Flower of the <HI>Italian</HI> Nobility. At the same time, nigh twenty thousand <HI>Christian</HI> Slaves recovered their Liberty. In 1687. the <HI>Venetians</HI> having in the three preceding years almost beat the <HI>Turks</HI> out of the rest of the <HI>Morea,</HI> and resolved to begin this Campagne with the Siege of <HI>Patras;</HI> their General <HI>Morosini,</HI> Landed in the <HI>Morea</HI> near <HI>Patras</HI> on <HI>July</HI> 22. not∣withstanding all the opposition of the <HI>Serasquier:</HI> the 24. he fought, and defeated the <HI>Serasquier:</HI> and ha∣ving thereupon taken in <HI>Patras,</HI> and the <HI>Dardanell</HI> Castle on that side, (so called in imitation of those of the <HI>Hellespont</HI>) he crossed to the other to <HI>Lepanto;</HI> and found the <HI>Turks</HI> making all the haste they could to empty the Place for him; whereupon he entred and took Possession of it for that Republick, without stri∣king one blow. Thus was this important Place lost, as basely as it was gained; and the Cowardize of this Age has revenged the Treachery of the former. It had in it one hundred and twenty Brass Canon: And it is an <HI>Archiepiscopal</HI> City, tho the Archbishop has used to reside at <HI>Larta.</HI> The <HI>Gulph</HI> of <HI>Lepanto</HI> is formed by the shooting forth of two Promontories into the <HI>Ionian</HI> Sea, from the <HI>Morea</HI> and <HI>Achaia;</HI> called <HI>Capo Antirio</HI> and <HI>Capo Rione.</HI> The first of which has the Castle of <HI>Patras,</HI> the other the Castle of <HI>Ro∣melia</HI> for its defence.</P>

But in 1646. in one of their Attacks they were beaten off, and lost all their Cannon here. This City lies twenty four <HI>Spanish</HI> Miles from <HI>Saragoza</HI> to the East; seven from the <HI>Ebro</HI> North, and twenty nine from <HI>Barcelona</HI> to the West. <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> overcame <HI>Afranius</HI> and <HI>Pe∣treius, Pompey</HI>'s Friends, here.

<P><HI>Leyden, <HI>Lugdunum Batavorum,</HI></HI> is a great City in the State of <HI>Holland,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Ptolemy</HI> and <HI>Antoninus.</HI> It is seated upon the old Stream of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and is the Capital of <HI>Rheinlandt,</HI> near the Lake of <HI>Harlem;</HI> three Leagues from <HI>Delft,</HI> and se∣ven from <HI>Amsterdam, Dort,</HI> and <HI>Ʋtretcht.</HI> Perhaps the most populous and wealthy City in all <HI>Holland,</HI> next <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> In the <HI>Roman</HI> times, the <HI>Praetor</HI> of the Empire for the <HI>Belgick Gaul,</HI> resided here with one of the Legions. It is situate in a plain and low Country, and has many Channels of Water pas∣sing through it: so that the City is divided into thirty one Islands, joined by one hundred forty five Bridges each to other: one hundred and four of which, are built with Stone. There lie about it most beautiful Meadows and Gardens; and the Air is reputed the best of all <HI>Holland.</HI> As this was one of the first Ci∣ties which revolted from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in 1572. so it was one of the first also that felt their fury. For they having besieged <HI>Harlem</HI> in 1573. without suc∣cess, in the year following sat down before <HI>Leyden;</HI> and had reduced it to great extremity; when the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> letting loose upon them the Wa∣ters which the Dams restrained before, by the same Stratagem brought relief to <HI>Leyden,</HI> and ruin on the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army: the year following, <HI>February</HI> 8. 1575. He opened the University there, to reward their Va∣lor, and recompence their losses: to which there has been added an excellent Library, a Physick Garden, and a Hall adorned with many Rarities of <HI>Anatomy-Antoninus</HI> gives this City the Title of <HI>Caput Germa∣norum.</HI></P>

It has a Castle called <HI>Pleisenburg,</HI> and an University opened here by <HI>Frederick</HI> Marquess of <HI>Misnia,</HI> in 1409. Upon the Banishment of the fol∣lowers of <HI>Jerome</HI> of <HI>Prague</HI> from that City, four thousand Students retiring to this. In 1520. <HI>Luther</HI> disputed here with <HI>Eckius</HI> against the Popes Supre∣macy; soon after which, they embraced the Refor∣mation. In 1547. this City (which then belonged to <HI>Maurice</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI>) was besieged by <HI>John</HI> the Elector of that House, in the Month of <HI>January: Maurice</HI> (tho a Protestant) having joined with the Empe∣rour against the rest of the <HI>Augustane</HI> Princes, who had taken Arms for the defence of their Religion and Li∣berty, against <HI>Charles</HI> V. And although the City was not then taken, yet it was much defaced by the Bat∣tery, and its Suburbs burnt. In 1630. <HI>Gustavus A∣dolphus</HI> gave the Forces of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> II. a great de∣feat near this place. In 1642. the <HI>Swedes</HI> defeated the Forces of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> III. under the Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold,</HI> and <HI>Piccolomineo;</HI> and thereupon the City was forced to yield it self to the Victorious <HI>Swedes.</HI> It is not great, but rich, by reason of its Mart twice every year; and the great concourse of Students to this University.</P>

<P><HI>Lichfield, <HI>Lichfeldia,</HI></HI> a City (which is a Bishops See, under the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>) seated in the County of <HI>Stafford:</HI> twenty four <HI>English</HI> Miles from <HI>Leicester</HI> to the West, ten from <HI>Stafford</HI> to the North-East, and sixteen from <HI>Coventry</HI> to the North-West. It is a low seated, beautiful, and large City; divided into two parts by a clear Brook, which is crossed by Causeys, with Sluces in them for the Passage of the Water. That part which lies on the South Side of this Water, is the greater by far; and divided into several Streets: and the North Part, though less, has the Cathedral Church, the Close (in∣compassed with a strong Wall) in which are the Pre∣bends Houses, and the Bishops Palace. This has been a Bishops See very long; for in the year of our Lord 606. <HI>Oswius</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> having conquered the then Pagan <HI>Mercians,</HI> instituted a Bi∣shoprick, and settled <HI>Dwina</HI> as Bishop here, to in∣struct them in the Christian Faith: his Successors were in such esteem with the following Kings of <HI>Mercia,</HI> that they did not only obtain large Posses∣sions for the maintaining the Dignity of this See; but were also reputed the Primates of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and Arch∣bishops. <HI>Ladulph</HI> (one of them) had a Pall sent him as such, upon the Golden Solicitations of <HI>Offa,</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> about 779. Which Dignity lasted not long; for it died with this King and Arch∣bishop <HI>Ladulph.</HI> A Synod held in 1075. ordaining, that the Bishops Sees for the future should be settled in the greatest Cities; <HI>Peter</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> re∣moved this to <HI>Chester. Robert Lindsey,</HI> another of them, removed it to <HI>Coventry.

It had a very strong Ca∣stle, which was ruined by the <HI>French.</HI> Though in the Protection of its own Bishop, yet it is a Free Imperial City: and herefore a pleasant Village situate in the Woods and Hills, amongst sweet Springs, which fell down from those Hills; frequently visited by <HI>Landebert</HI> Bishop of <HI>Tongres,</HI> who was afterwards slain here by <HI>Dodon</HI> a Servant of <HI>Pepin</HI> King of <HI>France.</HI> The See was first settled at <HI>Tongres,</HI> from thence removed to <HI>Maestricht,</HI> and at last by S. <HI>Hu∣bartus</HI> (one of these Bishops) settled at <HI>Liege.</HI> It takes this Name from a small River which there falls into the <HI>Maes:</HI> a vast part of the Ground within its Walls is not built; but imployed in Vineyards, and Orchards; and withal so very fruitful, that it may contend with <HI>Sicily.</HI> In this City <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> kept his <HI>Christmas</HI> in the year 769. <HI>Henry</HI> IV. died here of Grief in 1197. In the year 1131. Pope <HI>Inno∣cent</HI> II. crowned the Emperor <HI>Lottharius</HI> in the Church of S. <HI>Lambert</HI> here. <HI>Henry</HI> VI. reduced this City, (then in Rebellion) in 1191. It is supposed by some to be built by <HI>Amborix</HI> a <HI>German</HI> Prince, mentioned by <HI>Julius Caesar.</HI> It suffered much from the <HI>Normans;</HI> much also from one of the Dukes of <HI>Brabant,</HI> who in 1212. took it, and suffered it to be plundered six days together: in the fifteenth Century, <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgimdy,</HI> taking advantage of their Disagreement in the Election of a Bishop, grievously afflicted it, (in 1468.) and destroyed a part of it: in this last Age it has been ill treated by its Bishops: and the <HI>French</HI> taking it by surprize in 1675 the next year after ruined the Castle; so that it is no great wonder, if after all these Calamities, the num∣ber of its Inhabitants are diminished.

The <HI>French</HI> had it confirmed to them in 1668. by the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chapelle.</HI> It is the Head of a large Chattellany, containing divers Villages; and strongly fortified. § Also, a pleasant Town in the County of <HI>Venaissin</HI> in <HI>Provence,</HI> five or six Leagues from <HI>Avignon,</HI> and about the same from <HI>Carpentras,</HI> in a fruitful Coun∣try; surrounded by the River <HI>Sorgue,</HI> like an Island, and thence called <HI>L'isle.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Lima</HI> or <HI>Ciudad de Los Reyes, Lima,</HI> the Capital of the Kingdom of <HI>Peru;</HI> a beautiful, great, well tra∣ded City; and the See of an Archbishop. Built in 1535. by <HI>Francis Pizarro, a Spaniard,</HI> in the Valley of <HI>Lima,</HI> called by Natives <HI>Rimac.</HI> The Viceroy of <HI>Peru</HI> resides here; which with other Advantages hath made it very great, rich, populous, and beautiful; though it be all built with Timber, and an open unwalled Town. They compute about five thousand <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> and forty thousand <HI>Negroes</HI> in it; a great number of Ecclesiastical Buildings, as Churches, Con∣vents, Colleges, and Hospitals; and a stately Palace <HI>Royal,</HI> wherein the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> keeps his Court. It stands upon a River of the same Name; one Mile from the <HI>Pacifick Ocean,</HI> two from its own Harbor called <HI>Callao de Lima,</HI> one hundred and twenty from <HI>Cusco,</HI> the old Metropolis of this Kingdom, as <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Limburg,</HI> a Dutchy and Town in the <HI>Low-Coun∣tries.</HI> The Dutchy, though one of the <HI>Seventeen Provinces,</HI> is not great. It lies between the Duthcy of <HI>Juliers</HI> to the East and North, and the Bishoprick of <HI>Liege</HI> to the West and South. It had heretofore Dukes of its own: but upon the Death of <HI>Walrame</HI> the Third (by Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> called <HI>Henry</HI>) in 1285. <HI>Adolph</HI> the next Heir sold it to <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Bra∣bant;</HI> who pretended at the same time a Right to
<PB N="231" REF="123"/>
it, as descended from <HI>Margaret,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Limburgh,</HI> in 1172 married to <HI>Godfrey</HI> III. Duke of <HI>Brabant.</HI> In 1293 <HI>Reinold,</HI> Earl of <HI>Gel∣ders,</HI> set up another Title in the Right of <HI>Ermin∣grade</HI> his Wife, Daughter of <HI>Herman,</HI> late Duke of <HI>Limburg;</HI> but his Forces being defeated, and he ta∣ken Prisoner in the Battel of <HI>Worancan,</HI> he was for∣ced to refign his Right to <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> to regain his liberty; and from that time the Dukes of <HI>Brabant</HI> have peaceably enjoyed it. The Earth is very fruitful as to Wheat and Fewel; it has excellent Mines of Iron, and one of Copperas. It contains one hundred and twenty five Villages, whereof five are walled.</P>
<P><HI>Limburg, <HI>Limburgum,</HI></HI> the principal City of the last mentioned Dukedom, is pleasantly seated upon a Hill by the River <HI>Weser,</HI> amongst shady Woods; in the Consines of the Bishoprick of <HI>Licge;</HI> six Leagues from that City to the East, seven from <HI>Maestricht,</HI> and four from <HI>Aquisgrane</HI> to the South. It had a very strong Castle, mounted upon a steep Hill, and of a difficult Access. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> took this City in 1632. but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> recovered it again. In 1675. the <HI>French</HI> surprized it; and being forced to leave it in 1677. they destroyed the Castle, which now lies in Rubbish.</P>
<P><HI>Lime</HI> otherwise called <HI>Lime Regis,</HI> is a small Town in the Western Borders of the County of <HI>Dorset,</HI> next <HI>Devonshire,</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Bridport,</HI> upon a steep Hill, and a River of the same Name; which hardly deserves the Name of a Sea-Port, though it is frequented by Fishermen. It hath a Road, suffi∣ciently secured from the violence of the Winds by Rocks and high Trees. It is a Corporation, gover∣ned by a Major, and sends two Burgesses to the Par∣liament: defended by <HI>Blake</HI> against the Kings Forces in the late <HI>Parliamentarian Rebellion</HI> to a Wonder, though it has no other Fortifications, than what Na∣ture bestowed upon it. To this Place, <HI>Charles</HI> II. af∣ter the Battel of <HI>VVorcester</HI> retired, and was promised passage for <HI>France;</HI> but deluded by the Master, and forced to seek it elsewhere. The late Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth</HI> on <HI>June</HI> 11. 1685. with about one hundred and twenty Men on Board a single Vessel from <HI>Hol∣land</HI> surprized this Town, and began a Rebellion a∣gainst King <HI>James</HI> II. which was of short duration, unfortunate in all its events; and ended in the ruin of that Duke: being beheaded <HI>July</HI> 15. following, on <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Limen, <HI>Palus Moeotis,</HI></HI> a Branch or Bay of the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> on the East of the <HI>Crim Tartary;</HI> cal∣led also <HI>Mar de Zabacce,</HI> and <HI>de Tana,</HI> from the Ri∣ver <HI>Tanais,</HI> which falls into it.</P>
<P><HI>Limerick, <HI>Limericum,</HI></HI> a strong City in the Province of <HI>Mounster,</HI> (but in the Confines of <HI>Connaught</HI>) upon the River <HI>Shannon:</HI> forty five Miles from <HI>Kil∣kenny</HI> to the West, thirty five from <HI>Gallway</HI> to the South, and from the main Ocean about sixty; but so accommodated by the River, that Ships of Burden come up to the very Walls. This City is the Capital of a County of the same Name; and a Bi∣shops See, under the Archbishop of <HI>Casshel.</HI> The <HI>Irish</HI> call it <HI>Loumeagh.</HI> It was first conquered from them, by <HI>Raimond de Grosse,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Man: after which one <HI>Danewald,</HI> an <HI>Irish</HI> Royolet of <HI>Thomond,</HI> burnt it. King <HI>John</HI> built the Castle: the <HI>English</HI> in after times built an additional Town, and wal∣led it; securing it by Draw-Bridges, and whatever might contribute to the strength of it. What be∣came of this Place in the beginning of the <HI>Irish</HI> Re∣bellion, I do not find: but when <HI>Ireton</HI> came before it in 1651. to take it for the Parliamentarians, <HI>Hugh O-Neal,</HI> a Valiant <HI>Irish</HI> Man, and a good Comman∣der, being intrusted with the Government of it by the Lord Lieutenant; it made the best defence, and slew more of the Parliamentarians, than any place in <HI>Ireland:</HI> till after a Siege of three Months, it yiel∣ded upon Articles, when all their Victuals were spent. Having the Consolation of seeing her Conqueror soon swept away by the Plague, which he found here, when he forced the Town. After the Rout at the <HI>Boyne,</HI> King <HI>James's</HI> Forces rallied again here; and made a very vigorous defence under the Conduct of Monsieur <HI>Boiseleau</HI> the Governour: insomuch, that though King <HI>William</HI> in Person commanded the Siege, which began about the tenth of <HI>August</HI> 1690. yet his Ar∣my was forced to decamp the one and thirtieth fol∣lowing without success. The next year it surrended upon Articles</P>

Adorned now with divers Religious Houses, and has been a <HI>Viscounty</HI> for many Ages. The Bi∣shops of <HI>Aquitaine</HI> have celebrated some Councils at it.</P>

<P><HI>Lincoln, <HI>Lincolnia, Lindum,</HI></HI> a famous City sea∣ted on the North side of the River <HI>Witham,</HI> over
<PB N="232" REF="124"/>
which it hath several Bridges; almost in the Centre of the County to which it gives name: large, well built, and populous; extending from the top of a high Hill (where <HI>Lindum,</HI> the old <HI>Roman</HI> Town, stood; its Ditches and Rampier being still visible) a great way downwards unto the River. In this Town, the Va∣liant <HI>Britain, Vortimer,</HI> died in 456: being Poyson∣ed by <HI>Rowena,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Hengist,</HI> and Wife of <HI>Vortiger.</HI> The <HI>Saxons</HI> after this ruined <HI>Lindum</HI> and built <HI>Lincoln</HI> nearer the River, about the times, when <HI>Paulinus</HI> first Preached the Christian Faith to them. The <HI>Danes</HI> destroyed it twice. In the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Confessor,</HI> here was one thousand and seventy Man∣sions. In the <HI>Norman</HI> times no City in <HI>England</HI> was more Rich or Populous, as <HI>Will.</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury</HI> ac∣quaints us. <HI>Will.</HI> the Conqueror thought fit to build here a very strong Castle upon the top of the Hill a∣foresaid to awe the Inhabitants. <HI>Remigius,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Dorchester,</HI> near <HI>Oxon,</HI> at the same time removed the Sea hither, and built the Cathedral above the same Hill. In the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. it was made a Mart or Staple. King <HI>Stephen</HI> was overcome and taken Priso∣ner near this City, in 1140. <HI>Sept.</HI> 5. in a great Battel with <HI>Maud</HI> the Empress, and afterwards at <HI>Bristol</HI> laid in Irons. <HI>Henry</HI> III. had better success here; when it being defended by the Barons against him under Prince <HI>Lewis,</HI> in 1217. <HI>May</HI> 19. he took it, forced <HI>Lewis</HI> to Flee to <HI>London,</HI> and soon after into <HI>France.</HI> Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> observes, that of fifty Churches standing within an hundred Years of his time, there were only eighteen left. It hath by times gone through all the calamities of Fire, Sword, and Earthquake. Yet a large, populous, and well frequented place still, and enjoying the greatest Diocese of any in the King∣dom; as the Cathedral, there called commonly the <HI>Minster,</HI> is one of the stateliest Piles perhaps in Chri∣stendom. It hath the privilege also of being a Coun∣ty Corporate, whose Liberties extend about twenty Miles in compass, with the title of the <HI>County of the City of Lincoln.</HI> Its Long. 22. 52.

It is an Imperial and Free City, situate in the borders of <HI>Switzerland:</HI> eight Miles from <HI>Constance</HI> to the North-East; and grew up out of the ruins of <HI>Aeschach,</HI> a place near to it. Very strong both by its Site, and by Art; and therefore it the more easily repelled the Forces of Count <HI>Wrangel</HI> the <HI>Swedish</HI> General, who in 1647. besieged it. The beginning of this City was a Monastery, built here by <HI>Adelbert Rorbuck,</HI> a Kins∣man of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, in 810. This occasioned the building of a Village; and the Site being plea∣sant, fruitful, and convenient, it grew up by degrees to a City: at first subject to the Abbess; after that to the Dukes of <HI>Schwaben;</HI> obtaining its Privileges since from <HI>Rudolphus</HI> I. <HI>Frederick</HI> III. and <HI>Sigis∣mond.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Lombez, <HI>Lombaria,</HI></HI> or <HI>Lumbaria,</HI> a small City in <HI>Aquitain</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> in the County of <HI>Cominges,</HI> upon the River <HI>Sava;</HI> (which falls into the <HI>Garonne,</HI> four Miles beneath <HI>Tolose.</HI>) <HI>Lombes</HI> stands five Leagues from the <HI>Garonne</HI> to the North, eight from <HI>Aux</HI> to the South-East, and ten from <HI>Tolose</HI> to the South-West. Made a Bishops See by Pope <HI>John</HI> XXII. (who at the same time erected its ancient Abbey into a Cathedral) under the Archbishop of <HI>Tolose,</HI> in 1317. But little, and not well inhabited.

<P><HI>Lomond,</HI> and <HI>Lough Lomond, Lomandus,</HI> is a great Lake in the South of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the County of <HI>Lenox;</HI> between <HI>Menteith</HI> to the East, and <HI>Ar∣gile</HI> to the West. In length from North to South twenty Miles, ten in breadth from East to West in some places, in others three and four. It is only four Miles from <HI>Dunbritown</HI> to the North, and a little more from its <HI>Fyrth;</HI> the River <HI>Levin</HI> empties it into the <HI>Fyrth.</HI> There is in it sixteen small Islands.</P>

<P><HI>London, <HI>Londinum, Augusta Trinobantum,</HI></HI> the Capital City of the Kingdom of <HI>England;</HI> or rather three Cities united into one: Its length from East to West, from <HI>Lime-house</HI> to the further end of <HI>Mill∣bank</HI> in <HI>Westminster,</HI> coming to 7500 Geometrical pa∣ces, i. e. seven measured Miles and an half, at a thou∣sand paces a Mile: Its breadth, from the further end of <HI>Whitechappel-street</HI> to St. <HI>George's Fields</HI> in <HI>South∣wark,</HI> near three Miles. It is first mentioned by <HI>Ta∣citus,</HI> afterwards by <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus,</HI> who calls it <HI>Augusta; Stephanus de Ʋrbibus, Lindoni∣um; Bede</HI> and <HI>Sigebert</HI> call it <HI>Lindona;</HI> the <HI>En∣glish, London;</HI> the <HI>Saxons, Lundain;</HI> the <HI>French, Londres;</HI> the <HI>Germans, Londen;</HI> and the <HI>Italians, Londra.</HI> It is a Bishops See, under the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> seated in the County of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> upon the <HI>Thames</HI> (a noble navigable River), over which it has a Bridge of nineteen Arches, built with Houses on both sides, and of late enlarged as to the Passage. This is also the Royal City, the Seat of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> and has been so for many years. Therefore called <HI>the King of Englands Chamber.</HI> It is situate in a rich and plentiful Soil; abounding with plenty of all things; and on the gentle ascent of an Hill, on the North Side of the <HI>Thames.</HI> By whom, or when it was first built, is now unknown. <HI>Tacitus</HI> saith, that in <HI>Nero</HI>'s time, about the Year of Christ 66, it was <HI>Copia Negotiatorum, &amp; Commeatu maxi∣mè celebre. A place of great resort for Commerce, and famous for plenty of provisions.</HI> But <HI>London</HI> was then near a great Calamity: for <HI>Boadicia,</HI> Queen of the <HI>Iceni,</HI> being provoked by the Injuries of the <HI>Romans,</HI> to assemble the <HI>Britains,</HI> fell first upon <HI>Ca∣malodunum,</HI> (now <HI>Maldon</HI> in <HI>Essex;</HI>) and taking it by surprize that year, put all the <HI>Romans</HI> to the Sword. <HI>Petilius Cerealis,</HI> coming up with the ninth Legion, was defeated; and all his Foot put to the Sword too, the Horse hardly escaping. In the Inte∣rim <HI>Suetonius,</HI> the <HI>Roman Propraetor,</HI> or Governor. (who was then conquering the Isle of <HI>Anglesey</HI>) comes up to <HI>London;</HI> and was at first almost resolved to make it the Seat of War; but finding reasons to al∣ter this Resolve, he marched away to S. <HI>Albans:</HI> so <HI>Boadicia</HI> (who was not far off) came up, and put all She found in the Town to the Sword; and soon after treats S. <HI>Albans</HI> in the same manner: in which three places She destroyed seventy thousand <HI>Romans</HI> and their <HI>Allies.</HI> This City soon recovered this Blow, and was afterward as famous as ever. In the Year of Christ 292, it was in danger of being Sack'd by the <HI>Franks;</HI> if an unexpected Arrival of some <HI>Roman</HI> Forces had not accidentally preserved it, even when the <HI>Franks</HI> were actually in Possession of it. Soon after this, <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great is said to have Walled it. In 313, we find <HI>Restitutus,</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> at the Council of <HI>Arles</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> subscribing after <HI>Eborius,</HI> Bishop of <HI>York. Bede</HI> is very positive, that it was then an Archbishops See. Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> is of opinion, it was delivered up to the <HI>Saxons,</HI> under <HI>Hengist</HI> their first King, by <HI>Vortigern,</HI> about the Year of <HI>Christ,</HI> 463. Tho this changed the state of things, and rui∣ned Christianity; yet <HI>London</HI> continued in all this Storm a considerable Mart, or Sea-Port: in 610. S. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church was built, (or rather rebuilt) and assigned to the Uses of Christianity, by <HI>Athelbert,</HI> King of <HI>Kent. Miletus</HI> was made the first Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> after the Conversion of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> in 604; the Metropolitick See being removed by <HI>Augustin</HI> the Monk then from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Canterbury.</HI> About the Year 701, <HI>Offa,</HI> King of the <HI>East-Angles,</HI> enlarged and endowed the Church of <HI>Westminster:</HI> which is since become another City, joined to <HI>London.</HI> In the Year 854, this City fell into the Hands of the <HI>Danes,</HI> who Sacked it, and <HI>Canterbury;</HI> coming then with a Fleet of two hundred and fifty Ships. In 1012, these Barbarians slew the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> for not paying them their Tribute; the Year after, <HI>Sweno</HI> (King of the <HI>Danes</HI>) took the City, and expelled King <HI>Ethelred</HI> out of <HI>England;</HI> but this lasted not long. In the Year 1016, <HI>Canutus</HI> the <HI>Dane</HI> took <HI>London;</HI> and in 1018, was there Crowned King of <HI>England.</HI> In 1042, there was an end put to this <HI>Danish</HI> Race; and <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Confessor</HI> was Crowned King of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> In 1064, this Prince died; and <HI>Herald</HI> usurp∣ing upon <HI>Edward Atheling,</HI> the Right Heir, <HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy</HI> entred <HI>England,</HI> slew him, and in 1066, was Crowned in <HI>London.</HI> The Fate of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> has been much the same with that of <HI>England</HI> ever since; for this Prince in 1078, having built the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> it became the setled Residence of our Kings from that day forward. <HI>William</HI> II. in 1099, Wal∣led

In 1211, He built <HI>London Bridge.</HI> In 1217, <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>France</HI> was besieged in <HI>London</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> III. and forced to leave the Land. In 1378, <HI>John Philpot,</HI> a <HI>Londoner,</HI> at his own Cost, and upon his own Authority, put out a Fleet, and cleared the Seas of Pyrats. In 1381, the Country Clowns rising against the Nobility, and one <HI>Jack Straw</HI> behaving himself insolently towards the King in <HI>Smithfield;</HI> Sir <HI>William Wallworth,</HI> the Lord Major, stabbed him, and put an end to that Rebellion; for which Service the <HI>Red Dagger</HI> was added, as is said, to the Arms of <HI>London.</HI> In 1392, that Prince seized their Liber∣ties, for resusing to lend him Money. In 1567, the <HI>Royal Exchange</HI> was built by Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham.</HI> In succeeding times it throve to that degree, as to have one hundred and thirty three Parishes, accounted with∣in its Walls and Suburbs. In 1665, a Plague swept away one hundred thousand of her Inhabitants. In 1666, a devouring Fire Levelled thirteen thousand of her Houses. The Footsteps of which dismal Calami∣ty, by the Industry of the Citizens, encouraged by their Gracious King <HI>Charles</HI> II. are not otherwise to be seen, but in a more glorious Restauration. A great multitude of Provincial and National Councils have been celebrated at <HI>London</HI> in all times. Long. 23. 25. Lat. 51. 34. § <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New England</HI> is sometimes also called <HI>New London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>London-Derry,</HI> is a Colony of the <HI>English,</HI> Plan∣ted in the County of <HI>Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain,</HI> in the North of the Pro∣vince of <HI>Ʋlster:</HI> in a fruitful Soil, and upon Wa∣ters that afford it great plenty of Fish of all sorts. This in 1612, was made a <HI>London</HI> Colony; some of the Companies in <HI>London</HI> bearing the Charge of it; and one Colonel <HI>Dockwray</HI> (an old experienced Com∣mander of the <HI>English</HI>) being sent with them to com∣mand, govern, and take care of them. Being thus happily begun, and a great number following the first, in a short time it became the most considerable City in <HI>Ʋlster.</HI> And being as well carefully Fortified and Garrisoned as Peopled, in the time of the <HI>Irish Mas∣sacre,</HI> it stood so firm for the <HI>English,</HI> that no Force or Fraud of the <HI>Irish</HI> could expel them. The <HI>Irish</HI> had reduced them to great extremity in 1649, but one <HI>Owen Row Oneale</HI> in time frustrated their At∣tempts, and relieved the Town, when it was just up∣on the point of being starved into a Complyance.

<P><HI>Lorain, <HI>Lotharingia, Austrasia,</HI></HI> is a Dukedom belonging to <HI>Germany;</HI> of late seized by the <HI>French</HI> King, and therefore by <HI>Baudrand</HI> made a part of <HI>France.</HI> Bounded on the East with <HI>Alsatia,</HI> (cut off by the Mountain <HI>Vauge, Vogesus,</HI> and the Dukedom of <HI>Bipont</HI> or <HI>Westreich,</HI> as the <HI>Germans</HI> call it;) on the South with the County of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> or the <HI>Fran∣che Compté;</HI> on the West with the River <HI>Maes,</HI> which parts it from <HI>Champagne;</HI> and on the North with <HI>Luxemburg, Metz, Verdun,</HI> and the Land of <HI>Triers.</HI> This Country is in length about four days Journey, in breadth three; much overgrown with Woods, very Hilly and Mountainous, being a part of the once vast Forest of <HI>Ardenne.</HI> It was given by <HI>Lotharius,</HI> the Emperor, to his second Son <HI>Lotharius;</HI> and from him took the Name of <HI>Lorain,</HI> or (as others write it) <HI>Lorraigne.</HI> This happened about the Year 851. Others say, it took this Name from the Father, and not from the Son, about the Year 843: but all agree, that from <HI>Lotharius</HI> this County was called by the <HI>Germans Lotreich;</HI> by the <HI>Dutch Lot-reigne;</HI> (<HI>i. e. the Kingdom of Lot;</HI>) and from hence of later times by the <HI>Germans Lotthiringen;</HI> by the Inhabitants <HI>Lorrain;</HI> by the <HI>French Lorain.</HI> The first of these Dukes of <HI>Lorain</HI> was <HI>Charles,</HI> right Heir of the <HI>Caro∣line</HI> Line of <HI>France;</HI> but excluded, defeated, and taken Prisoner by <HI>Hugh Capet.</HI> His Advancement was from <HI>Otho</HI> II. (Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI>) about the Year 981; being the Son of <HI>Lewis</HI> IV. of <HI>France,</HI> and of <HI>Gerbage</HI> an Aunt of the said <HI>Otho.</HI> From this <HI>Charles,</HI> the present young Duke of <HI>Lorain</HI> is Lineal∣ly Descended, being the thirty fourth Duke of his Fa∣mily. The <HI>French</HI> first Possessed themselves of this Dukedom under <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII, in 1663: It was resto∣red to this Family again by the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Treaty, in 1659. In the Year 1674, it was again reassumed by the <HI>French. Charles Leopold,</HI> the late Duke of fa∣mous memory, being in the mean time employed by the Emperor as his General, won more Honour than he could have done if he had succeeded his Uncle in his rightful Inheritance. This great Prince died on the eighteenth of <HI>April,</HI> 1690, suddenly, in his forty eighth year, at a Convent near <HI>Lintz,</HI> in his Journey to <HI>Vienna;</HI> his renowned Actions and high Merits making him extremely lamented. He Married <HI>Elio∣nora Maria</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> Dowager of <HI>Michael,</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and Sister to the present Emperor; by whom the Title to this Dukedom continues in the Family to his eldest Son.</P>

<P><HI>Lorne, <HI>Lorna,</HI></HI> a County in the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon the Western Ocean, bounded on the North by <HI>Loquabre;</HI> on the East by <HI>Menteith;</HI> on the South by <HI>Argyle,</HI> and <HI>Cantyr;</HI> and on the West by the <HI>Ver∣givian</HI> Ocean: the old Inhabitants of this County were the <HI>Epidii,</HI> as <HI>Cambden</HI> acquaints us.</P>
<P><HI>Loretto,</HI> or <HI>Lauretto, Lauretum,</HI> a small, and a New City in the <HI>Marcha Anconitana,</HI> in the Domi∣nions of the Church; made a Bishops See by Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> V. in 1586. and in 1591. the Bishoprick of <HI>Recanati</HI> was for ever united to this new See. It stands upon a long Hill; three Miles from the Shoars of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea, fifteen from <HI>Ancona</HI> to the South; very well fortified to preserve it from the In∣cursions of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and has a Noble Palace. But that which is its greatest, yea, its only Glory, is the Chappel of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> called <HI>La Santa Casa,</HI> the <HI>Holy House;</HI> Pilgrims out of all parts of <HI>Europe</HI> repairing hither, to perform their Devotions to the Virgin. This place was anciently a desolate Grove, where in the Pagan Times some think there was a Temple of <HI>Juno Cuprana.</HI> The Chappel, that is so much esteemed, is supposed to be the very Chamber in which the Queen of Heaven was her self Educated; and received the Angel's Salutation. They believe it was brought hither out of <HI>Palestine</HI> by Angels. All this is proved by the Testimony of Grave Men, and the Memorials of an innumerable number of Miracles, which are believed to have been wrought here. The Reader is not to suppose it was brought from <HI>Pale∣stine</HI> hither at once: no, it was deposited, after the taking of <HI>Ptolomais</HI> by the <HI>Saracens,</HI> first in <HI>Dalma∣tia,</HI> in the year 1291.

<P><HI>Lyn, <HI>Linum Regis,</HI></HI> a Sea-Port-Town and Cor∣poration in the County of <HI>Norfolk;</HI> seated on the Eastern Shoar of the River <HI>Ouse,</HI> where it falls into the <HI>Washes;</HI> called by <HI>Ptolemy Aestuarium Metaris.</HI> It is a large Town, incompassed with a deep Trench, and for the most part walled; divided by two small Rivers, which have about fifteen Bridges over them. Built out of the ruins of another old Town, called <HI>Lyn</HI> too; but standing in Marsh Land, on the oppo∣site side of the River; chiefly preferred on the ac∣count of the Haven, which is safe and easie of ac∣cess. It was at first called <HI>Bishops Lyn;</HI> because the ground it stands upon, belonged to the Bishop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. It has great Privileges, which it obtained from King <HI>John,</HI> by siding with him against the <HI>Barons:</HI> he gave them his own Sword, to be carried before their Mayor; and a gilt Cup, which they still keep. From this place he went in 1216. with a mighty Army, over the <HI>Washes,</HI> into <HI>Lincolnshire;</HI> with a design to fight the Barons, (then united against him under <HI>Lewis, Dau∣phine</HI> of <HI>France,</HI>) but lost his Treasures and Carri∣ages in the passage, and his Life soon after. Then it was, that he granted them their Charter; and he ex∣piring soon after, and his Son having a necessity to comply with his Barons, for the expulsion of the <HI>French,</HI> their Liberties were seised, and the Town re∣duced to what it was before. In 1221. a Rebellion breaking out in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> this Prince (<HI>Hen∣ry</HI> III.) had occasion for their Loyalty, and Valour again: and they gave him such experience of both, that he regranted them their Charter, which they have ever since injoyed. Nor does this place deserve the less commendation for their Loyal Attempt, on the behalf of <HI>Charles</HI> I. in 1643. though instead of suc∣cess, it involved the Loyal Inhabitants in great Cala∣mities. <HI>Charles</HI> II. created Sir <HI>Horatio Townsend,</HI> Ba∣ronet, <HI>Baron</HI> of <HI>Lyn, April</HI> 20. 1661. rewarding at once his and their Loyalty by this Honour. It elects two Members of Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Lyons, <HI>Lugdunum Segusianorum,</HI></HI> is an ancient City in <HI>France,</HI> called by the Inhabitants, <HI>Lyon;</HI> by the <HI>Germans, <HI>Leon;</HI></HI> by the <HI>English, Lyons;</HI> and by the <HI>Poles, <HI>Lugdun.</HI></HI> It is a very great, famous, strong, rich, populous City; an Archbishops See, and the Capital of a Province, called from it <HI>Lionnois;</HI> seated at the foot of an Hill, upon the confluence of the the <HI>Saone</HI> and <HI>Rhone,</HI> (two of the principal Rivers of <HI>France,</HI>) in the Confines of <HI>la Bresse,</HI> and <HI>le Dauphine;</HI> one hundred Leagues from <HI>Paris</HI> to the South, five from <HI>Vienne,</HI> thirty six from <HI>Avignon,</HI> sixty from <HI>Turin,</HI> (as <HI>Baudrand</HI> represents the di∣stances) and sixty five from the <HI>Mediterranean Sea</HI> to the North. The first Colony the <HI>Romans</HI> settled in this part of <HI>France;</HI> and built by <HI>Munacius Plan∣cus</HI> under <HI>Augustus,</HI> thirty five years before Christ. After this it flourished very much; especially under the Auspicious Reign of <HI>Claudius Caesar,</HI> who was born here, nine years before the Birth of our Savi∣our, thirty three after the slaughter of <HI>Julius Caesar.</HI> In the twelfth year of the Reign of <HI>Nero,</HI> the year of Christ sixty five, it was miserably ruined by Fire; and <HI>Nero</HI> contributed very freely to the rebuilding of it, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> tells us in his Annals. In after times no City in the Empire flourished more, both as to Lear∣ning and Commerce. <HI>Severus,</HI> the Emperor, treated it about 199. with great severity, for adhering to the Party of <HI>Albinus</HI> against him; burning a great part of the City. <HI>Gratianus,</HI> the Emperor, was perfidi∣ously murthered in this City, in 384. <HI>Majoranus,</HI> Ge∣neral to <HI>Leo</HI> the Emperour, at the request of <HI>Sido∣nius Apollinarus,</HI> repaired and beautified this City ve∣ry much, about 460. But this was no long-lived splendor; the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Almains</HI> soon after prevai∣ling against the <HI>Romans</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> In the Reign of <HI>Clothaire</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> about 532. an end being put to the Kingdom of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> (erected here by the <HI>Goths,</HI>) this City fell into the Hands of the <HI>French.</HI> In the Reign of <HI>Gunthram,</HI> King of <HI>Metz,</HI> between 565. and 596. this City was again burnt: nor did it suffer less from the <HI>Moors</HI> about 730. who were called by the remainder of the <HI>Goths,</HI> against the <HI>Franks.</HI> About 955. it was given to <HI>Conrade</HI> I. King of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> After this, it was for some time subject to the Counts of the Forest, till 1173. The See was founded by S. <HI>Potinus,</HI> and <HI>Irenaeus;</HI> the first of which suffered Martyrdom here, about 177. <HI>Anno</HI> 1079. Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> VII. is said to have made it an Archbishops See; doubtless it was so long before. Pope <HI>Clement</HI> V. was crowned here in the presence of <HI>Philip</HI> (<HI>the Fair</HI>) King of <HI>France, Edward</HI> I. of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>James</HI> King of <HI>Arragon,</HI> in 1305. There have been many Councils held here. The most celebrated, was that in 1245. under <HI>Innocent</HI> IV. a∣gainst <HI>Frederick</HI> II. where that Prince was deposed as an Heretick, for Intelligence with the <HI>Sultan,</HI> and Familiarity with his Women; which produced a de∣structive War in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> There was ano∣ther in 1274. under Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> X. against the

<P><HI>Macedonia,</HI> is a Kingdom of great antiquity and fame in <HI>Greece.</HI> Anciently bounded by the <HI>Adria∣tick</HI> Sea to the West; the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea to the East, (now called the <HI>Archipelago;</HI>) the <HI>Ʋpper Moesia,</HI> a part of <HI>Illyricum,</HI> (now called <HI>Servia,</HI> cut off by Mount <HI>Sandus</HI>) to the North; and on the South it had <HI>Epirus, Thessalia,</HI> and <HI>Achaia.</HI> It was then di∣vided into four parts, as <HI>Livy</HI> saith; under which were twenty six Provinces: and at this day, though <HI>Albania,</HI> (which was of old a part of it) is dismem∣bred, yet the remainder is divided into four parts by the <HI>Turks.</HI> 1. <HI>Jamboli,</HI> of old <HI>Macedonia prima,</HI> and <HI>secunda;</HI> which lies East between <HI>Thrace</HI> and the Bay of <HI>Thessalonica.</HI> 2. <HI>Macedonia,</HI> properly so called, lies between Mount <HI>Karoponitze</HI> to the North, <HI>Thessalia</HI> to the South, and the Bay of <HI>Thessalonica</HI> to the East. 3. <HI>Comenolitari,</HI> the third part, (<HI>Ma∣cedonia tertia,</HI> and part of <HI>Thessalia,</HI>) has <HI>Macedo∣nia</HI> properly so called, on the North; <HI>Albania</HI> on the West, <HI>Thessalia</HI> on the South, and the same Bay on the East. 4. <HI>Janna,</HI> lies yet more South; and is the remainder of that which was anciently called <HI>Thessalia:</HI> on the North it has <HI>Commenolitari,</HI> on the West <HI>Epirus,</HI> on the South <HI>Livadia,</HI> and on the East the <HI>Archipelago</HI> and Bay of <HI>Negropont.</HI> The Reader may observe, that <HI>Thessalia</HI> is now a part of <HI>Macedonia,</HI> though anciently not; and <HI>Albania</HI> which anciently was a part of it, now is a separate Kingdom: both are under the <HI>Turks.</HI> This Coun∣try, anciently divided into one hundred and fifty Tribes or Nations, (as <HI>Pliny</HI> saith,) was by <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Alexander</HI> his Son, reduced first into one great and formidable body: which spread its Conquests not only over all the rest of <HI>Greece;</HI> but passing the <HI>Hellespont, Alexander the Great</HI> overthrew the <HI>Per∣sian</HI> Empire; and became Lord of all those Coun∣tries between the <HI>Caspian</HI> and <HI>Euxine Seas</HI> to the North; Mount <HI>Imaus</HI> to the East; the <HI>Persian Sea, Red Sea,</HI> the <HI>Cataracts</HI> of <HI>Nile</HI> to the South; the Desarts of <HI>Lybia,</HI> and the <HI>Adriatick Sea</HI> to the West: which Empire at his death became divided into four great Kingdoms, whereof <HI>Macedonia</HI> was the least. <HI>Philip of Macedon,</HI> (the two and twentieth King of the first Race,) began in the year of the World 3155. which ended in <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> in 3642. or thereabouts. <HI>Cassander</HI> extirpated the first Family; and began a second in 3648. which ended in <HI>Perseus</HI> XI. in that Succession, subdued by the <HI>Romans</HI> in 3789. But it became not in∣tirely subject, till the <HI>Turks</HI> first entered this Province under <HI>Bajazet</HI> their fourth King; who took <HI>Nico∣polis,</HI> (a Town upon the Bay of <HI>Thessalonica,</HI>) in 1392. The Conquest thereof was finished by <HI>Amu∣rath</HI> II. (their sixth King) in 1429. by the Conquest of <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> and all the other places in this King∣dom, considered without <HI>Albania.</HI> Now governed by a <HI>Turkish Sangiack,</HI> under the <HI>Beglerbeg</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> who has 8000.

Ptolemy</HI> calls it <HI>Menuthias; Pliny, Cerne Aethiopica.</HI> It is near one hundred Miles from the Coast of <HI>Africa</HI> to the East; and one of the greatest Islands in the World; exten∣tending from 1 to 25 deg. of Southern Latitude; but its breadth much less; as not exceeding one hundred and thirty <HI>English</HI> Miles. Discovered by the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> in 1506. on S. <HI>Laurence</HI>'s day. There was no Cities in it: the <HI>French</HI> have of late settled some Co∣lonies on the Southern Shoars. <HI>Stephen Flacourt,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> has given a large account of this Island. The Inhabitants are large of Stature, exceeding black, Warlike, much addicted to Fishing, great Eaters: Nature has accordingly provided them with plenty of Cattle, Fish, Fowl, Fruits, and what ever is necessary for the life of Man; which they use without Labour or Care, regarding neither Silver nor Gold, nor any thing but Beads and Bracelets for Ornament, Musick and Dancing for their Recreation. And the utmost Number they can tell, is <HI>Ten. <HI>Herbert.</HI></HI> 'Tis also rela∣ted, there is a mixture of <HI>Whites</HI> amongst them, who being circumcised, and using the Names of <HI>Moses, Aaron, Esther</HI> and the like, may be thought to de∣scend from the transmigrations of some of the ten lost <HI>Tribes</HI> of the <HI>Jews.</HI> About two hundred years ago, the <HI>Caliph</HI> of <HI>Meccha</HI> dispatched a Mission of <HI>Arabians</HI> hither, to teach <HI>Arabick</HI> and the <HI>Alca∣ron;</HI> which altogether missed not of its effect. The <HI>Northern</HI> Provinces are yet unknown to the <HI>Europe∣ans.</HI> As for Capes, Ports and Roads, Rivers, and fruitful Mountains, Mines of Iron and Steel, Precious Stones and Woods, <HI>Madagascar</HI> hath them.

<P><HI>Madera,</HI> an Island on the Western Shoar of <HI>Afri∣ca;</HI> called <HI>Madeira</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> of old <HI>At∣lantica.</HI> Discovered by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in 1419. and called by this Name from its plenty of Wood. Its length is twenty five Leagues, its Circuit sixty. The principal Town, <HI>Funchal.</HI> It lies in 32 deg. Lat. and Long. 360. Prodigiously fruitful; especially in Su∣gar, Mather, (a Dying stuff,) and Wines; the slipes whereof were brought from <HI>Candy.</HI> The Birds at first suffered themselves to be taken up; but have since learned to fear Mankind. It has plenty of Wa∣ter, and all other things needful for the life of Man. Though an <HI>Englishman</HI> is said to have landed here in 1344. yet the <HI>Portuguese</HI> were the first that peo∣pled this Island, and still possess it. They found it as one great Wood; and to clear it, they put fire to it, which raged so horribly at first, that they were forced to go to Sea, to avoid its fury. The Ashes contributed exceedingly to the Fertility of it. It is now returned to its natural strength, sufficient to maintain a vast number of Inhabitants. <HI>Funchal</HI> is an Archbishops See, and the Residence of the Go∣vernour: besides which, they reckon thirty six Pa∣rishes: Some call <HI>Madera,</HI> from its Fertility and Beau∣ty, the <HI>Queen of Islands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madera,</HI> a River in <HI>South America,</HI> also called <HI>Cayane.</HI> It ariseth in the Confines of <HI>Peru,</HI> by the City <HI>Argentea;</HI> and after a long Course, falls into

It stands in the Kingdom of <HI>New Castile,</HI> upon the top of an Hill, in a fruitful Country, an healthful Air. The Royal Palace, though not great, is very beautiful &amp; mag∣nificent. The Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> have resided here, but since the Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> II. before which time it was accounted only a Village. In 1473. a Council was ce∣lebrated here, to correct the <HI>Simony, Debauchery,</HI> and <HI>Ignorance</HI> of the <HI>Clergy</HI> of this Kingdom, under Pope <HI>Paul</HI> II. Long. 17. 00.

Hence one of the Ancients ob∣serves, <HI>it was the only River in the World, which returned almost back to its Fountain.</HI> Many of the Poets alluded to it in their Poems. Our Country-Man, Mr. <HI>Wheeler,</HI> who crossed it, saith; it was there sixteen Fathoms over: they pretended, it was as deep as broad, the Current was exceeding swift: he gives a Figure of it. It falls into the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> be∣tween <HI>Heraclea</HI> and <HI>Miletus,</HI> on the South of <HI>E∣phesus.</HI></P>

of <HI>Editha</HI> his Wife, Daughter of <HI>Edmund</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> about 940. Which Lady was afterwards buried in this City. It was for some time the Seat of the Empire; fortified with Walls, Rampires, Towers, and a deep Trench; so that <HI>Charles</HI> V. in 1549. could proscribe and spoil its Territories, but not take it. In 1631. it was taken by <HI>Du Tilly,</HI> the Emperors Gene∣ral; being suddenly surrounded by an Army, when they did not expect it, nor had made those Prepara∣tions requisite, of Men, Victuals, and Ammunition; the want of which last was the principal cause of its being taken by Storm, <HI>May</HI> 10. after a Siege of great sharpness for fifteen Months: and being set on fire to fright the Inhabitants from the defence of it, the fire prevailed so far above the intentions of the Incendia∣ries, that the whole City was laid wast. The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> retook it in 1636. In 1666. it was again for∣ced, by the Arms of the Duke of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> to ac∣cept <HI>Augustus</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> for its Administrator or Archbishop.</P>

It is said it was a Common∣wealth before: but <HI>Coronelli</HI> in his late description of the <HI>Morea,</HI> assures us; it was a Fort built by the <HI>Turks</HI> upon the Ruins of <HI>Cersapolis,</HI> to keep these <HI>Mainotes</HI> under; who being impatient of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Slavery and extremely Warlike, had betaken themselves to the Rocks and Forests, and would pay no Tribute to the <HI>Turks:</HI> thereupon the <HI>Turks</HI> began to build the Fort of <HI>Maina:</HI> but <HI>Querini</HI> Captain of the Gulph for the <HI>Venetians</HI> in 1570. understanding their design, Land∣ed, and by the help of the <HI>Mainotes</HI> took this Fort, and ruined it entirely; by which means the <HI>Mainotes</HI> were preserved, and obliged to the Service of this State.</P>

It is great, strong, and has a Haven belonging to it on the Western shoar of the Island. Long. 24. 40. Lat. 40. 00. The Maps place it in Lat. 38. 26. The Inhabi∣tants of this Island were of old famous Archers, from whence they were called <HI>Baleares;</HI> at first they went naked: being subdued by the <HI>Carthaginians, Anno Mundi</HI> 3500. they became more civilized, and served in the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Wars against the <HI>Romans;</HI> till together with <HI>Spain</HI> they fell under that Republick in the Year of <HI>Rome</HI> 630. 521 Years before the Birth of our Saviour. The <HI>Moors</HI> were their next Masters; who crossing out of <HI>Africa</HI> took Possession of them about the same time they Conquered <HI>Spain. Raymund</HI> Earl of <HI>Barcelone,</HI> by the assistance of the <HI>Genouese,</HI> expelled the <HI>Moors</HI> in 1102: but the <HI>Genouese,</HI> as if they had repented this good Deed restored them again.

(the fourth King of <HI>Majorca</HI>) was slain in Battel by <HI>Pedro</HI> IV. King of <HI>Arragon;</HI> and ever since these Islands have been an∣nexed to that Kingdom.

Dr. <HI>Hey∣lyn</HI> bounds it on the North with the River <HI>Gangeraco; Baudrand</HI> with the Kingdom of <HI>Decam; Buno</HI> bounde it to the North with the Cape of <HI>Darame,</HI> ten Miles beneath <HI>Goa. Cluverius</HI> reckons up these Kingdoms in it; <HI>Calicut, Coulete, Cranganor, Cochin, Coulam,</HI> and <HI>Travancor:</HI> of which <HI>Calicut</HI> is the Supreme, and therefore stiled <HI>Samory</HI> by them, that is, <HI>the Great Emperor, and God on Earth.</HI> For its extent Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> gives it three hundred <HI>English</HI> Miles to the Cape of <HI>Co∣mori,</HI> (which he supposeth to be the <HI>Commaria Ex∣trema</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy;</HI>) and its greatest breadth fifty Miles at the North. <HI>Baudrand</HI> makes its length one hun∣dred <HI>French</HI> Leagues; and its breadth ten, or fifteen, which is too little. <HI>Cluverius</HI> makes it eighty <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Miles long, and forty five broad. All agree, that it is the most fruitful, populous, and temperate Re∣gion in the whole <HI>East-Indies.</HI> The Inhabitants are very fierce, savage, and go naked, except what Nature desires to have hidden. They have a hatred of theft.

Lat. 03. 40. Subject to the King of <HI>Ihor,</HI> till the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in 1511. took it under <HI>Al∣phonsus Albuquerque,</HI> who made it an Episcopal City: In 1606. the <HI>Dutch</HI> besieg'd it in vain: but in 1640. the <HI>Dutch</HI> took it from them after a Siege of six Months. It is a celebrated Mart, has a large Haven, a strong Castle, and a River of the same name with the City; lying a Mile from it to the South-East. The Kingdom or Promontory of <HI>Malaca,</HI> which takes its name from this City, has the Kingdom of <HI>Siam</HI> to the North; and on all other sides is surrounded by the Ocean: it extends from one deg. of Northern Lat. to <HI>Queda,</HI> in six deg. Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> gives it two hundred and seventy <HI>English</HI> Miles in length: it is not of equal breadth: and being extremely hot and parched by the Sun, not very populous, or fruitful; but very rich by reason of the vast resort of all Nations for Trade. This was a part of the Kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> till 1258; when <HI>Parimisera</HI> and some other of the <HI>Javan</HI> Nobility be∣ing oppressed by their own King, fled to <HI>Sangesinga</HI> Viceroy for the <HI>Siamite;</HI> who receiving them kindly, was by them perfidiously slain: they erected in <HI>Sica∣pura</HI> this New Kingdom; which being soon reduced again by the <HI>Siamite,</HI> they built the <HI>Malaca;</HI> and got the Trade too from the former. The <HI>Moors</HI> join∣ing with them, they wholly revolted from <HI>Siam,</HI> (to whom they had submitted:) therefore that Prince in 1500. sent a Navy of two hundred Ships to reduce them; and thirty thousand Men with four hundred <HI>Elephants</HI> to attack them by Land: but Tempests and the disorders of his Soldiers made this Expedition miscarry. And in 1511. they fell into the hands of the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>

Taken from the <HI>Moors</HI> by <HI>Ferdinando</HI> and <HI>Isabella,</HI> in 1487. after a very long Siege. In 1661. an Inundation of the Ri∣ver swept away one thousand and sixty Houses, drown∣ed two thousand Men, and made three thousand more unfit for Habitation.

Francis Pirard</HI> has written a particular Discourse of these Islands; said to be some thousands in number; and to extend three hundred Leagues in length: partly inhabited, partly not; that where the King resides is not above five Miles in compass; whose Revenue principally consists in the fifth part of all the fruits, and in the Confiscation of Wrecks. He assumes the style of <HI>Sultan, King of thirteen Provinces and twelve thousand Islands.</HI></P>

CAMALODƲN. Cambden</HI> saith, from this Money, it is Collected this Expedition was in the twelfth Year of his Reign, fifty two years after the Birth of Christ. Certain it is, this City soon felt the fury of the <HI>Britains</HI> under <HI>Boadicia</HI> Qu. of the <HI>Iceni;</HI> who took and burnt it, and put all the <HI>Romans</HI> to the Sword, about the Year of Christ sixty three. Yet the <HI>Romans</HI> rebuilt it, as appears by <HI>An∣toninus. Edward</HI> the Son of <HI>Alfred,</HI> a <HI>Saxon</HI> King, finding it much ruined by the <HI>Danes,</HI> repaired and fortified it with a Castle. <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror had here one hundred and eighty Houses in the Tenure of the <HI>Burgesses;</HI> and eighteen wasted.

So very ancient, that it is supposed to have been built by the <HI>Phoenicians. Justin</HI> saith, it was built by the <HI>Phocians,</HI> in the Times of <HI>Tarqui∣nius,</HI> King of the <HI>Romans;</HI> who in their way thithe, contracted an Alliance with the Infant City of <HI>Rome;</HI> and did great things in their Offensive and Defensive Wars against the Barbarous <HI>Galls.</HI> That, the Soil of their Country being barren, they were forced to de∣pend more upon Navigation than Agriculture for their Subsistence; and would now and then exercise the (then thought innocent, if not glorious) Trade of Piracy: which led them round about <HI>Italy,</HI> to the Mouth of the <HI>Rhosne:</HI> and the pleasantness of the place allured them to go and settle there; where they were kindly treated by the <HI>Galls;</HI> the King granting them leave to build the City, and marrying his Daugh∣ter to their General. <HI>That,</HI> these were the great Ci∣vilizers and Instructors of the <HI>Galls</HI> in Learning, Arts, and Architecture. After this they managed some Wars against the <HI>Ligurians:</HI> and became formi∣dable to all their Neighbours: having great success, till they interposed in the Quarrel between <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Pompey;</HI> being in this more Loyal to that State, than prudent in the estimation of their Forces: for they pretended to interpose between those they were not able to force; and consequently fell a Victim to the Fortunes of <HI>Caesar,</HI> whose Army left them no∣thing but their Liberty. This Calamity befel them about forty two years before the Birth of our Saviour. They recovered again as great an esteem as ever. <HI>Ta∣citus</HI> informs us, that in his time it was a place where the <HI>Grecian</HI> Affability and the <HI>Provincial</HI> Thrift were rarely mixed. In the Fall of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, this City became a prey to the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Franks:</HI> but in what Times I cannot assign.

Since the settling Christianity here, it has ever been a Bishops See, under the Archbishop of <HI>Vienne</HI> formerly, now of <HI>Arles.</HI> Its first Bishop being said to be S. <HI>Lazarus,</HI> whom <HI>Christ</HI> raised from the dead.

In 745. it was made an Archbishops See, instead of <HI>Wormes;</HI> to which it was a Suffra∣gan See before. It was very severely treated by <HI>Fre∣derick Aenobarbus,</HI> the Emperor, in 1158. But re∣built and restored by <HI>Otho</HI> IV. In 1462. it was ta∣ken <HI>October</HI> 27. by <HI>Adolphus Nassaw,</HI> its Bishop: and whereas before it was Imperial and Free, it has been ever since subject to its own Archbishops. There was an University opened here in 1482. Others say in 1461. <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI> entred this place in Tri∣umph, <HI>December</HI> 14. 1631. In 1635. it was retaken from the <HI>Swedes:</HI> but the next year they again took it, and kept it till the Peace of <HI>Munster.</HI> It claims also the invention of Printing about 1430. <HI>A strong place, and well guarded</HI> (saith Dr. <HI>Brown;</HI>) <HI>has ma∣ny Churches and Monasteries, and some fair Build∣ings, especially those of Publick Concern; but the narrowness of the Streets, and many old Houses, take away much from the Beauty of it. It is most ex∣tended towards the River; and that part excels the other also towards the Land, as being more popu∣lous, and better built.</HI> It paid to the King of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> as a Ransom, above an hundred thousand Dol∣lers; which shews its Wealth. This Prince built a Bridge over the <HI>Main</HI> here, and another over the <HI>Rhine:</HI> partly upon Piles of Wood, partly upon Boats; the first of these is taken away, but the latter is continued still. The Archbishop is Arch-Chancellor of the Empire, and the first of the Electoral Col∣lege: in all publick Conventions he sits at the Right Hand of the Emperor; and is the Successor of <HI>Boni∣face,</HI> an <HI>Englishman,</HI> who very much promoted the Christian Faith in these parts. This City received a <HI>French</HI> Garrison in <HI>October</HI> 1688. Surrendred again to the Consederate Forces <HI>Sept.</HI> 11. 1689. after a Siege of six or seven Weeks. § The Electorate of <HI>Mentz, Moguntina Ditio,</HI> called by the Inhabitants, <HI>Maint∣zische;</HI> by the <HI>Germans, <HI>das Churfurstenthumb bon Mayntz;</HI></HI> is a small Province in the Lower Cir∣cle of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> under the Dominion of this Arch∣bishop: stretching from East to West, between the
<PB N="263" REF="142"/>
Territories of <HI>Weteraw</HI> and <HI>Westerwalt</HI> to the North, and the Lower Palatinate to the South. The bounds cannot be exactly stated; because the Do∣minions belonging to this Bishoprick lye dispersed in <HI>Franconia,</HI> and the other Circles; and render this Elector the less considerable. Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> observes, that a Bishop of <HI>Mentz</HI> subscribed in the Council of <HI>Colen</HI> in 347. So that this Bishoprick was only Re∣founded in 745▪ after the barbarous Nations had ex∣tirpated Christianity here. Dr. <HI>Brown</HI> saith, the Soil of this Country is fertile; abounds with all sorts of Provisions, and excellent Wines: So that his Revenue will afford him six or seven thousand Crowns a year.</P>

Now very small, and in a declining condition; only the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (in whose hands it is,) have bestowed of late years something in Fortifying it against the <HI>Por∣tuguese.</HI> The Archbishop's See was removed hence in 1124. by Pope <HI>Calistus</HI> II. to <HI>S.

<P><HI>Merionethshire, <HI>Mervinia,</HI></HI> is one of the twelve Shires in the Principality of <HI>Wales;</HI> called by the Inhabitants, <HI>Uerionethshire:</HI> on the North it has <HI>Carnarvan</HI> and <HI>Denbigh,</HI> on the East <HI>Montgomery,</HI> the South <HI>Cardigan,</HI> (cut off by the River <HI>Dowy,</HI>) and on the West it is washed by the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea.

This City was recovered out of the Hands of the <HI>Saracens</HI> by <HI>Roger</HI> the <HI>Norman</HI> in 1060. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> provoked it so far, that in 1674. it shook off their Yoke; who were never able to reduce the place again under their Obedience, till <HI>March</HI> 16. 1678. The Inhabitants pretend to have a Letter, which was Written to them by the <HI>Virgin Mary;</HI> and certainly they have great reason to value that singular favour.</P>

This City stands upon the North side of a Lake of the same name; in a most pleasant, fruitful, and large Plain, and in great part surround∣ed with the Lake. The Inhabitants pretend it was built in 1322. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> by the current and thread of their Story, say, it was built in 902. It was many Ages since, the Royal Seat of the Kings of <HI>Mexico;</HI> had then a great and splendid Palace, called in their Tongue the <HI>Tepac;</HI> but burnt together with the City, when it was taken by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in 1521. by <HI>Francis Cortez;</HI> who rebuilt the City, and made it the Capital of his Conquests.

The <HI>Romans</HI> first took it in the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 531. <HI>Marcellus</HI> their General Triumphing for the Slaughter of <HI>Viridomare</HI> the Prince of it, and the taking this City. This City however joined with the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> in the Second <HI>Punick</HI> War; and was not reduced without the loss of six thousand of her Inhabitants. In the times of Christianity, being con∣verted by S. <HI>Barnabas,</HI> it became an Archbishop's See, and suffered very much from the <HI>Arrian</HI> Princes, though in the end it preserved the Catholick Faith. <HI>Attila,</HI> King of the <HI>Huns,</HI> took and spoiled this, and several Neighbouring Cities; particularly <HI>Florence</HI> and <HI>Verona</HI> in the year of Christ 452. The next that became Masters of it were the <HI>Lombards,</HI> who possess'd themselves of it about 570. It continued under this Nation till 774. under a Succession of twenty three Princes.

It continued under this Fa∣mily, and the Emperors of <HI>Germany,</HI> till 1161: when it took part with Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> III. against <HI>Fre∣derick Barbarossa,</HI> and was for it rased to the ground: but it recovered; and outing the Emperors about 1221. became a Republick: and continued so till 1277. when it fell under <HI>Otho</HI> by the Title of <HI>Vis∣conti,</HI> but as subject to the Emperors of <HI>Germany. John Galeazo,</HI> the eighth of these, was made a Duke by <HI>Wenceslaus</HI> I. Emperor, in 1395. It continued under Dukes, till <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. in 1501. by the Con∣quest of <HI>Lewis,</HI> an usurping Duke, got it; <HI>Maximili∣an</HI> got it from the <HI>French</HI> in 1513. <HI>Francis,</HI> a Bro∣ther of this <HI>Maximilian,</HI> the seventeenth Duke, suc∣ceeded him in 1529. <HI>Francis</HI> I. King of <HI>France,</HI> won and lost it again in 1521. And being taken Pri∣soner by the Forces of <HI>Charles</HI> V. in the Battel of <HI>Pavia</HI> in 1525, he was forced for his Liberty to re∣nounce all his Pretences to this Duchy: upon the death of <HI>Francis Sforze,</HI> in 1535. it was by <HI>Charles</HI> V. united for ever to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> under which it still is. At this day, after all these Sufferings, it is the greatest and most beautiful City in <HI>Lombardy;</HI> the most populous too; its Inhabitants being thought to be two hundred thousand Souls. Its Trade is equal to its Greatness; and the Inhabitants very rich. It is seven Miles in compass; has one of the strongest Cit∣tadels in the World, with an University. It stands upon the River <HI>Olona,</HI> three hundred and twenty five Miles from <HI>Rome,</HI> one hundred and sixty five from <HI>Venice,</HI> and two hundred and thirty from <HI>Lyons.</HI> Long. 31. 30.

In the years 344. and 350, two Councils were here Congregated against the <HI>Ar∣rians.</HI> In 355. the <HI>Arrians</HI> carried it against the ad∣verse Party, and sent a great number thereof into Ba∣nishment. In 390. there was another celebrated against <HI>Jovinian.</HI> In 451. the Doctrine of the <HI>Incarnation of the Word,</HI> as expressed in the Epistle of Pope <HI>Leo</HI> to <HI>Flavianus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> received the approbation of a Council at this place. In 679. they held another against the <HI>Menethelites.</HI> And di∣vers since, of inferior note. § The Dukedom of <HI>Mi∣lan</HI> is a part of <HI>Lombardy;</HI> bounded on the North by <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and the <HI>Grisons;</HI> on the East by the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the Dukedom of <HI>Placen∣tia;</HI> on the South by the States of <HI>Genoua;</HI> and on the West by <HI>Montisferat</HI> and <HI>Piedmont.</HI> The Soil is extreamly fruitful, plain, well watered, very full of People, and consequently well improved.

(when there is so few Inhabitants in it) subject to the Plague every <HI>Autumn:</HI> besides the Mountain renders it weak and undefensible. This City is said to be built about the Year of the World 2997. in the days of the Patriarch <HI>Jacob;</HI> 1763 Years before the Birth of our Saviour: which account (if it be true) makes <HI>Misitra</HI> 983 years older than <HI>Rome.</HI> There was no City in the World that flourished so many Ages as this in Military Glory: it had a considerable share in all those Actions which made the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> so famous. It had Kings also the longest of any of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Cities: for many Ages two at once: and when they took away the Power from them, they pre∣served the name. This City was never brought under the Power of any Stranger; till <HI>Philopoemen</HI> (a <HI>Ma∣cedonian,</HI> who died in the Year of the World 3767.) took and abolished <HI>Lycurgus</HI> his Laws. Which is placed by <HI>Helvicus</HI> in the Year of the World 3767. one hundred and ninety one Years before the Birth of our Saviour. After this it became so inconsiderable, as to be rarely mentioned: only we are informed the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperors made it the <HI>Appenage</HI> of their Elder Sons. <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. (stiled the <HI>Great</HI>) was the first of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Princes, who in 1458. or thereabouts, possessed himself of this City and the Cittadel, built in the latter times on the top of Mount <HI>Taygetus.</HI> In 1473. the <HI>Venetians</HI> took the City from the <HI>Turks:</HI> but not being able to master the Cittadel, they were soon after forced to desert it. In 1687. the <HI>Bassa</HI> of <HI>Misitra</HI> Articled with the Victorious <HI>Venetians</HI> to March away with only what the Garrison could carry. This City is a Bishops See, under the Archbishop of <HI>Corinth;</HI> at this day very small, and little peopled.</P>
<P><HI>Misnia, <HI>Libonotria,</HI></HI> is a Province and Marquisate of <HI>Germany,</HI> called by the Inhabitants <HI>Meissen,</HI> or <HI>Meissnerlandt.</HI> It is a considerable part of the <HI>Ʋp∣per Saxony;</HI> bounded on the North by the Principa∣lity of <HI>Anhalt;</HI> on the East by <HI>Lusatia;</HI> on the South by <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and <HI>Franconia;</HI> and on the West by <HI>Thuringia.</HI> The greatest part is under the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> who resides at <HI>Dresden,</HI> the Capital City.

<P><HI>Modena, <HI>Mutina,</HI></HI> a City of <HI>Lombardy</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> the Capital of a Sovereign Dukedom of the same name. Seated in a Plain upon the River <HI>Secchia;</HI> the great∣est Bed of which runs four Miles more to the West: but it has two Branches; one runs under the Walls, the other through the City of <HI>Modena;</HI> and a little beneath the City unite and fall into the <HI>Panaro.</HI> This City lies twenty Miles from <HI>Bologna</HI> to the North-West, and forty four from <HI>Ferrara</HI> to the South-West. It is naturally strong by its Situation; forti∣fied too; and has had a Castle added of latter times for its greater security. Ancient Story informs us, this City was a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony of great Strength and Re∣putation; and that <HI>M. Antonius</HI> besieged <HI>D. Brutus,</HI> (the principal Conspirator against <HI>Julius Caesar</HI>) here: but <HI>Hirtius</HI> and <HI>Pansa,</HI> (the two Consuls) coming up, <HI>Antonius</HI> was forced to raise the Siege: where∣upon followed a bloody Fight, in which both these Consuls were slain, in the Year of <HI>Rome</HI> 711. In the times of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Lombards,</HI> it was intirely ruined; but rebuilt by the Children of <HI>Charles the Great.</HI> In 973. here was a Council held for the com∣posing some differences amongst the <HI>German</HI> Princes. This City is a Bishops See, under the Archbishop of <HI>Ravenna.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lo Stato di Modena, <HI>Mutinensis Ducatus; the Dukedom of Modena</HI></HI> is bounded on the North with the Dukedoms of <HI>Mantoua</HI> and <HI>Mirandola;</HI> on the East with the Territory of <HI>Bologna;</HI> on the South with the Dukedom of <HI>Tuscany;</HI> and the States of <HI>Lu∣ca</HI> on the West, with the Dukedom of <HI>Parma.</HI> It ex∣tends from North to South sixty, from East to West forty five Miles: heretofore under the Duke of <HI>Ferra∣ra;</HI> but the eldest Line of that Family failing in <HI>Al∣phonsus</HI> II. in 1597, the Dukes of <HI>Modena,</HI> (who were a younger Branch of the same Family) put in their Claim for the whole Succession; but were opposed by Pope <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. Whereupon ensued a War, which was ended by a Treaty the next Year; the Pope keeping <HI>Ferrara,</HI> and the Duke <HI>Modena,</HI> as a Sove∣reign State. <HI>Alphonsus d'Este</HI> the present Duke, is the Third of this Line, since the Sovereignty fell into this Family; descended from a Race of Dukes which began in 1452. when the Emperor <HI>Frederick</HI> III. in favour of <HI>Borso d'Este,</HI> first erected this State into a Dukedom. Tho this Family is the same with that of <HI>Brunswick</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> said to be eight hundred years old; yet the noblest Branch it ever produced, is <HI>Mary</HI> Queen Consort to King <HI>James</HI> II. This Country is much celebrated for its great fertility.</P>
<P><HI>Modica, <HI>Motuca,</HI></HI> an ancient City of <HI>Sicily,</HI> upon a River of the same name; ten Miles from <HI>Pachino,</HI> the most South-East Cape of that Island, and five from the Southern Shoar. It is now in a flourishing State.</P>

<P><HI>Modon, <HI>Methone,</HI></HI> a City of the <HI>Morea,</HI> on the Southern Shoar, in the Province of <HI>Belvedore,</HI> called <HI>Messenia</HI> by <HI>Strabo, Pliny</HI> and others; by the <HI>Vene∣tians Modon;</HI> by the <HI>Turks Mutune.</HI> It is now a fine strong City, a frequented Port, and a Bishops See, under the Archbishop of <HI>Patras:</HI> has a strong Castle, a large and safe Haven; about eleven <HI>English</HI> Miles from <HI>Navarino</HI> to the South, twenty five from <HI>Coron</HI> to the West, and sixty two from Cape <HI>Matapan</HI> to the same quarter. Seated in a fruitful and delightful Country, strong by Nature and Art, and is the com∣mon Residence of the <HI>Sangiac</HI> of the <HI>Morea.</HI> In the times of <HI>Trajan</HI> it suffered very much by a parcel of <HI>Illyrian</HI> Barbarians, who surprized and slew many of its Inhabitants: which loss that generous Prince re∣paired by his Princely Compassion, and advantageous Privileges granted to it. In 1208. the <HI>Genouese</HI> ra∣vished it from the <HI>Venetians,</HI> but did not hold it long. In 1124. it came first into the hands of the <HI>Venetians;</HI> but was taken from them the year following by the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperor. In 1204. the <HI>Venetians</HI> retook it. <HI>Bajazet</HI> II. in 1498. besieged it with an Army of an hundred and fifty thousand Men; and took it by a kind of surprize, after a stout defence, upon the arrival of a considerable Succour; which drew the Inhabitants from their Posts to their ruin. In 1659. <HI>Morosini,</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> General, took it; and might have taken <HI>Coron</HI> too, if he had not been forced to Sail away to the <HI>Dardanells,</HI> for the security of <HI>Candy.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> regained this Place in the end of the <HI>Candian</HI> War. But in 1686. the <HI>Venetian</HI> Arms again prevailed, to deliver this noble and strong City out of the Hands of the Infidels. They found in it ninety nine pieces of Canon.</P>

This otherwise small Place is memorable for two great Battels here fought: the first between <HI>Lewis</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent, in 1526: in which that un∣fortunate Prince <HI>Lewis,</HI> (being about twenty years old) with twenty five thousand Men, fought three hundred thousand <HI>Turks:</HI> when being over-powered by num∣ber, twenty two thousand of the Christian Army were slain upon the place; five thousand <HI>Wagons,</HI> eighty great Cannon, six hundred small ones, with all their Tents and Baggage were taken by the Victors; and the King in his flight over the Brook <HI>Curass</HI> feil into a Quagmire, and was swallowed up: after which <HI>Soly∣man</HI> took and slew two hundred thousand <HI>Hungari∣ans;</HI> and got such a footing in this Kingdom, that he could never be expelled. This fatal Battel was fought <HI>October</HI> 29. The second in some part retrieves the Loss and Infamy of the former.

<P><HI>The Molucques, <HI>Moluccae,</HI></HI> by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> called <HI>las Molucas,</HI> are five small Islands towards the Western Shoar of the Isle of <HI>Gilolo</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> lying near the <HI>Line:</HI> in Long. 150. deg. called <HI>Ter∣nata, Tidor, Machian, Motir,</HI> and <HI>Bachian.</HI> The greatest of them is forty five Miles in Compass. They lie extended from North to South, on both sides the <HI>Line;</HI> only regardable on the account of the vast quantities of Spice, which are from hence sent over all the World. About the Year of Christ 1013. the <HI>Chinian</HI> Empire, being then in a flourishing State, first became Masters of these Islands; but not without Blood and Treasure. About sixty years after, they were expelled by the Inhabitants of <HI>Malucca;</HI> after which succeeded the <HI>Persians,</HI> mixed with <HI>Arabians;</HI> and by the latter they were called the <HI>Molucca</HI> Isles. The ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> knew nothing of them, though they had Spices from them, brought by the <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> Merchants by the way of the Red Sea. In latter times those were brought by <HI>Persia</HI> to the <HI>Caspian</HI> and <HI>Euxine</HI> Seas; and thence dispersed over Christendom by the <HI>Genouese</HI> and <HI>Ve∣netians.</HI> After the <HI>Turks</HI> prevailed in <HI>Asia,</HI> the Trade was turned by the way of <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> and <HI>Alexan∣dria.</HI> But after the <HI>Portuguese</HI> by many discoveries had opened their way to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> about 1512. they first arrived in these Islands; and cut off all Trade between the <HI>Arabians</HI> and them; by which the <HI>Sultan</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> lost eight hundred thousand Ducats a year. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> came hither under <HI>Ferdinando Magal∣haens,</HI> about 1520: whereupon ensued a Contest be∣tween <HI>Charles</HI> V. and <HI>John</HI> III. (King of <HI>Portugal</HI>) concerning the Dominion of these Islands: <HI>Charles</HI> re∣signed his Right to <HI>John</HI> for two hundred thousand Ducats. About 1579. the <HI>English,</HI> under <HI>Drake,</HI> began to disturb the <HI>Portuguese</HI> here. About 1599. the <HI>Hollanders</HI> began to send numerous and strong Fleets into these Seas; by which, (and the great Wars, and Changes which have since happened in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portuga</HI>') they have intirely possessed themselves of these Islands.

It lies upon the North of <HI>Achaia,</HI> (or <HI>Livadia</HI>) be∣ing separated from it by a narrow Channel: one hun∣dred and twenty Miles from East to West, thirty broad; three hundred in circuit; joyned to the Con∣tinent by a Bridge of Stone built by the <HI>Venetians.</HI> It is extraordinary fruitful, but little inhabited. The principal Town was called formerly <HI>Chalcis,</HI> now <HI>Ne∣gropont;</HI> and stands on the South Side of the Island, at one end of the Bridge: its Walls are two Miles in compass. None but <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> are suffered to reside within those: the Christians dwell altogether in the Suburbs, the whole of which may be about five thousand, exceeding far in number the o∣ther: and amongst these the <HI>Jesuits</HI> have a College. There are four Mosques in the Town, of which the principal hath been a Cathedral Church dedicated to S. <HI>Mark,</HI> and the Seat not only of a Bishop under the Archbishop of <HI>Athens,</HI> but of an Archbishop. The Town is separated from the Suburbs by a deep Ditch of equal breadth from top to bottom: both stand on a plain level Ground: the Channel between the City and the Continent being not above thirty Paces, and the Bridge being secured by a Tower. This Town and Island was granted to the <HI>Venetians</HI> by the <HI>Latin</HI> Emperors of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> (in consideration of their Services,) about 1204. Though they fortified it to the utmost, yet <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. took the prin∣cipal City with the loss of forty thousand Men in 1463. or 69. (for I find various Accounts) after he had besieged it with one hundred and twenty thou∣sand Men, thirty days; putting all above twenty years of Age to the Sword; which amounted (when the Siege began) to eighty thousand. In 1660. the <HI>Venetians</HI> retook it: and relost it. Wherefore the <HI>Turks</HI> have fortified it with so many new strong Works, that tho the <HI>Venetians</HI> laid Siege to it with an Army of twenty four thousand Men, commanded by <HI>Morosini▪</HI> (then Doge,) which stormed it <HI>October</HI> 12. 1688; Yet it was left in the Enemies Possession. The most noted Promontories of the Island are the. ancient <HI>Caphareus,</HI> now called <HI>Capo Figera</HI> or <HI>Capo d'Oro,</HI> and the <HI>Capo Lithar.</HI> Its two Rivers are the <HI>Similio</HI> and the <HI>Cerco.</HI> The City <HI>Caristo,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Chateau-roux,</HI> near <HI>Capo Figera,</HI> is a Bishops See under the Archbishop of <HI>Negropont:</HI> and <HI>Rocco,</HI> betwixt that City and <HI>Negropont,</HI> another.

They have built seven great Towns; the chief of which is <HI>Boston;</HI> which in 1670. had fifty Sail of Ships belonging to it. They would never submit to any Governour sent from <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> but lived like a Free State; till a <HI>Quo Warran∣to</HI> being sent against them in 1683. by K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. they submitted to <HI>Henry Cranfield</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and in 1686. accepted Sir <HI>Edward Andrews</HI> as Governour for King <HI>James</HI> II.</P>

In 1329. it was besieged by <HI>Orchanes</HI> II. of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Line. <HI>Andronicus,</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperor, coming up to its Re∣lief was wounded, and forced to retire; yet the City held out, and was taken by a Stratagem rather than force the year following.

In ancient times it was one of the most considerable and important Cities of the East. Built by a King of <HI>Bithynia</HI> of the same name, says <HI>Strabo. Hannibal</HI> poysoned him∣self here, in the Reign of <HI>Prusias</HI> King of <HI>Bithynia,</HI> to avoid his being delivered to the <HI>Romans. Constan∣stine the Great</HI> dyed in or very near this City; which received the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> early, and became ho∣noured with divers Martyrdoms. In 358. a violent Earthquake, described particularly by <HI>Ammianus Mar∣cellinus,</HI> almost entirely ruined it, at a time, when the Emperor <HI>Constantius</HI> was to celebrate an <HI>Arrian</HI> Council at it. A number of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Inscri∣ptions appear there yet to be seen: And some relations tell us, it is now inhabited by about thirty thousand People, <HI>Greeks, Armenians, Jews</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> who have their respective Mosques and Churches, and trade much in Linnen and Silks.</P>

<PB N="289" REF="155"/>
East and West, the space of eight hundred Leagues. It encreases in the middle of <HI>June</HI> like the <HI>Nile,</HI> and overflows the Country. This continues twenty four days; and the decrease the same. After a long Course, and the Reception of many Rivers, (whose Names are unknown to us) it falls into the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean by six great Outlets; which are all (but one) South of Cape <HI>Verde.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nigritia,</HI> a large Country of <HI>Africa,</HI> extended on each side the River <HI>Niger</HI> which divides it from East to West into two parts; lying and bounded betwixt <HI>Guinee</HI> to the South, the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean to the West, and the vast deserts of <HI>Zaara</HI> to the East and North. The Kingdoms of <HI>Borno, Agades, Cano</HI> or <HI>Ghana, Tombut, Gualata, Guenehoa, Gaoga,</HI> and divers others of note and great extent, are contained in this division of <HI>Africa.</HI> The Inhabitants are the <HI>Negroes,</HI> above∣mentioned; who make a Trade of selling not only the Prisoners they steal or force from their Neighbors, but even their own Wives and Children, for Slaves, to the <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nile, <HI>Nilus,</HI></HI> a vast River in <HI>Africa;</HI> which ariseth from two Fountains in the higher <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> in the <HI>Abyssins</HI> Empire; in a Country called <HI>Sacahala,</HI> a∣mongst high Mountains; and being enlarged by the <HI>Gema, Kelti,</HI> and <HI>Branti,</HI> it passeth through the South part of the Lake of <HI>Dambea,</HI> to the greatest <HI>Cataracts.</HI> Before it enters <HI>Nubia,</HI> it takes in the River <HI>Meleg,</HI> and afterwards the <HI>Tacaze</HI> at <HI>Jalac;</HI> and entering and traversing the <HI>Ʋpper Egypt,</HI> four Miles beneath <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> it divides first into two, and after into more Branches; which anciently made the number of seven, but are now reduced to four; the rest being stopped up by the Sands of the <HI>Medi∣terranean</HI> Sea, and those brought down by the Ri∣ver; the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Princes (who have been many Ages Lords of <HI>Egypt</HI>) taking no care to keep them open. The Eastern Branch falls into the <HI>Mediter∣ranean</HI> Sea by <HI>Damiata,</HI> and was of old called <HI>Os Pelusiacum.</HI> The Western was then named <HI>Canopus,</HI> and falls into the same Sea below <HI>Rosetto.</HI> These two make the <HI>Delta</HI> an Island, which is the richest por∣tion of Land in <HI>Egypt.</HI> There are two other Outlets between these, but poor in Waters, saith Mr. <HI>Sandys.</HI> This River is the only cause of the Fertility of <HI>Egypt;</HI> beginning every year to rise with the Rising Sun, <HI>June</HI> 17. and swelling sometimes to twenty four Cu∣bits. About the middle of <HI>September</HI> it begins to decrease: about a Month after they sow their Grounds; and in <HI>May</HI> reap them. The Cause of this Inundation is now known to be the Rains, which fall in <HI>Aethio∣pia</HI> for three Months together in their Winter, and the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Summer. They of <HI>Egypt</HI> owe not only their Food, but many of them their Lives to the swel∣lings of this River: insomuch that when five hundred die of the Plague at <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> the day before, not one dies the day after. These Waters are sweet to the taste, cool and wholsom; and extremely Nutritive both to Plants and Animals. It has plenty of Fish, and too many Crocodiles; some of which live to be thirty foot long; but rarely come so low as <HI>Grand Cairo.</HI> Mr. <HI>Thevenot</HI> begins the encrease of the <HI>Nile, May</HI> 16. or 20. and saith, the Publication is made <HI>June</HI> 28. or 29. He saith, they give no account of its encrease beyond <HI>September</HI> 24 tho it often swells to the beginning of <HI>October,</HI> and gradually abates till the Month of <HI>May.</HI> He gives also this account of the Head of the <HI>Nile,</HI> from the Report of an <HI>Aethiopian</HI> Ambassador he met at <HI>Grand Cairo.</HI> The Head of <HI>Nile</HI> is a Well that springs out of the Ground in a large Plain, called <HI>Ovembromma,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Ago;</HI> which casts up the Waters very high; the Well being twelve days Journey from <HI>Gouthar,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Aethiopia.</HI> These Waters running Northwards, pass by seven Cataracts before they enter into <HI>Egypt;</HI> and he saith, there are no Mountains near its Head by three weeks journey. If the River doth not rise six∣teen foot, a Famine follows for want of Water: if it swells to twenty four, there is a Dearth; because the Seed time is lost. The <HI>Abyssines</HI> entitle the <HI>Nile,</HI> the <HI>Father of Rivers.</HI></P>

In the Year 1589, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> endea∣voured without any good success to reduce it; when <HI>Skenkius</HI> (their General) was drowned in the <HI>Wael.</HI> In the Year 1591, Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> took it after a sharp Siege. In the Year 1672, it was taken by the <HI>French;</HI> the only Town in all those Provinces which fought for its Liberty: the year after the <HI>French</HI> de∣serted it. In 1678, there was a Peace agreed here be∣tween the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> In the Year 1679, between the <HI>Germans</HI> and the <HI>French.</HI> This City is said to have been first built by the <HI>Catti,</HI> and the Castle by <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, whilst he was in <HI>France; Charles the Great</HI> built here a Noble Palace; which together with this City was burnt by the <HI>Nor∣mans.</HI> The <HI>Germans</HI> prevailing against the <HI>Normans,</HI> rebuilt the City; and gave it many Privileges; several of the Emperors residing in it, till at last it was mort∣gaged to <HI>Otho,</HI> Duke of <HI>Guelderland;</HI> and became the Capital of that Dukedom.</P>

But <HI>Bochartus</HI> transposes that verse, and endeavours to prove, that <HI>Nimrod</HI> was its Foun∣der, <HI>going forth out of the Land of Ashur.</HI> Others say, <HI>Ninus</HI> built, or at least augmented it, and gave it his own name. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> has left us a state∣ly description of it. In the time of <HI>Jonas,</HI> we read, it was <HI>an exceeding great City of three days journey:</HI> Jon. 2. 3. that is, in St. <HI>Jerom</HI>'s construction, in cir∣cuit.

<P><HI>The Land of Ophir.</HI> When <HI>Christopher Colum∣bus</HI> first discovered the Island of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> in <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> in 1492. he was confident he had found the <HI>Ophir</HI> of K. <HI>Solomon,</HI> to see the vast Mines of Gold there. <HI>Peru,</HI> and <HI>Mexico,</HI> have had the same judg∣ment passed upon them; as in <HI>Africa,</HI> the Kingdoms of <HI>Angola, Melinde,</HI> and <HI>Sofala,</HI> together with <HI>Car∣thage;</HI> and in <HI>Asia, Arabia,</HI> the Islands of <HI>Ormus; Zeylan, Java, Sumatra;</HI> the Kingdoms of <HI>Pegu, Siam, Bengala</HI> and <HI>Malaca:</HI> But the <HI>American</HI> Voyages, of all, sound the most improbable, because of the immense distance of that Country from <HI>Pale∣stine,</HI> and the want of the Compass in those times, which made Men scarce dare to lose the sight of Land. <HI>Joktan,</HI> of the Posterity of <HI>Shem,</HI> had two Sons, cal∣led <HI>Ophir</HI> and <HI>Havilah. Gen. 10. 29.

And <HI>Bochartus</HI> allows, that the <HI>three thousand talents of the Gold of Ophir,</HI> prepared by King <HI>David,</HI> (1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29. 4.) were fetched from <HI>Arabia.</HI> It is true, <HI>Josephus</HI> says, <HI>Solomons Fleet</HI> went to the <HI>Indies,</HI> to a Land called, <HI>the Land of Gold,</HI> meaning the <HI>Chersonesus Aurea</HI> (now <HI>Malaca:</HI>) and S. <HI>Jerom,</HI> that <HI>Ophir</HI> of the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terity of <HI>Shem</HI> gave his name not only to that <HI>Chersonesus,</HI> but also to the Isles of <HI>Java</HI> and <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and the Kingdoms of <HI>Siam, Pegu,</HI> and <HI>Bengala:</HI> Whereby, the three years time, said to be spent in the Voyage, may be the better accounted for.

<P><HI>Paris, <HI>Leutetia, Luotetia, Lucetia, Leucotetia, Parisii,</HI></HI> and <HI>Lutetia Parisiorum,</HI> the Capital City of the Kingdom of <HI>France;</HI> boasted by <HI>Baudrand,</HI> to be the greatest City of <HI>Europe;</HI> with a <HI>Nemine re∣clamante, no body denying it to be so.</HI> This was a celebrated City in the Times of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. <HI>Julian</HI> the <HI>Apostate</HI> (whilst he was <HI>Caesar</HI> only) re∣sided here in the Reign of <HI>Constantius:</HI> and adorned it with <HI>Baths</HI> and a <HI>Palace.</HI> But its greatest Rise was from the <HI>Franks: Clodoveus</HI> settling the Royal Throne in this City, about the year 458. <HI>Julius Cae∣sar</HI> is the first that mentions it; it was then very small; being wholly contained in an Island in the <HI>Seyne,</HI> not exceeding forty Acres, which had then a Wooden Bridge over the River. In this Isle the Cathedral Church now is, and the Palace of the first <HI>French</HI> Kings. From the times of <HI>Clodoveus</HI> the first Chri∣stian King, as long as that Race lasted, it grew migh∣tily, and became very considerable. But under the <HI>Caroline</HI> Line it was very little improved; those Princes not fixing here, or in any other place. In the year 585, it happened to be almost all burnt. In 845, 856, 886, and 890, the <HI>Normans,</HI> by Sieges and Incursions, did extremely endamage it. In 896, it was very hardly preserved out of the Hands of the <HI>Normans,</HI> as to the Island; what stood out of the Island was redeemed from Ruin by Money. The Posterity of <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> on the other side fixed here; and be∣stowed great Sums of Money in enlarging and adorn∣ing this City. <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> about the year 796, at the Request of <HI>Alcuinus,</HI> a <HI>Saxon,</HI> opened an Uni∣versity here; to whose further Grandeur King <HI>Lewis</HI> the Seventh, and <HI>Philip the August,</HI> contributed very much. The <HI>College</HI> of <HI>Sorbonne</HI> holds the first place therein. In the year 1034, it suffered another Fire; and in 1206, a terrible Inundation of the River <HI>Seine.</HI> In 1420, <HI>Henry</HI> V. of <HI>England,</HI> possessed himself of this City, by marrying <HI>Catharine</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. of <HI>France.</HI> In the year 1422, <HI>Henry</HI> VI. (Son of this Victorious, but short lived Prince) was crowned King of <HI>France</HI> in <HI>Paris.</HI> And again in 1431. After this it remained in the Hands of the <HI>English</HI> till the year 1435.

In 1588, the Inhabitants became almost as infamous by the <HI>Baracades</HI> against <HI>Henry</HI> III where∣by the Life of that Prince was indangered, and he driven out of his Royal Palace by a Seditious Subject, who made himself the Head of a Faction under the Pretence of Preserving the Religion of his Country. In 1589, <HI>Henry</HI> III. was stabbed by <HI>James Clement▪</HI> a <HI>Dominican Fryar,</HI> under the Walls of <HI>Paris;</HI> just as he was upon the point of revenging the Insolence of the <HI>Baracades.</HI> The year 1590 was no less miserable: this City being by a Siege reduced by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. to so dreadful a Famine, as is scarce any where else to be read of. In the year 1610, the same Streets were stained with the Blood of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. slain by <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vil∣lac,</HI> another Enthusiastick <HI>Monk,</HI> on the same Pre∣tence that his Predecessor was. In the year 1649, they suffered the Calamities of another Siege; and were forced to comply with the Queen Mother of <HI>France</HI> by Famine. In the year 1622, at the request of King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> XV. raised the Bishop of <HI>Paris</HI> to the Honour of an Archbishop, with three Suffragans under him; the Bishops of <HI>Chartres, Meaux,</HI> and <HI>Orleans.</HI> In 1674, the Diguity of a Dukedom and Peerdom was added to the Arch∣bishoprick by the present King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV.

What the <HI>Spaniards</HI> report of the Fertility, Wealth, and Government of this Kingdom, is scarce credible: yet all fell into the Power of <HI>Pizarro,</HI> an exposed Bastard, and a Hog-driver; who fled from <HI>Spain,</HI> because he had lost a Hog out of his Herd and durst not return home without it. <HI>He</HI> afterwards and his Partner in the Discovery, <HI>Almagro,</HI> quarrelling; they formed their Parties, and made War with one another for some years: at length <HI>Pizarro</HI> was kil∣led at <HI>Lima</HI> by <HI>Almagro</HI>'s Party; <HI>Almagro</HI> came to be taken and executed by <HI>Gonzalo Pizarro,</HI> the others Brother: And <HI>Gonzalo Pizarro,</HI> warring against <HI>Pe∣dro de la Gasca</HI> Vice-Roy for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> suffered the same fate to be taken and executed like a Criminal in <HI>Guaynanima.</HI> So both the <HI>Pizarro</HI>'s and with <HI>Almagro</HI> lost their lives, the Govern∣ment of all that Country they had conquered for the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> The ancient <HI>Emperours</HI> of <HI>Peru</HI> were called by the Natives, <HI>Yncas.</HI> They began their Reign about the year 1125. four hundred years before the coming of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> hither. <HI>Garcilassus de la Vega</HI> has published a noble <HI>History</HI> of them. In divers parts and Provinces of their Empire, they had erected Palaces and Temples the richest in <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver</HI> as perhaps ever the Sun beheld. There being so prodigious a quantity of those Mettals here, that in less than fifty years, the King of <HI>Spain's fifth</HI> part out of only <HI>one</HI> of the Mines of <HI>Potosi,</HI> amounted to a∣bove a hundred and eleven Millions weight of pieces of thirteen <HI>Reales</HI> and a quarter weight a piece.

Antonius,</HI> (Brother of the Great <HI>Antonius</HI>) by <HI>Augustus,</HI> till he was forced to yield by Hunger; so that <HI>Perusina fames</HI> became a Proverbial Expression. <HI>Totila,</HI> a King of the <HI>Goths,</HI> besieged this City seven years before he took it. <HI>Narsetes</HI> retook and repaired it: The <HI>Lombards</HI> were the next Masters of it. <HI>Charles the Great</HI> gave it to the See of <HI>Rome.</HI> In the Wars betwixt the <HI>Guelphs</HI> and the <HI>Gibelines,</HI> it suffered very much: two or three small Synods have been assembled at it. It gives its name to the famous Lake, where <HI>Hannibal</HI> defeated the <HI>Romans</HI> under <HI>Flaminius,</HI> Consul, in the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 537. P. <HI>Paul</HI> III. built in it a Castle, which added to the natural strength of the Place; its pleasant Situation, magnificent and spruce Buildings, and the great plenty of all things, have made it one of the most considerable Cities in the Popes Dominions.</P>

The Country about it is called the County of <HI>Pest,</HI> from this Town. Between it and <HI>Buda,</HI> there is a fine Bridge of Boats, almost a quarter of a League long, or half an <HI>English</HI> Mile. In 1541. <HI>Solyman the Magnificent</HI> took it without Resistance: and though the next year after, it was attempted by a Potent Army under the Marquess of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> a Breach made and a brave Assault given by <HI>Vitellius,</HI> an <HI>Italian;</HI> yet the <HI>Germans</HI> cowardly left the Siege. In the year 1602. whilst the <HI>Turks</HI> were busie in the Siege of <HI>Alba Regalis;</HI> the <HI>Germans</HI> took <HI>Pest</HI> and the <HI>Lower Buda:</HI> after which, many sharp Rencoun∣ters passed between the two Garrisons; especially when the River was frozen. In 1604. <HI>Jagenreuter</HI> (a base Coward) being intrusted with the Govern∣ment of it, without any force or so much as the appearance of an Enemy, upon a bare report the <HI>Turks</HI> were coming to besiege it, deserted the Town and fled. It continued in the hands of the <HI>Turks</HI> till 1684. when it was taken by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and kept all that Summer; but deserted, when he drew off from the Siege of <HI>Buda.</HI> In 1686. it was retaken; and by the acquisition of <HI>Buda,</HI> assured to the Imperialists.</P>

This place sprung up out of a Monastery here built, and dedicated to S. <HI>Peter</HI> by <HI>Penda</HI> the first <HI>Christian King</HI> of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> about 546. <HI>Wolpher</HI> his Successor finished it in 633. In 867. it was destroy∣ed by the <HI>Danes.</HI> In 960. <HI>Ethelwold,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Win∣chester,</HI> began to rebuild it with the assistance of King <HI>Edgar</HI> and <HI>Adulph</HI> the Chancellor. In the Reign of <HI>William the Conquerour,</HI> it was plundered by <HI>Herward</HI> a <HI>Saxon;</HI> but it recovered in after∣times. When <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. dissolved this House, there be∣longed to it a Revenue of one thousand nine hundred seventy and two Pounds the year. This Prince in 1541. founded a Bishoprick in this Monastery; and annexed to it a Dean and six Prebends: <HI>John Cham∣bers,</HI> the last Abbot, becoming the first Bishop; from whom, the present is the thirteenth. <HI>Charles</HI> I. of Blessed Memory, added another Honour to this place; when in 1627. he created <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Mordant,</HI> Baron of <HI>Turvy,</HI> Earl of <HI>Peterborough.</HI> In which Family that Honour now is.

<P><HI>Philipsbourg, <HI>Philippoburgum,</HI></HI> a strong Fort or Castle upon the <HI>Rhine;</HI> which before was called <HI>Ʋdenheim.</HI> First walled in 1343. by <HI>Gebhard</HI> Bishop of <HI>Spire.</HI> And afterwards took its present name from <HI>Philip Christopher de Soeteren,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Spire;</HI> who in 1615. refortified it for the defence of that Bi∣shoprick. <HI>George</HI> Count Palatine of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> a former Bishop of <HI>Spire,</HI> had built in this place, in 1513, a noble Castle, (or rather Palace;) which was much improved in 1570, by <HI>Marquardus ab Hatstein,</HI> another Bishop. Being thus improved and made very considerable, it was reduced by the <HI>Swedes</HI> in 1634. by Hunger. Surprized by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by a Stratagem in 1635.

One Mile from the <HI>Po,</HI> forty from <HI>Mi∣lan</HI> to the East, and thirty five from <HI>Parma</HI> to the North-East; in a pleasant place, surrounded with fruit∣ful fields, Meadows, and Pastures; having many Channels cut for the watering their Ground, and the bringing in Merchandizes. It has several Salt-Springs, Mines of Iron; plenty of Wine, Oil, Corn; and Fruits of all sorts: the best Cheese in the whole World is made here in great quantity. Nor does it want Woods and Forests for Hunting; so that all things considered, it is one of the pleasantest situated Cities in the World: and thought to have taken its name from thence. It was one of the first Colonies the <HI>Romans</HI> setled in <HI>Gallia Cisalpina</HI> against the <HI>Gauls.</HI> They fortified it so well, that though the <HI>Insubres</HI> and <HI>Boii</HI> out of dis∣content Revolted and joined with <HI>Hannibal,</HI> (who made the Siege of this place one of his first Attempts) yet he was not able to take it. Nor had <HI>Asdrubal</HI> who followed him any better success: so that <HI>Livy</HI> informs us, this was one of the twelve Colonies which in the second <HI>Punick</HI> War saved <HI>Rome.</HI> In the Year of <HI>Rome</HI> 553. <HI>Amilcar</HI> a third <HI>Punick</HI> General, took this City with the help of the <HI>Gauls;</HI> and in a great degree ruined it by Fire and Sword. <HI>Caelius,</HI> a <HI>Thus∣can</HI> General, not being able to defend it against the Siege of <HI>Cinna</HI> and <HI>Marius,</HI> rather than he would be taken, desired his friend <HI>Petronius</HI> to give him his sword in his heart; who did so, and afterwards exe∣cuted the same to himself. <HI>Spurina,</HI> a Commander under <HI>Vitellius,</HI> defended this City with great Gallan∣try against <HI>Cecina,</HI> (one of <HI>Otho</HI>'s Generals;) who yet at last took and burnt it, <HI>Anno Christi</HI> 69. In 269. <HI>M. Aurelianus</HI> received a great overthrow from the <HI>Marcomanni</HI> near it. In 542. <HI>Totilas</HI> King of the <HI>Goths,</HI> took it by a Siege: which reduced them to the necessity of eating Mans Flesh. About 1335. it fell first into the Hands of the Viscounts of <HI>Milan.</HI> About 1447. they called in the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and endeavoured to shake off the Dominion of the <HI>Milanese:</HI> which had like to have ended in their Ruin; the City being taken and sacked, and a most cruel Slaughter made of the Inhabitants. It continued after this under the Dukes of <HI>Milan;</HI> till together with <HI>Milan,</HI> it fell into the Hands of <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. King of <HI>France,</HI> in 1499. Pope <HI>Julius</HI> in 1512, got the Possession of it. In 1545. Pope <HI>Paul</HI> III. Created <HI>Lewis</HI> (his Natural Son) Duke of this City: who was slain for his Cruelty and wickedness by some Gentlemen hereof; and the place put into the Hands of <HI>Charles</HI> V. in 1547. <HI>Philip</HI> II. his Son, ten years after this, granted it to the Duke of <HI>Parma;</HI> whose Posterity of the House of <HI>Farnese</HI> enjoy it now.

<P><HI>Poland, <HI>Polenia,</HI></HI> is one of the principal King∣doms in <HI>Europe;</HI> called by the Natives <HI>Poloska;</HI> by the <HI>Germans, <HI>die Polen;</HI></HI> by the <HI>French, Pologne;</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Italians, Polonia;</HI> by the <HI>En∣glish, Poland.</HI> A part of the old <HI>Salmatia Europaea;</HI> and has its Name from <HI>Pole,</HI> which signifies a Plain in the <HI>Sclavonian</HI> Tongue. Bounded on the North by the <HI>Baltick Sea,</HI> the <HI>Swedish Livonia,</HI> and <HI>Russia;</HI> by the last, and the Desarts of <HI>Tartary,</HI> on the East; on the South by the <HI>Ʋpper Hungary, Transylvania,</HI> and <HI>Walachia;</HI> on the West by <HI>Germany.</HI> This King∣dom is of a round Figure, two thousand six hundred Miles in compass. The Earth plain, but full of Woods; which do in some degree rectifie the Cold∣ness of the Air. They have no Wine; as for Bar∣ley and Pulse, they have more than they spend. The People are Industrious and Learned; good Souldi∣ers, proud and prodigal. The Christian Faith was first settled in <HI>Poland,</HI> under <HI>Miceslaus,</HI> in the year 963. by one <HI>Meinardus.</HI> The Reformation about 1535. crept into these Countries; but never general∣ly imbraced, nor persecuted. The <HI>Greek</HI> Church has some footing here too; but the most general, is the <HI>Roman Catholick.</HI> This vast Kingdom is divided in∣to thirty four Palatinates, most of which I shall men∣tion in their proper places. The principal Cities are <HI>Belzko, Braclaw, Braslaw, Briescie, Kaliss, Kami∣niec, Chelmo, Krakow, Elbing, Dantzick, Gnesna, Kiow, Lenzycze, Lwow, Lublin, Lucko, Malbork, Mscislawau, Minsko, Novogrod, Plocko, Pozan, Prze∣misl, Konigsberg, Sendomiers, Siracz, Thorn, Trocko, Warzawa,</HI> (commonly called <HI>Warsaw,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Poland</HI>), <HI>Wilna, Witebsko,</HI> and <HI>Wlodzimiers.</HI> The first Duke of this Kingdom was <HI>Lechus,</HI> who began his Reign in 694. His Posterity in eleven De∣scents continued till 800. when <HI>Priastus</HI> was the first elected Duke. In the year 1000. <HI>Boleslaus</HI> (Son of <HI>Mieceslaus</HI>) received the Title of King, from <HI>Otho</HI> III. Emperour of <HI>Germany.</HI> The present King is the forty sixth Prince, and the thirty second King of <HI>Poland;</HI> who has had the Honour to be the Preserver of <HI>Christendom</HI> by the Relief of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and many other brave Actions. Though this Prince has the Name of a King, and the first Dukes were in truth Kings without the Title; yet at present he is nothing less: being not allowed to make Peace or War, to impose Taxes, make Laws, alienate any of his Demeans; or in short, to do any thing of Impor∣tance, which concerns the Publick, without the con∣sent of the Diet. He does not only swear to do all this; but allows their Disobedience, in case he vio∣lates his Oath: which makes the Subjects the Princes Judges, and this Kingdom a meer Aristocracy; or knot of petty Kingdoms under one Head. Whence the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Muscovites</HI> have reaped great advan∣tages; and the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> once, with forty thousand men, reduced this Country to the last extre∣mity, which otherwise accounts two hundred thousand men a small Army to be sent into the Field by <HI>Poland. Socinianism</HI> hath been a prevailing Sect here: it oweth its denomination to the two <HI>Socinus</HI>'s (<HI>Lae∣lius</HI> and <HI>Faustus,</HI>) Natives of this Kingdom: who in the last Century, amidst the distractions of people about <HI>Religion,</HI> revived the ancient assertions of <HI>A∣rius, Nestorius,</HI> &amp;c. called <HI>Heresies,</HI> under their own Names.

pleasure: at this day a great, populous, fine City: in which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have built a Cittadel. There are very many <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquitios, and natural Rarities in it, not easily to be found elsewhere: Some Remains particularly of <HI>Caligula</HI>'s Bridge, of three thousand nine hundred Paces, over the <HI>Gulph,</HI> reaching from <HI>Pozzuoli</HI> to <HI>Bajae;</HI> which he proudly passed and re∣passed in triumph.

This City is divided into three parts; the <HI>Old,</HI> the <HI>New,</HI> and the <HI>Little</HI> City. The <HI>Old</HI> lies on the East of the <HI>Muldau;</HI> very populous, full of Buildings; and in this the University was founded by the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> IV. about the year 1370. 2. The <HI>New</HI> is very large; se∣parated from the former by a large Ditch or Trench. 3. The <HI>Klein Seitten,</HI> or <HI>Lesser Prague,</HI> for plea∣santness, beauty of Buildings, and fair Palaces, far ex∣ceeds the other two: this lies on the West of the <HI>Muldau:</HI> in this is the Royal Palace, the Cathedral Church (dedicated to S. <HI>Veit</HI>) built by S. <HI>Wenceslaus</HI> Duke of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> in 923. The Circuit of the City is very great: there are many Hills and void spaces in it; yet it is more populous than <HI>Florence,</HI> and the Streets larger. Dr. <HI>Brown</HI> in his Travels, has given an exact account of it. It seems to be a Place of great Antiquity; and to be the <HI>Marobudum</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy. John</HI> King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> took it from <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Carinthia,</HI> in 1311. The Inhabitants imprisoned <HI>Winceslaus</HI> their King in 1392. <HI>George Podiebrach,</HI> the Revenger of the Perfidy of the Coun∣cil of <HI>Constance,</HI> took it in 1441. The University was opened here by <HI>Charles</HI> IV. Emperour of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> in 1370. which has had above forty thousand Students at once in it; especially in the time of <HI>John Hus,</HI> about 1409. (whose Doctrines were condemned in a Council, assembled by the Archbishop of <HI>Prague</HI> here in 1405. according to the <HI>German Writers.</HI>) But it is most famous for the Defeat of the Protestant Forces near its Walls, <HI>Novemb.</HI> 8. 1620. by <HI>Maxi∣milian</HI> Duke of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> which was after severely re∣venged in the <HI>Swedish</HI> Wars. And in this City <HI>May</HI> 26. 1635. a Peace was made between the Emperour and his Protestant Subjects. It lies fifteen <HI>German</HI> Miles from <HI>Budweiss</HI> to the North, eighteen from <HI>Dresden,</HI> and thirty eight from <HI>Vienna</HI> to the North-East.

<P><HI>Rhoa, <HI>Edessa,</HI></HI> a City of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> menti∣oned by all the ancient Geographers; famous for the Story of King <HI>Abgarus:</HI> very great, and an Archbishops See, under the Patriarch of <HI>Antioch.</HI> It has had anciently many other Names; at this day it is the Capital of <HI>Diarbeck,</HI> (or <HI>Mesopotamia</HI>) under the <HI>Turk.</HI> It stands in the middle between <HI>Aleppo</HI> to the West, and <HI>Amida</HI> to the East. In the times of the Holy War it had Counts; but falling into the Hands of the <HI>Mahometans</HI> again, they have reduced it into the State in which it now is. Thus described by Mr. <HI>Thevenot,</HI> who saw it. <HI>This City is about two hours march in circuit; the Walls are fair; and pretty entire, and form a Square; within there is hardly any thing but Ruins to be seen, and yet it is very populous: on the South Side is a Castle upon an Hill, with large and deep Ditches, tho they are cut in the Rock: this Castle is of a large circumference; has little within it, but Ruins; and some pitiful old broken Guns.</HI> Long. 72 30 Lat. 37. 30.</P>
<P><HI>Rhodes, <HI>Rhodus,</HI></HI> a celebrated Island in the <HI>Medi∣terranean</HI> Sea; upon the Coast of the <HI>Lesser Asia,</HI> near its South-West Point; over against <HI>Caria:</HI> ha∣ving <HI>Cyprus</HI> to the East, <HI>Egypt</HI> to the South, and <HI>Candia</HI> to the West. Of old it had very many names; and is now called by the most remarkable of them. About an hundred and thirty Miles in compass; or as others say, an hundred and ten. The principal Place in it is <HI>Rhodes:</HI> an Archbishop's See; seated upon an insensible Ascent of a Hill, near the North-East part of the Island; and environed with divers other little Hills, full of Springs and Fruits: it sprung out of the Ruins of <HI>Jalissi,</HI> an ancient City near it. It has a delicate Harbor to the East and North; form'd by two strong <HI>Moles</HI> approaching each other demi∣circularly, so as to leave a Passage betwixt them for no more than a single Vessel: and of old much fa∣med for a vast Coloss, (or Statue of Brass of the <HI>Sun</HI>) made by <HI>Chares,</HI> a <HI>Lydian,</HI> a Scholar of <HI>Lysippus</HI> of <HI>Sicyon;</HI> seventy Cubits high: which stood a-stride over the Mouth of this Harbor, upon two Rocks; so that the Ships failed between his Legs; and this was then thought one of the seven Wonders of the World. The Brass of this Statue in 654, (one thou∣sand four hundred and sixty one years after it was built), when <HI>Muhavia</HI> the <HI>Saracen</HI> Sultan of <HI>Egypt</HI> had conquered the Island, was carried to <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> by the <HI>Saracens,</HI> upon the backs of se∣venty two Camels: having, it is said, been thrown down in an Earthquake: which verifies the Predi∣ction of the <HI>Oracle</HI> long before, That <HI>Rhodes</HI> should be lost, when that <HI>Colossus</HI> broke. This Island is seated twenty Miles from the nearest Coast of <HI>Asia</HI> to the South; one hundred and thirty four from <HI>Crete</HI> or <HI>Candy</HI> to the North-East; and five hundred from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to the South: of a most fertile Soil, and so serene and pleasant an Air, that as the Ancients dedicated both it and the <HI>Colossus</HI> to the <HI>Sun,</HI> because not a day passes without the full displaying of his beams here; so many of the chief <HI>Romans</HI> chose it for the place of their Retreat. First peopled by <HI>Do∣danim,</HI> the Son of <HI>Javan</HI> (Grandchild of <HI>Japhet</HI>), before he peopled <HI>Greece.</HI> After these, the Empire of this Island passed to the <HI>Phaenicians;</HI> who made the Inhabitants so very expert in Navigation, that for some Ages they gave Law to the World, and were Sovereigns of the Sea: their Constitutions and Judg∣ments in Affairs concerning the Sea being withal so just, as to become incorporated afterwards into the <HI>Roman Pandects.</HI> Their fear of the <HI>Macedonians</HI> made them sue to the <HI>Romans</HI> for Protection; whom they served very effectually to the Ruin of the for∣mer: after which they helped on the Ruin of <HI>Antio∣chus;</HI> and withstood the flattering Fortune of <HI>Mi∣thridates</HI> King of <HI>Pontus,</HI> till at last the <HI>Roman</HI> Greatness became undisputable by this small Island; and under <HI>Vespasian</HI> they were made a <HI>Roman</HI> Pro∣vince. It continued under the <HI>Greek</HI> Empire, (to which it fell in the Division) till 652: when it was conquered by <HI>Muhavia,</HI> the <HI>Saracen</HI> Sultan of <HI>Egypt.</HI> It returned under the <HI>Greeks</HI> again during the Civil Wars of the <HI>Saracens;</HI> and in 1124. was taken by the <HI>Venetians.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> recovered it under <HI>John Ducas,</HI> about 1227. About 1283. it fell together with the <HI>Lesser Asia,</HI> under the <HI>Turks.</HI> In 1310. the Knights of S. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> (when <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and all the <HI>Holy Land</HI> was lost from the Christians) retook it, after a Siege of four years under <HI>Fulk Villares,</HI> Great Master of that Order. The <HI>Turks,</HI> 'ere it could be re-fortified, again besieged it: in which Conjuncture, <HI>Amadaeus</HI> IV. Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> bravely succoured it; and to eternalize the Memory of his Victory, changed the <HI>Eagles,</HI> the Arms of his Predecessors; into the <HI>Silver Cross</HI> of the Order of the <HI>Knights;</HI> with these four Letters <HI>F. E. R. T.</HI> to signifie, <HI>Fortitudo Ejus Rhodum Tenuit.</HI> After this it was one of the Bulwarks of Christendom against the <HI>Turks. Mahomet</HI> II. the Great, attempted the Reduction of it in 1457. Again in 1480, with 100000 Men, and the greatest Art and Obstinacy ima¦ginable for 3 Months, but without Success: in comme∣moration whereof, <HI>Peter d'Aubusson,</HI> the then Grand Master, built the Church of S. <HI>Maria della Victoria;</HI> with a Chappel to the Honour of S. <HI>Pantaleon</HI> here;
<PB N="339" REF="181"/>
it being upon his day that the <HI>Turks</HI> in their last As∣sault were defeated. Nor had <HI>Solyman</HI> II. the Magnifi∣cent, had any better Success in 1522; if he had not met one <HI>Andrea Amarato</HI> a discontented Traitor, a <HI>Portuguese;</HI> (discontented at the Elevation of another to the dignity of <HI>Grand Master</HI> before him) within the place; who was Chancellor of the Order, and betray∣ed their Counsels to that Prince: who yet spent six Months before it, and lost an infinite number of Men. And <HI>Amarato,</HI> his Treason being (before the Surrender) discovered, had his Head cut off on <HI>Oct.</HI> 30. Mr. <HI>Knolls</HI> in his <HI>Turkish</HI> History, p. 391, has well described the Situation of the principal City in this Island. <HI>Bellonius</HI> saith, it was seated in a Plain; fenced with double Walls, thirteen Towers, and five Bastions; of great Strength and Beauty. The <HI>Turks</HI> have to this day so great a Veneration for the Valor of those Knights of S. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> that they preserve (saith he) their Houses as they left them; with all the Arms, Paintings, Statues and In∣scriptions; and the Walls of the City are put into the same state they were before the Siege. From hence these Knights passed to <HI>Sicily;</HI> and in 1530. obtain∣ed from <HI>Charles</HI> V. the Isle of <HI>Malta.</HI> Two small Bays accompany the Harbour on the North and South sides. The former is lock'd up by a <HI>Mole,</HI> which enters into the Sea above 300 Paces; bearing a Fort, called <HI>The Tower of S. Nicholas;</HI> built by the <HI>Order</HI> in 1464, and worthy of remembrance, for its withstanding the repeated furious Assaults of the <HI>Turks</HI> in the Siege in 1480. Long. 58. 00.

<P><HI>Romans, <HI>Romantium, Romanis,</HI></HI> a spruce fine City in <HI>Dauphine</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> seated in a pleasant Plain upon the River <HI>Iseure;</HI> over which it has a Bridge; four Leagues from <HI>Valence</HI> to the South-East, toward <HI>Grenoble</HI> ten Miles, and the same distance from <HI>Vi∣enne</HI> to the South. It is thought to represent <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI> in its Situation and Figure; insomuch that in 1520. there was a Building added to it, made in the fashion of the <HI>Holy Sepulchre</HI> that stands upon <HI>Mount Calvary; Francis</HI> I.

<PB N="344" REF="185"/>
King, called it <HI>Gothia;</HI> and other Princes the like: But the Name of <HI>Rome</HI> still has been always preserved by it. This City is seated upon the <HI>Tyber;</HI> twelve Miles above its fall into the <HI>Tyrrhenian Sea</HI> to the North-East; one hundred and twenty from <HI>Na∣ples</HI> to the North; three hundred from <HI>Genoua</HI> to South; one hundred thirty five from <HI>Ancona,</HI> and one hundred and forty from <HI>Florence.</HI> Long. 36. 30. Lat. 40. 40. Though there are great Controversies concerning the Time and the Founder of it, yet the most received opinion is, that it was built by <HI>Romu∣lus</HI> and <HI>Remus;</HI> in the first year of the seventh <HI>O∣lympiad, Anno Mundi</HI> 3198. seven hundred and fifty years before the Birth of our Saviour. Its Foundati∣ons were small and obscure; and not above two Miles in compass; with four Gates, inclosing only the <HI>Capitoline</HI> and <HI>Palatine</HI> Mountains. It continued under seven Princes two hundred forty five years: when <HI>Sextus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Tarquinius,</HI> ravishing <HI>Lucretia</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Lady, it so incensed them, that thereupon they not only dethroned <HI>Tarquinius;</HI> but for many Ages they would not endure the Name, much less the Au∣thority of a King; but lived under Temporary ac∣countable Magistrates, <HI>Consuls;</HI> two together, yearly e∣lected; with <HI>Praetors, Tribunes, Quaestors, Censors, Praefects,</HI> and other Magistrates under them. And when extream necessity required it, they created a temporary <HI>Dictator</HI> with Supreme Authority over all. At this time their Empire was not above fifteen Miles in length: and this Change greatly hazarded the Ruin of the Insant City. In the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 365. (during the <HI>Consular</HI> Government), it was ta∣ken by <HI>Brennus</HI> King or General of the <HI>Gaules;</HI> and all but the <HI>Capitol</HI> burnt down to the ground: yet it continued a Free State, though sorely shaken by <HI>Hannibal</HI> about the year five hundred thirty se∣ven; and by their own Domestick Broils under <HI>Ma∣rius</HI> and <HI>Sylla,</HI> between the years 665. and 672. But, the fatal time being come, <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> (in the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 705.) by the Battel of <HI>Pharsalia,</HI> put an end to that Commonwealth, forty six years before the Birth of our Saviour: making himself to be de∣clared <HI>Perpetual Dictator</HI> and <HI>Emperour;</HI> and the Name of the <HI>Commonwealth</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> to be changed into, the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> And though the Civil Wars broke out again to the great hazard, not only of their Empire, but Being; yet <HI>Augustus,</HI> in the Battel of <HI>Actium,</HI> put a happy Period to them, in 721. and prepared the World to receive the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> by an Universal Peace. He was born under this Prince in the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 753. and of the World 3950. The times that followed were fatal to <HI>Rome;</HI> which double dyed her Purple in the Blood of Holy Men, who endeavoured to reduce her from the Vassalage of <HI>Doemons</HI> to the Knowledge and Service of the True God. To these an end was put by <HI>Conslantine the Great,</HI> by the Defeat of <HI>Maxentius</HI> under the Walls of <HI>Rome,</HI> in the year of Christ, 312. of <HI>Rome</HI> 1064. This great Prince laid soon after the founda∣tion of the Ruin of <HI>Rome,</HI> by removing the Seat of the Empire to <HI>Byzantium</HI> or <HI>Constantinople,</HI> in the year of Christ 330. which afterwards brought on the Division of the Empire, into the <HI>Eastern</HI> and <HI>Western. Alaricus</HI> King of the <HI>Goths</HI> in 410. (of <HI>Rome</HI> 1162.) took and spoiled this City. <HI>Gensericus,</HI> the <HI>Vandal,</HI> followed him; and in 455. took it the second time. <HI>Odoacer</HI> took it in 465. <HI>Ricimere</HI> in 472. <HI>Totila</HI> in 547. So that in the space of one hundred thirty seven years, it was taken and spoiled by these Barba∣rous Nations four times. In 580. it was besieged by the <HI>Lombards;</HI> and preserved by the Emperours Forces, which were sent to relieve it. <HI>Leo</HI> IV. in 593. bestowed something in the repair of it. <HI>Rome</HI> was now recovered by the Eastern Emperours. <HI>Ju∣stinian</HI> by <HI>Narses</HI> his General in <HI>Italy,</HI> having slain <HI>Totila</HI> in 553. and three years after, by the taking of <HI>Capua,</HI> having put an happy end to the <HI>Gothick</HI> War in <HI>Italy.</HI> This City continued under those Princes, till 726. when under <HI>Gregory</HI> II. <HI>Italy</HI> (by the pro∣curement of that Pope) revolted, because <HI>Leo</HI> the Emperour had by an Edict prohibited the Worship of Images. The <HI>Lombards</HI> were very instrumental in this Change. Neither could they and the Popes long agree: but <HI>Aistulphus</HI> in 753. besieged <HI>Rome;</HI> and Pope <HI>Stephen</HI> III. (obtaining no relief from the Emperour against the <HI>Lombards</HI>) sends for <HI>Pepin</HI> King of <HI>France;</HI> who came and delivered him for that time. <HI>Desiderius</HI> the next King of the <HI>Lombards</HI> got <HI>Rome</HI> by a Stratagem in 770. and using his Power tyrannically, <HI>Charles the Great</HI> (in 774.) was called in; who put an end to the Kingdom of the <HI>Lombards,</HI> and made the Western Empire once more considerable. The <HI>Lombards</HI> and these <HI>French</HI> Princes in order to oblige the Popes by the Ties of Gratitude to them, had at several times bestowed several Territories upon the See of <HI>Rome. Charles the Great</HI> reserved to him∣self and his Successors the Approbation of the future Popes; which was confirmed by a Council held at <HI>Rome,</HI> in 773. This in after-times embroiled the Popes and the Western Emperours, as much as ever the <HI>Eastern</HI> and the <HI>Lombards</HI> were. For <HI>Charles the Great</HI> being crowned at <HI>Rome</HI> in 800. his Posterity had frequent quarrels with the Popes, (the Clergy and City of <HI>Rome</HI>) about the Elections of the Popes. The first Invasion was made by <HI>Stephen</HI> VI. about 817. under <HI>Lewis the Gentle;</HI> who is pretended to have granted away that Right of electing the Pope, which had been acknowledged in <HI>Charles the Great.</HI> In 819. <HI>Paschal</HI> I. a <HI>Roman,</HI> was chosen Pope against the Will of this Prince. But in 823. <HI>Lothaire</HI> co∣ming to <HI>Rome</HI> to receive the Crown, put this Pope to purge himself by Oath; and slew many of the Nobility, for setting him up against the Emperours Will: for which that See bore him no kindness. <HI>Gregory</HI> IV. in 833. finding <HI>Pepin</HI> his Son in rebellion against him, and pretending to reconcile them, when he came into <HI>Germany,</HI> he took part with his Son against the Father; and Pope-like, threatned to ex∣communicate the Emperour, if he did not resign the Empire to his Son: which Treachery of his, in 839: was severely revenged by <HI>Lothaire</HI> the Emperour, by taking many Places from him in <HI>Italy.</HI> In 839. the <HI>Saracens</HI> sorely distressed the Papacy; which necessi∣tated the Pope to have recourse to the Emperour for Protection, and he had it: In this Invasion, the <HI>Saracens</HI> wasted the Suburbs of <HI>Rome,</HI> as they did in 846. which occasioned the building of the Castle of S. <HI>Angelo</HI> by Pope <HI>Sergius</HI> II. The Empire being translated from the <HI>Franks</HI> to the <HI>Germans,</HI> in the Person of <HI>Ar∣nulph</HI> (a Natural Son of <HI>Carloman;</HI>) against him <HI>Formosus</HI> crowns <HI>Guido</HI> a Rival, in 891. And in 893. sendeth for <HI>Arnulph</HI> to come and free <HI>Rome</HI> from the oppressions of this <HI>Guido. Arnulph</HI> comes into <HI>Italy,</HI> and in 906. took <HI>Rome.</HI> A Schism being about this time in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> there was little done by the Popes, till <HI>Berengarius</HI> (growing Potent in <HI>Italy</HI>) necessitated them to seek to <HI>Otho</HI> I. who being crowned at <HI>Rome,</HI> in 962. a Council there held in 964. acknowledged the same Right in him, that had been in <HI>Charles the Great. Gregory</HI> VII. on this account begins a quarrel with <HI>Henry</HI> IV. Empe∣rour; sets up Anti-Emperours, and excommunicates the Emperour, in 1076. whereupon that Prince thus provoked, besieged <HI>Rome</HI> in 1081. took it in 1084. and burnt it: and soon after, this Turbulent Pope died in Banishment in great misery. In 1242. Pope

<HI>Gregory</HI> IX. (having excommunicated <HI>Frederick</HI> II. Emperour, for refusing to give the See of <HI>Sardinia</HI> to <HI>Rome;</HI>) and proclaiming a <HI>Croysade</HI> against the Emperour; that Prince defeated his Army: and fol∣lowing his blow, took <HI>Ravenna, Siena,</HI> and <HI>Faenza</HI> (with divers of the Cardinals,) and reduced the See of <HI>Rome</HI> to a mean condition. <HI>Innocent</HI> IV. insolent∣ly renews the Excommunication against the Empe∣rour in 1242. Whereupon arose the famous Facti∣ons of the <HI>Guelphs</HI> for the Pope, and the <HI>Gibelines</HI> for the Emperour; which made <HI>Italy</HI> extremely mi∣serable for some Ages. During part of which times, in 1305. Pope <HI>Clement</HI> V. removed the See to <HI>Avig∣non</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> where it continued to 1376. upon which arose a Schism between the Popes of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Avignon;</HI> not ended, till the Council of <HI>Constance;</HI> which begun in 1414. In 1408. <HI>Ladislaus</HI> King of <HI>Naples</HI> took <HI>Rome,</HI> and laid its Walls in the dust. In 1494. <HI>Charles</HI> VIII. of <HI>France</HI> took <HI>Rome.</HI> In 1526. Cardinal <HI>Pompeius Columna;</HI> and in 1527. the Forces of <HI>Charles</HI> V. took and sacked <HI>Rome. Philip</HI> II. besieged it, and had certainly taken it, if the Pope had not complyed about 1557. Yet after all these Changes and Calamities, this City at this day is said to be fifteen Miles in compass; very populous; and full of magnificent Buildings, as well Ancient as Modern. They reckon in it above three hundred thousand Souls: besides eight thousand <HI>Jews,</HI> who are enclosed in a particular quarter by themselves; and obliged every <HI>Saturday</HI> to hear a <HI>Christian</HI> Sermon. Houses and Palaces twenty two thousand; Parishes ninety two: forty one National Churches; sixty four Religious Houses for Men; above forty for Women; thirty Hospitals; one hundred and six Societies of <HI>Pe∣nitents;</HI> and divers Colleges. It hath eighteen Gates; three hundred and sixty Towers flanking the Walls; six Bridges over the <HI>Tiber;</HI> three principal Fountains; and eight <HI>Obelisks</HI> remaining out of about forty five, it formerly had, rehearsed in the Writings of <HI>Anti∣quaries.</HI> The Church of S. <HI>Peter,</HI> (in which the Body of that <HI>Apostle</HI> is deposited) built within and without of Marble, in the Figure of a Cross; near one hun∣dred <HI>Toises</HI> long, sixty six broad in the Branches; with a <HI>Dome</HI> fifty five <HI>Toises</HI> high, a <HI>Portail</HI> twenty four, erected in 1612. by Pope <HI>Paul</HI> V. to a <HI>Portico</HI> of the same largness; together with all its Riches, Paintings, Columns, Statues, Altars and Galleries; sur∣passes the greatest Idea that the mind can well form of Beauty and Grandeur. Then the <HI>Library</HI> in the <HI>Vatican</HI> Palace obtains the pre-eminence of all other Li∣braries in the World. Anciently this City Walls were 50 Miles in compass; with seven hundred and forty Towers in them; and thirty Gates, leading to, and de∣nominating as many broad High-ways, which were paved and adorned with wonderful Magnificence: where the <HI>Rests</HI> of <HI>Tombs</HI> yet appear; it being by the Law of the <HI>Twelve Tables (in Ʋrbe ne sepe∣lito, neve urito)</HI> forbidden to <HI>bury</HI> in the City. It had anciently eight Bridges; of which <HI>Pons Sublicius</HI> built by the King <HI>Ancus Marcius,</HI> and repaired by <HI>Aemilius Lepidus,</HI> where <HI>Horatius C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cles</HI> sustained the Effort of the <HI>Thuscanes</HI> who would have re-esta∣blished the deposed <HI>Tarquinius</HI> upon the Throne; and where afterwards the Emperour <HI>Heliogabalus</HI> was precipitated into the <HI>Tiber,</HI> is ruined. But <HI>Pons Mil∣vius,</HI> without the City, is no less remarkable, for the Victory there obtained by <HI>Constantine the Great</HI> over <HI>Maxentius,</HI> and the drowning of that Tyrant in the <HI>Tiber</HI> also. It had anciently eighteen Fountains; eight hundred Baths; an unknown number of Sta∣tues, Columns, Colossusses, Obelisks; (the Columns of <HI>Trajan</HI> and <HI>Antoninus</HI> are still standing;) and Temples for no less than thirty thousand <HI>Gods,</HI> by the accounts that <HI>Varro</HI> and others make of the <HI>Gods of the Ro∣mans.</HI> The <HI>Censors</HI> have sometimes <HI>sold</HI> the <HI>Com∣mon Sink</HI> to Gardiners for six hundred thousand Crowns. The number of Inhabitants in <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s time was computed to sixteen hundred thousand, two hundred ninety and one: In <HI>Augustus</HI>'s, much more. Their Army, under the <HI>Emperours,</HI> ordinarily con∣sisted of two hundred thousand Foot, and forty thou∣sand Horse: their Fleets, of fifteen hundred Galleys, and two thousand Ships. There were one hundred and sixty Granaries in their Empire: And in fine the <HI>Empire it self</HI> had for its Bounds to the East, <HI>Eu∣phrates,</HI> the Mountain <HI>Taurus,</HI> and <HI>Armenia;</HI> to the South, <HI>Aethiopia;</HI> to the North, the <HI>Danube;</HI> and to the West, the <HI>Atlantick Ocean.</HI> For the <HI>Coun∣cils</HI> that have been celebrated here since <HI>Christianity,</HI> by Popes and Anti-Popes against one another, against the Schismaticks and Hereticks (so called) of all Ages, and against Emperours and Princes, or the Abuses committed and occasioned by them and any of them; it is not for this place to rehearse so vast a number: Themselves have sometimes proved the greatest Abuse.

<P><HI>Rugen, <HI>Rugenlandt, Rugia,</HI></HI> an Island in the <HI>Bal∣tick</HI> Sea, upon the Coast of <HI>Pomerania;</HI> which has the Title of a Principality; about seven <HI>German</HI> Miles square; but the Sea breaks in and covers a considera∣ble part of the middle of it from the West, and al∣most divides it into several Islands. This was caused by an Outragious Tempest in 1309. A part of this Island at the same time, which lay to the South-East as far as the Isle of <HI>Ruden</HI> (then conjoyned with this,) was torn away; and sunk so deep into the bottom of the Sea, that the greatest Ships may Sail over it: what remains, affords Corn and Cattle in great plenty; serv∣ing as a granary to the parts adjacent. The best Town in it is <HI>Bergen:</HI> the others of note are <HI>Sogart, Hick,</HI> and <HI>Bingst.</HI> This Island is able to Arm about seven thousand Men in case of necessity.

So that it is by far the greatest Kingdom in Christendom; if it were equally Civiliz'd, Fertil, and Peopled, as it is not. For the dispatch of Business and the Management of Affairs, it is divided into forty Provinces; the names of which, (and of about thirty three Cities, that are to be found in it) would take more room than this small Work will allow. This Nation in 861. made an Invasion into <HI>Greece;</HI> and besieged <HI>Michael</HI> the Emperor in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but could not take it. The Captives they carried home with them, and made them partakers of a greater bles∣sing by teaching them the Christian Religion; which was after this in 866. promoted by <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius</HI> the Em∣peror. In 944. they made a second attempt upon <HI>Constantinople,</HI> which miscarried also. In 980. <HI>Ʋio∣domir</HI> Duke of <HI>Russia,</HI> (Marrying <HI>Anna</HI> Daughter to <HI>Basilius</HI> Emperor of <HI>Greece,</HI>) embraced the Christian Religion, and settled it intirely in this Country: from whence it comes to pass, that they embrace the Te∣nets, Rites, and Ceremonies of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church; and have the utmost Aversion for the Latin Church and Service. About 1058. <HI>Boleslaus</HI> King of <HI>Poland</HI> Conquered <HI>Russia;</HI> which was reduced to obedience after a Revolt by another <HI>Boleslaus</HI> in 1123. In after∣times they had frequent Wars with the <HI>Poles;</HI> who prevailed so far as about 1342 they intirely Conquer∣ed the red <HI>Russia;</HI> the Nobility of which, (in 1434) were received into the same state with the Nobility of <HI>Poland;</HI> allowing them at the same time the Ex∣ercise of the <HI>Greek</HI> Religion, which they from their first Conversion to this day follow. They are as well by Interest as Conquest united to that Crown; and never to be separated from it, but by another Con∣quest. About 1205. the black <HI>Russia</HI> (now called <HI>Muscovy</HI>) was Invaded by <HI>Batton</HI> Son of <HI>Ghangius</HI> King of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who lived to the North-East of this Country: they oppressed this Nation for many Ages, and so harrassed them, that no account can be given of the times, when the Reigns of their Princes
<PB N="349" REF="187"/>
began or ended. <HI>John</HI> XI. was the first who began to enfranchise these Countries from the Servitude of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> which they had so long groaned under. <HI>John Basilovitz</HI> the <HI>4th.</HI> of this Race (who began his Reign very young) in 1540. ended it by the Conquest of the <HI>Tartars</HI> and all the petty Princes, which had till then reigned in several parts of this Empire. This was the cruellest Tyrant that any Age has produced; and died as wretchedly as he lived, in 1584. <HI>Foedor Juanovits</HI> his Son succeeded him at the Age of twen∣ty two years; he was a perfect natural Fool. There was another Brother called <HI>Demetrius</HI> of nine years of Age, which had more sense. But <HI>Boris</HI> (who ma∣naged all this under <HI>Foedor</HI>) caused <HI>Demetrius</HI> to be Murthered. In 1597. <HI>Foedor</HI> dying suddenly without Children, <HI>Boris</HI> was Elected; and soon after Deposed, in favour of a Counterfeit <HI>Demetrius</HI> brought in by the <HI>Poles:</HI> after which followed nothing but Calami∣ties and Confusions; till in 1615. (or as others say in 1612) one <HI>Michael Fedrovizt,</HI> Son of <HI>Foedor Nikitis</HI> (a Kinsman far removed, of <HI>John Basilovitz</HI>) was chosen by the Body of this Nation Emperor of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> This Prince settled this vast Empire; go∣verned it with more Justice, Clemency, Prudence and Piety than all his Predecessors had used; and at last died in great Honor <HI>July</HI> 12. 1645.

It is one of the most delightful Islands in the World; swelling in the midst into high Mountains, which afford upon the Descents several Stages, planted one above the other: the higher Plan∣tations enjoying the pleasure of the prospect of the lower.

This Island was discovered by <HI>Christopher Columbus,</HI> the finder out of the New World; and either called by this Name to preserve the Memory of his own, or because the Island at a distance seems to represent the usual Picture of S. <HI>Christopher</HI> upon a Giants Shoulders.

Hyrcanius</HI> the High Priest of the <HI>Jews</HI> about the year of the World 3941. took, and intirely ruined this City; which lay desolate, till <HI>Herod the Great</HI> rebuilt it about 4033. and called it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Honour of <HI>Augustus.</HI> The Temple of <HI>Samaria</HI> was standing in our Saviour's time, as appears in S. <HI>John</HI>'s Gospel: after our Saviour's Passion, this City received the Christian Faith, by the Preaching of <HI>Philip the Evangelist,</HI> about the year of Christ 35. <HI>Simon</HI> the Father of Heresie, was one of these new Converts, and the Founder of the <HI>Gnosticks.</HI> About 42. <HI>Herod Agrippa</HI> obtained this City as an Addition to his Kingdom from <HI>Caligula.</HI> In the first ruin of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, (under <HI>Vespasian</HI>) this Nation and City had no great share of the Calamity; because I suppose, they sided with the <HI>Romans</HI> in this first Revolution against the <HI>Jews.</HI> But in the second, un∣der <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperour, they acted otherwise; and about the year of Christ 135. were, together with the <HI>Jews,</HI> extirpated by the Arms of that Prince. This City has ever since lain buried in its Ruins; though there are some few remainders of the <HI>Samaritan</HI> Na∣tion to this day in <HI>Palestine</HI> and <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> where they keep their Synagogues and their ancient Sacri∣fices: Especially at <HI>Sichem,</HI> now called <HI>Naplouse,</HI> in <HI>Palestine;</HI> (the residence of their High Priest, who pretends to be of the Race of <HI>Aaron.</HI>) But following Laws and Rites, different from those of the <HI>Penta∣teuch,</HI> they have nevertheless the esteem of <HI>He∣reticks</HI> amongst the <HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Samaritans</HI> of Mount <HI>Gerizim</HI> were mortal enemies to the ancient <HI>Christians</HI> there, till the Emperour <HI>Justianian</HI> took and burnt their King <HI>Julian,</HI> and curbed them from time to time by very severe Edicts.

It is about eighty in compass. It has a City on the East side, which is a Bishops See under the Archbishop of <HI>Ephesus;</HI> so poor, that it will scarce find its Bishop Bread: yet is this Island so fruitful, that almost nothing can be planted, which the Earth will not bring to maturity. The Wines of it are excee∣ding pleasant; but for want of a Trade and encou∣ragement, the Inhabitants plant little more than they use. The Inhabitants were so powerful in ancient times, that they managed a prosperous War against the <HI>Ephesians;</HI> and afterwards against the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Milesians,</HI> about the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 313. and the eighty fourth <HI>Olympiad:</HI> till <HI>Pericles</HI> about the year of the World 3510. reduced them. Upon his depar∣ture, they reassumed their Liberty; and forced him to besiege their City nine Months before he could take it; to invent the <HI>Battering Ram,</HI> and several other Engines for that purpose; and even after this, they sustained some other Wars. Their greatest Glory was <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> the Father of Philosophy. <HI>Juno</HI> was their principal Patroness and Goddess, in whose honour there was a famous Temple erected by them. This Island once so powerful, rich and populous, is by the <HI>Turks</HI> (who are Masters of it) reduced to that mean and depopulated condition, that a few Pyrates dare land and plunder it as they please. So that ever since 1676. no <HI>Turk</HI> durst venture to live upon it, lest he should be carried into Captivity by these Rovers; as four of them were then by Monsieur <HI>Crevellier,</HI> a famous Privateer.</P>

<P><HI>Scotland, <HI>Scotia,</HI></HI> is the second Kingdom in <HI>Great Britain;</HI> called by the <HI>French, l' Escosse;</HI> by the <HI>Ita∣lians, Scotia;</HI> by the <HI>Germans, Schottlandt.</HI> On the East it is bounded by the <HI>German</HI> Ocean; on the North by the <HI>Deucalidonian</HI> Sea, and the Isles of <HI>Orkney;</HI> on the West by the <HI>Vergivian</HI> Ocean, and the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea; on the South by the River <HI>Tweed,</HI> the <HI>Cheviot</HI> Hills, and the adjacent Tract to <HI>Solway</HI> Sands; whereby it is separated from <HI>England. Sol∣way Fyrth</HI> lies in deg. 56. of Latitude; and the most Northern point lies in 60 30. by which it should be three hundred and fifteen <HI>English</HI> Miles in length. <HI>Po∣lydore Virgil</HI> reckons four hundred and eighty: its breadth is no where above sixty; and its form Trian∣gular; with many great Inlets and Arms of the Ocean, which indent both the Eastern and Western sides of it. The Soil especially towards the North, is gene∣rally barren; affords little Timber, and no Fruit Trees. The Southern parts are more fruitful; the Air in both sharp and cold. It is divided into two parts, (the Southern and the Northern) by <HI>Dunbri∣tain</HI> and <HI>Edenburgh Fyrth.</HI> The South part called the <HI>Low-Lands,</HI> is fuller of Cities and great Towns; the People are more rich and better civilized; as not only Inhabiting a better Country, but driving a Trade at Sea. The Northern or <HI>High-Lands,</HI> are more bar∣ren and poor; the Inhabitants accordingly patient of want and hunger, and very temperate in their Diet; without which Virtues they could not subsist. South <HI>Scotland</HI> is divided into twenty one; North <HI>Scotland</HI> into thirteen Counties. For the Ecclesiastical Govern∣ment they have two Archbishops: S. <HI>Andrews,</HI> who has eight; and <HI>Glascow,</HI> who has three Suffragan Bishops under him. In the times of the <HI>Romans,</HI> this Country was called <HI>Caledonia</HI> and <HI>Albania;</HI> the Peo∣ple, <HI>Picts,</HI> from their custom of Painting their Bo∣dies. The <HI>Romans</HI> never extended their Conquests beyond the South of <HI>Scotland,</HI> because they thought the Northern and barrener parts not worth their pains. The remaining Inhabitants, (after the withdrawing of the <HI>Roman</HI> Garrisons from the Northern parts of <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI>) became very troublesome to the <HI>Britains;</HI> and forced them to call in the <HI>Saxons</HI> about 449: who Conquered the South parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and possess it to this day. The <HI>Scots</HI> or <HI>Irish</HI> about the same time entered the Western parts of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and by degrees united first with the <HI>Picts</HI> or <HI>Highlanders;</HI> by their assistance Conquered the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and gained the Sovereignty of that whole Kingdom. But there be∣ing no Letters here, the Story of these times is very dark; which has occasioned great Controversies con∣cerning the time of the <HI>Scots</HI> coming out of <HI>Ireland.</HI> About 839 the <HI>Picts</HI> were intirely subdued by <HI>Ken∣neth</HI> II. first sole King of all <HI>Scotland.</HI> This Line continued under twenty three Princes, to 1285. When <HI>Alexander</HI> III. dying without Issue, there began a tedious and bloody contest about the Succession; which was referred to <HI>Edward</HI> I. of <HI>England,</HI> who adjudged the Crown to <HI>John Baliol,</HI> an <HI>Englishman.</HI> He Rebelling against his Benefactor, was defeated by that Prince; who following his blow made himself Master of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and kept it to his death. In 1307. <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> the other Competitor, overthrew the <HI>English;</HI> established himself King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Reigned till 1332: when the Kingdom divided again between <HI>Edward Baltol,</HI> and <HI>David Bruce;</HI> which latter prevailed at first against his Competitor; but fell under the power of the <HI>English,</HI> where he was many years a Prisoner. In 1371. <HI>Rob.</HI> II. Surnamed <HI>Steward,</HI> descended from the eldest Daughter of <HI>David Bruce,</HI> succeeded. In 1602. <HI>James</HI> VI. (the ninth in this Line;) succeeded after Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to the Crown of <HI>England;</HI> as Descended both by Fa∣ther and Mother, from <HI>Margaret</HI> the eldest Daughter of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. King of <HI>England;</HI> the whole Line of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. being extinguished. The Christian Reli∣gion was Planted here by different Persons, and at se∣veral times. The <HI>Saxon Scots</HI> were Converted by <HI>Ai∣dan,</HI> the first Bishop of <HI>Lindisferne,</HI> about 635. The South-Eastern by <HI>Nimas,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Candida Casa,</HI> (or <HI>White Herne</HI>) about 555.

The Harbor for∣merly was capable of receiving many and great Ves∣sels: but is now choaked with Sand to that degree, as to admit only of Skiffs; whilst Ships lye in the road behind the Rocks for Shelter. In the Christian times it was a Bishop's See under the Archbishop of <HI>Tyre.</HI> The <HI>Eutychians</HI> held Council here of twenty four Bishops, in 512, under the protection of the Emperour <HI>Ana∣stasius.</HI> In 1260, the <HI>Tartars</HI> became Masters of it:

<P><HI>Shrewsbury, <HI>Salopia,</HI></HI> the principal City in <HI>Shrop∣shire,</HI> is seated upon the <HI>Severne;</HI> on the top of an Hill of Red Earth, in the middle of that County. The River runs almost round the Town, and is covered by two lovely Bridges. <HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>VVilliam</HI> the Conqueror, built on the North side of it a strong Castle, which added much to its strength; he founded a stately Abbey in it, whose remains are extant still. It was then a very considera∣ble Place. Nor is it (after so many Ages) sunk in its Wealth, Riches, or People: but still a goodly City, and the Centre of the Trade between <HI>VVales</HI> and <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> Near this City, in 1463, was a sharp Battel fought between <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and <HI>Henry Percie</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> on the behalf of <HI>Edward Morti∣mer</HI> (Earl of <HI>March</HI>) as the right Heir of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> after <HI>Richard</HI> II.

The Air of it is gentle and healthful, the Soil rich and fruitful; abounding in Wheat, Barley, Pit-Coals, Iron and Wood. The <HI>Se∣verne</HI> (which is the second River of <HI>England</HI>) divides this County almost in the middle; receiving into it the <HI>Camlet,</HI> the <HI>Morda,</HI> the <HI>Mele,</HI> the <HI>Roddon,</HI> the <HI>Terne,</HI> the <HI>VVorse,</HI> and some others: on the South it has the <HI>Temde,</HI> which receives the <HI>Bradfield, Onke, Omey, Quenny, Stradbrook, Corve, Ledwich</HI> and <HI>Rea;</HI> all which, and some other Rivers, water and enrich the South part of this County; so that it may very well be one of the most fruitful and best peopled Counties in <HI>England.</HI> The Principal City is <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Siam,</HI> a City and Kingdom beyond the <HI>Ganges,</HI> in the <HI>Further East Indies.</HI> The Kingdom is boun∣ded on the North by the Kingdoms of <HI>Pegu</HI> and <HI>Ava;</HI> on the East, <HI>Cambaya, Lao, Jancoma</HI> and <HI>Tangu:</HI> on the South, the Bay of its own Name; and on the West by the Bay of <HI>Bengale:</HI> making by this form of its situation a Demicircle of about four hundred and fif∣ty Leagues. Some assign it a far greater extent, and bound it by <HI>Pegu</HI> and <HI>Lao</HI> on the North; the <HI>Chinian</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Oceans to the East and West; with the Kingdom of <HI>Malaca</HI> to the South: And this way it makes a great <HI>Peninsula.</HI> It is certain, the King of <HI>Siam</HI> keeps several other Kingdoms and Principalities tributary to him; and his Country being blessed with a good Air, a fertile Soil, Mines of Lead, Tin, Silver and Gold (tho of a base Alloy,) with store of Ivory; and being visited continually by Vessels from <HI>Japan, China, Cochinchina, Tonquin,</HI> the <HI>Sound</HI> and the <HI>Phi∣lippine</HI> Islands; from all parts of the <HI>Hither East Indies,</HI> and from <HI>Arabia, Persia,</HI> and the Kingdoms of <HI>Europe;</HI> it affords the enjoyment of every thing almost that is valuable. Whilst the Sun is in the Nor∣thern Signs, from <HI>March</HI> to <HI>September,</HI> the Fields are generally overflown by the Rivers, which much con∣tributes to the fertility of them: for the Ear of the Rice mounts above the height of the Waters. The King of <HI>Siam</HI> was Master heretofore of <HI>Malaca;</HI> see <HI>Malaca.</HI> Of late, himself became a Tributary to the King of <HI>Pegu;</HI> see <HI>Pegu.</HI> But he is very absolute o∣ver, and served with the profoundest Adoration by, his own Subjects. The <HI>English, French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> have each their Factories in this Kingdom. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Armenians, Moors</HI> and <HI>Chinese,</HI> settle here in great Numbers: being allowed dwellings in the City <HI>Siam,</HI> by a Favour not made common to all Nations. <HI>Siam,</HI> the City, stands in an Island that is formed by the River <HI>Menan:</HI> surpassing, in the richness of its Temples, most of the proudest Cities in the <HI>Indies;</HI> and its <HI>Pa∣lace Royal,</HI> where the King resides, built by the River side, is of an extent sufficient to denominate a City of it self. In 1634, the <HI>Dutch</HI> built themselves a House in <HI>Siam,</HI> which<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is one of the best, belonging to their Company in these <HI>Indies.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Sicily, <HI>Sicilia, Sicelia, Trinacria, Sicania, Tri∣quetra,</HI></HI> a very great Island in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, at the South West point of <HI>Italy.</HI> Thought by some Ancients to join originally with <HI>Italy,</HI> as part of the con∣tinent, and to have been separated from it by the stormy Powers of the Ocean. It lies in the form of a vast Tri∣angle (from whence some of its names are derived;) having three great Capes (<HI>Pelorum</HI>) now <HI>Faro,</HI> to the North-East towards <HI>Italy; Pachynus</HI> (now <HI>Passa∣ro</HI>) towards the <HI>Morea,</HI> and the South-East; and <HI>Lilybaeum</HI> (now <HI>Cape Coco</HI>) to the West. Threehun∣dred and eighty Miles from the <HI>Morea,</HI> one hundred from <HI>Africa,</HI> one hundred and seventy from <HI>Sardinia,</HI> and from <HI>Italy</HI> a Mile and a half. Its North side is two hundred fifty five Miles; its Southern one hundred and ninety; and the Western one hundred fifty five, as <HI>Cluverius</HI> saith, who measured the whole Island. It is now divided into three Counties, <HI>Val di Domoni</HI> to the North, <HI>Val di Noto</HI> to the South, and <HI>Val di Maza∣ra</HI> to the West. The ancient Cities of greatest power, were <HI>Syracusa</HI> (now <HI>Syragosa</HI>) <HI>Panormus, Palermo, Messina,</HI> and <HI>Messana;</HI> of which the two last re∣tain their former Dignity. The other Cities are <HI>Ger∣genti▪ Calatagirone, Catania, Cefalu, Trapano, Ma∣zara, Monreal, Noto, Patti, Sacca,</HI> and <HI>Terra Nova.</HI> It is wonderfully fruitful as to Corn and Wine; there∣fore called by <HI>Cato, The Granary of the Common-VVealth, and Nurse of the People of</HI> Rome. Abounds also with Cattle, Sheep, Honey, Wine and Oyl. In ancient times it had seventy three Free Cities: in the time of the second <HI>Punick</HI> War it had sixty six. We have only Fabulous accounts who were the first Inha∣bitants: but certainly the: <HI>Phoenicians</HI> have been here,

and were expelled by the <HI>Greeks;</HI> who not well agree∣ing amongst themselves, drew over the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> to their common ruine. The <HI>Romans</HI> followed not long after; and in the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 494, (two hun∣dred and fifty six years before the birth of our Saviour) made themselves Masters of it; it being the first Pro∣vince they possessed out of the Bounds of <HI>Italy.</HI> In the mean time <HI>Dionysius, Agathocles, Hiero,</HI> and <HI>Peri∣cles</HI> advanced themselves to an <HI>Absolute Tyranny</HI> here, by the use they made of their Victories. It continued under the <HI>Romans</HI> till the Reign of <HI>Justinian:</HI> then the <HI>Vandals</HI> under <HI>Gensericus,</HI> (in 439. and 440.) for some time became Masters of it, who were expelled by <HI>Bellisarius</HI> in 535. Having been miserably spoil∣ed by the Emperor <HI>Constans,</HI> in 669. it fell into the Hands of the <HI>Saracens;</HI> who plundered it, as they did several times after, and left it. <HI>Leandro Alberti</HI> faith, that in the Division of the Empire between <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, and <HI>Nicephorus</HI> Emperor of the East, (about 800.) <HI>Sicily, Calabria,</HI> and <HI>Apulia</HI> fell to the Emperor of <HI>Constantinople:</HI> and that it continued under them till the times of <HI>Nicephorus Thomas.</HI> However we find the <HI>Saracens</HI> (in 910.) after a great Naval Victory, became Masters of <HI>Cala∣bria, Apulia,</HI> and <HI>Sicily. Leandro</HI> placeth this in 914: and saith, the <HI>Greeks</HI> had part of <HI>Sicily</HI> still. In 1035. the <HI>Saracens</HI> were still possessed of part of <HI>Si∣cily:</HI> but as <HI>Leander</HI> saith, they and the <HI>Greeks</HI> too were expelled by the <HI>Normans,</HI> in the times of <HI>Mi∣chael Caliphates</HI> (who reigned but one year, about 1041. and 1042) by <HI>Gulielmus Ferebatus;</HI> [and not by <HI>Tancred,</HI> as say others.] To this <HI>William</HI> succeeded, (as Counts of <HI>Calabria</HI>) <HI>Roger</HI> I. by the Pope created King of <HI>Sicily;</HI> he having taken the Pope Prisoner in the year 1139, <HI>William</HI> II. <HI>Willi∣am</HI> III. and <HI>Tancred,</HI> a Bastard, opposed by Pope <HI>Ce∣lestine</HI> III: who preferred <HI>Costanza,</HI> (a Daughter of <HI>Roger</HI> II. an ancient Lady, a Nun) and married her to <HI>Henry,</HI> Son of <HI>Frederick Barbarossa,</HI> and made him King of <HI>Sicily;</HI> to whom succeeded <HI>Fre∣derick</HI> II. his Son. Then followed <HI>Manfredus,</HI> his Natural Son; but the Pope set up <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> against him in 1263. In 1281. upon <HI>Easter∣day,</HI> in time of <HI>Vespers,</HI> (whence the name came of the <HI>Sicilian Vespers</HI>) the <HI>French</HI> were all massacred by the <HI>Sicilians,</HI> by the Order of <HI>Peter</HI> III. King of <HI>Arragon,</HI> who had married the Daughter of <HI>Manfred.</HI> During this Interval, this Crown had been offered to <HI>Richard,</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwal;</HI> (Brother to <HI>Henry</HI> III. King of <HI>England</HI>) and he refused it. From thence∣forward it became inseparably united to the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> and has ever since had the same fate to this day, being governed by a Vice-Roy, who resides at <HI>Palermo</HI> the present capital City of it. <HI>Hoffman</HI> saith, the <HI>Saracens</HI> were possessed of <HI>Palermo;</HI> had their <HI>Admiral,</HI> (or General) there, from 827. to 1070: when they were finally expelled by the <HI>Nor∣mans,</HI> to whom Pope <HI>Nicolas</HI> granted this Island on that condition, in 1058. So that the <HI>Normans</HI> might perhaps expell the <HI>Greeks</HI> in 1042. and the <HI>Saracens</HI> in 1070. The Inhabitants forced the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the year 1647. to recall all their Taxes. This Island enjoyeth three Archbishops Sees, <HI>Palermo, Messina,</HI> and <HI>Monreale;</HI> about six or seven Bishops Sees, and one University, <HI>Catania.

Seated in the Borders of the Dukedom of <HI>Florence;</HI> thirty two Miles from that City to the South, and an hundred and seven from <HI>Rome</HI> to the North. This City; as <HI>Poly∣bius</HI> saith in his second Book, was built by the <HI>Gauls</HI> in the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 396. <HI>A. M.</HI> 3730. after the taking of <HI>Rome</HI> by <HI>Brennus,</HI> and from the <HI>Senones,</HI> (one of their tribes) took this Name. In the fall of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, it suffered very much from the Barbarous Nations; and is said to have been rebuilt by <HI>Charles Martel.</HI> The Inhabitants purchased their freedom of <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the Emperor, and managed the same with various succes∣ses till 1555: when it was taken by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and sold to the Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> in 1558. under whom it still is. In 1459. it was made an Archbishop's See under Pope <HI>Pius</HI> II. It was a flourishing University in 1386. but when founded is not known to me. Seve∣ral Popes (<HI>Alexander</HI> III. <HI>Pius</HI> II. <HI>Pius</HI> III. <HI>Alexan∣der</HI> VII.) and great Men have been Natives of this place: its greatest glory is S. <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Siena,</HI> a <HI>Domini∣can,</HI> who persuaded Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> IX. to leave <HI>Avig∣non.</HI> She died in 1380.

<P><HI>Spain, <HI>Hispania,</HI></HI> is one of the most considerable Kingdoms in <HI>Europe,</HI> called heretofore <HI>Hesperia</HI> and <HI>Iberia.</HI> It is separated from <HI>France</HI> towards the North-East by the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Hills; on all other sides surrounded by the <HI>Mediterranean Sea,</HI> the <HI>Streights of Gibraltar,</HI> and the <HI>Atlantick Ocean:</HI> so that it lies in the form of a vast <HI>Peninsula,</HI> joined to <HI>France</HI> by a Neck of eighty <HI>Spanish</HI> Leagues over. Called by the Natives <HI>La Espanna,</HI> by the <HI>French L'Espagne,</HI> by the <HI>Italians La Spagna,</HI> by the <HI>English <HI>Spain,</HI></HI> by the <HI>Poles <HI>Hispanska,</HI></HI> by the <HI>Germans <HI>Spanien,</HI></HI> and by the <HI>Dutch <HI>Spangien.</HI></HI> Its greatest length from East to West is one hundred and ninety <HI>German</HI> Miles; or five hundred <HI>Italian.</HI> Its circuit two thou∣sand four hundred and eighty <HI>Italian</HI> Miles; taking in the Creeks and Windings of the Seas and Moun∣tains, it is two thousand eight hundred and sixteen Miles; the least of which Computations, is four hun∣dred and sixty Miles greater than <HI>France</HI> was forty years agone. The ancient Geographers with one con∣sent affirm, <HI>That it abounded with whatsoever the Ambition or Needs of Men required; full of Men and Horses; all over replenished with Mines of Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron, and Lead, (white and black;) had Corn, Wine, and Oyl in abundance: in short, so extremely fruitful, that if any place for want of Water was less useful, yet even there Hemp and Flax thrived very well.</HI> It was in those days the <HI>West-Indies</HI> of the World, and like them the Store-House of the ancient Treasures. The Ancients divi∣ded it into three great parts; called by them <HI>Tarra∣conensis, Baetica,</HI> and <HI>Lusitania.</HI> First, <HI>Hispania Tarraconensis</HI> was the greatest of the three, and the most Eastern. On the East bounded by the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Hills; on the North by the Bay of <HI>Biscay;</HI> on the West by the <HI>Atlantick Ocean,</HI> and <HI>Lusitania;</HI> on the South by the <HI>Mediterranean Sea,</HI> and <HI>Baetica.</HI> Secondly, <HI>Hispania Baetica</HI> was the most Southern part; bounded on the East and South by the for∣mer in part, and by the Ocean; on the West and North by the same Ocean and <HI>Lusitania.</HI> Thirdly, <HI>Hi∣spania Lusitanica</HI> was the most Western part; exten∣ded upon the Ocean between <HI>Hispania Tarraconensis,</HI> and <HI>Hispania Baetica.</HI> The very ancient History of
<PB N="385" REF="207"/>
this Country is either fabulous or lost. The <HI>Phoeni∣cians</HI> may justly be supposed to have been the first Civilizers of it, and the Founders of the most ancient Cities, as <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> affirm. After these (who settled mostly in <HI>Baetica</HI>) the <HI>Grecians</HI> followed; who from <HI>Marseille</HI> sent many Colonies into <HI>Hispania Tarraconensis.</HI> The <HI>Carthaginians</HI> were the next; who about forty years after they were by the <HI>Romans</HI> dispossessed of <HI>Sicily, Sardinia,</HI> and <HI>Corsica,</HI> (in the end of the first <HI>Punick</HI> War about the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 512;) by the Isle of <HI>Gades</HI> (which was theirs before) entered <HI>Spain;</HI> and in less than twenty years (under <HI>Amilcar, Asdrubal</HI> and <HI>Hanni∣bal,</HI> the Son of <HI>Amilcar</HI>) destroyed <HI>Saguntum;</HI> built <HI>New Carthage;</HI> conquered all the Nations of this Country, as far the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Hills, and the <HI>Mediter∣ranean</HI> Sea; and might easily have subdued the rest; but that <HI>Hannibal</HI> chose rather to revenge the Injuries of his Country, and ruin <HI>Rome</HI> by an Invasion of <HI>Ita∣ly.</HI> The Jealousie of the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> ruined his Designs in <HI>Italy;</HI> and the <HI>Roman</HI> Fortunes prevailed in <HI>Spain</HI> too, under <HI>Cornelius Scipio,</HI> about the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 545. The People having been broken by the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> submitted the more willingly and easily to the <HI>Romans;</HI> and continued under them till about the year of Christ 400, when <HI>Gundericus</HI> (King of the <HI>Vandals</HI>) first conquered them. The <HI>Goths</HI> followed these; and in 418, set up a Kingdom; which in time extirpated the <HI>Vandals,</HI> or drove them over the Sea into <HI>Africa.</HI> This Kingdom continued under thirty one Princes, till 724; when the <HI>Moors</HI> came in, and after a Fight of seven Days continuance prevailed against the <HI>Goths,</HI> and forced <HI>Spain.</HI> They brought over fifty thousand Families of <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Jews;</HI> and so fixed themselves here, that though they were in a short time cantoned into a small Kingdom; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with the remainders of the <HI>Goths</HI> (who had secured themselves in the Mountains and other places of difficult access) by the help of the <HI>French,</HI> made a gainful and prevailing War upon them; yet they could not be intirely subdued before 1492▪ In after times it is hard to say, whether the good Fortunes or ill Government of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have contributed most to the ruin of this once most potent Kingdom. For first <HI>Ferdinando</HI> and <HI>Isabella</HI> in 1492, expelled out of <HI>Spain</HI> one hundred and seven∣ty thousand Families of the <HI>Jews. Philip</HI> II. in 1610. expelled nine hundred thousand <HI>Moors.</HI> And <HI>America</HI> being found in the mean time, the numbers of <HI>Spaniards</HI> that passed thither is unknown. <HI>Philip</HI> I. succeeded in 1504: The first Prince of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> who reigned in <HI>Spain. Charles</HI> V. his Son in 1516. <HI>Philip</HI> II. in 1556. <HI>Philip</HI> III. in 1598. <HI>Philip</HI> IV. in 1621. <HI>Charles</HI> II. the present King be∣gan his Reign in <HI>September</HI> 1665, being then an In∣fant. This Kingdom is now divided into fifteen Kingdoms or Provinces, <HI>viz. 1. Navarre. 2. Biscay. 3. Guipuscòa. 4. Leon</HI> and <HI>Oviedo. 5. Gallicia. 6. Cor∣duba. 7. Granada. 8. Murcia. 9. Toledo. 10. Castile. 11. Portugal. 12. Valentia. 13. Catalonia.</HI> 14. The Kingdom of <HI>Majorca.</HI> 15. And the Kingd. of <HI>Arragon.</HI> Which are at this day all reduced under three Crowns or Governments, <HI>Castile, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Arragon.</HI> The Religion professed is strict <HI>Roman Catholick;</HI> especial∣ly since the introducing the Inquisition by <HI>Pedro Gon∣sales de Mendoza,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Toledo,</HI> in 1478. The Christian Faith was taught this Nation very early by <HI>S. James,</HI> or more probably by <HI>S. Paul. Aria∣nisin</HI> entered with the <HI>Goths,</HI> and continued till 588. They never heard of the <HI>Roman</HI> Rites till after 1083: when a <HI>Frenchman</HI> being made Archbishop of <HI>Toledo,</HI> endeavoured the Introduction of that Service; and was at first opposed in it by all the other Prelates and People. It had been well for <HI>Spain,</HI> if it had never been received: seeing it has cost that Nation so many of its People; no less than three thousand Families having been destroyed by the Inquisition in one Dio∣cese in three years: not to mention the loss of the United Netherlands, and the ruin of <HI>Flanders.</HI> The Cities of <HI>Spain</HI> are too numerous to be here inser∣ted.</P>
<P><HI>New Spain, <HI>Hispania Nova,</HI></HI> is a considerable Country in North <HI>America;</HI> called by the <HI>Spaniards la Nueva Espanna,</HI> and sometimes <HI>el Mexico,</HI> from its Capital City. It contains all that space of Land be∣tween the North and the South Sea, that lies between the <HI>Terra Firma</HI> (or Streight of <HI>Panama</HI>) to the East, and <HI>Florida</HI> to the West; which by the <HI>Indians</HI> was called <HI>Anahuac;</HI> that is, <HI>The Land by the Water.</HI> It extends from fifteen deg. of Latitude to twenty six exclusively; in breadth six hundred <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, in length twelve hundred. The Air is very temperate (tho situate wholly in the <HI>Torrid Zone</HI>) by reason of the frequent Showers which fall in <HI>June, July,</HI> and <HI>August;</HI> (their hottest Months in the year) and also by reason of the Sea Breezes. It is abundantly inriched with inexhaustible Mines of Gold, Silver, Brass and Iron: has great plenty of Coco-Nuts, Cochineel, Wheat, Barley, Oranges, Limons, Figs, Cherries, Ap∣ples, and Pears, Cattle and Fowl: but it has few Grapes, and no Wine. Their Seed time is in <HI>April</HI> or <HI>May;</HI> their Harvest in <HI>October:</HI> in the Low Coun∣tries they sow in <HI>October,</HI> and reap in <HI>May.</HI> This Kingdom had Kings of its own, from 1332, to 1520: about two years before which, <HI>Francis Cortez,</HI> a <HI>Spa∣niard,</HI> entered it with eleven Ships, and five hundred and fifty Men; by help of which he sacked the Town of <HI>Pontonchon,</HI> defeated by his Cannon and Horse for∣ty thousand naked <HI>Indians,</HI> (who came to revenge this Injury;) and in 1531, took the City of <HI>Mexico, Aug.</HI> 13. and put an end to the <HI>Indian</HI> Empire. The Provinces of this vast Kingdom, are 1. <HI>Panuco. 2. Mechuacan. 3. Mexicana. 4 Tlascala. 5.

So industrious, that a Beggar is not to be seen amongst them. Of latter times they have shewn the World they are good Soldiers, and capable of Learning too.

It yields Corn and Wine, but not sufficient for its Inhabitants. In length two hundred and forty Miles, in breadth one hun∣dred and eighty. The Inhabitants are Honest, Fru∣gal, Industrious, great Lovers of Liberty, good Sol∣diers, Lovers of Impartiality and Justice. About the time of <HI>Julius Caesar</HI>'s Conquering <HI>Gaul,</HI> fifty six years before the Birth of our Saviour; these People being oppressed with too great a number of People, to the number of three Millions six hundred and eight thousand made an Irruption into <HI>Gaul;</HI> burning all their own Towns before they left them.

Famous it is for a great Defeat of the <HI>Athenians</HI> under its Walls; in the year of the World 3536. of <HI>Rome</HI> 339. It fell under the power of the <HI>Romans</HI> in the year of the World 3738. of <HI>Rome</HI> 541. two hundred and ten years before the Birth of our Saviour; when it was intirely ruined by <HI>Marcel∣lus,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> General.

with Noble <HI>Greek</HI> Cities. Upon the Eastern side of it, stands <HI>Caffa,</HI> (which was the ancient <HI>Theodo∣sia</HI>) under the <HI>Turks.</HI> In the entrance of the Neck of it, <HI>Precop;</HI> under the <HI>Tartars:</HI> from whence the whole <HI>Peninsula</HI> is sometimes called <HI>Precopsca;</HI> and the In∣habitants, the <HI>Precopensian Tartars.</HI> It makes the most Southern part of the <HI>Krim Tartary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tauris, <HI>Ecbatana, Tabresium, Tauresium, Ti∣granana,</HI></HI> a great City of the Kingdom of <HI>Persia,</HI> called by the Inhabitants <HI>Tebris.</HI> It stands in the Province of <HI>Aderbuitzan;</HI> eleven hundred Miles from <HI>Constan∣tinople</HI> to the East, and twenty five <HI>German</HI> Miles from the <HI>Caspian Sea</HI> to the South. Founded, (as the <HI>Persians</HI> all agree) in the one hundred and sixty fifth year of the <HI>Hegyra,</HI> in the year of Christ 786. In 849. it was ruined by an Earthquake. In 1490. the Princes of the Race of <HI>Sheitb-Sephi,</HI> removed to this City from <HI>Ardevil.</HI> In 1514. <HI>Selim,</HI> Emperour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> took it upon Articles, two years after the Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> removed to <HI>Casbin.</HI> In the time of <HI>Solyman the Magnificent,</HI> the City rebelled; assassi∣nated the <HI>Turkish</HI> Governour, and Garrison; which was severely revenged by <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> (General of that Prince) in 1548. In the Reign of <HI>Amurath,</HI> it re∣belled again; and was again taken and sacked by the <HI>Turks</HI> in 1585. In 1603. <HI>Abas,</HI> King of <HI>Persia,</HI> took it by Stratagem: ever since which, it has been under the <HI>Persians.</HI> The Learned <HI>Minadoi,</HI> (in his Histo∣ry of the <HI>Turkish</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> War, <HI>pag.</HI> 311.) thus describes it. It is seated (saith he) on the North side of Mount <HI>Orontes;</HI> having <HI>Persia</HI> to the East, the <HI>Caspian</HI> Mountains to the West, and the <HI>Caspian Sea</HI> to the North: in a fruitful Plain; in a cold, snowy, healthful Air; abounding with all things need∣ful for the Life of Man; enriched by great Caravans of Merchants, which pass to and fro through it; so populous, that it maintains two hundred thousand Inhabitants; yet without any Walls or Bastions, or the least defence against an Enemy: The Houses are low and mean: the Gardens, Fountains, Basars and Mosques, Magnificent and Sumptuous. Sir <HI>John Char∣din,</HI> who saw this City, agrees with him: and adds, that a small River (called <HI>Spingicha,</HI>) runs across through it; and another called <HI>Agi,</HI> on the North side. Long. 88. 00. Lat. 41. 19. Sir <HI>John Chardin</HI> estimated the Inhabitants to be five hundred and fifty thousand: so much has a long Peace improved it since <HI>Minadoi</HI>'s time. It extends its Commerce over <HI>Per∣sia, Turkey, Tartary, Moscovy,</HI> and the <HI>Biack Sea;</HI> consisting much in Cottons, Silks, Chagrines, Bro∣cades, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which fills it well with Strangers. The <HI>Mosques</HI> are reckoned to two hundred and fifty; where∣of some have been <HI>Christian</HI> Churches. The <HI>Capu∣chines</HI> had a convenient House built in this City in 1668. Without the City to the South, appear the Ruins of the Palace of the ancient Kings of <HI>Persia:</HI> and to the East, the like of a Castle, which was the Royal Seat of <HI>Chosroes.</HI> The <HI>Geographers</HI> generally affirm, <HI>Tauris</HI> stands in the place of the ancient <HI>Ec∣batana.</HI> It is governed by a <HI>Beglerbeg,</HI> of great power and consideration in the Kingdom of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Taurus,</HI> the greatest Mountain in all <HI>Asia;</HI> so called, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> saith, from its Magnitude. It begins at the East or <HI>Chinian Ocean;</HI> and traverseth the whole body of <HI>Asia,</HI> as far as the Sea of <HI>Pamphy∣lia</HI> in the <HI>Lesser Asia;</HI> dividing <HI>Asia</HI> into the Nor∣thern and Southern, and assuming various Names in different Places. Yet the particular Name of <HI>Taurus</HI> belongs most properly to that Branch of this Moun∣tain, which divides <HI>Pamphylia</HI> and <HI>Cilicia</HI> from the <HI>Lesser Armenia.</HI> Sir <HI>John Chardin</HI> who crossed that part of this Mountain, (called <HI>Caucasus</HI>) saith; that it is the highest Mountain, and the most difficult to pass over that ever he beheld: full of Rocks and dis∣mal Precipices. The top of it (eight Leagues broad), cover'd with Snow and not inhabited: yet the sides are prodigious fruitful; afford Honey, Wheat, Gums, Wines, and Fruits in vast quantities. The Inhabitants are a good natur'd sort of Christians, In <HI>Tartary</HI> this Mountain is called <HI>Imaus.</HI> In this long course it separates many Potent Nations one from another. <HI>Herbert</HI> (our Country-man) saith; that it is fifty <HI>English</HI> Miles over, and fifteen hundred long.</P>

Sir <HI>John Chardin</HI> who saw it some few years since, contrariwise assures us it is one of the fairest, though not the biggest Cities in <HI>Persia;</HI> at the bottom of a Mountain, upon the River <HI>Cur;</HI> incompassed on all sides, but the South, (where the River secureth it) with a strong and beautiful Wall; and has about fourteen Christian Churches, served by <HI>Armenians</HI> and
<PB N="402" REF="217"/>
<HI>Georgians;</HI> together with a large Castle guarded by Natural <HI>Persians</HI> only. The Bishops See or Pa∣lace is near the Cathedral Church. It has in the mean time not one Mosque, (except a small one lately built in the Castle;) because the Christians will not endure it, and the <HI>Persians</HI> are too wise to exasperate their Frontier People; who can with ease call in the <HI>Turks</HI> to revenge the Injuries of their Religion. It is well Peopled, full of Strangers, who resort thither on the ac∣count of Trade. Twice in the hands of the <HI>Turks,</HI> in the Reigns of <HI>Ishmael</HI> II, and <HI>Solyman</HI> his Son.

This ancient Town was sacked by <HI>Sweno</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> in 1004. and suffered more from them in 1010. About 1047. the Bishops See of the <HI>East-Angles</HI> was removed hither from <HI>Elmham.

Now a great Town: and for∣merly of great Import and Trade; as appears by this, that her Walls have been thrice inlarged. In the late Wars (saith <HI>Guicciardin</HI>) between the <HI>French, Liegeois</HI> and Low Countries, it has been much wa∣sted; and in part desolated, though the Inhabitants enjoy great Privileges.

In 844. <HI>Charles the Bald</HI> assisted at another Council here. In the latter Times it was often ta∣ken by the <HI>French:</HI> who ever since 1644. have in∣tirely possessed it; the Peace of the <HI>Pyrenees</HI> con∣firming it to them.</P>

In 1546. <HI>Dom Juan Albuquerque</HI> a Franciscan, Arch∣bishop of <HI>Goa,</HI> erected a College at <HI>Cranganoor,</HI> for the conversion of these Christians to the <HI>Church of Rome.</HI> In 1587. the <HI>Jesuits</HI> established another, one League from <HI>Cranganoor.</HI> And in 1559. <HI>Me∣neses,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Goa</HI> and <HI>Primate</HI> of the East, was employed in a grand Mission hither to promote the same Conversion. But the <HI>Christians of S. Tho∣mas</HI> will not, by all the endeavours that are used, be induced to forsake the ancient Customs of their Fore∣fathers. They use the <HI>Chaldee</HI> language in their Of∣fices. Acknowledge the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon</HI> for their Chief. Practise their own Ceremonies; and in mat∣ters of Faith are <HI>Nestorians.</HI></P>

Begun by the Inhabitants of <HI>Padoua,</HI> about the year of Christ 421, upon the Rocks of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea, out of a terror of the <HI>Goths</HI> and other barbarous Nations: which then like an impetuous and irresistible Torrent over run <HI>Italy.</HI> The Senate of <HI>Padoua,</HI> as Masters of the Islands of the <HI>Lagune,</HI> to this purpose proclaimed by their three Consuls the ssame year, <HI>Rialto</HI> (a Port belonging to them there) to be an Asylum for all that would retire to it. <HI>Attila</HI> after this overthrowing and ruining <HI>A∣quileja,</HI> the Inhabitants of that City fled to <HI>Venice</HI> too in the year 453. Whereby both <HI>Rialto,</HI> and the neighbouring Islands, became Peopled; receiving for their Governours, Consuls, or Tribunes, (which <HI>Cassiodorus</HI> calls <HI>Maritimorum Tribunos</HI>) sent to them from the Senate of <HI>Padoua:</HI> till in time every Island chose itself a particular Tribune yearly, and every Tri∣bune became in the nature of a petty Sovereign. And thus for nigh the first three hundred years, they were neither one and the same City, or Republick; but a consederation of many neighbouring Islands united together, by common interest, for their security against the <HI>Barbarians</HI> of <HI>Italy.</HI> In the year 697, the Tribunes of the twelve principal Islands by per∣mission from the Emperor (as Sovereign of all the Country) and the Pope, which was procured to su∣persede the pretensions of <HI>Padoua</HI> to these Islands, set up the first Duke: and since that time this City hath encreased to that degree, that it has filled all the seven∣ty two Islands about it; which, as every Island ancient∣ly had its separate Pastor as well as Tribune, are be∣come so many Parishes, each having its peculiar Church. From the year 697. to 1172. or 1177. the Dukes or Doges governed with an absolute authority; and caused their Brothers or Children to be elected often∣times their Colleagues, and their Successors. The third Doge was assassinated by the People for his Tyranny: whereupon ensued an <HI>Interregnum</HI> of five years; in which the State was committed to certain Officers, e∣very new year changed and elected. Then they desi∣red to have a Doge again: And from 697. to 1177. they had about thirty four or thirty six Sovereign Do∣ges. In 1172. the Election of the Doge by the voices of all the People was abolished; and a Sovereign in∣dependent Counsel appointed for that use, consisting of two hundred and forty Citizens, chosen indifferent∣ly out of the Gentry, Citizens, and Artiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns: But withal they Created twelve Tribunes, with power to oppose the Doges Ordinances, in case they appeared unjust. This fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m of Government continued one hundred and eleven years: And in 1280. the Coun∣cil was fixed upon a number of certain Families and their descendents, expressed in publick Register; with an utter exclusion of other Persons and Families, of all States and Qualities whatsoever. Which last form, time hath improved with many additions. The Sword is now carried not before, but behind the Doge; and the publick Coins represent him in Du∣cal Habits, upon his Knees before S. <HI>Mark,</HI> (who is the Symbol of the Republick;) two no small intimations of his inferiority to it. It is lawful for the Senate to de∣pose him (otherwise his Dignity is for life) in case of extreme old age and sickness, rendring him uncapable of business: as they did <HI>Francisco Foscarini,</HI> at the age of 84. after his Dogate had been always happy to them. The Families of the twelve Tribunes who set up the first Doge in 697, are all preserved to this day; and obtain the first rank in the <HI>Venetian</HI> Nobility, with the Title of the twelve Electoral Houses Most of the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> and not them only, but <HI>Hen.</HI> III. and <HI>Henry le Grand,</HI> Kings of <HI>France,</HI> have desired to be received into the Body of the Nobility of this State: For which, others, who purchase their Nobili∣ty, ordinarily pay one hundred thousand Duckats. In the year 1177. the Emperor <HI>Frederick Barbarossa</HI> and Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> III. were reconciled in a Coun∣cil here: but the common story of the Pope's putting his foot upon the Emperor's Neck is rejected and re∣futed by <HI>Baronius.</HI> In the year 1451, the Bishop of this City had the Title of a Patriarch given him: who writes, <HI>Divina Miseratione Venetiarum Patriarcha,</HI> without the addition of <HI>Sanctae sedis Apostolicae gra∣tia;</HI> and is nominated by the Senate. <HI>Aquitela</HI> is another Patriarchate within the Dominions of this State: who, though that City belongs to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> find means to keep the Patriarchate con∣stantly full, against the interposition of any Person by the Emperour. The Body of <HI>S. Mark,</HI> brought hi∣ther from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> is said to be preserv'd in the NOble Church of his name in this City. Here are accounted one hundred and forty Palaces, one hun∣dred and thirty Monasteries for Men and Women, one hundred and sixty five Marble Statues, twenty five brass, sixty seven Parishes, eighteen Hospitals, and in∣numerable other Testimonies of Riches and Gran∣deur. The several Islands are said to be joyned toge∣ther by five hundred Bridges; the greatest of which called <HI>il ponte di Rio Alto,</HI> was built of <HI>Istrian</HI> Stone, in 1591. The <HI>Arsenal</HI> for their Gallies is the most celebrated, and their Harbor the most large and safe in the World. This City is the Mistress and Sovereign of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea; once the Mistress of the <HI>Morea, Cyprus, Candy,</HI> the <HI>Negropont,</HI> almost all the Islands of the <HI>Archipelago</HI> up to <HI>Constantinople, Thessalonica,</HI> most of the other Sea-Port Towns of <HI>Greece, Smyrna,</HI> and many others in <HI>Asia;</HI> which have been ravished from her, by the prevailing fortunes of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> House. She is now no less gloriously strugling to regain what she dearly sold, if the <HI>Turk</HI> had at all va∣lued human Blood. But of all these places I have discoursed in the Accounts I have given of them. She stands two hundred and sixty Miles from <HI>Rome</HI> to the North, two hundred and eighty from <HI>Vienna</HI> South, one hundred from <HI>Ravenna</HI> North, fifteen from <HI>Mi∣lan</HI> East. Upon <HI>Ascension-Day,</HI> the Doge accompa∣nied with the whole College, and Ambassadours of Crown'd Heads, performs a Ceremony yearly at <HI>Port Lido,</HI> which is peculiarly remarkable in this City, of marrying the <HI>Adriatick Sea;</HI> which is done by throw∣ing out of his <HI>Buccintoro</HI> (a most rich and pompous Galley for the purpose, wherein he rides in triumph) a Gold Ring into the Sea, with these words; <HI>Despon∣samus te, Mare, in signum veri &amp; perpetui dominii.</HI> This Ceremony was first instituted by Pope <HI>Alexan∣der</HI> III. towards the end of the twelfth Century; as a solemn Declaration of the Sovereignty over the <HI>Adriatick,</HI> which the Republick had acquired by their Arms. <HI>Zebastiano Zani</HI> was the Doge at that time.

But no such regard to it having been observed by the <HI>Turks</HI> in the last Siege, a Cross was immediately advanced in the place of the Crescent. This City has been the Seat of the Emperors of <HI>Germany</HI> ever since 1438. <HI>Frederick</HI> II. founded an University in it, in 1237. which <HI>Albert</HI> III.

<P><HI>York, <HI>Eboracum, Eburacum, Brigantium,</HI></HI> the Capital City of <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> and an Archbishops See; in the North Riding. Called by the <HI>British Caer Effroc,</HI> by <HI>Ninius Caer Ebrauc,</HI> by the <HI>English York.</HI> Seated upon the River <HI>Ver</HI> or <HI>Ʋre;</HI> which is since by the <HI>Saxons</HI> called <HI>Ouse,</HI> from <HI>Ouseburne,</HI> a small River that falls into it. It is in Honour, Wealth, and Great∣ness the second City of <HI>England:</HI> and the far great∣est not only in that Shire, but in all the North. Hav∣ing thirty Parish Churches, besides the Cathedral; and governed by a <HI>Lord Mayor,</HI> like <HI>London.</HI> A plea∣sant, well built, strong, and beautiful City: and the most ancient Archbishops See in this Island. The <HI>Ʋre</HI> or <HI>Ouse,</HI> having with a gentle stream entered it from the North-West, divides it into two unequal parts; united by a Stone-Bridge. The West part (tho much less peopled) is incompassed with a sair Wall; the other which is greater, more populous and close built, is fortified also with strong Walls with Turrets upon them, and a muddy Dike. Herein <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror built a strong Castle, now ruined by time: on the North-East side of this part stands the Cathedral Church dedicated to <HI>S. Peter;</HI> which is a stately and a venerable <HI>Fabrick.</HI> This City was built by the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> about the times of <HI>Hadrian</HI> the Emperour; and had the honour of a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony bestowed on it in the Reign of <HI>Severus,</HI> who died in his Palace here, in the year of Christ 210. In the year 306, <HI>Fla∣vius Valerius Constantius,</HI> Surnamed <HI>Clorus,</HI> (the Virtuous Father of <HI>Constantine the Great</HI>) ended his life in this City. <HI>Constantine</HI> his Son, took upon him here the Government of his Fathers share of the Em∣pire; who became afterwards the first Christian Em∣perour, the deliverer of the Church, and the Estab∣lisher and Exalter of the Cross. In the times that fol∣lowed, (though she had the Honour to be an Archbi∣shops See; and <HI>Eborius</HI> Bishop of this City in the year 313. subscribed to the Council of <HI>Arles,</HI> before <HI>Restitutus</HI> Bishop of <HI>London;</HI> yet) the Barbarous Na∣tions in the next Century breaking in upon the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Empire; this City suffered from the <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> all the miseries of VVar. So that about the year 627. when <HI>Paulinus</HI> was to Baptize <HI>Edwin</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> they were forced to build a little Oratory of VVood for that purpose; all the ancient Churches being entirely ruined. Hereupon that Prince began the building of the present Cathedral, which was finished by his Successor <HI>Oswald.</HI> From this time forward, this Church and City began to revive and flourish again. The Archbishops had under them not only all the North of <HI>England,</HI> but all the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> till 1471 (or as others, 74) In 740,

<HI>Egbert,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> opened here a noble Li∣brary; which a contemporary Historian calls the Ca∣binet of all liberal Arts: from whence <HI>Alcuinus</HI> the Preceptor of <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> and Founder of the University of <HI>Paris,</HI> borrowed those Lights which have since glittered there. About 867, the <HI>Danes</HI> had so weakened this City the second time, that <HI>Os∣bright</HI> and <HI>Ella,</HI> Kings of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> brake easily through its VValls: and fought the <HI>Danes</HI> in the City; where both these valiant Princes were slain, and the <HI>Danes</HI> remained Masters of it. It was recovered again out of the Hands of the <HI>Danes,</HI> by King <HI>Athel∣stane</HI> in 928: and was a City of sixteen hundred and twenty eight Mansions, in the Reigns of <HI>Edward</HI> the the Confessor, and <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror. In 1069, (the fourth year of the Conqueror's Reign) <HI>Sweno</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> and <HI>Edgar Atheling</HI> the lawful Prince of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> with the <HI>Scots,</HI> attacking this place; the <HI>Nor∣mans</HI> siring the Suburbs, the City took fire too: and the Enemy entring at the same time, Fire and Sword almost destroyed it. Those few Citizens which esca∣ped were made a Sacrifice to the Jealousie of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror. In the Reign of King <HI>Stephen, Eg∣berts</HI> Library, the Cathedral, and a great part of the City was burnt by a casual Fire. Nor was the Ca∣thedral rebuilt before the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I. At which time the Citizens also rebuilt the Walls of the City. <HI>Richard</HI> II. made it a County incorporate by it self: Annexing a small Territory to it on the West side, in which the Archbishops of <HI>York</HI> enjoy the Rights of <HI>Palatines. Richard</HI> III. began the Repair of the Castle, which ended with his short Reign. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. erected here a Court of Chancery for the North; not much unlike the Parliaments of <HI>France:</HI> which lasted till the War in 1640, put a period to it. <HI>Charles</HI> I. retired hither in 1641: when the Tumults of <HI>London</HI> forced him from thence. This City stood firmly to him, and had certainly restored him to his rightful Do∣minion and Authority, had not the <HI>Scots</HI> broke their Faith, and entred <HI>England</HI> the second time in 1644: who joyning with <HI>Manchester</HI> and <HI>Fairfax,</HI> besieged this City with three Armies. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> came up and relieved it <HI>July</HI> 31. But the Kings Forces being defeated at <HI>Marstonmoor</HI> soon after, <HI>July</HI> 16. this Loyal City was delivered up to the Parliament upon Honorable Terms: and ill kept by the prosperous Re∣bels.

<HEAD>AN ADVERTISEMENT Concerning the INDEX.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the shortning this <HI>Index</HI> as much as was possible, I have intirely, 1. Omitted all those Latin Names which are formed from the Vulgar, and differ from them in little or nothing but their Termination. 2. The greatest part of the ancient Latin Names which are now in common use. 3. Most of those Latin Names which have the four first Letters of the Vulgar Names. In all which cases the Reader shall find the Word he seeks in the body of the Book in its proper place.</P>
<P>After almost every Name there is a Letter placed, which shews the Reader what it is: as,</P>

<ITEM>R. River.</ITEM>
<ITEM>T. Territory.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Where any of these Letters are doubled there are several Places of the same Name.</P>
<P>The Latin Names are in the <HI>Roman Letter,</HI> and the Vulgar in the <HI>Itali∣an;</HI> and those that are in the <HI>English Letter,</HI> belong to <HI>England, Scot∣land,</HI> or <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
