<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS no small Reflection on Pieces of this nature, that Panegyrick is so much improv'd, and that De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ication is grown more an Art than Poetry; that Authors, to make their Patrons more than Men, make themselves less; and that Persons of Honour are forc'd to decline patronizing Wit, because their Modesty cannot bear the gross Strokes of Adulation.</P>
<P>But give me leave to say, Sir, that I am too young an Author to have learnt the Art of Flattery; and, I hope, the same Modesty which recommended this Play to the World, will also reconcile my Addresses to You, of whom I can say nothing but what your Merits may warrant, and all that have the honour of your Acquaintance will be proud to vindicate.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>The greatest Panegyrick upon you, Sir, is the unpreju∣diced and bare Truth of Your Character, the Fire of Youth, with the Sedateness of a Senatour, and the Modern Gaity of a fine <HI>English</HI> Gentleman, with the noble Solidity of the Antient <HI>Britton.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Character, Sir, which all men, but your self, are proud to publish of You, and which more celebrated Pens than mine should transmit to Posterity.</P>
<P>The Play has had some noble Appearances to honour its Representation; and to compleat the Success, I have pre∣sum'd to prefix so Noble a Name to usher it into the World. A stately Frontispiece is the Beauty of a Build∣ing. But here I must transverse <HI>Ovid</HI>:
<Q><L>Materia superabit Opus.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE to the READER.</HEAD>
<P>AN affected Modesty is very often the greatest Vanity, and Authors are sometimes prouder of their Blushes than of the Pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s that occasion'd them. I shan't therefore, like a foolish Vigin, fly to be pursued, and deny what I chiefly wish for. I am very willing to acknowledg the Beauties of this Play, especially those of the third Night, which not to be proud of, were the heighth of Impudence: Who is asham'd to value himself upon such Favours, undervalues those who confer'd them.</P>
<P>As I freely submit to the Criticisms of the Iudicious, so I cannot call this an ill Play, since the Town has allow'd it such Success. When they have pardon'd my faults, 'twere very ill manners to condemn their Indulgence. Some may think (my Acquaintance in Town being too slender to make a Party for the Play) that the Success must be deriv'd from the pure Merits of the Cause. I am of another opinion: I have not been long enough in Town to raise Enemies against me; and the <HI>English</HI> are still kind to Strangers. I am below the Envy of great Wits, and above the Malice of little ones. I have not displeas'd the Ladies, nor offended the Clergy; both which are now pleas'd to say, that a Comedy may be diverting without Smut and Profane∣ness.</P>
<P>Next to these Advantages, the Beauties of Action gave the greatest life to the Play, of which the Town is so sensible, that all will join with me in commendation of the Actors, and allow (without detracting from the me∣rit of others) that the <HI>Theatre Royal</HI> affords an excellent and compleat set of Comedians. Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s performance has set him so far above com∣petition in the part of <HI>Wildair,</HI> that none can pretend to envy the Praise due to his Merit. That he made the Part, will appear from hence, that whenever the Stage has the misfortune to lose him, Sir <HI>Harry Wildair</HI> may go to the Iubilee.</P>
<P>A great many quarrel at <HI>the Trip to the Jubilee</HI> for a <HI>Misnommer</HI>: I must tell them that perhaps there are greater Trips in the Play; and when I find that more exact Plays have had better success. I'll talk with the Criticks about <HI>Decorums,</HI> &amp;c. However, if I ever commit another fault of this nature, I'll endeavour to make it more excusable.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE, by a Friend.</HEAD>
<L>POETS will think nothing so checks their Fury,</L>
<L>As Wits, Cits, Beaux, and Women for their Jury.</L>
<L>Our Spark's half dead to think what Medly's come,</L>
<L>With blended Judgments to pronounce his Doom.</L>
<L>'Tis all false Fear; for in a mingled Pit,</L>
<L>Why, what your grave Don thinks but dully writ,</L>
<L>His Neighbour i'th' great Wig may take for Wit.</L>
<L>Some Authors court the Few, the Wise, if any;</L>
<L>Our Youth's content, if he can reach the Many,</L>
<L>Who go with much like Ends to-Church, and Play,</L>
<L>Not to observe what Priests or Poets say,</L>
<L>No! no! your Thoughts, like theirs, lie quite another way.</L>
<L>The Ladies safe may smile: for here's no Slander,</L>
<L>No Smut, no lewd-tongu'd Beau, no double Entendre.</L>
<L>'Tis true he has a Spark just come from <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>But then so far from Beau—why he talks Sense!</L>
<L>Like Coin o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t carry'd out, but—seldom brought from thence.</L>
<L>There's yet a Gang to whom our Spark submits,</L>
<L>Your Elbow-shaking Fool, that lives by's Wits,</L>
<L>That's only witty tho, just as he lives by fits.</L>
<L>Who Lion-like through Bayliffs scours away,</L>
<L>Hunts in the Face a Dinner all the Day,</L>
<L>At Night with empty Bowels grumbles o're the Play.</L>
<L>And now the modish Prentice he implores,</L>
<L>Who with his Master's Cash stol'n out of Doors,</L>
<L>Imploys it on a Brace of—Honourable Whores;</L>
<L>While their good bulky Mother pleas'd sits by,</L>
<L>Bawd Regent of the Bubble Gallery.</L>
<L>Next to our mounted Friends we humbly move,</L>
<L>Who all your Side-box Tricks are much above,</L>
<L>And never fail to pay us — with your Love.</L>
<L>Ah Friends! Poor <HI>Dorse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Garden-hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is gone,</L>
<L>Our merry Meetings there are all undone:</L>
<L>Quite lost to us, sure for some strange Misdeeds</L>
<L>That strong Dog <HI>Sampson</HI>'s pull'd it o're our Heads,</L>
<L>Snaps Rope like Thread; but when his Fortune's told him,</L>
<L>He'll hear perhaps of Rope will one day hold him:</L>
<L>At least I hope that our good-natur'd Town</L>
<L>Will find a way to pull his Prizes down.</L>
<L>Well, that's all! Now Gentlemen for the Play,</L>
<L>On second Thoughts I've but two words to say;</L>
<L>Such as it is for your Delight design'd,</L>
<L>Hear it, read, try, judg, and speak as you find.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>spoken by Mr. <HI>Wilks.</HI></BYLINE>
<L>NOW all depart, each his respective way,</L>
<L>To spend an Evening's Chatt upon the Play;</L>
<L>Some to <HI>Hippolito</HI>'s, one homeward goes,</L>
<L>And one with loving she retires to th' <HI>Rose.</HI></L>
<L>The amorous Pair in all things frank and free,</L>
<L>Perhaps may save the Play, <HI>in number three.</HI></L>
<L>The tearing Spark, if <HI>Phillis</HI> ought gai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>says,</L>
<L>Breaks th' Drawer's Head, kicks her, and murders <HI>Bays.</HI></L>
<L>To <HI>Coffee</HI> some retreat to save their Pocket<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</L>
<L>Others more generous damn the Play at <HI>Lockets.</HI></L>
<L>But there, I hope, the Author's Fears are vain.</L>
<L>Malice ne're spoke in generous <HI>Champain.</HI></L>
<L>That Poet merits an ignoble Death,</L>
<L>Who fears to fall over a brave <HI>Monteth.</HI></L>
<L>The Privilege of Wine we only ask,</L>
<L>You'll taste again, before you damn the Flask.</L>
<L>Our Author fears not you; but those he may</L>
<L>Who in cold Blood, murder a Man in <HI>Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></L>
<L>Those Men of Spleen, who fond the World should know it,</L>
<L>Sit down, and for their <HI>two pence</HI> damn a Poet.</L>
<L>Their Criticism's good, that we can say fort't,</L>
<L>They understand a Play—too well to pay for't.</L>
<L>From Box to Stage, from Stage to Box they run,</L>
<L>First steal the Play, then damn it when they've done.</L>
<L>But now to know what Fate may us betide,</L>
<L>Among our Friends in <HI>Cornhil</HI> and <HI>Cheapside:</HI></L>
<L>But those I think have but one Rule for Plays;</L>
<L>They'l say they'r good, if so the World says.</L>
<L>If it should please them, and their Spouses know it,</L>
<L>They straight enquire what kind of Man's the Poet.</L>
<L>But from Side-box we dread a fearful Doom,</L>
<L>All the good-natur'd Beaux are gone to <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
<L>The Ladies Censure I'd almos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forgot,</L>
<L>Then for a Line or two t' engage their Vote:</L>
<L>But that way's old, below our Author's Aim,</L>
<L>No less than his whole Play is Complement to them.</L>
<L>For their sakes then the Play can't miss succeeding,</L>
<L>Tho Criticks may want Wit, they have good Breeding.</L>
<L>They won't, I'm sure, forfeit the Ladies Graces,</L>
<L>By shewing their ill-nature to their Faces.</L>
<L>Our Business with good Manners may be done,</L>
<L>Flatter us here, and damn us when you're gone.</L>

Then it hapned that three young Gentlemen from the University coming into the Country, and being benigh∣ted, and Strangers, call'd at my Father's: He was very glad of their Compa∣ny, and offer'd them the Entertainment of his House.</P>

<P>Come, come, Madam, you know very well— those who stand so high, that the vulgar envy even their Crimes, whose Figure adds privi∣lege to their Sin, and makes it pass unquestion'd; fair, high, pamper'd Fe∣males, whose speaking Eyes, and piercing Voice, wou'd warm the Statue of a <HI>Stoick,</HI> and animate his cold Marble with the Soul of an <HI>Epicure,</HI> all ra∣vishing, lovely, soft, and kind, like you.</P>
