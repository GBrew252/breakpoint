<HEAD>TO THE WOR∣shipfull,
and his ever
honoured friends, the whole po∣sterity
of his worthy Patron, Sir
Timothy Hutton deceased, both
to his Sonnes with their wives and
Children, and to his Daughters
with their husbands and children:
namely, Mathew Hutton of
Marsk. Esquire, Iustice of peace;
Iames Maulleverer of Arncliffe
Esquire; Iohn Dodsworth of
Thornton-watlasse, Esquire, Iustice
of peace: Edmund Cleburne of
Cleburne, Esquire; Mr Timothy
Hutton; Mr Philip Hutton decea∣sed
his relict and issue; M<SUP>r</SUP>
Iohn Hutton; and M<SUP>r</SUP>
Thomas Hutton,
Peace &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His little fol∣lowing
book
had beene in
the Printers


<PB REF="3"/>
hands diverse daies ere
ever I purposed any
nuncupation, or dedi∣cation
of it at all. At
last, it came into my
minde to addresse it
this way, and that for
these causes. first, out of
honour to your chiefe,
<HI>Arch-Bishop Hutton,</HI> of
whom for his learning,
and gravitie, this great
Encomium was pub∣liquely
given, that hee
was <HI>worthy to sit Presi∣dent
in a generall Coun∣cell.</HI>
Secondly, because
I was well ascertained,
my book could receive


<PB REF="3"/>
no smut from you, be∣ing
people of whole
fame for native gentle∣nesse,
innocency of
manners, faire deport∣ment,
and for the con∣stant
and uniforme pro∣fession
of Religion.
Thirdly, for that the
most of you are spread
into a goodly posterity
and have faire sonnes
and daughters, unto
whom these things may
bee truely usefull to
ground them soundly
in Religion, so as nei∣ther
<HI>Abundance</HI> can
<HI>choake,</HI> nor <HI>Indigence</HI>


<PB REF="4"/>
ever <HI>starve</HI> in them those
due respects they owe to
divine powers. Would
God parents would at
last be wise, and thinke
it were conduceable to
the hopefull setling of
a child, to aime at more
of <HI>instruction</HI> and in∣stitution,
though lesse
of <HI>provision.</HI> Fourthly,
in acknowledgement of
that great love, sweet fa∣miliarity,
and continuall
intercourses of Christi∣an
acquaintance which
you were ever pleased
to hold with mee, both
affecting my person,


<PB REF="4"/>
and leaning to my mi∣nistery
farre beyond
the proportion of de∣sert.
Lastly, and espe∣cially
for the pious me∣mory
of that worthy
Knight Sir <HI>Timothy Hut∣ton,</HI>
your deare Father,
and my most incorrupt
Patron. Into the menti∣on
of whom being fal∣len,
I cannot containe
my pen, but to his great
praise I must relate one
or two things of him in
this very regard: first
that comming to settle
his family at <HI>Marske,</HI>
and finding the <HI>Rector</HI>


<PB REF="5"/>
there to be no more but
a bare reader, he rested
not till hee had com∣pounded
forth the pre∣sent
incumbent, and fil∣led
the Church with a
preaching Ministery.
And when it was empty
againe by the death of
that incumbent, he most
freely presented my selfe
with out the least request
made in my behalfe to
him, either by my selfe,
or any other; yea hee
besought mee earnestly
to take it, and when he
signed the presentation
he drew with his pen the


<PB REF="5"/>
forme of his heart be∣tweene
his name and
sir-name. and I can well
take an accompt of my
memory, that the Bpp
of the diocesse, when he
gave institution, asser∣ted
vehemently that I
had the best and most
upright Patron living.
This I say not onely for
his <HI>honour,</HI> but also for
the just <HI>defamation</HI> both
of such <HI>Patrons</HI> (sonnes
of the earth whosoever
they be) as thinke hea∣ven
and earth would
faile them for mainte∣nance
and support, if


<PB REF="6"/>
they should present a
<HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Priest</HI> with∣out
some sprinckling
either of direct or indi∣rect
symonie: and also
of such <HI>Clerkes</HI> as pro∣fesse
they believe the re∣surrection
of their bo∣dies
after they are cal∣cined
to dust, and yet
dare not trust God for
food and raiment, with∣out
these indirect and
symoniacall contracts.
But I containe.</P>
<P>These things there∣fore
(my much honou∣red,
and most deerely
respected friends) I pre∣sent


<PB REF="6"/>
unto you, and to∣gether
with them what∣soever
is worth accep∣tance
either in the per∣son
or function of</P>

friend, and
Servant in the things
of Iesus Christ.

<HEAD>THE INTRO∣DUCTION,
OR PRE∣face
necessary to bee read
by the Peruser of
this Booke.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He designe, and end which
the Author hath in publi∣shing
these few sheets of
Paper, shall be made knowne unto
thee in a few following Paragraphs.</P>
<P>First, Being a man full of lei∣sure,
hee thought they might <MILESTONE N="I"/>
(through Gods blessing) prove a
few well spent houres to compose
some little <HI>Theologicall tractate,</HI>
or <HI>manuall of Devotion,</HI> which
might be truly usefull to militant
Christians, either to <HI>beget,</HI> or <HI>pre∣serve</HI>
Religion in their hearts.
Wherein he had a speciall aime to
serve the Salvation of two sorts
of people: first, of his <HI>Parcchiall
charge,</HI> or the slocke whereof hee
is made an Over-seer; Secondly,


<PB REF="8"/>
of such <HI>Christian friends</HI> and ac∣quaintance
(of what degree soever)
dispersed here and there, as did
more peculiarly love his person,
or approve his work in the ministery
thinking he might take more liber∣ty
and boldnesse of speech to speake
unto every of them in the lan∣guage
of <HI>Saint Paul</HI> to his Schol∣ler
<HI>Timothy: Thou hast fully
knowne my doctrine: continue
thou in the things which thou
hast learned and hast beene assu∣red
of, knowing of whom thou
hast learned them.</HI> 2 Tim. 3.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="II"/> 2. His Second thoughts were,
in so doing to practise <HI>selfe-deni∣all,</HI>
in meerely serving Vertue, and
not fame; and not to theame his
pen with some high and applau∣ded
subiect, but to apply him∣selfe
to what should bee I. most
plaine and easie for the <HI>understan∣ding.</HI>
2 most short and contracted
for the <HI>memory.</HI> 3 most methodi∣call
and disposed, to take the <HI>fan∣cy.</HI>
4. Serious and weighty, to


<PB REF="8"/>
worke on the <HI>Conscience,</HI> and la∣stly
usefull and practicall in re∣gard
of the <HI>will and affections,</HI>
that thus it might have a kindly
working on all the severall <HI>pow∣ers</HI>
and <HI>faculties</HI> of the Soule.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Hereupon hee resol∣ved <MILESTONE N="III"/>
to draw and pourtray the
whole entire <HI>body of divioitie</HI> com∣monly
called <HI>The revealed will of
God,</HI> and cast it into little moulds
or formes, as <HI>Alexander</HI> did all
<HI>Homers</HI> Iliads into a nut-shell, and
as <HI>Regiomontanus</HI> did his exquisite
motions into the little body of a flie,
yet so as he endeavoured to free it
from those two monstrosities both
of Nature and Art, <HI>Defect</HI> of any
thing necessary on the one hand, and
<HI>redundancie</HI> or excesse of any thing
superfluous on the other.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Hee acquired and <MILESTONE N="IIII"/>
looked into most of all the fa∣mous
and notorious institutions of
Religion, Systemes of Divinitie
Common places, Theologicall the∣ses,
Catechismes both of topi∣call


<PB REF="9"/>
Churches, and particular men,
famed all over the Christian world,
and cried up to be <HI>Orthodox, me∣thodicall</HI>
and <HI>receaved,</HI> that at
least observing the <HI>Oeconomie</HI> and
<HI>fabricke</HI> of every one, and how the
same truths did concurre in a di∣verse
method and order of han∣dling,
there might out of all of
them together compared and col∣lated
result and arise what the
Author heereof doth now in these
ensuing Schedules present.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="V"/> Fifthly, But then considering
that there is the same danger in a
spirituall flocke as was in <HI>Jacobs,</HI>
Gen. 33. 13. the ghostly guide
may over-drive the Children
that are tender, and the heards
that are with young, whereas to
lead on softly, is safe; and consi∣dering
againe that there are three
sorts, or rather degrees in Religi∣on,
First, <HI>Beginners</HI> or probatio∣ners,
Secondly, <HI>Proficients,</HI> or
growers, and lastly <HI>growne</HI> and
full statured Christians, Ephesi∣ans


<PB REF="9"/>
4. 11, who may challenge the
brave title and clogy of <HI>Mnason,</HI>
Act 21, 16, <HI>an old disciple:</HI> yea
that the Scripture it selfe allow∣eth,
and beareth up this distincti∣on
in two severall texts, both 1 Ioh.
Epist. chap. 2. verse 13. under the
titles of<SUP>1</SUP> <HI>Children,<SUP>2</SUP> Young men,
and<SUP>3</SUP> Fathers;</HI> and also Marke
4. 28. under the tearmes of<SUP>1</SUP>
the <HI>blade,</HI> <SUP>2</SUP> the <HI>Eare,</HI> <SUP>3</SUP> the <HI>ripe
corne in the eare:</HI> Hereupon the
Author hath endeavoured to make
sacred Divinitie hold proportion
with the severall <HI>strengths</HI> and
<HI>capabilities</HI> of Christians, casting
it into three severall moulds or
formes: The first of 12 Queries
and Responses, according to the
number of the howers of the day,
or moneths of the Yeere, intended
to bee the <HI>Childs Divinitie.</HI> the
second of 31. after the number of
daies in the moneth, which is the
<HI>young mans Divinitie.</HI> The third
into 52. as there are weekes in the
yeere, which you may call the <HI>old


<PB REF="10"/>
mans Divinitie,</HI> as the severall
Title-pages preceding each tra∣ctate
will more fully declare.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="VI"/> Sixtly, and Lastly, whereas the
worthy addressing of a mans selfe
to the Lords table, to receive the
blessed Sacrament of the body and
bloud of Christ is, and hath ever
beene esteemed an high piece of
Pietie, and one of the most eminent
performances which a militant
Christian can goe about, as being
one of the neerest approaches wee
can make to God: therefore as a
<HI>Coronis</HI> to the rest, here is anne∣xed
an <HI>Alphabet,</HI> or <HI>Abecedary
tractate</HI> concerning the Lords sup∣per,
and our profitable comming
thereunto, as the frontispice-lease
thereof doth shew.</P>
<P>And this is all the Author hath
to say anent this little worke and
his intent in publishing of it. There
yet remaines something to be ad¦ded
touching the right use thereof,
in the behalfe of the <HI>usufructuary,</HI>
or whosoever hands these treatises


<PB REF="10"/>
may fall into: in which regard the
Authour proposeth these Counsels
and Advertisements.</P>
<P>First, Hee adviseth that by all
meanes the <HI>chiefes</HI> and <HI>superin∣tendents</HI>
of families, and schooles
who are both <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI>
within their owne sept and verge,
see that those who are under their
goverment bee initiated and instru∣cted
in the principles of Religion,
whilst they are yet of very tender
yeares. for it is scarce to be credi∣ted,
if experience did not ascertaine
the truth thereof, either how inept
and indisposed unto divine know∣ledge
such are, as are stept into
yeeres, and having first filled their
heads, and bardened their hearts
with worldly-mindednesse have
thereby prevented, aud praeoccu∣pated
the enterance of the things
of God: or on the other hand how
naturally and sweetly Catechisme
is <HI>sucked</HI> in with the Mothers
milke, <HI>rocked</HI> in with the Nurse,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">As in <HI>A∣thanasius,</HI> and his play-fel∣lowes, <HI>Ba∣ronius</HI> ad annum 311</NOTE>
<HI>sported</HI> in with play-fellowes,


<PB REF="11"/>
<HI>hired</HI> in with nuts and apples, <HI>awed</HI>
in with the twig of a rod, &amp;c. which
howsoever at first in them it may
be no more oft times than the bare
letter, or<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Rom. 2. 20. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>forme of knowledge,</HI>
yet by the Spirits worke ere long
may bee improved unto <HI>Saving
knowledge.</HI> This those worthy
auncient Christians knew well,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Hieron ep. 7. &amp; 27. &amp; Baron. ad an. 384. n. 4.</NOTE>
who taught their infants first to
loose their tongues into the articu∣late,
and syllabicall pronunciati∣on
of the word <HI>Hallelujah.</HI> And
surely it's as easie to teach Chil∣dren
to say <HI>Hosanna</HI> to Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arist. me∣taphys. 1.</NOTE> as
<HI>bald-pate</HI> to <HI>Elisha. Aristotle</HI> pro∣veth
the sweetnesse of knowledge
by this, that the mouths of Chil∣dren
are so full of questions: and
there is this reason further in Di∣vinitie,
that those who are yet <HI>in∣nocent
as doves,</HI> shall receive such
irradiation of divine light from
God, as to bee <HI>wise as Serpents,</HI>
and those whose wills doe cleave
unto <HI>good,</HI> their understanding
shall approach unto <HI>Truth.</HI></P>
<P>

<PB REF="11"/>
2. The second Advertisement
is this, that the <HI>Catechist,</HI> that is,
hee, or shee, who takes upon them
the office to instruct, and Cate∣chize
others, stand in some faire
and neere relation to the <HI>Catechu∣menoi,</HI>
that is, those who are taught
and instructed: by which meanes it
comes to passe that their principles
are more <HI>authentick, authoritative</HI>
and <HI>magisteriall,</HI> and the doctrine
which they instill, proves both
more <HI>strong,</HI> by reason of the cre∣dit
of a Superiour, and more
<HI>sweet,</HI> by reason of the love of a
familiar. Oh then documents
sticke, when wee can say, <HI>I know
of whom I have learned them.</HI>
Then rudiments and grounds are
indeed <HI>Nailes</HI> to fasten in the
memory, and <HI>goads</HI> to pricke on
the Affections, Eccles. 12. 11.
Thus <HI>Samuel</HI> was instructed by
<HI>Eli,</HI> and young <HI>Jehoash</HI> by <HI>Jeho∣jadah,</HI>
both Priests; the great
Eunuch by <HI>Philip,</HI> a Deacon;
<HI>Paul</HI> by his tutour <HI>Gamaliel; Ti∣mothy</HI>


<PB REF="12"/>
by his mother, and Grand∣mother,
<HI>Lois</HI> and <HI>Eunice; Ori∣gen</HI>
by his father <HI>Leonides; Gor∣gonia</HI>
by her brother <HI>Nazianzene;</HI>
Saint <HI>Basil</HI> by his nurse <HI>Macri∣na;</HI>
and Saint <HI>Hierom</HI> comman∣ded
the Lady <HI>Paula</HI> to set her
maids to learne the Scriptures.
Neither ought any one thinke they
lesson themselves unto any low
indecencies in playing the duty of
a <HI>Catechist</HI> towards their <HI>No∣vices;</HI>
whilst they see whole Chur∣ches,
Counsels both nationall and
oecumenicall, particular men of
signall note and fame, such as <HI>Lu∣ther,</HI>
and <HI>Calvin,</HI> calling off their
pennes from learned Commenta∣ries,
positive Divinitie, polemicall
disputes, exquisite Sermons, and
the like, even to write Cate∣chismes
by way of question and
answer. Yea how many fathers are
there both of the Greeke and La∣tine
Church which have their pe∣culiar
<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Rom 6. 17.</NOTE><HI>forme of doctrine,</HI> or<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> 2. Tim. 1. 13.</NOTE> <HI>hy∣potyposis
of wholsome words?


<PB REF="12"/>
Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandira</HI> his Pae∣dagogue;
<HI>Cyrill</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> his
Catechisme, <HI>Origen</HI> that famous
Catechist his bookes of principles,
<HI>Theodoret</HI> his Epitome of divine
precepts, <HI>Lactantius</HI> his instituti∣ons,
<HI>Augustine</HI> his encheiridion,
&amp;c. Neither could it bee credi∣ted,
if the voucher were not histo∣ries
of singular esteeme, how emi∣nent
persons for learning, vertue,
and honour have descended even
unto the practiques herein, one I
cannot omit: Saint <HI>Hierom, for
learning</HI> so great a Clerke, as S.
<HI>Augustine</HI> seriously wished to e∣quallize
him, <HI>for sanctity</HI> so rare,
as it is farre more easy to <HI>counter∣feit</HI>
him then <HI>imitate</HI> him: hee ha¦ving
exhorted <HI>Leta</HI> to send her
daughter to her Grandmother
<HI>Paula</HI> at <HI>Bethleem,</HI> to be educated
there, addes certaine words, wher∣by
hee binds himselfe to become
master and Catechist to the child,
saying hee will carry her upon his
armes, and on his shoulders, and


<PB REF="13"/>
that as old as hee was, hee would
teach her stammeringly to pro∣nounce
her words, and that in this
regard hee would not esteeme him∣selfe
lesse glorious then <HI>Aristotle,</HI>
who had <HI>Alexander</HI> the sonne of
<HI>Philip,</HI> King of <HI>Macedon</HI> for his
Scholler, &amp;c.</P>
<P>3. The third Advertisement
must be this, that the disciple or
scholler be throughly acquainted by
his Catechist and instructer with
the <HI>Scheme</HI> and <HI>method</HI> of his in∣stitution
or Catechisme, for as in
reading of holy Scripture, who so
meanes to understand what hee
reades, must labour to get into his
head the structure and fabricke,
that is, the <HI>Oeconomie,</HI> and <HI>or∣der</HI>
of that booke of holy writ, that
he is reading: So whosoever would
bee fully instructed in Christian
Religion, must first get unto him∣selfe
a perfect and methodicall
forme of sound doctrine, and then
before he goe to particulars, must
possesse his understanding of the


<PB REF="13"/>
generall lineaments and portrai∣ture
of that body of Divinitie,
which hee meanes to make his com∣passe
for his knowledge to saile by.
To instance in these subsequent
moulds and formes of Divinitie.
The oeconomie and disposition of
the first stands in the unfolding of
three points, 1. Mans <HI>misery</HI> by <MILESTONE N="I"/>
the fall. 2. His <HI>redresse</HI> from
that misery. 3. His <HI>thankeful∣nesse</HI>
for that redresse: which is
also the manner and forme both
of the Heidelberge Catechisme, au∣thorized
through all the low Coun∣tries,
and the Palatinate, and al∣so
of Alstedius his Catechisme

<MILESTONE N="III"/> The third is of a circular
forme, like a snake holding the
taile in the mouth: of which forme
also are divers of Davids Psalmes
which are called circular Odes, as
Psalm. 8. and 117. and the five
last Psalmes. Enterance is made
into it by the very same quere that
Calvin doth into his so famous Ca∣techisme,
that it is translated into
all the 3. learned Languages, La∣tine,
Greeke, and Hebrew; and
from thence, like the river of E∣den,
Gen. 2. 10. it spreads it selfe
into 4 heads, the first of <HI>Faith,</HI> or
thinges to bee beleeved, the se∣cond
of <HI>Love,</HI> or thinges to bee
done, The third of <HI>Prayer,</HI> or
things to be asked, and the fourth
of the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> or thinges to be
sealed: and this is the Oeconomie
of Canisius, and Bellarmines Ca∣echismes,

&amp;c. And to adde a <MILESTONE N="IIII"/>
word touching the mode and forme
of the last tractate, concerning the
holy Eucharist and the communi∣cants
worthy receiving of it, it's
method is pure Scripturall, for who
so hath but saluted the holy ori∣giuall
tongue of the old Testament
knowes that<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Quadru∣pliciplanxit alphabeto Hieron, praefat.</NOTE> Ieremies Threnes and

and purpose, to helpe memory both
to <HI>attaine</HI> and <HI>retaine</HI> them with
greater ease and lesse industry.
And beside the authority of Scrip∣ture
to warrant this way of com∣posing;<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Baron. ad an. 392. num. 6.</NOTE>
Ecclesiasticall History
makes mention of an <HI>Abecedary
Psalme,</HI> which Saint Augustine so
made up against the Donatists.</P>
<P>The 4. and last advertisement
is this, that to make a brave know∣ing
and intellectuall Christian in∣deed,
the way is, to referre the Scrip∣ture
which he reads, and the Ser¦mons
he heares, unto those heads
and points of Catechisme, where∣unto


<PB REF="15"/>
they specially and most pro∣perly
belong. And to doe this
the better, learners and beginners
are not onely to make use of their
owne dexterity and skill so farre
as they are able, but also till they
be well versed in this way, consult
with their Superiours and teach∣ers,
get them to looke over them
while they practise, intreat them
freely to use their <HI>asteriskes</HI> of
approbation where they hit, and
their spunges and <HI>obeliskes</HI> where
they misse. The benefit redounding
hence will be this, First, an ad∣mirable
establishment and confir∣mation
of the truth to see ser∣mons,
bookes, Scriptures, &amp;c. all
to concurre and be concentrique to∣gether.
Secondly, an excellent in∣geny
and quicknesse both in pro∣ving
the principles and fundamen∣tals
of Religion by Scripture, and
in referring texts of Scripture, and
Sermons to principles of Cate∣chisme,
which may bee called the
<HI>Genesis</HI> and <HI>Analysis</HI> of Divinity.


<PB REF="15"/>
And I doubt not but by practise a
Lay Christian may doe as much as
Cartwright,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Cart∣wrights</HI> comment on the Proverbs.</NOTE> who hath referred
every Proverbe of Solomon to one
of the ten Precepts of the morall
Law.</P>
<P>The Author now thinkes hee
hath prefaced sufficiently, and
will remove <HI>manum de tabula</HI> as
speedily as if hee heard an Angell
from Heaven say, <HI>hold thy hand,
it is enough;</HI> in all which if hee
have iudged any thing <HI>truly,</HI> or
