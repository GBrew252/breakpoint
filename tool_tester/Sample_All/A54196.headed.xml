perceive the Subject, of it,
<HI>viz. The Light of Christ
in Man, as the Manifesta∣tion
of Gods Love, for
Mans Happiness.</HI> Now,
for as much as this is the
<PB REF="3"/>
<HI>Peculiar</HI> Testimony and
<HI>Characteristick</HI> of the Peo∣ple
called <HI>Quakers;</HI> their
great <HI>Fundamental</HI> in Re∣ligion:
That by which they
have been distinguished
from other Professors of
Christianity, in their Time,
and to which they refer all
People about Faith, <HI>Wor∣ship,</HI>
and <HI>Practice,</HI> both
in their Ministry and Wri∣tings:
That as the Fingers
shute out of the Hand, and
the Branches from the Bo∣dy
of the Tree, so, true Re∣ligion,
<PB REF="3"/>
in all the Parts and
Articles of it, Springs
from this Divine Princi∣ple
in Man: And because
the Prejudices of some are
very great against this Peo∣ple
and their Way; and that
others, who Love their Se∣riousness
and commend their
good Life, are yet, through
Mistakes, or want of Inqui∣ry,
under <HI>Jealousie</HI> of their
Vnsoundness in some Points
of Faith; and that there
are not a few in all Perswa∣sions
which desire earnestly
<PB REF="4"/>
to know and enjoy God in
that sensible Manner this
People speak of, and who
seem to long after a State of
Holiness and Acceptance
with God; but are under
Doubts and Dispondings of
attaining it, from the want
they find in themselves of in∣ward
Power to enable them,
and are unacquainted with
this Efficacious <HI>Agent,</HI>
which God hath given and
appointed for their Supply▪</P>
<P>For these Reasons and
Motives know, <HI>Reader,</HI> I
<PB REF="4"/>
<HI>and so often trod upon and
treated as the Off-scour∣ing
of the Earth, are the
People of God, and Chil∣dren
of the most High.</HI>
Bear with me <HI>Reader,</HI> I
know what I say, and am
not high minded but <HI>fear.</HI>
For I write with <HI>Humi∣lity</HI>
towards God, though
with <HI>Confidence</HI> towards
thee. Not that thou shouldst
believe upon my Authority
nothing less, for that's not
Act upon Knowledge but
<HI>Trust:</HI> But that thou
<PB REF="5"/>
shouldst try and prove what I
write: For that is all I
ask, as well as all I need,
for thy Conviction and my
own Justification: The
whole, indeed, being but a
spiritual Experiment upon
the Soul, and therefore seeks
for no implicite Credit, be∣cause
it is Self-evident to
them that will uprightly try
it.</P>
<P>And when thou, <HI>Rea∣der,</HI>
shalt come to be ac∣quainted
with this <HI>Princi∣ple,</HI>
and the plain and hap∣py
<PB REF="5"/>
Teachings of it, thou
wilt, with us, admire thou
shouldst live so long a <HI>Stran∣ger</HI>
to that which was so
<HI>near</HI> thee, and as much won∣der
that other Folks should
be so blind as not to see it,
as formerly thou thoughtest
us singular for obeying it.
The Day, I believe, is at
hand, that will declare this
with an uncontroulable Au∣thority,
because it will be
with an unquestionable E∣vidence.</P>
<P>I have done, <HI>Reader,</HI>
<PB REF="6"/>
with this Preface, when <HI>I</HI>
have told thee. <HI>First,</HI> That
<HI>I</HI> have stated the <HI>Principle,</HI>
and opened, as God has en∣abled
me, the <HI>Nature</HI> and
<HI>Virtue</HI> of it in <HI>Religion:</HI>
Wherein the <HI>common Do∣ctrines</HI>
and <HI>Articles</HI> of the
Christian Religion, are deli∣vered
and improved; and in
which, <HI>I</HI> have endeavoured
to express my self in <HI>Plain</HI>
and <HI>Proper</HI> Terms, and not
in <HI>Figurative, Allegorical,</HI>
or <HI>Doubtful</HI> Phrases; that
so <HI>I</HI> may leave <HI>no room</HI> for
<PB REF="6"/>
an Equivocal or Double
Sence; but that the <HI>Truth</HI>
of the Subject <HI>I</HI> treat upon,
may appear <HI>Easily</HI> and <HI>Evi∣dently</HI>
to every common
Vnderstanding. Next, I
have confirmed what I have
writ, by Scripture, Reason
and the Effects of it, upon
so great a People; whose
uniform, concurrence in the
Experience and Practice
thereof, through all Times
and Sufferings, since a Peo∣ple,
challenge the Notice
and Regard of every serious
<PB REF="7"/>
<HI>Reader.</HI> Thirdly, <HI>I</HI> have
written <HI>briefly,</HI> that so it
might be every ones Mony
and Reading: And, much
in a little is best, when
we see daily that the <HI>Richer</HI>
People grow, the <HI>less</HI> Mo∣ny
or Time they have for
God, and Religion: And
perhaps, those that would not
buy a large Book, may find
in their Hearts to give a∣way
some of these, for their
Neighbours Good, being
little and Cheap. Be seri∣ous,
Reader, be Impartial
<PB REF="7"/>
and then be as <HI>Inquisitive</HI>
as thou canst; and that
for thine own Soul, as
well as the Credit of this
most <HI>misunderstood</HI> and <HI>a∣bused</HI>
People: And the
God and Father of <HI>Lights</HI>
and <HI>Spirits,</HI> so bless thine,
in the Perusal of this
short <HI>Treatise,</HI> that thou
mayst receive real Benefit
by it, to his Glory and
thine own Comfort: Which
is the Desire and End of
him that wrote it; who is,

The Nature of it. Sect.

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P><HI>§. 1. THat which the Peo∣ple
called</HI> Quakers
<HI>lay down, as a main</HI>
Fundamental <HI>in Re∣ligion
is this,</HI> That God, through
Christ, hath placed a Principle in every
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
Man, to inform him of his Duty and
to enable him to do it; and that those
that live up to this Principle, are the
People of God, and those that live in
Disobedience to it, are not God's Peo∣ple,
what ever Name they may bear, or
Profession they may make <HI>of Religion.
This is their</HI> Ancient, First <HI>and</HI> Stand∣ing
<HI>Testimony: With this they be∣gan,
and this they bore, and do bare
to the World.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 2. By this <HI>Principle</HI> they un∣derstand
something that is <HI>Divine,</HI>
and though in Man, <HI>yet not of Man,</HI>
but of God; that came from him,
and leads to him all those that will be
lead by it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 3. There are divers ways of
speaking, they have been led to
use, by which they declare and
express what this <HI>Principle</HI> is,
about which I think fit to Precau∣tion
the Reader. <HI>viz.</HI> They call
it <HI>the Light of Christ within Man,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>

Leaven that Leavens the whole
Lump of Man:</HI> Which are many of
them Figurative Expressions, but all
of them such as the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> hath
used, and which will be used in this
<HI>Treatise,</HI> as they are most frequently
in the Writings and Ministry of this
People. But that this <HI>Variety</HI> and
Manner of Expression, may not oc∣casion
any Misapprehension or Con∣fusion
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
in the Understanding of the
<HI>Reader,</HI> I would have him know,
that they always mean by those
Terms or Denominations, not an <HI>o∣ther,</HI>
but the <HI>same Principle,</HI> before
mentioned: Which, as I said, though
it be in Man, is not of Man, but of
God, and therefore <HI>Divine:</HI> And
one in it self, though diversly ex∣pressed
by the Holy Men, according
to the various Manifestations and O∣perations
thereof.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 4. It is to This Principle of <HI>Light,
Life</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> that this People refer
all: For they say it is the great <HI>A∣gent</HI>
in Religion; <HI>That,</HI> without
which, there is no <HI>Conviction,</HI> so no
<HI>Conversion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John 3. 5.</NOTE> or <HI>Rege∣neration;</HI>
and conse∣quently
no entring into the King∣dom
of God. That is to say, there
can be no true <HI>sight</HI> of Sin, nor <HI>sor∣row</HI>
for it, and therefore no forsaking
or overcoming of it, or Remission
or Justification from it. A necessa∣ry
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
and powerful Principle indeed,
when neither Sanctification, nor Ju∣stification
can be had without it. In
short, there is no becoming Virtu∣ous,
Holy and Good without this
Principle; no acceptance with God,
nor Peace of Soul, but through it.
But on the contrary, that the Rea∣son
of so much <HI>Irreligion</HI> among
Christians, so much <HI>Superstition,</HI> in∣stead
of Devotion, and so much Pro∣fession
without Injoyment, and so
little <HI>Heart-Reformation,</HI> is because
People, in Religion, <HI>Over-look</HI>
this Principle, and leave it behind
them.</P>
<P>They will be Religious <HI>without</HI> it,
and Christians without it; though
this be the only means of making
them so indeed: So natural it is to
Man, in his degenerate Estate, to
<HI>prefer</HI> Sacrifice before Obedience,
and to make Prayers go for Pra∣ctice,
and so flatter himself to Hope,
by Ceremonial and Bodily Services,
to excuse himself with God, from
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
the stricter Discipline of this Princi∣ple
in the Soul; which leads Man to
take up the Cross, deny self, and do
that which God requires of him:
And that is every Mans true Religi∣on,
and every such Man is truly Re∣ligious:
That is, he is <HI>Holy, Humble,
Patient, Meek, Merciful, Just, Kind</HI>
and <HI>Charitable;</HI> which, they say, no
Man can make himself; but that this
Principle will make all them so, that
will embrace the <HI>Convictions,</HI> and
<HI>Teachings</HI> of it; being the <HI>Root</HI> of all
true Religion in Man, and the <HI>Good-Seed,</HI>
from whence all Good Fruits
proceed. To summ up, what they
say upon the Nature and Virtue of
it, as Contents of that which fol∣lows,
they declare that this Princi∣ple,
is, First, <HI>Divine.</HI> Secondly, <HI>V∣niversal.</HI>
Thirdly, <HI>Efficacious:</HI> In that
it gives Man.</P>
<P>First, The Knowledge of God and
of himself, <HI>and therein a sight of his</HI>
Duty, <HI>and</HI> Disobedience <HI>to it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, It begets a true Sence and
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
Sorrow for Sin, <HI>in those that seri∣ously
regard the Convictions of it.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, It enables them to forsake
Sin and Sanctifies from <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, It applies Gods Mercies in
Christ for the forgiveness of Sins that
are past, unto Justification, upon such
Sincere Repentance and Obedience.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly, It gives the Faithful Perse∣verance
unto a Perfect Man, and the
Assurance of Blessedness World with∣out
End.</HI> To the Truth of all which,
they call in a Threefold Evidence:
<HI>First,</HI> The <HI>Scriptures,</HI> which give
an ample Witness, especially those
of the New and better Testament.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Reasonableness</HI> of it
in it self. And <HI>Lastly,</HI> A <HI>General
Experience,</HI> in great Measure: But
particularly <HI>their Own,</HI> made credi∣ble
by the good Fruits they have
brought forth, and the Answer God
has given to their Ministry: Which,
to impartial Observers, have com∣mended
the Principle, and gives me
Occasion to abstract their <HI>History,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
in divers Particulars, for a Conclu∣sion
to this little <HI>Treatise.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 1. I Shall begin with the Evi∣dence
of the blessed Scrip∣tures
of Truth for this <HI>Divine Prin∣ciple,</HI>
and that under the Name of
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<HI>Light,</HI> the first and most common
Word, used by them, to express
and denominate this Principle by;
as well as most apt and proper in
this dark State of the World.</P>
<P>John 1. 1. In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word <HI>was God.</HI></P>
<P>Ver. 3. All things were made <HI>by
him;</HI></P>

Life</HI> was the <HI>Light</HI> of Men.</P>
<P>Ver. 9. <HI>That</HI> was the <HI>true Light,
which Lighteth every</HI> Man that

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 2. I have begun with him,
that begun his History with the be∣ginning
of the Creation of God; the
most beloved Disciple, and longest
Liver of all the Apostles, and he,
that for his excelling Knowledge and
Wisdom in heavenly Things, is
justly entituled, <HI>John the Divine.</HI>
He tells us, first, what he was in
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
the Beginning, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Word.
<HI>In the beginning was the Word.</HI></HI></P>
<P>And though that shews what the
<HI>Word</HI> must be, yet he adds and ex∣plains,
that the <HI>Word was with God,
and was God;</HI> lest any should doubt
of the Divinity of the Word, or
have lower Thoughts of him than he
deserved. The <HI>Word,</HI> then, is <HI>Di∣vine;</HI>
and an apt Term it is that the
<HI>Evangelist</HI> stiles him by, since it is
so great an Expression of the Wis∣dom
and Power of God to Men.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 3. <HI>All things were made by him.</HI>
If so, he wants no Power. And if
we were made by him, we must be
new made by him too, or we can
never enjoy God. His Power shews
his Dignity, and that nothing can be
too hard for such a sufficiency as made
all things, and without which no∣thing
was made that was made. As
Man's Maker must be his <HI>Husband,</HI>
so his Creator must be his <HI>Redeem∣er</HI>
also.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 4. <HI>In him was Life, and the Life
was the Light of Men.</HI> This is <HI>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Point.</HI> The <HI>Evangelist</HI> first begins
with the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Being</HI> of the
<HI>Word:</HI> From thence he descends to
the <HI>Works</HI> of the <HI>Word:</HI> And lastly,
then he tells us what the <HI>Word</HI> is
with respect to <HI>Man,</HI> above the rest
of the Creation, <HI>viz. The Word was
Life, and the Life was the Light of
Men.</HI> The Relation must be very
near and intimate, when the very
<HI>Life</HI> of the Word <HI>(that was with
God, and was God)</HI> is the <HI>Light of
Men:</HI> As if Man were next to the
Word, and above all the rest of his
Works; for it is not said so of any
other Creature.</P>
<P>Man cannot want <HI>Light</HI> then; no
not a <HI>Divine Light:</HI> For if this be
not <HI>Divine,</HI> that is the <HI>Life</HI> of the
<HI>Divine</HI> Word, there can be no such
thing at all as <HI>Divine</HI> or <HI>Supernatural</HI>
Light and Life. And the Text does
not only prove the <HI>Divinity</HI> of the
Light, but the <HI>Vniversality</HI> of it al∣so,
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
because the <HI>Man</HI> mentioned in
it, is <HI>Mankind:</HI> Which is yet more
distinctly express'd in the 9th <HI>verse,
That was the True Light, which lighteth
<HI>every</HI> Man that cometh into the
World.</HI> Implying, that he that
lighteth not Mankind is not that
<HI>True Light;</HI> and therefore <HI>John</HI> was
not that <HI>Light,</HI> but bore witness of
him that was, who <HI>lighted every
Man;</HI> to wit, the <HI>Word</HI> that took
Flesh: So that both the <HI>Divine
Nature,</HI> and <HI>Vniversality</HI> of the Light
of Christ within, are confirmed to∣gether.</P>

by the Holy Ghost, than this I have
produced, yet hardly hath any place
been more industriously wrested
from its true and plain Sence: E∣specially
since this People have laid
any Stress upon it, in Defence of
their Testimony of the <HI>Light with∣in.</HI>
Some will have it to be but a
<HI>Natural</HI> Light, or a <HI>Part of Man's
Nature,</HI> though it be the <HI>very Life</HI>
of the <HI>Word</HI> by which the World
was made; and wrapt within those
Verses which only concern his <HI>Eter∣nal
Power and Godhead.</HI> But, because
I would be understood, and treat of
things with all plainness, I will o∣pen
the Terms of the Objection as
well as I can, and then give my An∣swer
to it.</P>

<P>§. 2. If by <HI>Natural</HI> be meant a
Created thing, as Man is, or any
thing that is requisite to the Com∣position
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
of Man, I deny it: The
Text is expresly against it; and says,
the Light with which Man is light∣ed,
is the <HI>Life of the World, which
was with God and was God.</HI> But if
by Natural is only intended, that
the Light comes along with us in∣to
the World; or that we have it
as sure as we are Born, or have Na∣ture;
and is the <HI>Light</HI> of our Na∣ture,
of our Minds, and Under∣standings,
and is not the result of
any Revelation from without, as by
Angels or Men; then we mean and
intend the <HI>same</HI> thing. For it is <HI>Na∣tural</HI>
to Man to have a <HI>Supernatural</HI>
Light, and for the <HI>Creature,</HI> to be
lighted by an <HI>uncreated</HI> Light, as is
the Life of the <HI>Creating Word.</HI> And
did People but consider the Constitu∣tion
of Man, it would conduce much
to preserve or deliver them from any
Dilemma upon this account. For
Man can no more be a light to his
Mind then he is to his Body: He
has the Capacity of seeing Objects
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
when he has the help of Light, but
cannot be a Light to himself by
which to See them. Wherefore as
the <HI>Sun</HI> in the Firmament is the
Light of the Body, and gives us dis∣cerning
in our Temporal Affairs; so
the <HI>Life</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> is the glorious
<HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Sun</HI> of the <HI>Soul:</HI> Our <HI>In∣tellectual
Luminary,</HI> that informs our
Mind and give us true Judgment and
Distinction about those things that
more immediately concern our Bet∣ter,
Inward, and Eternal Man.</P>

<P>§. 4. There is a Third Sort that
will needs have it understood, not
of any Illumination by a Divine
Light or Spirit in Man, but by the
<HI>Doctrine</HI> Christ Preached and the
<HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Example</HI> he Lived, and led
in the World; and which yet neither
reach'd the thousandth Part of Man∣kind,
nor can consist with what the
Apostle <HI>John</HI> intends in the begin∣ning
of his History, which wholly
relates to what Christ was before he
took Flesh, or at least, what he is
to the Soul, by his <HI>immediate Inshi∣nings</HI>
and <HI>Influences:</HI> 'Tis most true,
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
Christ was, in a Sence, the <HI>Light of
the World</HI> in that very Appearance,
and shined forth by his <HI>heavenly Do∣ctrine,</HI>
many admirable <HI>Miracles,</HI> and
his <HI>Self-denying Life,</HI> and <HI>Death:</HI> But
still that hinders not, but that he
was and <HI>is That Spiritual Light,</HI> which
shineth, more or less, in the Hearts,
of the Sons and Daughters of Men.
For as he was a <HI>Light</HI> in his Life
and Conversation, he was only a
Light in a more excellent Sence, then
he spoke of to his Disciples, when
he said, <HI>Ye are the Lights of the
World.</HI> But Christ the Word en∣lightned
them, and enlightens us,
and enlightens all Men that come
into the World; which he could
not be said to do, if we only regard
his Personal and Outward Appear∣ance:
For in that Sence it is long,
since he was that Light, but in
this, he is continually so. In that
respect he is <HI>Remote,</HI> but in this Sence
he is <HI>Present</HI> and <HI>Immediate,</HI> else we
should render the Text, <HI>That was
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
the True Light which <HI>did</HI> lighten,</HI> instead
of which <HI>Lighteth every Man that cometh
into the World.</HI> And that the Evan∣gelist
might be so understood as we
speak, he refers to this as an Evi∣dence
of <HI>His</HI> being the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and
not <HI>John;</HI> for whom many People
had much Reverence; for, <HI>verse</HI> 8.
he saith of <HI>John, He was not That
Light, but was sent to bear Witness of
That Light:</HI> Now comes his Proof and
our Testimony, <HI>That was the True
Light, which lighteth Every Man that
cometh into the World;</HI> which was
not <HI>John,</HI> nor any else, but the
<HI>Word that was with God, and was
God.</HI> The Evangelist did not de∣scribe
him by his Fasting Forty Days,
Preaching so many Sermons, Work∣ing
so many Miracles, and Living
so Holy a Life; and, after all, so pati∣ently
Suffering Death (which yet
Christ did) thereby to prove him
the Light of the World; but, says
the Evangelist, <HI>That was the True
Light, the Word in Flesh the Messi∣ah,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
and not <HI>John,</HI> or any else, <HI>which
lighteth Every Man that cometh into

and distinguished by giving
Light: And indeed so are all his Fol∣lowers
from other People, by <HI>recei∣ving</HI>
and <HI>obeying</HI> it. There are many

<P>§. 1. THe Third thing, is the
<HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Efficacy</HI> of this
Light for the end for which God
hath given it, <HI>viz. To lead and guide
the Soul of Man to Blessedness.</HI> In or∣der
to which, the first thing it does
in and for Man, is to give him a True
Sight or Discerning of himself: What
he is, and what he does; that he
may see and know his own Conditi∣on,
and what Judgment to make of
himself, with respect to Religion and
a future Estate: Of which, let us
hear what the <HI>Word</HI> himself saith,
that cannot Err, as <HI>John</HI> relates it,
<HI>Chap. 3. 20, 21. For every one that do∣eth
Evil, hateth the Light, neither
<PB N="23" REF="19"/>
cometh to the Light, least his deeds
should be Reproved. But he that doeth
Truth cometh to the Light, that his
deeds may be made Manifest, that they
are wrought in God.</HI> A most preg∣nant
Instance of the <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Au∣thority</HI>
of the Light. <HI>First,</HI> It is that
which Men ought to <HI>examine</HI> them∣selves
by. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It gives a <HI>true
Discerning</HI> betwixt Good and Bad,
<HI>what is of God, from what is not of
God.</HI> And <HI>Lastly,</HI> It is a <HI>Judge,</HI> and
condemneth or acquitteth, <HI>reproveth</HI>
or <HI>comforteth</HI> the Soul of Man, as he
rejects or obeys it. That must needs
be <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Efficacious,</HI> which is
able to discover to Man, what is of
God, from what is not of God; and
which gives him a <HI>Distinct</HI> Know∣ledge,
in himself, of what is wrought
in God, from what is not wrought in
God. By which it appears, that this
Place does not only regard the dis∣covery
of Man and his Works; but,
in some Measure, <HI>it manifesteth God,
and his Works also,</HI> which is yet some∣thing
<PB N="24" REF="20"/>
higher; for as much as it gives
the <HI>obedient</HI> Man a discovery of what
is wrought or performed by <HI>God's
Power, and after his Will,</HI> from what
is the meer Workings of the Crea∣ture
of himself. If it could not ma∣nifest
God, it could not tell Man
what was God's Mind, nor give him
such a grounded Sense and Discern∣ing
of the Rise, Nature, and Tenden∣cy
of the Workings of his mind or
Inward Man, as is both expressed and
abundantly implied in this Passage of
our Saviour. And if it reveals God,
to be sure it manifests Christ, that
flows and comes from God. Who
then would oppose or slight this
blessed Light?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 2. But that this <HI>Light</HI> doth
<HI>manifest</HI> God, is yet Evident from
<HI>Rom. 1. 19. Because that which may be
known of (God) is manifest in Men,
for God hath shewed it unto them.</HI> An
<HI>universal</HI> Proposition; and we have
the Apostles Word for it, who was
<HI>One of a Thousand,</HI> and inspired <HI>on
<PB N="25" REF="20"/>
purpose</HI> to tell us the Truth: Let it
then have its due weight with us.
If that which may be known of God
is manifest in Men, the People cal∣led
<HI>Quakers</HI> cannot, certainly, be out
of the Way in Preaching up the
<HI>Light within,</HI> without which, no∣thing
can be manifested to the mind
of Man; as saith the same Apostle to
the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> Eph. 5. 13. <HI>Whatsoe∣ver
doth make manifest is Light.</HI> Well
then may they call this Light with∣in
a <HI>Manifestation</HI> or <HI>Appearance of
God,</HI> that sheweth <HI>in</HI> and to Man <HI>all</HI>
that may be known of God. A pas∣sage
much like unto this, is that of the
Prophet <HI>Micah,</HI> Chap. 6. 8. <HI>God hath
shewed thee, O Man, what is good; and
what doth the Lord require of thee, but
to do justly, and to love Mercy, and to
walk humbly with thy God?</HI> God hath
<HI>shewed Thee, O Man!</HI> It is very Em∣phatical.
But how hath He shewed
him? Why by his <HI>Light in the Con∣science,</HI>
which the <HI>wicked Rebel a∣gainst,</HI>
Job 24. 13. <HI>Who,</HI> for that
<PB N="26" REF="21"/>
Cause, <HI>know not the ways, nor abide
in the Paths thereof: For its way are
ways of Pleasantness, and all its Paths
are Peace,</HI> to them that obey it.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 3. But the <HI>Light</HI> giveth the
<HI>Light of Life,</HI> which is <HI>Eternal Life</HI>
to them that receive and obey it.
Thus says the blessed
Saviour of the World.<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 8. 12.</NOTE>
<HI>I am the Light of the
VVorld, he that follweth me shall not
abide in Darkness, but shall have the
Light of Life.</HI> Now he is the Light

every Man that cometh into the
VVorld; and they that obey that
Light obey him, and therefore have
the Light of Life. That is, the <HI>Light</HI>
becomes <HI>Eternal Life</HI> to the Soul:
That as it is the <HI>Life</HI> of the <HI>VVord,</HI>
which is the <HI>Light</HI> in Man, so it be∣comes
the Life in Man through his
Obedience to it, as his <HI>Heavenly

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 4. Furthermore, this Light
was the very Ground of the <HI>Aposto∣lical
<PB N="27" REF="21"/>
Message,</HI> as the Beloved Disciple
assures us. <HI>This then
is the Message,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John 1. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE> <HI>which
we have heard of him,
and declare unto you, that God is Light,
and in him is no Darkness at all: If we
say we have Fellowship with him, and
walk in Darkness, we Lye and do not
the Truth: But if we walk in the Light,
as he is in the Light, we have Fellowship
one with another, and the Blood of Je∣sus
Christ cleanseth us from all Sin.</HI>
VVhich is so comprehensive of the
Virtue and Excellency of the Light,
in reference to Man, that there is
little need that more should be said
upon it; for as much as, <HI>First,</HI> It re∣veals
God, and that God himself is
Light. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It discovers Dark∣ness
from Light, and that there is
no fellowship between them. <HI>Third∣ly,</HI>
That Man ought to walk in the
Light. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> That it is the
VVay to obtain forgiveness of Sin,
and Sanctification from it. <HI>Fifthly,</HI>
That it is the Means to have Peace

as indeed it hath been, more than
once, objected upon us, <HI>That this is
another Light, not that Light where∣with

tells us, that <HI>in the VVord was
Life, and the <HI>Life</HI> was the Light of
Men, and that that very Light,</HI> that

1. 4, 9. VVhere is there as plain a
Text to be found against the suffici∣ency,
as well as Universality of the
Light within; or a plainer for any
Article of Faith in the whole Book
of God. Had the <HI>Beloved Disciple</HI> in∣tended
<HI>Two</HI> Lights, in his Evangelical

he would have noted to us his Distin∣ction:

we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eason to conclude he
meant the same.</P>

<P>§. 6. But if any shall yet Object,
<HI>That this is to be understood of a Spiri∣tual
Light, and that ours is but a Natu∣ral
one.</HI> I shall desire them to do two
things. <HI>1st</HI> To prove that a <HI>Natural</HI>
Light, as they phrase it, doth ma∣nifest
God, other then as I have be∣fore
explained and allowed; Since
whatever is part of Man, in his Con∣stitution,
but especially in his Dege∣neracy
from God, is so far from
Yielding him the knowledge of God,
that it cannot <HI>rightly</HI> Reprove or Dis∣cover
that which offends him, with∣out
the Light we speak of: And it
is Granted, that what we call <HI>Divine,</HI>
and some, Mistakenly, call <HI>Natural</HI>
Light, can do both. <HI>2dly</HI> If this
Light be <HI>Natural,</HI> Notwithstanding
it doth manifest our Duty, and Re∣prove
our Disobedience to God, they
would do well to assign us some
Certain <HI>Medium,</HI> or <HI>Way,</HI> whereby
we may truly discern, and distinguish
<PB N="30" REF="23"/>
between the Manifestations and Re∣proofs
of the <HI>Natural</HI> Light within,
from those of the <HI>Divine</HI> Light with∣in,
since they Allow the Manifesta∣tion
of God, and Reproof of Evil,
as well to the one, as to the other.
Let them give us but one Scripture
that distinguishes between a <HI>Natural</HI>
and a <HI>Spiritual Light within.</HI> They
may, with as much Reason, talk of
a <HI>Natural and Spiritual Darkness with∣in.</HI>
'Tis true, there is a natural
proper darkness, to wit, the Night
of the outward World; and there
is a Spiritual darkness, <HI>viz.</HI> The
<HI>clouded</HI> and <HI>benighted Vnderstandings</HI>
of Men, through disobedience to the
Light and Spirit of God: But let
them Assign us a Third, if they can.
People Use, indeed, to say, impro∣perly,
of Blind men, they are <HI>dark,</HI>
we may Call a <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>Idiot</HI> so,
if we will: But where is there ano∣ther
darkness of the Understand∣ing,
in the things of God? If they
can, I say, find that, In and about
<PB N="31" REF="23"/>
the things of God, they do some∣thing.</P>
<P>Christ distinguished not between
Darkness and Darkness, or Light
and Light, in any such sence; nor
did any of his Disciples: Yet both
have frequently spoken of Darkness
and Light. VVhat difference, pray,
doth the Scripture put between Spi∣ritual
Darkness and Darkness, menti∣oned
in these Places, <HI>Luke 1. 7, 9.
Mat. 4. 16. John 1. 5. John 3. 19.
John 8. 12, 31, 46. 1 Thess. 5. 4.

12. 2 Cor. 6. 14, 22. Eph. 5. 8. Col.</HI>

of them I find none. It is all one
Spiritual Darkness. Neither is there
so much as one Scripture that affords
us a Distinction between <HI>Light with∣in,
and Light within;</HI> or that there
are really <HI>Two Lights</HI> from God, in
Man, that regard Religion. Peruse
<HI>Mat. 4. 16. Luke 2. 32. Chap. 15. 8.

Chap.</HI> 22. 5. And we believe the
greatest Opposer, to our Assertion,
will not be able to sever Light from
Light, or find out <HI>two Lights within,</HI>
in the Passages here mentioned, or any
other, to direct Man in his Duty to
God and his Neighbour: And if he
cannot, pray let him forbear his
<HI>mean Thoughts and VVords</HI> of the
<HI>Light of Christ within Man,</HI> as Man's
<HI>Guide</HI> in Duty to God and Man. For
as he must yield to us, that the Light
Manifesteth Evil, and Reproveth for
it, so doth Christ himself teach us
of the Light, <HI>John 3. 20. For every
one that doth Evil hateth the Light,
neither cometh unto the Light, lest his
Deeds should be reproved.</HI> And the
Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> plainly saith, <HI>Eph. 5.
13. But all things that are reproved
are made manifest by the Light;</HI> there∣fore
there are not two distinct Lights
<PB N="33" REF="24"/>
within, but one and the same <HI>Ma∣nifesting,
Reproving,</HI> and <HI>Teaching</HI>
Light within. And this the Apostle
<HI>John</HI> in his first Epistle makes plain,
beyond all Exception, to all Consi∣derate
People: <HI>First,</HI> In that he calls
God, <HI>Light,</HI> Chap. 1. 5. <HI>Secondly,</HI>
In that he puts no <HI>Medium,</HI> or <HI>Third</HI>
thing between that <HI>Light,</HI> and <HI>Dark∣ness,</HI>
Verse 6. <HI>If we say, we have Fel∣lowship
with him, and walk in Dark∣ness,
we Lye,</HI> &amp;c. Intimating, that
Men must walk either in <HI>Light</HI> or
<HI>Darkness,</HI> and not in a <HI>Third,</HI> or o∣ther
State or Region. I am sure,
that which manifests and reproves
Darkness <HI>cannot be Darkness.</HI> This
all Men must confess.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 7. And, as if the Apostle <HI>John</HI>
would have anticipated their Obje∣ction,
<HI>viz. 'Tis true, your Light with∣in
reproves for Evil, but it is not there∣fore
the Divine Light, which leads in∣to
higher things, and which comes by
the Gospel;</HI> he thus expresseth him∣self,
1 <HI>John Ch. 2. 8, 9. The Darkness is
<PB N="34" REF="25"/>
and the true Light now shineth. He
that saith he is in the Light, and hateth
his Brother, is in Darkness even until
now;</HI> which is not another Light then
that mentioned before, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. For
as Light is put there, in Opposition to
Darkness, so Light here, is put <HI>in
Opposition</HI> to Darkness. And as the
<HI>Darkness</HI> is the <HI>same,</HI> so must the
<HI>Light</HI> be the <HI>same.</HI> Wherefore we
may plainly see, that it is <HI>not another
Light,</HI> then that which reproves a
Man for <HI>hating his Brother,</HI> which
brings a Man <HI>into Fellowship with God,
and to the Blood of cleansing,</HI> as the
next Verse speaks: Therefore that
Light which reproveth a Man for ha∣ting
his Brother, <HI>is of a Divine and
Efficacious Nature.</HI> In short, That
Light which is opposite to, and re∣proves
Spiritual Darkness, in Man
and Woman, is a <HI>Spiritual</HI> Light;
but such a Light is that which we
Confess, Testifie to, and Maintain:
Therefore it is a <HI>Spiritual Light.</HI> It
is also worth our Notice, that the A∣postle
<PB N="35" REF="25"/>
useth the same Manner of Ex∣pression
here, <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. 8. The <HI>True
Light</HI> shineth, that he doth in his E∣vangelical
History, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. 9. That
was the <HI>True Light;</HI> intimating the
<HI>same</HI> Divine Word, or <HI>True</HI> Light
<HI>now</HI> shineth; and that it is the same
<HI>True Light</HI> in his account, that <HI>repro∣veth</HI>
such as <HI>hate their Brethren:</HI> Con∣sequently,
that Light that so repro∣veth
them, is the <HI>True</HI> Light. And
strange it is, that Christ and his Dis∣ciples,
but especially his beloved One,
should so often make that very Light,
which <HI>stoops</HI> to the <HI>lowest</HI> step of Im∣morality,
and to the reproof of the
<HI>grossest</HI> Evil, to be no other than the
<HI>same</HI> Divine <HI>Light,</HI> in a <HI>farther</HI> degree
of Manifestation, which brings such
as follow it to the <HI>Light of Life,</HI> to
the <HI>Blood of Cleansing,</HI> and to have
<HI>fellowship with God and one with ano∣ther.</HI>
Nay, not only so, but the A∣postle
makes a Mans being a <HI>Child of
God,</HI> to depend upon his <HI>Answering</HI>
of this Light in a <HI>palpable</HI> and common
<PB N="36" REF="26"/>
Case, <HI>viz. not hating of his Brother:</HI>
And that yet any should shut their
Eyes so fast against beholding the

we slight it because we come so ea∣sily

contemn them, or prize them? <HI>Prize</HI>
them certainly, as what we cannot
live, nor live <HI>comfortably,</HI> without.
The more general the Mercy is, the
greater, and therefore the greater
Obligation upon Man to live humbly

<P>Obj. <HI>BUt some may say,</HI> we could
willingly allow to the Spirit
and Grace of God, which seemed to be
the peculiar Blessing of the New and Se∣cond
Covenant, and the Fruit of the
coming of Christ, all that which you a∣scribe
to the <HI>Light within;</HI> but except
it appeared to us that this <HI>Light</HI> were the
same in Nature with the <HI>Spirit and
Grace</HI> of God, we cannot easily bring
our selves to believe what you say in fa∣vour
of the Light within.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This <HI>Objection,</HI> at first look,
seems to carry weight with it: But,
upon a just and serious Review, it will
appear to have more Words than
Matter, Show than Substance: Yet
<PB N="39" REF="27"/>
because it gives occasion to solve scru∣ples,
that may be flung in the way
of the Simple, I shall attend it
throughout. I say then, if it appear
that the <HI>Property's</HI> ascribed to the
<HI>Light within,</HI> are the same with those
that are given to the Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> and
<HI>Grace</HI> of God; and that those several
Terms or Epithytes, are only to ex∣press
the divers Manifestations or O∣perations
of one and the <HI>same Princi∣ple,</HI>
then it will not, it cannot be
denied, but this Light within, is <HI>Di∣vine</HI>
and <HI>Efficacious,</HI> as we have As∣serted
it. Now that it is of the same
Nature with the Spirit and Grace of
God, and tends to the same End,
which is to bring People to God; let
the <HI>Properties</HI> of the <HI>Light</HI> be com∣par'd
with those of the <HI>Spirit</HI> and
<HI>Grace</HI> of God. I say, they are the
same, in that, First, The Light pro∣ceeds
from the <HI>one Word,</HI>
and <HI>one Life</HI> of that <HI>one
Word,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John 1. 4.</NOTE> which was <HI>with</HI>
God and was <HI>God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John 1. 9.</NOTE> Secondly, It is
<PB N="40" REF="28"/>
<HI>Vniversal,</HI> it lighteth <HI>every</HI> Man.
Thirdly, <HI>It giveth the Knowledge of
God and Fellowship with</HI> him, <HI>Rom. 1.
19. John 3. 21. 1 John</HI> 1. 5, 6.
Fourthly, It <HI>manifesteth and reproveth
Evil,</HI> John 3. 20. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5. 13. Fifth∣ly,
<HI>It is made the Rule and Guide of
Christian Walking,</HI> Psalm 43. 3. <HI>John
8. 12. Eph.</HI> 5. 13, 15. Sixthly, <HI>It is
the Path</HI> for Gods People to go in,
<HI>Psalm 119. 105. Prov. 4. 18. Isa. 2.
5. 1 John 1. 7. Rev. 24. 23. and the
Nations of them that are saved shall
walk in the Light of the (Lamb.)</HI>
Lastly, It is the <HI>Armour</HI> of the Chil∣dren
of God against <HI>Satan,</HI> Psalm 27.
1. <HI>The Lord is my Light, whom shall I
fear,</HI> Rom. 13. 12. <HI>Let us put on the
Armour of Light.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 2. Now let all this be compar'd
with the <HI>Properties</HI> of the <HI>Holy Spi∣rit,</HI>
and their Agreement will be ve∣ry
manifest. First, <HI>It proceedeth from
God,</HI> because it is the Spirit of God,
<HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 11. Secondly, It is <HI>Vniver∣sal.</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="28"/>
It <HI>strove</HI> with the Old World,
<HI>Gen.</HI> 6. 3. Then to be sure with the
new One: <HI>Every one hath a measure

32. 8. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. 10, 11. Fourthly,
<HI>It reproveth Sin,</HI> John 16. 8. Fifth∣ly,
<HI>It is a Rule and Guide for the Chil∣dten

Sixthly, It is also the <HI>Path</HI> they are
to walk in, <HI>Rom. 8. 1. Gal. 5. 15.
Walk in the Spirit.</HI> Lastly, This is
not all, it is likewise the <HI>Spiritual
Weapon</HI> of a true Christian, <HI>Eph. 6.
17. Take the Sword of the Spirit, which
is the Word of God.</HI> After this, I
hope none will deny that <HI>this</HI> Light
<HI>and this</HI> Spirit must be of <HI>one and the

<HI>one and the same Holy End.</HI></P>

in that, First, The <HI>Grace</HI> floweth
from Christ the Word
that took Flesh as well
as the <HI>Light;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John 1. 4, 9, 14, 16.</NOTE> for as in

Godliness, and consequently it must ma∣nifest

It teaches to deny Vngodliness and world∣ly
Lusts, and to live Soberly, Righteous∣ly

herein is a Rule of Life,</HI> Tit. 2. 11, 12.

Sixthly, <HI>It is to all that receive it, all
that they can need or desire,</HI> 2 Cor. 12.

Power of this Teaching and Saving
Grace, under the strongest Tempta∣tions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P><HI>§. 4. Obj.</HI> But there is little men∣tion
made of the Spirit, and none of
the Grace, before Christs coming, and
therefore the Spirit, as spoken of in the
Writings of the New Testament, and
especially the Grace, must be another,
and a nobler thing than the Light with∣in.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> By no means another Thing,
but <HI>another</HI> Name, from <HI>another Ma∣nifestation</HI>
or <HI>Operation,</HI> of the <HI>same</HI>
Principle. It is called Light from
the <HI>Distinction and Discerning</HI> it gives.
<HI>Let there be Light, and there was Light,</HI>
said God in the beginning of the Old
World; so there is first Light in the
<PB N="44" REF="30"/>
beginning of the New Creation of
God in Man. It is called <HI>Spirit,</HI> be∣cause
it <HI>giveth Life, Sense, Motion,</HI>
and <HI>Vigour:</HI> And it is as often menti∣oned
in the Writings of the <HI>Old</HI> as
<HI>New</HI> Testament; which every <HI>Rea∣der</HI>
may see, if he will but please to
look into his Scripture-<HI>Concordance.</HI>
Thus <HI>Gods Spirit strove,</HI> with the
<HI>Old World,</HI> Gen. 6. 3. and with <HI>Isra∣el,</HI>
in the VVilderness, <HI>Neh.</HI> 9. 30.
and <HI>David</HI> ask'd, in the Agony of his
Soul, <HI>Whither shall I go from thy Spi∣rit?</HI>
Psalm 139. 7. and the Prophets
often felt it. It is stiled Grace, not
from its being another Principle, but
because it was a <HI>fuller Dispensation</HI> of
the Virtue and Power of the Same
Divine Principle: And that being
purely God's Favour and Mercy, and
not Mans Merit, is aptly and deser∣vedly
called the <HI>Grace, Favour</HI> or
<HI>Goodwill</HI> of God to undeserving Man.
The <HI>Wind</HI> does not always blow <HI>fresh,</HI>
nor <HI>Heaven</HI> send down its Rain <HI>free∣ly,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="30"/>
nor the <HI>Sun</HI> shine forth <HI>clearly;</HI>
shall we therefore say, it is not of the
<HI>same kind</HI> of Wind, <HI>Rain</HI> or <HI>Light,</HI>
when it Blows, Rains or Shines but
a <HI>little,</HI> as when it Blows, Rains or
Shines <HI>much?</HI> It is certainly the same
in <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Kind;</HI> and so is this
blessed <HI>Principle,</HI> under all its seve∣ral
Dispensations, Manifestations
and Operations, for the Benefit of
Mans Soul, ever since th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> World
began.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 5. But this is most <HI>freely, hum∣bly</HI>
and <HI>thankfully</HI> acknowledged by
us, that the <HI>Dispensation</HI> of the <HI>Go∣spel,</HI>
was the <HI>clearest, fullest,</HI> and <HI>no∣blest</HI>
of all other; <HI>both with regard</HI> to
the coming of Christ in the <HI>Flesh,</HI> and
being our one Holy Offering to God
for Sin, through the Eternal Spirit;
and the breaking forth of his Light,
the Effusion of his Spirit, and Ap∣pearance
of his Grace, in and to <HI>Man,</HI>
in a <HI>more excellent manner,</HI> after his
<PB N="46" REF="31"/>
Ascention. For though it was not
another Light, or Spirit, then that
which he had given to Man in for∣mer
Ages, yet it was another and
<HI>greater Measure;</HI> and that is the Pri∣viledge
of the Gospel above former
Dispensations. What before shined
but <HI>dimly,</HI> shines since with <HI>great
Glory.</HI> Then it appear∣ed
but <HI>darkly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 3. 18.</NOTE> now with
<HI>open Face.</HI> Types, Fi∣gures
and Shadows <HI>Vailed,</HI> and made
its appearances look <HI>low</HI> and <HI>faint;</HI>
but in the Gospel Time,
the Vail is <HI>Rent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John 1. 5, 17.</NOTE> and
the <HI>Hidden</HI> Glory <HI>mani∣fest.</HI>
It was under the Law but as a
Dew, or small Rain, but under the
Gospel, it may be said to be poured
out upon Men. According to that
Gracious and Notable <HI>Promise</HI> of
God, by the Prophet
<HI>Joel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joel 2. 28.</NOTE> <HI>In the latter Days,
I will pour out of my Spi∣rit
upon all Flesh.</HI> Thus we say, when
<PB N="47" REF="31"/>
it Rains plentifully, look how it
pours. So God <HI>Augments</HI> his Light,
Grace and Spirit to these latter Days.
They shall not have it <HI>sparingly,</HI> and
by small Drops, but <HI>fully and freely,</HI> and
<HI>overflowingly</HI> too. And thus <HI>Peter,</HI>
that deep and excellent Apostle, ap∣plies
that Promise in <HI>Joel,</HI> on the Day
of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> as the beginning of the
accomplishment of it. This is Grace,
and Favour, and Goodness <HI>indeed.</HI>
And therefore well may this <HI>Brighter</HI>
Illumination, and <HI>Greater</HI> Effusion of
the Spirit, be called Grace; for as
the coming of the Son excelled that
of the Servant, so did the Manifesta∣tion
of the Light and Spirit of God,
since the coming of Christ, excell that
of the foregoing Dispensations; yet
ever sufficient to Salvation to all those
that walked in it. This is our <HI>Sence</HI>
of the <HI>Light, Spirit,</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> of
God: And by what is said, it is evi∣dent
they are <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same Princi∣ple,</HI>
and that he that has <HI>Light,</HI> need
<PB N="48" REF="32"/>
not <HI>want</HI> the Spirit or Grace of God,
if he will but receive it, in the Love
of it: For the very Principle that is
<HI>Light</HI> to show him, is also <HI>Spirit,</HI> to
quicken him, and <HI>Grace,</HI> to Teach,
Help, and Comfort him. It is <HI>suffici∣ent</HI>
in all Circumstances of Life to
them that diligently Mind and obey
it.</P>

<P>§. 1. Obj. BVt some may yet say,
if it be as you declare,
how comes it, that all who are enlight∣ned
are not so good as they should be; or,
as you say, this would make them?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Because People don't re∣ceive
and obey it. All Men have
<HI>Reason,</HI> but all Men are not <HI>Reasona∣ble.</HI>
Is it the fault of the <HI>Grain,</HI> in
the <HI>Garnary</HI> that it yields no increase,
or of the <HI>Talent</HI> in the Napkin, that
it is not improved? It is plain a <HI>Ta∣lent</HI>

Talents were actually improved by
others, and that the Just Judge ex∣pected
his <HI>Talent</HI> with Advantage,
which else, to be sure, he would ne∣ver
have done. Now when our Ob∣jecters
will tell us, whose fault it was
the <HI>Talent</HI> was not improved, we
shall be ready to tell them, why the
<PB N="51" REF="33"/>
unprofitable Servant was not so good,
as he should have been. The Blind
must not <HI>blame</HI> the Sun, nor Sinners
tax the Grace of <HI>Insufficiency.</HI> 'Tis
Sin that <HI>darkens</HI> the Eye, and <HI>hardens</HI>
the Heart, and that <HI>hinders</HI> good
things from the Sons of Men. <HI>If we
do his Will, we shall know of his Divine
Doctrine,</HI> so Christ tells us. Men, not
living to what they know, cannot
blame God, that they know no more.
The unfruitfulness is in <HI>us,</HI> not in the
<HI>Talent.</HI> 'Twere well indeed, that
this were laid to Heart. But, alas!
Men are too apt to follow their sensu∣al
Appetites, rather then their reason∣able
Mind, which renders them Bru∣tal
instead of Rational. For the <HI>Rea∣sonable</HI>

<HI>Reason</HI> in the most <HI>excellent</HI>

up himself to God a reasonable Sacri∣fice.
Then a <HI>Man indeed;</HI> a <HI>compleat
<PB N="52" REF="34"/>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 2. Obj. <HI>But some yet Object,</HI>
If Mankind had always this Principle,
how comes it that Gospel Truths were not
so fully known before the coming of Christ
to those that were obedient to it.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Because a <HI>Child</HI> is not a
<HI>grown</HI> Man, nor the Beginning the
<HI>End;</HI> and yet He that is the <HI>Begin∣ning,</HI>
is also the <HI>End:</HI> The Principle

As the VVorld has many
Steps and Periods of Time towards
its End, so hath <HI>Man</HI> to his Perfecti∣on.

they know of the Dispensation of

of the Church of God.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="34"/>
This we see in the

<HI>David</HI> in many of his excellent <HI>Psalms,</HI>

3, 4. This was not another Princi∣ple,
though another Manifestation of
the same Principle, nor what is com∣mon,
but particular and extraordi∣nary
in the Reason of it.</P>
<P>It was the same Spirit that came
<PB N="54" REF="35"/>
upon <HI>Moses,</HI> which came upon <HI>John</HI>
the <HI>Baptist,</HI> and it was also the same
Spirit that came, upon <HI>Gideon,</HI> and
<HI>Sampson,</HI> that fell upon <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul;</HI>
but it was not the same Dispensation
of that Spirit. It hath been the <HI>Way</HI>
of God, to visit and appear to Men
according to their States and Condi∣tions,
and as they have been prepa∣red
to receive him, be it more out∣wardly
or inwardly, sensibly or spi∣ritually.
There is no Capacity too
low or too high for this Divine Prin∣ciple:
For as it made and knows all,
so it reaches to all People. It ex∣tends
to the meanest, and the highest
cannot subsist without it. Which
made <HI>David</HI> break forth in his Ex∣postulations
with God, <HI>Whither shall
I go from thy Spirit, or whither shall I
flee from thy Presence?</HI> Psalm 139. 7,
8, 9, 10. Implying it was <HI>every where,</HI>
though not every where, nor at eve∣ry
time <HI>alike.</HI> If I go to <HI>Heaven,</HI>
to <HI>Hell,</HI> or <HI>beyond the Seas, even there
shall thy Hand lead me, and thy Right
<PB N="55" REF="35"/>
Hand shall hold me.</HI> That is, there
will this Divine <HI>Word,</HI> this Light of
Men, this <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, find me,
lead me, help me and comfort me.
For it is with me where ever I am,
and where ever I go, in one respect
or other; <HI>Prov. 6. 22. When thou
goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleep∣est,
it shall keep thee; and when thou
awakest, it shall talk with thee:</HI> And I
can no more get rid of it, if I would
then of my self or my own Nature;
so present it is with me, and so close
it sticks unto me. <HI>Isa. 43. 2. When
thou passest through the Waters, I will
be with thee; and through the Rivers,
they shall not overflow thee; when thou
walkest through the Fire, thou shalt not
be burnt, neither shall the Flame kindle
upon thee. David</HI> knew it, and
therefore had a great value for it.
<HI>In thy Light shall we see Light,</HI> or we
shall be enlightned by thy Light.
<HI>Thou wilt Light my Can∣dle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm 34. 9.</NOTE>

Again, <HI>The Lord is my
Light,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm 27. 1.</NOTE> <HI>whom shall I fear.</HI>
It was his <HI>Armour</HI> against all Dan∣ger.
It took Fear away from him,
and he was <HI>undaunted,</HI> because he
was safe in the way of it. Of the same

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Yes, and it is the Glory of
this Doctrine which we profess, that
Gods Love is therein held forth to
<HI>All.</HI> And besides the Texts cited in

is very Particular in the second Chap∣ter
of his Epistle to the <HI>Romans,
That the Gentiles ha∣ving

in the Law,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 2. 7. unto the 17.</NOTE> <HI>and were a Law un∣to

themselves.</HI> That is, they had not
an outward Law, <HI>circumstanced</HI> as
the <HI>Jews</HI> had; but <HI>they had the Works
of the Law written in their Hearts</HI>
and therefore might well be a Law
to themselves, that had the Law <HI>in
themselves.</HI> And so had the <HI>Jews</HI>
too, but then they had greater out∣ward
helps to quicken their Obedi∣ence
to it; such as God afforded not
unto any other Nation: And there∣fore
the Obedience of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> or
<HI>Vncircumcision</HI> is said to be by <HI>Na∣ture,</HI>
or <HI>Naturally,</HI> because it was
without those <HI>Additional,</HI> External,
and extraordinary Ministries and
Helps which the <HI>Jews</HI> had to provoke
them to their Duty. Which is so
far from lessening the obedient <HI>Gen∣tiles,</HI>
that it exalts them in the Apo∣stles
Judgment; because though they
had less Advantages then the <HI>Jews,</HI>
yet the <HI>Work of the Law written in
their Hearts</HI> was made so much the
more evident by the good Life they
lived in the World. He adds, <HI>their
<PB N="58" REF="37"/>
Consciences bearing Witness</HI> (or as it
may be rendred, witnessing with
them) <HI>and their Thoughts, mean while,
accusing or else excusing one another, in
the Day when God shall judge the secrets
of all Hearts by Jesus Christ, according
to my Gospel.</HI> Which presents us
with four things to our Point, and
worth our serious Reflection. <HI>First,</HI>
That the <HI>Gentiles</HI> had the Law writ∣ten
<HI>in</HI> their Hearts. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That
their Conscience was an <HI>allowed</HI> Wit∣ness
or Evidence about Duty. <HI>Third∣ly,</HI>
That the Judgment made there∣by
shall be <HI>confirmed</HI> by the Apostles
Gospel at the great Day, and there∣fore
Valid and Irreversible. <HI>Fourth∣ly,</HI>
That this could not be, if the
<HI>Light</HI> of this Conscience were not a
<HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Sufficient</HI> Light: For <HI>Con∣science,</HI>
truly speaking, is no other
then the <HI>Sence a Man hath, or Judge∣ment
he maketh of his Duty to God, ac∣cording
to the Vnderstanding God gives
him of his Will.</HI> And that no ill,
but a true and scriptural Use may be

made of this Word <HI>Conscience,</HI> I li∣mit
it to <HI>Duty,</HI> and that, to a Virtu∣ous
and Holy Life as the Apostle evi∣dently
doth, about which we cannot
miss, or dispute, read <HI>verse</HI> 7, 8, and
9. It was to that therefore the Apo∣stles
of our Lord Jesus Christ desired
to be made <HI>manifest,</HI> for they dared
to stand the Judgment of <HI>Conscience</HI>
in reference to the Doctrine they
preach'd and prest upon Men. The
Beloved Disciple also makes it a <HI>Judge</HI>
of Man's present and future State, un∣der
the Term <HI>Heart, For if our Heart
condemn us, God is
greater then our Heart,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John 3.21, 22</NOTE>
<HI>and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our
Heart condemn us not, then have we
Confidence towards God.</HI> Plain and
strong Words: And what were they
about, but whether we Love, God,
in Deed and in Truth: And how must
that appear? VVhy in <HI>keeping his
Commandments,</HI> which is living up to
what we know. And if any desire
to satisfie themselves farther of the
<PB N="60" REF="38"/>
<HI>Divinity</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> let them read
<HI>Plato, Seneca, Plutarch, Epictetus,
Marcus Aurelius Antoninus,</HI> and the
like <HI>Gentile</HI> VVriters. They will al∣so
find many of their sayings, colle∣cted
in the first Part of a Book called
the <HI>Christian Quaker,</HI> and compared
with the Testimonies of Scripture,
not for their Authority, but agreea∣bleness.
In them they may discern
many Excellent Truths, and taste
great <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Devotion</HI> to Virtue:
A fruit that grows upon no Tree, but
that of Life in no Age or Nation.
Some of the most Eminent VVriters
of the first Ages, such as <HI>Justin Mar∣tyr,
Origen, Clemens Alexandrinus,</HI>
&amp;c. bore them great Respect, and
thought it no lessening to the Repu∣tation
of Christianity, that it was
defended in many <HI>Gentile</HI> Authors,
as well as that they used and urged
them, to engage their Followers to
the Faith, as <HI>Paul</HI> did the <HI>Athenians</HI>
with their <HI>own Poets.</HI></P>

<P><HI>§.</HI> 1. Obj. <HI>BUt it may be said,</HI>
If it were one Princi∣ple,
why so many Modes and Shapes of
Religion, since the World began? For
the <HI>Patriarchal, Mosaical and Chri∣stian,</HI>
have their great differences; to
say nothing of what has befallen the Chri∣stian,
since the Publication of it to the
World.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I know not properly
they may be called divers Religions,
that assert the true God for the <HI>Ob∣ject</HI>
of Worship; the Lord <HI>Jesus
Christ,</HI> for the <HI>only Saviour;</HI> and the
Light, or Spirit of <HI>Christ,</HI> for the great
<HI>Agent</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> of Man's Conversion
and Eternal Felicity, any more than
<PB N="63" REF="39"/>
Infancy, Youth, and Manhood make
<HI>three Men,</HI> instead of <HI>three growths</HI> or
periods of Time, of one and the same
Man. But passing that, the many
Modes or Ways of Gods appearing
to Men, arise, as hath been said,
from the divers States of Men, in all
which, it seems to have been his
main design to prevent <HI>Idolatry</HI> and
<HI>Vice,</HI> by directing their Minds to the
<HI>true Object</HI> of Worship, and pressing
<HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Holiness.</HI> So that though
mediately he spoke to the <HI>Patriarchs,</HI>
mostly by <HI>Angels</HI> in the fashion of
Men, and by them to their Families,
over and above the <HI>Illumination</HI> in
themselves; so the <HI>Prophets,</HI> for the
most Part, by the Revelation of the
Holy Ghost <HI>in them,</HI> and <HI>by them</HI> to
the <HI>Jews:</HI> And since the Gospel Dis∣pensation,
by his Son, both Exter∣nally,
<HI>by his coming in the Flesh,</HI> and
Internally, by his <HI>spiritual Appearance
in the Soul,</HI> as he is the <HI>great Light of
the World:</HI> Yet all its flowings medi∣ately
through others, has still been
<PB N="64" REF="40"/>
from the same Principle, co-opera∣ting
with the Manifestation of it <HI>im∣mediately</HI>
in Man's own Particular.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 2. This is of great weight, for
our Information and Incouragement,
that God's Work, in reference to
Man, is <HI>all of a Piece,</HI> and, in it self,
lies in a narrow Compass, and that
his Eye has ever been upon the <HI>same
thing</HI> in all his Dispensations, <HI>viz.</HI> to
make <HI>Men truly Good,</HI> by planting his
Holy Awe and Fear in their Hearts:
Though he has condescended, for
the hardness and darkness of Men's
Hearts, to approach and spell out his
Holy Mind to them, by low and car∣nal
ways, as they may appear to our
more Enlightned Understandings:
Suffering <HI>Truth</HI> to put on <HI>divers</HI> sorts
of <HI>Garments,</HI> the better to reach to
the low State of Men, to engage them
from false Gods and ill Lives; seeing
them <HI>sunk</HI> so much below their <HI>nobler</HI>
Part, and what he made them, that,
like brute Beasts, they knew not their
own Strength and Excellency.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<PB N="65" REF="40"/>
<P>§. 3. And if we do but well consi∣der
the Reason of the
Prevalency of <HI>Idolatry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 31. Ch. 35.</NOTE>
upon the <HI>Earlier</HI> and
<HI>Darker</HI> Times of the
World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 20.—</NOTE> of which the
Scripture is very par∣ticular,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Levit. 21.—</NOTE>
we shall find
that it ariseth from this;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 29. Ch. 30. 31. 32. Chap.</NOTE> that it is
more Sensual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Josh. 22. 23, 24. Chap.</NOTE> and therefore calcula∣ted
to please the <HI>Sences</HI> of Men; be∣ing
more <HI>Outward</HI> or <HI>Visible,</HI> or more
in their own Power to perform then
one more <HI>spiritual</HI> in its Object. For
as their <HI>gods</HI> were the Workman∣ship
of <HI>Mens</HI> Hands, they could not
prefer them, that being the Argu∣ment
which did most of all gaul their
Worshippers, and what of all things,
for that reason, they were most wil∣ling
to forget. But their Incidency
to <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and the Advantages it
had upon the true Religion with
them, plainly came from this, that
it was more outward and <HI>sensual:</HI>
They could <HI>see</HI> the Object of their
<PB N="66" REF="41"/>
Devotion, and had it in their
Power to Address it when they
would. It was more <HI>fashionable</HI> too,
as well as better accommodated to
their <HI>Dark</HI> and too <HI>Brutal</HI> State. And
therefore it was that God, by many
Afflictions, and greater Deliveran∣ces,
brought forth a People, to en∣dear
himself to them, that they
might remember the Hand that sa∣ved
them, and Worship him, and
him only; in order to root up <HI>Ido∣latry,</HI>
and plant the <HI>Knowledge, and
fear of him in their Minds,</HI> for an Ex∣ample
to other Nations. VVhoever
reads <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> which is a <HI>sum∣mary</HI>
of the other four Books of <HI>Mo∣ses,</HI>
will find the frequent and earnest
Care and concern of that good Man
for <HI>Israel,</HI> about this very Point; and
how often that People <HI>slipt</HI> and <HI>laps'd,</HI>
notwithstanding God's Love, Care
and Patience over them, into the <HI>Ido∣latrous</HI>
Customs of the Nations about
them. Divers other Scriptures in∣form
us also, especially those of the
<PB N="67" REF="41"/>
Prophets, <HI>Isaiah</HI> 44. and 45. <HI>Psalms</HI>
37. and 115. and <HI>Jer.</HI> 10. where
the Holy Ghost Confutes and Re∣bukes
the People, and mocks their
<HI>Idols</HI> with a sort of Holy Disdain.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 4. Now that which is <HI>farthest</HI>
from Idolatry, and the best <HI>Antidote</HI>
against it, is the <HI>Principle</HI> we have
laid down, and the more Peoples
Minds are turned and brought to it,
and that they resolve their Faith,
VVorship and Obedience into the
Holy Illuminations and Power of it,
the <HI>nearer</HI> they grow to the end of
their Creation, and consequently to
their <HI>Creator.</HI> They are more spi∣ritually
qualified, and become better
fitted to VVorship God as he is:
VVho, as we are told, by our Lord
Jesus Christ, <HI>Is a Spirit and will be
Worshipped in Spirit and in Truth, and
that they are such sort of Worshippers
which God seeketh to worship him, in
this Gospel Day. The hour cometh,</HI>
saith he, <HI>and now is.</HI> That is, some
now do so, but more shall. A plain
<PB N="68" REF="42"/>
Assertion in present, and a <HI>Promise</HI>
and <HI>Prophesie</HI> of the encrease of <HI>such</HI>
VVorshippers in future. VVhich
shows a Change intended from a Ce∣remonial
VVorship, and State of the
Church of God, to a <HI>Spiritual</HI> One.
Thus the Text; <HI>But the time cometh,
and now is, when the true Worshippers
shall Worship the Father in the Spirit
and in the Truth.</HI> VVhich is as much
as to say, when the VVorship of God
shall be <HI>more Inward</HI> than Outward,
and so <HI>more suitable</HI> to the Nature of
God, and the nobler Part of Man, his
<HI>Inside,</HI> or his <HI>inward and better Man:</HI>
For so those blessed VVords import,
<HI>in Spirit and in Truth. In the Spirit,</HI>
that is, <HI>through the Power</HI> of the Spi∣rit.
<HI>In the Truth,</HI> that is, in <HI>Reali∣ties,</HI>
not in Shadows, Ceremonies,
or Formalities, but in Sincerity with
and in Life, being divinely prepared
and animated; which brings Man
not only to offer up <HI>Right</HI> VVorship,
but also into <HI>Intimate Communion and
Fellowship with God, who is a Spirit.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<PB N="69" REF="42"/>
<P>§. 5. And if it be duly weighed
it will appear, that God, in all his
Manifestations of himself, hath still
come <HI>nearer</HI> and <HI>nearer</HI> to the <HI>Insides</HI>
of Men, that he might reach to
their Understandings, and open their
Hearts, and give them a plainer and
nearer Acquaintance with himself in
Spirit: And <HI>then</HI> it is that Man must
seek and find the Knowledge of God
for his Eternal Happiness. Indeed,
all things that are made show forth
the Power and Wisdom of God, and
his Goodness too to Mankind; and
therefore many Men urge the <HI>Crea∣tion</HI>
to silence <HI>Atheistical</HI> Objections:
But though all those things show a
God, yet Man does it, above all the
Rest. He is the <HI>precious Stone</HI> of
the <HI>Ring,</HI> and the most <HI>glorious Jew∣el</HI>
of the <HI>Globe;</HI> to whose reasonable
Use, Service, and Satisfaction, the
whole seems to be made and dedi∣cated.
<HI>But God's Delight</HI> (by whom
Man was made, we are told by the
Holy Ghost) <HI>is in the habitable Parts
<PB N="70" REF="43"/>
of the Earth, with the Sons of Men,</HI>
Prov. 8. 31. And with those that
are contrite in Spirit, <HI>Isa.</HI> 66. 1. And
why is Man his Delight, but be∣cause
Man only, of all his Works,
was his Likeness. This is the <HI>inti∣mate
Relation</HI> of Man to God: Some∣what
<HI>nearer</HI> than ordinary; for of
all other Beings Man <HI>only</HI> had the
Honour of being his <HI>Image;</HI> and by
his <HI>Resemblance</HI> to God, as I may
say, came his <HI>Kindred</HI> with God and
<HI>Knowledge</HI> of him. So that the near∣est
and best way for Man to know
God, and be acquainted with him,
is to seek him in himself, in his
<HI>Image;</HI> and as he finds that, he
comes to find and know God. Now
Man may be said to be God's I∣mage
in a double Respect. <HI>First,</HI>
As he is of an Immortal Nature;
and next, as that Nature is <HI>Endued</HI>
with those Excellencies in <HI>small,</HI> and
proportionable to a Creatures Capa∣city,
that are by Nature <HI>Infinitely</HI>
and <HI>Incomparably</HI> in his Creator.
<PB N="71" REF="43"/>
For Instance, <HI>Wisdom, Justice, Mer∣cy,
Holiness, Patience,</HI> and the like.
As Man becomes Holy, Just, Mer∣ciful,
Patient, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By the <HI>Copy</HI> He
will know the <HI>Original,</HI> and by the
<HI>Workmanship</HI> in himself, he will be
acquainted with the Holy <HI>Work∣man.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 6. 15, 16.</NOTE>
This <HI>Reader</HI> is
the <HI>Regeneration</HI> and
<HI>New Creature</HI> we press, <HI>and according
to this Rule, we say, Men ought to
be Religious, and Walk in this World.</HI>
Man, as I said just now, is a Com∣position
of both Worlds; his Body
is of this, his Soul of the other
World. The Body is as the Tem∣ple
of the Soul, the Soul the <HI>Tem∣ple</HI>
of the <HI>Word,</HI> and the Word,
the <HI>Great Temple</HI> and <HI>Manifestation</HI> of
God. By the <HI>Body</HI> the Soul looks into
and beholds this World, and by the
<HI>Word</HI> it beholds God the World
that is without End. Much might
be said of this Order of things,
and their respective Excellencies,
but I must be Brief.</P>

<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 1. THough there be many
good things said, how
Christ appears and works in a Soul, to
Awaken, Convince and Convert it; yet
you seem not particular enough about the
Death and Sufferings of Christ: And it
is generally Rumour'd and Charged upon
you by your Adversaries, that you have
little reverence to the Doctrine of Christ's
Satisfaction to God for our Sins, and
that you do not Believe, That the <HI>Active</HI>
and <HI>Passive</HI> Obedience of Christ, when he
was in the World, is the <HI>alone</HI> ground of
a Sinners Justification before God.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> §. 1. The Doctrine of <HI>Sa∣tisfaction</HI>
and <HI>Justification,</HI> truly under∣stood,
are placed in so strict an Uni∣on,
that the one is a necessary Con∣sequence
<PB N="74" REF="45"/>
of the other, and what we
say of them, is what agrees with the
suffrage of Scripture, and for the most
part in the terms of it; always be∣lieving,
that in Points where there
arises any difficulty, be it from the
Obscurity of Expression, Mis-transla∣tion,
or the Dust raised by the Heats
of <HI>Partial</HI> Writers, or <HI>Nice Criticks,</HI>
it is ever best to keep close to the
Text, and maintain Charity in the
rest. I shall first speak <HI>Negatively,</HI>
what we do not own, which perhaps
hath given occasion to those who have
been more Hasty than Wise, to judge
us defective in our Belief of the Effi∣cacy
of the Death and Sufferings of
Christ to Justification: As,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P><HI>§. 2. First, We cannot Believe
that Christ is the</HI> Cause, <HI>but the</HI> Ef∣fect
<HI>of God's Love, according to the
Testimony of the Beloved Disci∣ple</HI>
John, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. God hath so lo∣ved
the World, that he hath given
his only Begotten Son into the World,
that whosoever believeth on him
<PB N="75" REF="45"/>
should not perish, but have Everlast∣ing
Life.</P>
<P>Secondly, We cannot say, God
<HI>could not</HI> have taken another way to
have saved Sinners, than by the Death
and Sufferings of his Son, to satisfie
his Justice, or that Christ's Death
and Sufferings were a <HI>strict</HI> and <HI>rigid</HI>
Satisfaction for that Eternal Death
and Misery due to Man for Sin and
Transgression: For such a Notion
were to make God's Mercy little con∣cerned
in Man's Salvation; and in∣deed
we are at too great a distance
from his Infinite Wisdom and Pow∣er,
to judge of the <HI>Liberty</HI> or <HI>Necessity</HI>
of his Actings.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We cannot say Jesus
Christ was the <HI>greatest Sinner</HI> in the
World, (because he bore our Sins
on his Cross, or because he was made
Sin for us, who knew no Sin) an
Expression of great <HI>levity</HI> and <HI>unsound∣ness,</HI>
yet often said by great Preach∣ers
and Professors of Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="46"/>
Fourthly, We cannot Believe that
Christ's Death and Sufferings <HI>so</HI> satis∣fies
God, or justifies Men, as that
they are thereby Accepted of God:
They are indeed thereby put into a
state capable of being accepted of God,
and through the Obedience of Faith
and Sanctification of the Spirit, are
in a state of Acceptance: For we can
never think a Man justified before
God, while <HI>Self-condemned;</HI> or that
any Man can be in Christ, who is
not a <HI>New</HI> Creature, or that God
looks upon Men <HI>otherwise</HI> than they
are. We think it a state of <HI>Presump∣tion,</HI>
and not of <HI>Salvation,</HI> to call <HI>Je∣sus,
Lord!</HI> and not by the Work of
the <HI>Holy Ghost. Master!</HI> And he
not yet <HI>Master of our Affections: Savi∣our!</HI>
And they not saved by him
from their <HI>Sins: Redeemer!</HI> And yet
they not redeemed by him from their
<HI>Passion, Pride, Covetousness, Wanton∣ness,
Vanity, Honours, vain Friend∣ships,</HI>
and <HI>Glory</HI> of this World: Which
were to deceive themselves; for God
<PB N="77" REF="46"/>
will not be mocked, such as Men
sow, such they must reap. And
though Christ did <HI>Die</HI> for us, yet we
must, by the Assistance of his Grace,
<HI>work out our Salvation with fear and
trembling:</HI> As he Died for Sin, so we
must Die <HI>to</HI> Sin, or we cannot be said
to be saved by the Death and Suffer∣ings
of Christ, or throughly justified
and accepted with God. Thus far Ne∣gatively.
Now, Possitively, what
we own as to Justification.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 3. We do Believe, That Jesus
Christ was our Holy <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> and
<HI>Attonement,</HI> and <HI>Propitiation;</HI> that
he bore our Iniquities, and that by
his Stripes we were healed of the
Wounds <HI>Adam</HI> gave us in his Fall;
and that God is just in forgiving true
Penitents upon the Credit of that
Holy Offering, Christ made of him∣self
to God for us; and that what he
did and suffer'd, satisfied and pleased
God, and was for the sake of fallen
Man that had displeased God: And
that through the Offering up of him∣self
<PB N="78" REF="47"/>
once for all, through the E∣ternal
Spirit, he hath for Ever per∣fected
those (in all times) that are
sanctified, <HI>who walk not after the Flesh,
but after the Spirit. Rom.</HI> 8. 1. Mark that.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 4. In short, <HI>Justification</HI> consists
of two parts, or hath a twofold Con∣sideration,
<HI>viz.</HI> Justification from
the Guilt of Sin, and Justification
from the Power and Pollution of Sin,
and in this Sense Justification gives
Man a full and clear Acceptance be∣fore
God. For want of this latter
part, it is that so many Souls Religi∣ously
inclin'd, are often under Doubts,
Scruples and Dependencies, notwith∣standing
all that their Teachers tell
them of the Extent and Efficacy of the
first part of Justification. And it is
too general an Unhappiness among
the Professors of Christianity, that
they are apt to cloak their own <HI>Active
and Passive Disobedience</HI> with the <HI>Active
and Passive Obedience of Christ.</HI> The
first part of Justification we do reve∣rently
and humbly acknowledge is
<PB N="79" REF="47"/>
only for the sake of the Death and
Sufferings of Christ; nothing we can
do, <HI>though by the Operation of the Holy
Spirit,</HI> being able to cancel Old Debts,
or wipe out Old Scores: It is the
Power and Efficacy of that Propitia∣tory
Offering, upon Faith and Repen∣tance,
that justifies us from the Sins
that are past; and it is the Power of
Christ's Spirit in our Hearts that
purifies and makes us acceptable be∣fore
God. For till the Heart of Man
is purged from Sin, God will never
accept of it. He Reproves, Rebukes
and Condemns those that entertain
Sin there, and therefore such cannot
be said to be in a <HI>Justified</HI> State; Con∣demnation
and Justification being
Contraries: So that they that hold
themselves in a Justified State by the
Active and Passive Obedience of
Christ, while they are not Actively
and Passively Obedient to the Spirit of
Christ Jesus, are under a <HI>strong</HI> and
<HI>dangerous Delusion;</HI> and for crying out
against this Sin-pleasing Imagination,
<PB N="80" REF="48"/>
not to say <HI>Doctrine,</HI> we are Staged
and Reproached as Deniers and De∣spisers
of the Death and Sufferings of
our Lord Jesus Christ. But be it
known to such, they add to Christ's
Sufferings, and Crucifie to themselves
afresh the Son of God, and trample
the Blood of the Covenant under their
Feet, that walk unholily under a
Profession of Justification; for God
will not acquit the Guilty, nor justi∣fie
the Disobedient and Unfaith∣ful.
Such deceive themselves, and
at the Great and Final Judgment their
Sentence will not be, Come ye Bles∣sed,
because it cannot be said to them,
<HI>Well done Good and Faithful,</HI> for
they cannot be so esteemed that live
and die in a Reproveable and Con∣demnable
State; but, Go ye Cur∣sed,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>§. 5. Wherefore, O my Reader!
Rest not thy self wholly satisfied with

<P>§. 1. AND lest any should say
we are <HI>Equivocal</HI> in our
Expressions, and <HI>Allegorize away</HI>
Christ's Appearance in the Flesh;
meaning only thereby, our own Flesh,
and that as often as we mention him,
<PB N="85" REF="50"/>
we mean only a <HI>Mystery,</HI> or a <HI>Mystical
Sense</HI> of him, be it as to his <HI>Coming,

and <HI>Judgment;</HI> I would yet add, to
preserve the well-disposed from being
stagger'd by such Suggestions, and
to inform and reclaim such as are un∣der
the Power and Prejudice of them,
That, we do, we Bless God, Religi∣ously
Believe and Confess, to the
Glory of God the Father, and the
Honour of his Dear and Beloved Son,
that, <HI>Jesus Christ, took our Nature
upon him, and was like unto us in all
things, Sin excepted; That he was Born
of the Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>and Suffered under</HI>
Pontius Pilate, <HI>the</HI> Roman <HI>Governour,
Crucified, Dead, and Buried in the Se∣pulchre
of</HI> Joseph <HI>of</HI> Arimathea; <HI>Rose

§. 2. But because we so Believe,
must we not Believe what Christ said,
<HI>He that is with you shall be <HI>in</HI> you,</HI> John
14. <HI>I <HI>in</HI> them, and they in me,</HI> &amp;c.
Chap. 17. <HI>When it pleased God to re∣veal
his Son <HI>in</HI> me,</HI> &amp;c. Gal. 1. <HI>The
Mystery hid from Ages, is Christ <HI>in</HI> the</HI>
Gentiles <HI>the hope of Glory,</HI> Col. 1. <HI>Vn∣less
Christ be <HI>in</HI> you, ye are Reprobates?</HI>
2 Cor. 13. Or must we be industri∣ously
represented Deniers of Christ's
Coming in the Flesh, and the Holy
<HI>Ends</HI> of it, in all the Parts and
Branches of his <HI>Doing</HI> and <HI>Suffering,</HI>
because we Believe, and press the
Necessity of Believing, Receiving and
Obeying his <HI>Inward</HI> and <HI>Spiritual</HI> Ap∣pearance
and Manifestation of him∣self,
through his Light, Grace and
Spirit in the Hears and Consciences
of Men and Women, to Reprove,
Convict, Convert and Change them?
This we esteem hard and unrighteous
Measure; nor would our warm and
sharp Adversaries be so dealt with by
others: But to do as they would be
<PB N="87" REF="51"/>
done to, is too often no part of their
Practice, whatever it be of their Pro∣fession.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 3. Yet we are very ready to de∣clare
to the whole World, that we
cannot think Men and Women <HI>can be
saved</HI> by their Belief of the one <HI>with∣out
the Sense and Experience of the other;</HI>
and that is what we oppose, and
not his Blessed Manifestation in the
Flesh. We say that he then overcame
our Common Enemy, foil'd him in
the open Field, and in our Nature, tri∣umphed
over him that had overcome
and triumphed over it in our Fore∣father
<HI>Adam,</HI> and his Posterity; and
that as truly as Christ overcame him
in our Nature, in his own Person, so,
<HI>by his Divine Grace</HI> being received and
obeyed by us, he overcomes him in
us: That is, he detects the Enemy by
his <HI>Light</HI> in the Conscience, and <HI>ena∣bles</HI>
the Creature to resist him, and all
his Fiery Darts, and finally, so to
Fight the Good Fight of Faith, as to
<HI>overcome</HI> him, and lay hold on Eternal
Life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<PB N="88" REF="52"/>
<P>§. 4. And this is the Dispensation
of <HI>Grace,</HI> which we declare, <HI>has ap∣peared
to all,</HI> more or less, teaching
those that will receive it, <HI>to deny un∣godliness
and worldly lusts, and to live
soberly, righteously, and godly in this
present World; looking for</HI> (which
none else can justly do) <HI>the blessed
Hope, and glorious Appearing of the
Great God, and our Saviour Jesus
Christ,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Tit.</HI> 2. 11, 12, 13. And
as from the Teachings, and Experi∣ence,
and Motion of this Grace, we
minister to others, so the very drift of
our Ministry is to turn Peoples Minds
to this Grace in themselves, that they
may all, up and be doing, <HI>even the
good and acceptable Will of God, and
work out their Salvation with fear and
trembling, and make their High and
Heavenly Calling and Election sure;</HI>
which none else can do, whatever be
their <HI>Profession, Church</HI> and <HI>Character:
For such as Men sow they must reap;
and his Servants we are whom we obey.
Regeneration</HI> we must know, or we
<PB N="89" REF="52"/>
cannot be Children of God, and
Heirs of Eternal Glory: And to be
Born again, an <HI>other</HI> Spirit and Prin∣ciple
must <HI>prevail, leaven, season,</HI> and
<HI>govern</HI> us, then either the Spirit of
the World, or our own depraved Spi∣rits;
and this can be no other Spi∣rit
than that which dwelt in Christ,
for unless that dwell in us, we can be
none of his, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 9. And this
Spirit begins in <HI>Conviction,</HI> and ends
in <HI>Conversion</HI> and <HI>Perseverance:</HI> And
the one follows the other; Conver∣sion
being the Consequence of <HI>Con∣victions
obey'd,</HI> and Perseverance a na∣tural
<HI>Fruit</HI> of Conversion, and being
Born of God; for such Sin not, be∣cause
the Seed of God abides in them,
<HI>John</HI> 3. 7, 8. but through Faithful∣ness,
continue to the end, and obtain
the Promise, even Everlasting Life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 5. But let my <HI>Reader</HI> take this
along with him, that we do acknow∣ledge
that Christ, through his Holy
<HI>Doing</HI> and <HI>Suffering</HI> (for being a <HI>Son</HI>
he learned <HI>Obedience)</HI> has obtained
<PB N="90" REF="53"/>
Mercy of God his Father for Man∣kind;
and that his Obedience has an
Influence to our Salvation, in all the
Parts and Branches of it; since there∣by
he became a Conqueror, and <HI>led
Captivity Captive, and obtained Gifts
for Men, with divers Great and Pre∣cious
Promises, that thereby we might
be partakers of the Divine Nature, ha∣ving</HI>
(first) <HI>escaped the <HI>Corruption</HI>
that is in the World, through Lust.</HI> I
say we do Believe and Confess that
the <HI>Active</HI> and <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> of
Christ Jesus affects our Salvation
throughout, as well from the Power
and Pollution of Sin, as from the
Guilt, He being a Conqueror as well
as a Sacrifice, and both through Suf∣fering:
Yet, they that reject his Di∣vine
Gift, so obtained, and which
he has given to them, by which to
see their Sin, and the sinfulness of it,
and to repent and turn away from it,
and do so no more; and to wait upon
God for daily strength to resist the
Fiery Darts of the Enemy, and to be
<PB N="91" REF="53"/>
Comforted through the Obedience of
Faith in and to this Divine Grace of
the Son of God, such do not please
God, believe truly in God; nor are
they in a state of true Christianity
and Salvation. <HI>Woman,</HI> said Christ,
to the <HI>Samaritan,</HI> at the Well, <HI>hadst
thou known the Gift of God, and who it
is that speaketh to thee,</HI> &amp;c. People
know not Christ, and God, whom
to know is Life Eternal, <HI>John</HI> 17.
because they are Ignorant of the Gift
of God, <HI>viz.</HI> a measure of the Spirit
of God that is given to every one to
profit with, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 7. which re∣veals
Christ and God to the Soul.
<HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> cannot do it, <HI>Oxford</HI>
and <HI>Cambridge</HI> cannot do it, <HI>Tongues</HI>
and <HI>Philosophy</HI> cannot do it; for they
that <HI>by Wisdom</HI> knew not God, had
these things for their <HI>Wisdom:</HI> They
were strong, deep and accurate in
them; but alas, they were clouded,
puft up, and set farther off from the
Inward and Saving Knowledge of
God, because they sought for it in
<PB N="92" REF="54"/>
them, and thought to find God there.
But the <HI>Key of David</HI> is an other thing,
which shuts and no Man opens, and
opens and no Man shuts; and this
Key have all they that receive the
<HI>Gift of God</HI> into their Hearts; and it
opens to them, the Knowledge of
God and themselves, and gives them
a quite <HI>other Sight, Taste</HI> and <HI>Judg∣ment</HI>
of things, than their <HI>Educational</HI>
or <HI>Traditional</HI> Knowledge afforded
them. This is the beginning of the
<HI>New Creation</HI> of God, and thus it is
we come to be New Creatures: And
we are bold to declare there is no o∣ther
way, besides this, by which Peo∣ple
can come into Christ, or to be
true Christians, or receive the Advan∣tage
that comes by the Death and
Sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ.
Wherefore we say, and upon good
Authority, even that of our <HI>own Ex∣perience,</HI>
as well as that of the Scrip∣tures
of Truth, Christ will prove <HI>no
Saving Sacrifice</HI> for them, that <HI>refuse</HI>
him for their <HI>Example.</HI> They that
<PB N="93" REF="54"/>
<HI>reject</HI> the Gift, do <HI>deny</HI> the <HI>Giver,</HI> in∣stead
of themselves <HI>daily,</HI> for the <HI>Gi∣vers</HI>
sake. O that People were wise!
that they would consider their latter
End, and the things that make for
the Peace thereof! Why should they
<HI>perish</HI> in a vain hope of Life, <HI>while
Death Reigns?</HI> Of living with God,
who live not to him, nor walk with
him? <HI>Awake,</HI> thou that sleepest in thy
Sin, or at best, in thy Self-righteous∣ness;
Awake, I say, and Christ shall
give thee Life! For he is the <HI>Lord
from Heaven, the quickening Spirit,</HI>
that quickens us, by his Spirit, if we
do not, <HI>resist</HI> it and <HI>quench</HI> it, by our
Disobedience; but receive, love and
obey it, in all the Holy Leadings and
Teachings of it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 14, 15. To
which Holy Spirit I commend my
<HI>Reader,</HI> that he may the better see
where he is, and also come to the
true Belief and Advantage of the <HI>Do∣ings</HI>
and <HI>Sufferings</HI> of our Dear and
Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ, who saves from the <HI>Power
<PB N="94" REF="55"/>
and Pollution,</HI> as well as Guilt of Sin,
all those that <HI>hear his knocks, and open
the Door of their Hearts</HI> to him, that
he may come in and work a real and
through Reformation in and for them:
And so the <HI>Benefit, Virtue</HI> and <HI>Efficacy</HI>
of his <HI>Doings</HI> and <HI>Sufferings</HI> without
us, will come to be livingly applied
and felt, and Fellowship with Christ
in his Death and Sufferings known,
according to the Doctrine of the Apo∣stle;
which, those that live in that
which made him suffer, know not,
tho' they profess to be saved by his
Death and Sufferings. Much more
might be said as to this matter, but I
must be brief.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 6. To conclude this Chapter,
we wonder not that we should be
mistaken, mis-construed and mis-re∣presented,
in what we believe and do
to Salvation, since our Betters have
been so treated in the Primitive
Times; nor indeed is it only about
<HI>Doctrines</HI> of Religion, for our <HI>Pra∣ctice</HI>
in <HI>Worship</HI> and <HI>Discipline</HI> have
<PB N="95" REF="55"/>
had the same Success: But this is
what I earnestly desire, that however
bold People are pleased to make with
us, they would not <HI>deceive</HI> themselves
in the great things of their own Sal∣vation:
That while they would seem
to own all to Christ, they are not
found <HI>disowned</HI> of Christ in the last
Day. Read the 7th of <HI>Matthew;</HI> it
is he that hears Christ, the great
Word of God, and does what he en∣joins,
what he commands, and by his
Blessed Example, recommends, that
is a <HI>Wise Builder,</HI> that has founded
his House well, and built with good
Materials, and whose House will
stand the last shake and Judgment.
For which cause we are often plain,
close and earnest with People, to
consider, that Christ came not to
save them in, but <HI>from their Sins;</HI> and
that they that think to discharge and
release themselves of his <HI>Yoke</HI> and
<HI>Burden,</HI> his <HI>Cross</HI> and Example, and
secure themselves, and Complement
Christ with his having done all for
<PB N="96" REF="56"/>
them, while he has wrought <HI>little or
nothing in them,</HI> nor they parted with
any thing for the love of him, will
finally awake in a dreadful surprize,
at the sound of the last Trumpet, and
at this sad and irrevokeable Sentence,
<HI>Depart from me, ye Workers of Iniqui∣ty,
I know you not:</HI> Which terrible
End, may all timely avoid, by <HI>hear∣kening</HI>
to Wisdom's Voice, and <HI>turn∣ing</HI>
at her Reproof, that she may lead
them in the Ways of Righteousness,
and in the midst of the Paths of Judg∣ment,
that their Souls may come to
inherit <HI>Substance;</HI> even <HI>durable Riches
and Righteousness</HI> in the Kingdom of
the Father, World without end.</P>

<P>§. 1. AS the Lord wrought ef∣fectually,
by his Divine
Grace, in the Hearts of this People,
so he thereby brought them to a <HI>Di∣vine
Worship and Ministry;</HI> Christ's
words they came to Experience, <HI>viz.
That God was a Spirit, and that he
would therefore be worshipped in the Spi∣rit,
and in the Truth, and that such
Worshippers the Father would seek to
worship him.</HI> For, bowing to the
Convictions of the Spirit in them∣selves,
in their daily course of living,
by which they were taught to es∣chew
that which was made manifest
to them to be evil, and to do that
which was good, they, in their As∣sembling
together, sate down, and
waited for the Preparation of this
Holy Spirit, both to let them see their
States and Conditions before the Lord,
and to worship him acceptably; and
<PB N="99" REF="57"/>
as they were sensible of Wants, or
Shortness, or Infirmities, so in the
secret of their own Hearts, Prayer
would spring to God, through Jesus
Christ, to help, assist and supply
them: But they did not dare to <HI>wake
their Beloved before his time; or ap∣proach
the Throne of the King of Glory,
till he held out his Scepter; or take
thought what they should say,</HI> or after
their own or other Mens studied
<HI>Words and Forms,</HI> for this were to
Offer <HI>strange Fire;</HI> to pray, but not
by the Spirit; to ask, but not in the
Name, that is, in the Power of our
Lord Jesus Christ, who pray'd as well
as that he spoke like one having Au∣thority,
that is, <HI>Power,</HI> a Divine <HI>E∣nergy</HI>
and <HI>Force</HI> to reach and pierce
the Heavens, which he gives to all
that obey his Light, Grace and Spirit,
in their solemn Waitings upon him.
So that 'tis this Peoples Principle,
that <HI>Fire must come from Heaven;</HI>
Life and Power from God to enable
the Soul to pour out it self acceptably
<PB N="100" REF="58"/>
before him. And when a <HI>Coal from
his holy Altar, touches our Lips,</HI> then
can we Pray and Praise him as we
ought to do. And as this is our Prin∣ciple,
and that according to Scripture,
so is it, Blessed be God, our Experi∣ence
and Practice: And therefore it is
we are separated from the Worships
of Men, under their several Forms,
because they do not found it in the
Operation, Motion and Assistance of
the Spirit of Christ, but the Appoint∣ment,
Invention and Framing of
Man, both as to Matter, Words and
Time. We do not dissent in our own
Wills, and we dare not comply a∣gainst
His that has called us, and
brought us to his own Spiritual Wor∣ship;
in Obedience to whom we are
what we are, in our Separation from
the divers Ways of Worship in the
World.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 2. And as our Worship stands
in the Operation of the <HI>Spirit</HI> and
<HI>Truth</HI> in our inward Parts, as before
expressed, so does our <HI>Ministry.</HI> For
<PB N="101" REF="58"/>
as the Holy Testimonies of the Ser∣vants
of God of Old, were from the
Operation of his Blessed Spirit, so
must those of his Servants be in every
Age, and that which has not the Spi∣rit
of Christ for its Spring and Source,
is of Man, and not Christ. Christian
Ministers are to minister <HI>what they re∣ceive:</HI>
This is <HI>Scripture;</HI> now that
which we receive, is not our own,
less another Mans, but the <HI>Lord's:</HI>
So that we are not only not to <HI>Steal</HI>
from our Neighbours, but we are not
to <HI>Study</HI> and speak our <HI>own words.</HI> If
we are not to study what we are to
say before Magistrates for our selves,
less are we to study what we are to
say <HI>for and from</HI> God to the People.
We are to minister, <HI>as the Oracles of
God;</HI> if so, then must we receive
<HI>from Christ,</HI> God's Great Oracle, what
we are to minister. And if we are
to minister what we receive, then not
what we Study, Collect, and beat
out of our own Brains, for that is not
the Mind of Christ, but our Imagi∣nations,
<PB N="102" REF="59"/>
and this will not Profit the
People.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 3. This was recommended to
the <HI>Corinthians</HI> by the Apostle <HI>Paul,
1 Cor.</HI> 14. that they should speak <HI>as
they were moved</HI> or <HI>as any thing was
revealed to them, by the Spirit,</HI> for the
Edification of the Church; for says
he, <HI>Ye may all Prophecy;</HI> that is, ye
may all Preach to Edification, <HI>as any
thing is revealed to you,</HI> for the Good
of others, <HI>and as the Spirit giveth Vt∣terance.</HI>
And if the Spirit must give
Christ's Ministers their Utterance,
then those that are his, are careful not
to utter any thing in his Name to the
People, without his Spirit; and by
good Consequence, they that go be∣fore
the true Guide, and utter words
without the Knowledge of the Mind
of the Spirit, are none of Christ's Mi∣nisters:
Such certainly run and God
has not sent them, and they cannot
Profit the People. And indeed, how
should they, when it is impossible that
meer Man, with all his Parts, Arts and
<PB N="103" REF="59"/>
Acquirements, <HI>can turn People from
Darkness to Light, and from the Power
of Satan to God,</HI> which is the very End
and Work of the Gospel-Ministry.
It must be Inspired Men, Men Gifted

Heavenly Spirit, that can be qualified
for so great, so inward, and so Spiri∣tual
a Work.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 4. <HI>Ministers</HI> of Christ are his
<HI>Witnesses,</HI> and the Credit of a Wit∣ness
is, that he has <HI>heard, seen</HI> or <HI>han∣dled:</HI>
And thus the Beloved Disciple
states the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> of their
<HI>Mission</HI> and <HI>Ministry; 1 John 1. 1, 3.
That which we have heard, which we have
seen with our Eyes, which we have looked
upon and our hands have handled, that
declare we unto you, that your Fellow∣ship
may be with us, and truly our Fel∣lowship
is with the Father, and with his
Son Jesus Christ.</HI> I say, If Christ's
Ministers are his <HI>Witnesses,</HI> they must
know what they speak; that is, they
must have experienced, and past
through those <HI>States</HI> and <HI>Conditions,</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="60"/>
they Preach of, and practically know
those Truths they declare of to the
People, or they come not in by the
Door, but over the Wall, and are
<HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>Robbers.</HI> He that has
the Key of <HI>David</HI> comes in at the
Door, Christ Jesus, and has his <HI>Ad∣mission</HI>
and <HI>Approbation</HI> from him,
<HI>anointed</HI> by him, the alone <HI>High Priest</HI>
of the Gospel-Dispensation. He it is
that breaths, and <HI>lays his hands</HI> upon
his own Ministers, he anoints them,
and recruits their Cruice, and renews
their Horn with <HI>Oyl,</HI> that they may
have it fresh and fresh, for every Oc∣casion

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 5. Nor is this all, <HI>but as they Re∣ceive
freely, freely they Give:</HI> They do
not Teach for <HI>Hire,</HI> Divine for <HI>Mony,</HI>
nor Preach for <HI>Gifts</HI> or <HI>Rewards.</HI> It
was Christ's Holy Command to his
Ministers to give <HI>freely,</HI> and it is our
Practice. And truly we cannot but
admire that this should be made a

<PB N="105" REF="60"/>
should not be seen to be one; yea a
<HI>Mark</HI> of False Prophets, when it has
been so frequently and severely cried
out upon, by the True Prophets of
God in former times. I would not
be Uncharitable, but the Guilty are
desired to call to mind, who it was
that offered Mony to be made a Mi∣nister,
and what it was for; if not to
get Mony and make a Trade or Live∣lihood
by it; and what answer he
met with from the Apostle <HI>Peter,
Acts</HI> 8. 18, 19, 20. The Lord <HI>Touch</HI>
the Hearts of those that are giving
Mony to be made Ministers, in order
to live by their Preaching, that they
may see what ground it is they build
upon, and repent, and turn to the
Lord, that they may find Mercy, and
become living Witnesses of his Power
and Goodness in their own Souls; so
may they be enabled to tell others
<HI>What God has done for them,</HI> which is
the <HI>Root</HI> and <HI>Ground</HI> of the true Mi∣nistry;
and this Ministry it is that
God does Bless. I could say much
<PB N="106" REF="61"/>
on this Subject, but let what has been
said suffice at this time, only I can∣not
but observe, that where any Re∣ligion
has a strong Temptation of

there is great Danger of their run∣ning

same Anointing teacheth you, of all
things, and is Truth, and is no Lye:
And even as it hath taught you, <HI>ye
shall abide in him.</HI></HI> In which <HI>Three</HI>
things are observable. <HI>1st,</HI> That he
writ his Epistle upon an extraordina∣ry
Occasion, <HI>viz.</HI> to prevent their
<HI>Delusion. 2dly.</HI> That he asserts a
nearer and superior Minister than
himself, <HI>viz. The <HI>Anointing or
Grace</HI></HI> they had received; and
that not only in that particular
Exigency, but in <HI>all Cases</HI> that
might attend them. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That
if they did but take heed to the
Teachings of it, they would have
no need of Man's Directions, or fear
of his Seducings. At least of <HI>no Mi∣nistry
<PB N="108" REF="62"/>
that comes not from the Power
of the Anointing:</HI> Though I rather
take the Apostle in the highest Sence
of the Words, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 4. 9. Thus also
the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Thessalonians.
But as touching Brotherly Love, ye need
not that I write unto you: For ye your
selves are <HI>Taught of God</HI> to Love
one another.</HI> But <HI>Helps</HI> are useful,
and a great Blessing, if from God,
such was <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptists;</HI> but re∣member
he pointed all to Christ,
<HI>John 1. 26. Lo the Lamb of God! I
Baptize you with VVater, but he shall
Baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
with Fire,</HI> Mat. 3. 11. And so the
true Ministry does. And while Peo∣ple
are <HI>Sensual,</HI> and under such an
<HI>Eclipse,</HI> by the Interposition of <HI>Sin</HI>
and <HI>Satan,</HI> God is pleased to send
forth his <HI>Inlightning</HI> Servants to awa∣ken
and turn them <HI>from the Dark∣ness
to the Light in themselves,</HI> that,
through Obedience to it, they may
come to be <HI>Children of the Light,</HI>
John 12. 36, and have their fellow∣ship
<PB N="109" REF="62"/>
one with another in it, and an
Inheritance, at last, with the Saints
in Light for ever.</P>
<P>And as it is the Way God has
taken to Call and Gather People, so
a <HI>Living</HI> and <HI>Holy Ministry</HI> is of great
advantage, to <HI>VVatch over,</HI> and <HI>Build
up</HI> the Young, and <HI>Comfort</HI> and <HI>Esta∣blish</HI>
the feeble and simple Ones. But
still I say, the <HI>more Inward,</HI> the <HI>less
Outward:</HI> The more People come to
be taught Immediately of God, by
the Light of his Word and Spirit in
their Hearts, the less need of out∣ward
means, read <HI>Isa.</HI> 16. 19, 20.
which is held by all to be a <HI>Gospel</HI>
Promise, and the Sun and Moon
there, as general understood to mean
the external Means in the Church.
Compare them with <HI>John 1. 13.
Rom. 1. 19. 1 Cor. 2. 11, 15. 1 Thes.
4. 9. 1 John 2. 20, 27. Rev.</HI> 21. 22,
23, 24. All which points at what we
assert of the sufficiency and glorious
Priviledge of Inward and Spiritual
Teachings. And most certainly, as
<PB N="110" REF="63"/>
Men <HI>Grow in Grace, and know the A∣nointing</HI>
of the Word in themselves,
the Dispensation will be less in
Words (though in Words) and more
in Life; and Preaching will, in great
Measure, be turned into <HI>Praising,</HI> and
the Worship of God, more into <HI>Walk∣ing
with,</HI> than Talking of God: For
that is <HI>VVorship indeed,</HI> that <HI>Bows</HI> to
his Will at all Times, and in all Pla∣ces:
The <HI>truest,</HI> the <HI>highest</HI> Worship
Man is capable of in this World.
And it is that Conformity that gives
Communion, and there is no fellow∣ship
with God, no Light of his Coun∣tenance
to be enjoyed, no Peace and
Assurance to be had, further than
there is <HI>Obedience</HI> to his Will, and a
<HI>Faithfulness</HI> to his Word, according
to the Manifestation of the Light
thereof in the Heart.</P>
<P>I say, this is the <HI>truest</HI> and <HI>highest</HI>
State of Worship; for <HI>Set Days and
Places,</HI> with all the Solemnity of
them, were most in Request <HI>in the</HI>
weakest Dispensation. <HI>Altars, Ark,</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="63"/>
and <HI>Temples, Sabbaths</HI> and <HI>Festivals,</HI>
&amp;c. are not to be found in the Wri∣tings
of the New Testament. There,
every Day's <HI>alike,</HI> and
every Place is <HI>alike;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 14. 5, 6, 7, 8, 17. 1 Cor. 8. 6. Col. 2. 16. 17. Phil. 1. 21. Gal. 2. 20.</NOTE> but
if there were a Dedicati∣on,
<HI>let it be to the Lord.</HI>
Thus the Apostle, but
he plainly shews a State beyond it,
<HI>for to Live</HI> (with him) <HI>was Christ,
and to Dye was Gain;</HI> for the Life he
Lived, <HI>was by the Faith of the Son of
God, and therefore it was not he that
Lived, but <HI>Christ that Lived in
him;</HI></HI> that is, that <HI>Ruled, Conducted,</HI>
and <HI>bore Sway</HI> in him; which is the
<HI>true Christian Life;</HI> the <HI>Supersensual
Life;</HI> the <HI>Life of Conversion</HI> and <HI>Re∣generation;</HI>
to which all the <HI>Dispen∣sations</HI>
of God, and <HI>Ministry</HI> of his
Servants have ever tended, as the <HI>Con∣summation</HI>
of God's Work for Man's
Happiness. Here every Man's a
<HI>Temple,</HI> and every Family a <HI>Church,</HI>
and every Place, is a <HI>Meeting-Place,</HI>
and every Visit a <HI>Meeting.</HI> And yet
<PB N="112" REF="64"/>
a little while and it shall be so yet
more and more; and a People the
Lord is now Preparing to enter into
this Sabbath or Degree of Rest.</P>
<P>Not that we would be thought
to <HI>undervalue Publick</HI> and Solemn
Meetings: We have them all over
the Nations where the Lord has cal∣led
us. Yea, tho' but Two or Three
of us be in a Corner of a County; we
meet, as the Apostle Exhorted the
Saints of his time, and Reproved such
as Neglected to Assemble themselves.
But yet shew we unto thee, O <HI>Rea∣der,</HI>
a <HI>more excellent Way</HI> of Wor∣ship:
For many may come to those
Meetings, and go away <HI>Carnal, Dead,</HI>
and <HI>Dry;</HI> but the Worshippers <HI>in
Spirit</HI> and <HI>in Truth,</HI> whose <HI>Hearts</HI>
Bow, whose <HI>Minds</HI> Adore the Eter∣nal
God, <HI>that is a Spirit,</HI> in and by
his Spirit, such as conform to his Will,
and walk with him in a Spiritual Life,
they are the <HI>True, Constant, Living,</HI>
and <HI>Acceptable Worshippers;</HI> whether
it be in Meetings or out of Meetings;
<PB N="113" REF="64"/>
And as with such, all outward Assem∣blies
are greatly Comfortable, so al∣so
do we meet for a <HI>Publick</HI> Testi∣mony
of Religion and Worship, and
for the <HI>Edification</HI> and <HI>Encouragement</HI>
of those that are yet Young in the
Truth, and to <HI>Call</HI> and <HI>Gather</HI> others
to the knowledge of it, who are yet
going astray; and Blessed be God,
it is not in vain, since many are there∣by
added to the Church, that we
hope and believe shall be Saved.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 1. AND as God has been pleased
to call us from an <HI>Human</HI>
Ministry, so we cannot for Consci∣ence-sake
<HI>Support</HI> and <HI>Maintain</HI> it, and
upon that Score, and not out of <HI>Hu∣mour</HI>
or <HI>Covetousness,</HI> we refuse to pay
<HI>Tithes,</HI> or such-like pretended Dues,
concerning which, many Books have
been writ in our Defence: We can∣not
Support what we cannot Ap∣prove,
but have a Testimony against;
for thereby we should be found <HI>In∣consistent</HI>
with our selves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 2. We dare not <HI>Swear,</HI> because
Christ forbids it, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. 34, 37. and
<HI>James,</HI> his true follower. It is Need∣less
as well as Evil, for the reason of
<PB N="116" REF="66"/>
Swearing, being <HI>Vntruth,</HI> that Men's
<HI>Yea was not Yea,</HI> Swearing was used
to awe Men to Truth Speaking, and
to give others Satisfaction, that what
was Sworn, was true. But the true
Christians, <HI>Yea, being Yea,</HI> the end of
an Oath is answered, and there∣fore
the use of it is <HI>Needless, Super∣fluous,
and cometh of</HI> Evil. The Apo∣stle
<HI>James</HI> Taught the same Doctrine,
and the Primitive Christians Practis∣ed
it, as may be seen in the Book of
<HI>Martyrs;</HI> as also the earliest and best
of the Reformers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 3. We also believe, that <HI>War
ought to cease,</HI> among the followers of
the <HI>Lamb</HI> Christ Jesus, who taught
his Disciples to <HI>forgive and love their
Enemies,</HI> and not to War against
them, and kill them; and that there∣fore
the Weapons of his true Follow∣ers
are not <HI>Carnal</HI> but <HI>Spiritual;</HI> yet
mighty, through God, to cut down
<HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Wickedness,</HI> and <HI>Dethrone</HI> him
that is the Author thereof. And as
this is the most Christian, so the most
<PB N="117" REF="66"/>
Rational Way; Love and Perswasion
having more Force than Weapons of
War. Nor would the worst of Men
easily be brought to hurt those that
they really think love them. 'Tis that
Love and Patience must in the end
have the Victory.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 4. We dare not give worldly
Honour, or use the Frequent and
<HI>Modish Salutations</HI> of the Times, see∣ing
plainly, that <HI>Vanity, Pride</HI> and
<HI>Ostentation</HI> belong to them. <HI>Christ</HI>
also forbid them in his Day, and
made the Love of them a Mark of
Declension from the Simplicity of
purer times; and his Disciples, and
their Followers, were observed to
have obeyed their Masters Precept.
It is not to <HI>Distinguish</HI> our selves a
Party, or out of <HI>Pride, Ill-breeding</HI> or
<HI>Humour,</HI> but in Obedience to the
Sight and Sence we have received
from the Spirit of Christ, of the <HI>evil
Rise</HI> and <HI>Tendency</HI> thereof.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 5. For the same Reason we
have returned to the first <HI>Plainness</HI> of
<PB N="118" REF="67"/>
Speech, <HI>viz. Thou</HI> and <HI>Thee,</HI> to a
single Person; which tho' Men give
no other to God, they will hardly en∣dure
it from us. It has been a great
<HI>Test</HI> upon Pride, and shewn the <HI>Blind</HI>
and <HI>weak Insides</HI> of many. This also
is out of <HI>pure Conscience,</HI> whatever
People may think or say of us for it.
We may be Despised, and have been
so often, yea, very evilly Entreated,
but we are now better known, and
People better Informed. In short, 'tis
also both <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Grammar,</HI> and
we have Propriety of Speech for it,
as well as Peace in it,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 6. We cannot allow of <HI>mix'd
Marriages,</HI> that is, to joyn with such as
are not of our Society; but Oppose
and Disown them, if at any time
any of our Profession so grosly err
from the Rule of their Communion;
yet Restore them upon sincere Re∣pentance,
but not disjoyn them.
The Book I writ of the Rise and Pro∣gress
of the People called Quakers, is
more full and express herein.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<P><PB N="119" REF="67"/>
§. 7. <HI>Plainness in Apparel and Fur∣niture,</HI>
is another Testimony peculiar
to us, in the degree we have bore it
to the World: As also, <HI>few Words,</HI>
and being <HI>at a Word.</HI> Likewise <HI>Tem∣perance</HI>
in <HI>Food,</HI> and <HI>Abstinence</HI> from the
<HI>Recreations</HI> and <HI>Pastimes</HI> of the World:
All which we have been taught,
by the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to be according to Godliness; and
therefore we have long exhorted all
that their <HI>Moderation may be known
unto all Men, for that the Lord was at
hand,</HI> to enter into Judgment with
us for every Intemperance or Excess;
and herein we hope we have been no
ill Examples, or Scandal unto any
that have a due Consideration of
things.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 8. We cannot in Conscience to
God, observe <HI>Holy days</HI> (so called) the
Publick <HI>Fasts</HI> and <HI>Feasts,</HI> because of
their <HI>Human</HI> Institution and Ordina∣tion,
and that they have not a Divine
<PB N="120" REF="68"/>
Warrant, but are appointed in the
Will of Man.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<P>§. 9. Lastly, We have been lead,
by this Good Spirit of our Lord <HI>Jesus
Christ,</HI> of which I have treated in
this Discourse, according to <HI>Pri∣mitive</HI>
Practice, to have a <HI>due Care</HI>
over one another, for the Preserva∣tion
of the whole <HI>Society,</HI> in a Con∣versation
<HI>suitable</HI> to their Holy Pro∣fession.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> In respect to a <HI>strict</HI> Walk∣ing
both towards those that are With∣out,
and those that are Within; that
their Conversation in the World, and
Walking in and towards the Church,
may be blameless. That as they
may be <HI>Strict</HI> in the one, so they may
be <HI>Faithful</HI> in the other.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That Collections be made
to supply the Wants of the <HI>Poor,</HI> and
that care be taken of <HI>Widows</HI> and <HI>Or∣phans,</HI>
and such as are helpless, as
well in <HI>Council</HI> as about <HI>Subsistance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="68"/>
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> That all such as are in∣tended
to Marry, if they have <HI>Pa∣rents,</HI>
or are under the Direction of
<HI>Guardians</HI> or <HI>Trustees,</HI> are obliged,
<HI>First,</HI> to declare to them their Inten∣tion,
and have their Consent <HI>before</HI>
they propose it to one another, and
the Meeting they relate to, who are
<HI>also careful</HI> to examine their Clear∣ness,
and being satisfied with it,
They are by them allowed to Solem∣nize
their Marriage in a Publick Se∣lect
Meeting, for that Purpose Appoin∣ted,
and not otherwise: Whereby all
<HI>Clandestine</HI> and <HI>Indirect</HI> Marriages are
prevented among us.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> And to the end that this
<HI>Good Order</HI> may be observed, for the
Comfort and Edification of the whole
<HI>Society,</HI> in the Ways of <HI>Truth</HI> and
<HI>Soberness; Select</HI> Meetings, of <HI>Care</HI>
and <HI>Business,</HI> are fix'd in all Parts,
where we Inhabit, which are held
<HI>Monthly,</HI> and which Resolve into
<HI>Quarterly</HI> Meetings, and those into
one <HI>Yearly</HI> Meeting, for our better
<PB N="122" REF="69"/>
Communication one with another, in
those things that maintain <HI>Piety</HI> and
<HI>Charity;</HI> that God, who by his Grace,
has called us to be a People to his
Praise, may have it from us, through
his Beloved Son, and our Ever-blessed
