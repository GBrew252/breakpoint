<HEAD><HI>To my Honest Friend Mr.</HI> Fled-wit, <HI>Clerk to Mr.</HI> Dull-man.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Jack,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had finisht this little Piece, I was thinking what Duke, Marquess, Earl, Lord, Knight, Squire or Gentleman to De∣dicate it to; but hearing thou wert come to Town from thy Fathers Paternal Seat of <HI>Fled-wit-Hall,</HI> I laid aside my thoughts of such designs, and to thy own judicious self Present this <HI>Poem.</HI></P>
<P>Ah <HI>Jack!</HI> those glorious Times are over, when thou and I were Chums together at <HI>Brazenose College</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> when we valued Tutors, Proctors, or Vice-chancellors no more than a Vint∣ner does a Proclamation against <HI>French Wines.</HI> When others were studying or making Declama∣tions in the Schools, we were Refreshing our Un∣derstanding with the Juice of the Grape at the Crown; and I'll say that for thee, thou didst use to be so Witty after the second Bottle, and hadst such Magnificent Puns, such Exalted Clinches,
<PB REF="3"/>
such Caterquibbles and Cunundrums, as would have serv'd to have set up half a Dozen Fourth-Rate Poets.</P>
<P>Since our Parents, our Destinies, our Fate, or what you please to call it, design'd us for the study of the Law, after which, tho we have Rode Whip and Spur, we are never like to overtake, and therefore are resolv'd never to break our Brains with <HI>Cook</HI> upon <HI>Littleton, Plowden, Keeble,</HI> or <HI>Fitzherbert:</HI> No, let the Fraterni∣ty prate their Unintelligible Jargon at the Bar till their Lungs ake, we have found out a more pleasant way of Living.—But let the worst come to the worst, 'tis at last but going to the Devil—Tavern I mean; And so dear Rogue, I wish thee a pleasant Term, with two Thousand Millions of Rich easy bleeding Clients, hoping, expecting, desiring, wishing, nay certainly believ∣ing you would have the same good Luck attend,</P>

<L>WEllcome thou long expected <HI>Season,</HI></L>
<L>Wellcome as is to Madmen Reason,</L>
<L>To Prisners Freedom, Thieves a Pardon,</L>
<L>Or Rescue when the Bums press hard-on</L>
<L>Poor Debtor fly'ng through Lanes and Alleys,</L>
<L>To scape a Jayl far worse than Gallows;</L>

For there is no great alteration</L>

<L>The difference is scarce a Tester</L>
<L>'Twixt Terms of <HI>Hilary</HI> or <HI>Easter,</HI></L>
<L>Or <HI>Michaelmas</HI> or <HI>Trinity,</HI></L>
<L>Compar'd with Gains we find in thee:</L>
<L>True, at those times we keep a stir</L>
<L>In famous <HI>Hall of Westminster,</HI></L>
<L>In torn Bar-Gowns we loudly bawl,</L>
<L>And <HI>Eccho</HI> murmurs through the Hall,</L>
<L>In Tryals mix our Sense with <HI>Jokes</HI></L>
<L>On <HI>John a Stiles</HI> and <HI>John a Nokes;</HI></L>
<L>Not Plough-Man sweats so much as we</L>
<L>To get a Clients <HI>Guinea Fee;</HI></L>

<L>If not their <HI>Purse,</HI> their <HI>Wems</HI> they fill:</L>
<L>Did they at first their Errand tell,</L>
<L>They might be Kickt or Cudgell'd well;</L>

<L>No, there is certainly a Spell</L>

<L>Twenty <HI>Atturneys</HI> of that swarm,</L>
<L>Who flock from <HI>Norfolk</HI> to the <HI>Term,</HI></L>
<L>With Hearts all Light, and Purses Swelling,</L>

<L>What they should have that Night for Sup∣per,</L>

<L>Here by a purling Brook there sits</L>

<L>For having once at <HI>London</HI> been,</L>

<L>Begins a <HI>Health,</HI> which each one follows</L>

But where the <HI>Sages</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI></L>
<L>Did use to sit, were <HI>Boys at Taw,</HI></L>

<L>Stood where the Learned Counsel Plead,</L>

<L>The place appear'd so Melancholy,</L>
<L>To stay there longer was a folly,</L>

<L>Sitting on Steps by <HI>Horse</HI> of <HI>Brass,</HI></L>
<L>Saw <HI>Splitcause</HI> the <HI>Solliciter,</HI></L>
<L>Expecting, like some humble Cur,</L>
<L>What scraps or bones would fall for Dinner;</L>
<L>Taking compassion on the Sinner,</L>
<L>To Cellar gave him Invitation,</L>

<L>To cram his Guts with <HI>Beef</HI> and <HI>Pudding,</HI></L>
<L>Which for two days had had no Food in;</L>

His Belly fill'd and Bones at rest,</L>
<L>He told me that with Interest</L>
<L>He would repay the Obligation</L>
<L>I shew'd him in the <HI>Long Vacation,</HI></L>
<L>And had he had but <HI>Cole</HI> in <HI>Pockets,</HI></L>
<L>He'd take me instantly to <HI>Lockets,</HI></L>
<L>And fill my Skin with old <HI>Burgundy,</HI></L>
<L>But he would not forget me one day:</L>
<L>Seeming to like his grateful Humour,</L>
<L>We parted, when just 'gainst the <HI>Rummer,</HI></L>
<L>I met a <HI>very honest Croney,</HI></L>
<L>Who values, just like Dirt, his Mony;</L>
<L>But by his sad dejected looks,</L>
<L>I found his Purse was off the Hooks,</L>
<L>To meet (as ev'ry Mortal well-knows)</L>
<L>A Man with Stockins out at Elbows,</L>
<L>His Linnen foul, and Cloaths all torn in,</L>
<L>With Hands and Face in Nat'ral Mourning,</L>
<L>Informs a Man, beyond all doubt,</L>
<L>The World and he are fallen out:</L>
<L>He seem'd amaz'd when first I met him;</L>
<L>But since I was resolv'd to Treat him,</L>
<L>Consented, and to drown all Sorrow,</L>
<L>All anxious thoughts about to morrow,</L>

Drank Bumpers <HI>Supernaculum,</HI></L>
<L>To better Luck for time to come;</L>
<L>Strange power of <HI>Wine,</HI> whose sprightly Juice,</L>
<L>Can a new kind of Soul infuse:</L>
<L>My Friend had now forgot his Cares,</L>
<L>And for a chearful Song prepares;</L>
<L>Nay, thought himself as great to th'full,</L>
<L>As is the <HI>Indian Great Mogull:</HI></L>
<L>But I not willing the Delusion</L>
<L>Should bring his Senses to Confusion,</L>
<L>Soon sent him Home in Hackney-Coach,</L>
<L>To keep him from a worse Debauch.</L>

<LG>
<L>Walking along the <HI>Strand,</HI> a <HI>Strange</HI></L>
<L><HI>Young Spark</HI> salutes me by th' <HI>Exchange:</HI></L>
<L>I knew him not, yet he'd pretend</L>
<L>To be my Servant and my Friend,</L>
<L>And that as well we knew each other,</L>
<L>As if the one was t'others Brother:</L>
<L>Amaz'd I stood in strange suspense;</L>
<L>But he with Air of Impudence,</L>
<L>"Cry'd, surely Sir you can't forget</L>
<L>"Our last Intreague in <HI>Surry-street,</HI></L>
<L>"When amongst Ladies half a Dozen,</L>
<L>"You only did select my Cousin;</L>

"She's a brisk Tit, and Sir you know it,</L>
<L>"(Then begs my Ear) could you allow it,</L>

<L>"I should be yours more than my own;</L>
<L>I straight survey'd my <HI>Spark</HI> all o're,</L>
<L>Having ne're seen his Face before,</L>
<L>Instead of lending him a <HI>George,</HI></L>
<L>Kickt him and made him walk at large.</L>

<L>From thence I met with no Adventure,</L>
<L>Until I did the <HI>Temple</HI> Enter;</L>
<L>Which come to, with amazement saw</L>
<L>A brisk pretender to the Law,</L>
<L>Who was in Term-time all men know</L>
<L>A mighty Dressing Sparkish <HI>Beau,</HI></L>
<L>And would with <HI>Tooth-Pick</HI> fixt in Mouth,</L>
<L>Stand three full hours by th' Clock in troth</L>
<L>At <HI>Temple-Gate,</HI> with Roguish Leering,</L>
<L>Ogling all women who came near him;</L>
<L>But now by some strange turn of Fate</L>
<L>Reduc'd to very mean Estate;</L>
<L>His <HI>Beaver</HI> was reduced to <HI>Caster,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Nekcloath</HI> hardly worth a <HI>Tester,</HI></L>
<L>Tuckt in within a tatter'd <HI>Wastcoat,</HI></L>
<L>O're which, a <HI>Coat</HI> was once a <HI>Lac'd-Coat;</HI></L>

A <HI>Wigg</HI> so full of Knots and Stains,</L>
<L>As if't had seen a score <HI>Campaigns,</HI></L>
<L>And all the other Cloaths he wore,</L>
<L>Like those we mentioned just before:</L>
<L>Surpriz'd I was, I must confess,</L>
<L>At such an odd and uncouth Dress;</L>
<L>Whether 'twas Gaming, Whoring, Drinking</L>
<L>Reduc'd him, thought not worth my think∣ing;</L>
<L>So passing on to <HI>King</HI>'s<HI>-Bench</HI> Walk,</L>
<L>Survey'd a Num'rous crew were Talk-Ing, hither, thither, to and fro,</L>
<L>As if they'd little else to do:</L>
<L>Poor <HI>Pettifogging Pimps</HI> o'th' Law,</L>
<L><HI>Trav'lers</HI> who ne're Salt-water saw,</L>
<L><HI>Alsatian Biters</HI> and their <HI>Cullies,</HI></L>

<L><HI>Projectors</HI> and their <HI>Undertakers,</HI></L>
<L><HI>News Writing 'Squires</HI> and <HI>Ballad Makers,</HI></L>
