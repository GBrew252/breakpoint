<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen I consider the
many worthy works
which had their first
being within the
bounds of this our Parish, I may
justly be ashamed, that my weak
<PB REF="5"/>
endeavours should be borne in
the same place.</P>
<P>For first, the book of <HI>Mr.
Cranmer</HI> (afterwards Arch-Bishop
of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and
Martyr) containing the Rea∣sons
against King <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>8<SUP>th</SUP></HI>
his Marriage with <HI>Queen Ka∣tharine
Dowager,</HI> was
compiled in our<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Fox</HI> Acts and Monu∣ments, page 1860.</NOTE> Pa∣rish,
whilest the said
<HI>Cranmer</HI> retired hither (in the
time of a Plague at <HI>Cam∣bridge</HI>)
to teach his Pupils.
Thus did <HI>Waltham</HI> give Rome
the first deadly blow in <HI>En∣gland,</HI>
occasioning the Popes
<PB REF="5"/>
primacy to totter therein, till it
tumbled down at last.</P>
<P>The large and learned works
of the no lesse Religious then In∣dustrious
<HI>Mr. Fox</HI> in his book
of Martyrs was penned here,
leaving his posterity a consider∣able
estate at this day possessed
by them in this Parish.</P>
<P>What shall I speak of the no
lesse pleasant then profitable
pains of Reverend Bishop <HI>Hall</HI>
(predecessor in my place) the
main body of whose Books bears
date from <HI>Waltham.</HI></P>
<P>And shall my unworthy pam∣phlet
presume to follow such able
<PB REF="6"/>
works from the same place?
However seeing my publike pro∣mise
is solemnly past to you, to
Print the same (hoping some
profit may thence arise to you
and others) let it as a Page at
due distance wait upon the works
of those most eminent Authors.</P>
<P>Some will say this your <HI>In∣fants
Advocate</HI> hath almost
been as long in the breeding, and
birth, as Infants use to lye in
their Mothers womb; so many
moneths hath past betwixt the
promise and performance there∣of.
But let none grudge the
time if it appear at last in its
<PB REF="6"/>
<HI>perfect shape,</HI> coming forth
soon enough for those who will
reap benefit thereby; Too soon
for such who will take causless
offence thereat.</P>
<P>Some perchance will take ex∣ception
at the plainness thereof
which by me was purposely af∣fected
herein. It is a good leslon
which may be learned from the
mouth of a bad master, even
Rayling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 Kings 18. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Rabshakeh,</HI>
not to deliver a message
of publick concernment, in a
language which a few Courtiers
only do understand, but in a
tongue whereby all the <HI>people
<PB REF="7"/>
on the wall</HI> may partake there∣of.
And seeing the generali∣ty
of our opposers are unlearned,
I conceived it my duty to decline
all difficult words and phrases,
that all might more easily and
perfectly perceive the truth ther∣in.</P>
<P>Some perchance might expect
a confutation of their practice
which are Re-baptized; a task
needless for me to perform. For
such repetition of Baptism will
follow of course to be vain, if not
wicked, unneedful if not unlaw∣ful;
where the lawfulness and
needfulness of Infants Baptism
<PB REF="7"/>
hath formerly been proved. Bap∣tism
<HI>once wel done</HI> on Infants,
I may say, is <HI>twice done,</HI> which
<HI>twice done is once ill done,</HI>
namely when it is iterated the se∣cond
time without any just rea∣son
for the same.</P>
<P>What remains (dear Pari∣shioners)
but that I pray that
my weak Preaching may be
powerful and profitable unto
you, that you may <HI>do and suf∣fer</HI>
cheerfully according to the
will of God; Remember the ad∣dition

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Mongst the many <HI>Lying

not the last, and least what they

Of him they report that <HI>he spake
as soon as ever he was born, and pro∣fessing
himself to be a Christian alrea∣dy
in his heart, requested (or rather
required) that he might be Bapti∣zed,
which done, he instantly ended
his life.</HI></P>
<P>I know not whether to call this
a <HI>Childs fable</HI> from the <HI>subject,</HI> or
in the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 4. 7.</NOTE> Apostles lan∣guage,
<HI>an old wives fa∣ble</HI>
from the <HI>inventors</HI>
thereof: Otherwise, were this
true, and all children like him,
this our <HI>Infants Advocate</HI> were ut∣terly
useless, and our pains for the
present altogether superfluous,
which now we believe and hope
may be profitable for those who
cannot plead for themselves. For
<PB REF="9"/>
though I cannot with
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Job 29. 15</NOTE> <HI>Job be eyes to the blind,</HI>
and <HI>feet to the lame;</HI> that is, re∣lieve
their poverty, out of a plen∣tiful
estate; yet I will endeavour
to be a <HI>tongue to the dumb,</HI> and
plead as well as I may, in their be∣half.</P>
<P>True it is, I must confesse with
that good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Jer. 1. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Prophet,</HI> not
in respect of my age (be∣ing
past the vertical point there∣of)
but of my other infirmities,
<HI>behold I cannot speak for I am a child,</HI>
and if a <HI>child</HI> be <HI>advocate</HI> for <HI>chil∣dren,</HI>
the cause is likely to be poor∣ly
pleaded: However I will en∣deavour
to supply in integrity,
what I want in ability; and some∣times
a <HI>cordial counsel,</HI> who zea∣lously
engageth for his client, is
<PB REF="10"/>
to be accepted for his hearty in∣tentions
and affections, though
falling short of others in his per∣formances.</P>
<P>Indeed <HI>great is the multitude of
pleaders,</HI> who have undertook
this cause, and truly the more
the better, such the worth there∣of
to deserve, the weight thereof
to require, many defenders against
the fiercenesse and multitude of
modern opposers. But here give
me leave to bemoan a sad acci∣dent,
that the <HI>councel</HI> cannot agree
amongst themselves how to ma∣nage
their <HI>clients</HI> cause. Some
found it on a Jewish ceremony of
washing; others fasten it only on
the ancient practice of the Primi∣tive
Church; others graft it on
the Analogie of Circumcision;
<PB REF="10"/>
others bottom it on an implicite
precept; others on expresse argu∣ments
in the New Testament.
And which is the worse, many of
these are not content alone to pre∣fer,
and advance their own opi∣nion,
except also they decry,
and destroy, confute, and con∣found
the arguments of others, by
which discords, our adversaries
in this point gain to themselves
no small advantage.</P>
<P>I am confident those our adver∣saries
long since had wanted wea∣pons,
had not our friends furnish∣ed
them with all manner of muni∣tion
out of our own magazins.
Yet dare I not challenge such
pleaders for Infants Baptism of
<HI>disloyaltie,</HI> as if they wilfully be∣trayed
their trust herein; though
<PB REF="11"/>
I cannot excuse them for <HI>indiscre∣tion,</HI>
whereby they have prejudi∣ced
that cause, they endeavoured
to defend.</P>
<P>It would be well therefore for
the time to come, if the assertors
of Pedo-Baptism, on what bot∣tom
soever they builded, (<HI>store in
this kind is no sore, and the firmer it is
that stands on so many foundations</HI>)
raise their own Reasons without
opposing the arguments of others
who agree with them in judge∣ment,
though going by different
ways to the end of the same place.</P>
<P>It is said of every Locust, that
marched in Gods Army
<HI>they shall</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Joel 2. 8.</NOTE> <HI>not thrust one
another, they shall walk every one in
his path,</HI> on Gods blessing; let the
assertors of Childrens Baptism
<PB REF="11"/>
(what way soever they imbrace
for the proof thereof) proceed
fairly and friendly in their own
tract, and leave off justling those
who go next to them in another
path. Thus desiring, Reader, Gods

pains, I remain,</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Circumcision.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>What it was, on whom, by whom,
and when to be administred. The
Penalty of wilful Recusants there
in.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>IRCUMCISION was the cutting
off of a skin, in those parts
which nature hath covered
with shame, which might
be spared without danger of
life, hinderance of generation, or visible
deformity.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="13"/>
The solemn Institution hereof we find
<HI>Gen.</HI> 17. where it was commanded to
<HI>Abraham</HI> and his seed; before which time
(though allowing something Sacramental
in the <HI>Tree of Life, Ark, &amp;c.</HI>) the Church
of God had (<HI>Sacrifices</HI> but) no constant
and continuing <HI>Sacrament.</HI></P>
<P>This Circumcision is subject to many
carnal objections, which corrupt Nature
may urge against it. First, some accuse
it as an immodest Ceremony; whereas in∣deed
no such wantons as such, who pre∣tend
to more modesty then God com∣mands.
If a strict enquiry should be made
into their lives, it is more then suspicious,
<HI>Eph.</HI> 5. 12. <HI>It would be a shame to speak of
those things which are done by them in se∣cret.</HI></P>
<P>Others are offended at such Cruelty
therein exercised on a small Infant, as pro∣bably
with the pain thereof, might drive
it into a Feavour.</P>
<P>It is answered, that was cruelty indeed
which wil-worship commanded super∣stitious
Parents to afford to their Idols,
when 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 17. 31. <HI>They burnt their
children in fire to the gods of Sephar Va∣im:</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
Call not Circumcision Cruelty, but
what indeed it was, Mercy, Pity, and
Compassion; that such who by nature
were <HI>children of wrath,</HI> and deserved dam∣nation,
had by Gods mercy, their suffer∣ings
commuted into the short pain of <HI>Cir∣cumcision.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, we are bound to believe that
God doubled the guard of his providence,
to preserve such infants as were ordered
according to his command. Indeed if the
<HI>Priests</HI> of <HI>Baal, who with knives, and lan∣ces
cut themselves till the bloud gushed out,</HI>
1 <HI>Kings</HI> 18. 28. I say, if such superstitious
<HI>Bedlams,</HI> should have their wounds fester
and <HI>gangreen,</HI> they dyed <HI>felons de se,</HI> and
the Devils Martyrs; seeing God never re∣quired
it at their hands. But if any infant
miscarried under <HI>Circumcision,</HI> (the prece∣dents
whereof we conceive very rare) be∣ing
a divine ordinance and injunction; the
Parents might comfortably presume of
the final good estate thereof; who ren∣dred
his soul in service to Gods com∣mand.</P>
<P>Come we now to consider on whom
<HI>Circumcision</HI> was to be administred. These
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
were <HI>all the males,</HI> and <HI>only the males</HI> of
<HI>Abrahams</HI> family, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 13.</P>
<P>All the Males
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Born in his house.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Bought for money.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In the latter observe a miraculous pro∣vidence:
How many of these persons be∣ing
taken prisoners, and sold, like <HI>beasts</HI>
in the <HI>slave-market,</HI> accounted themselves
utterly undone for the losse of (<HI>the life of
their Life</HI>) their Liberty? What sighing,
what sobbing, what grieving, what groa∣ning
for their forlorn condition? But
oh! Let them not sorrow that they are
sold, but rejoyce that <HI>Abraham</HI> hath
bought them; How had they been <HI>un∣done,</HI>
if they had not been <HI>undone? Sold
under sin</HI> for ever, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 14. if not sold
unto <HI>Abraham.</HI> See here in some cases it
is better to be a good mans <HI>slave,</HI> then a
great mans <HI>Son.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Only Males.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> How cometh it to passe that so
many as amount to the <HI>halfe</HI> of <HI>reasonable
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouls</HI> were excluded the Sacrament. If
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
the <HI>Grecians</HI> Acts 6. 1. murmured against
the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> because their widows were
neglected in the <HI>ministration</HI> of <HI>Almes,</HI>
had not the <HI>weaker sex</HI> cause to grieve and
grudge at men that neither their widows,
wives, nor virgins, were included in the
administration of <HI>Circumcision?</HI> Besides,
no <HI>Sacrament,</HI> no <HI>Salvation.</HI> Their not
partaking of the <HI>sign,</HI> might cause them
to suspect the <HI>substance,</HI> and question their
<HI>title</HI> to <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>happiness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Before we come to the parti∣cular
answer hereof, be it premised, that
had God created at the first two distinct,
and absolute, (as to the mutual depen∣dance
each on other) principles of mans
being, the one <HI>male,</HI> the other <HI>female;</HI>
and had they both, wilfully forfeited
their integrity, then some necessity might
have been pretended that to <HI>Re-covenant</HI>
them both, both <HI>Sexes</HI> should have been
signed with <HI>Circumcision.</HI> But Divine
providence otherwise ordered the matter,
only making man at the first, and woman
of the man.</P>
<P>This laid down, we answer to the Ob∣jection;
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
though women were not for∣mally,
they were vertually <HI>circumcised</HI> in
the <HI>males.</HI> What is done to the head none
will deny done to the body; The <HI>man</HI>
therefore being the <HI>head of the woman,</HI>
1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. such females as died in their
<HI>virginity</HI> were circumcised in their <HI>Fa∣thers;</HI>
such as survived to be <HI>married</HI> were
<HI>circumcised</HI> in their <HI>husbands;</HI> Their nea∣rer
relation (<HI>one flesh</HI>) swallowing up that,
which was more remote in their Father.
And thus all, though not directly, redu∣ctively
<HI>Circumcised.</HI></P>
<P>It follows, <HI>by whom it was administred;</HI>
this generally was the <HI>master of the family,
Abraham Circumcised Isaac,</HI> Gen. 21. 4.
As for <HI>Zipporahs</HI> Circumcising her sons,
<HI>Exod,</HI> 4. 25. in a case of extremity, and
her husbands indisposition, it was an ir∣regular
act, not to be drawn into prece∣dent▪
but to be recounted amongst those,
which when performed are valid, but
ought not to be performed.</P>
<P>Come we now to the time, <HI>When;
eighth day</HI> Here I will not search with
some for a secret sanctity in the Number
of <HI>eight,</HI> (as consisting of <HI>seven,</HI> the Em∣bleme
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
of <HI>Perfection,</HI> with the Addition of
<HI>one,</HI> that is Intirenesse) lest our Curiosi∣ty
reap what Gods wisdom never sowed
therein. The plain reason is this. Before
the <HI>eighth day,</HI> a child was not conceived
to be <HI>consolidated flesh,</HI> but till then in the
bloud of the mother. And for the same
cause, <HI>when a bullock, sheep, or goat was
brought forth,</HI> Levit. 22. 27. <HI>Then it shall
be seven dayes under the dam, and from the
eighth day and thenceforth, it shall be ac∣cepted
for an offering made by fire unto the
Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> What became of the souls of
such <HI>infants,</HI> who died before the eighth
day, and so wanted <HI>Circumcision?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> They wanted not <HI>Circumcision.</HI>
For want is the absence of that which
ought to be had; now there was no ne∣cessity
of, (because no command for)
their <HI>Circumcision,</HI> before that time; God
the <HI>Grand Law-giver,</HI> though <HI>tying</HI> others,
is not <HI>tyed</HI> himself to his <HI>Law:</HI> But can,
and no doubt did, give spiritual <HI>grace</HI> to
many <HI>infants,</HI> (chiefly if children of be∣lieving
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
<HI>Parents</HI>) dying in their <HI>non-age,</HI>
of <HI>their non-age,</HI> (before the <HI>eighth
day</HI>) and incapacity of the <HI>sign</HI> of <HI>Circum∣cision.</HI>
He who, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 17. <HI>calleth things
which are not as if they were,</HI> can call chil∣dren,
which are, but are not <HI>circumcised,
as if they were</HI> circumcised. And although

<P>An <HI>instance</HI> we have hereof plain and
pregnant to such, who read the place

day that the child died:</HI> That is, <HI>seventh
day à nativitate,</HI> from the birth thereof,
as <HI>Tremelius</HI> expoundeth it; the more
probably because no mention is made of
any <HI>name</HI> imposed upon it. This child,
besides the natural stain of original corru∣ption,
had also the personal blemish of
<HI>adulterous extraction;</HI> And yet how con∣fident
<HI>David</HI> was of the final happinesse
thereof, appears by this expression, <HI>vers.</HI>

Let none strangle the life of so com∣fortable
a passage, with too narrow an
<HI>interpretation</HI> thereof, as if nothing there∣in
were imported more then that <HI>David</HI>
should die as well as his child. This had
been but cold comfort unto him, and
would never have invited him to such
<HI>cheerfulness</HI> of <HI>spirit,</HI> so freely to have re∣freshed
himself: Whose joy was found∣ed
on the comfortable assurance of his

<P>It remaineth that we treat of the <HI>punish∣ment</HI>

<P>These three interpretations do not
crosse but crown one another, being no
contradiction unto, but a gradation one
above another. The <HI>Refuser of Circum∣cision,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
first shall be <HI>cut off</HI> by <HI>excommuni∣cation:</HI>
that not causing his amendment,
shall be <HI>cut off</HI> by the <HI>Magistrate,</HI> and the
pain and shame of <HI>temporal death</HI> not re∣claiming
him, he shall be <HI>cut off</HI> with <HI>Eter∣nal
Damnation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> Here is a heavy <HI>punishment</HI> indeed;
But who is the person, on whom it is to be
inflicted? It was the <HI>Disciples</HI> question to
our <HI>Saviour,</HI> John 9. 2. <HI>Who did sin, this
man or his parents, that he was born blind?</HI>
But here the question will be, <HI>who shall be
punished, this child or his parents?</HI> seeing
betwixt both Circumcision is neglected?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> First negatively, surely not the
child, for it is said, <HI>He hath broken my Co∣venant.</HI>
The <HI>Covenant</HI> may be said to be
broken <HI>on him,</HI> but not <HI>by him,</HI> being pure∣ly
passive therein. Were the child sensible
of the benefit, by the having, dammage
by the loosing thereof, and might it but
borrow a tongue of the standers by, never
was <HI>Rachel</HI> more impatient for <HI>children</HI>
then this child would be importunate for
<HI>Circumcision; Give me Circumcision or else
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
I dye.</HI> Now positively that the Penalty
fals not on the <HI>child,</HI> but on the parent,
plainly appears by Gods proceedings,
<HI>Exod.</HI> 4. 24. When he sought to kill <HI>Moses,</HI>
and not his <HI>children</HI> for being <HI>uncircumci∣sed.</HI>
However if a child left <HI>uncircumci∣sed</HI>
by his Parents neglect, afterwards
arrive at mans estate, and pertinaciously
persist in the contempt of <HI>Circumcision,</HI> he
equally entitleth himself to the fault, and
is also liable to the <HI>punishment</HI> in my text.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> Seeing so sharp and severe the
penalty, how came that suspension of <HI>Cir∣cumcision
full forty years in the wilderness,
Josh.</HI> 5. 7 to be connived at, God not on∣ly
not punishing, but, (for ought appears
in <HI>Scripture</HI>) not so much as reproving the
same?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In the first place I
cannot approve the answer of
S.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">About the end of his first Book on the Galati∣ans, <HI>The∣odoret. 2. Quest. on</HI> Joshua.</NOTE> <HI>Hierom</HI> and others, affirm∣ing
that Circumcision was gi∣ven
to difference and distin∣guish
the Jews from other
Nations; and seeing no Na∣tions
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
were near them during their travel
in the desolate wildernesse, Circumcision
was therefore purposely omitted. For
(beside that sundry people, and particu∣larly
the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> dwelt in the desart)
Circumcision was principally ordained,
(not to be a badge of distinction, but) a
Seal of the consecration of the Jews unto
God. More probable therefore it is,
that because the Jews during that fourty
years were alwayes (though not actually
moving) disposed to move at a minutes
warning, when ever they <HI>received orders</HI>
from the removing of the <HI>Pillar,</HI> God the
Lawgiver dispensed with them to defer
Circumcision, till they were fixed in a set∣led
condition, affording conveniencies
for the curing of that sorenesse, which
otherwise by constant journeying would
be chafed, and inflamed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Circumcision considered as a Seal of
the Gospel Covenant; and what
spiritual Graces were conveyed
and confirmed thereby.</HEAD>
<P>MAny behold Circumcision with a
flighting and neglectful eye; as a
meer legal Ceremony, an outward Type
and shadow; having nothing Evangelical
therein. But on serious Enquiry it will
appear, to have a Gospel ground-work
under a Ceremonial varnish.</P>
<P>The clearing hereof is of great conse∣quence
to our Present Controversie: For
if the Covenant of God made with <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
at <HI>Circumcision</HI> was meerly typical,
then it died at Christs death with the rest
of the Ceremonies; But if it were a Go∣spel
Covenant, then it descendeth at this
day to all the faithful. It is our present
endeavour to evince, this Covenant of <HI>A∣braham</HI>
was Evangelical, eternal, and
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
hereditary to all the Faithful.</P>
<P>For proof hereof take notice that God
never made but two grand and spiritual
<HI>Covenants:</HI> Though the latter hath been
manifested by different degrees, and di∣spensations
thereof.</P>

<ITEM>1. Made with <HI>Adam</HI>

</LIST>
<P>This second, or New Covenant is the
sole subject of our present discourse, which
God made first with <HI>Adam</HI> without a seal,
and now renewed it with <HI>Abraham,</HI> with
a seal, when the sign of Circumcision was
affixed thereunto.</P>
<P>Here we must be cautious not to mi∣stake
the several declarations of this New
Covenant to sundry person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to be so ma∣ny
new distinct Covenants. For, after∣wards
the same was repeated to <HI>Isaac, Ja∣cob,
Moses,</HI> the whole body of the Jews at
mount <HI>Sinai, Joshua, (I wil never leave thee,
nor forsake thee,</HI> a promise applied by
the Apostle, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 5. to all Christians)
<HI>David,</HI> and others. Yea, scarce any of
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
the Prophets wherein this new Covenant
is not reinforced. Now, suppose a man
causeth his will (formerly roughly drawn
up in paper) to be afterwards ingrossed
in parchment, then fairly to be transcri∣bed
in vellome, afterwards to be several∣ly
written in Roman, Secretary, Court,
and Text-hands, so long as the same and
no other <HI>legacies,</HI> are on the same termes
bequeathed to the same, and no other
<HI>legatees,</HI> all will acknowledge these no
distinct Wils, but the same in substance,
and effect. As here the same new Cove∣nant,
at sundrie times, and in divers
places was made to the Fathers, by the
Prophets, and at last most plainly by
Christ himself.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. If this were a new, or Go∣spel
Covenant made with <HI>Abraham</HI> at
Circumcision, then was there a third, and
newer then this made afterwards to the
Jews. For, so saith the Prophet, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.
31. <HI>Behold the days come saith the Lord,
that I will make a new Covenant with the
house of</HI> Israel, <HI>and with the house of</HI> Ju∣dah.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="21"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> Nothing more usual, and ob∣vious
in Scripture then to call that new,
which is renewed; especially if what was
but dark and obscure before, hath the old
impression set forth in a new and fairer
edition thereof, <HI>John</HI> 13. 34. <HI>A new com∣mandment
I give unto you, that ye love one
another;</HI> and yet this <HI>new commandment</HI>
was from the beginning, <HI>John</HI> 2. 5. though
lately almost antiquated, and obliterated
by mans vindicativeness Christ <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.
20. consecrated for us <HI>a new and living
way,</HI> yet is it the same with the Prophets
<HI>old path, Jer.</HI> 6. 16. traced with the feet
of <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> and thorow which
alone all the Patriarchs made their passage
into heaven, yet termed <HI>a new way</HI> (as a
new Covenant) because after Christs
coming, more cleared, explained, and en∣larged
then before.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. It is improbable that this
covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> at Circumcision,
should be, a <HI>Grace-Gospel-new-Covenant,</HI>
because God four hundred years after,
(namely <HI>Exod.</HI> 20. at Mount <HI>Sinai</HI>) gave
the <HI>Law,</HI> or <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> to the
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
Jews the children of <HI>Abraham.</HI> Now
Gods mercy observeth a progressive mo∣tion,
it doth, not (with the Sun on <HI>Ahaz</HI> his
<HI>Dial</HI>) go backwards; but with the master
of the feast, <HI>John</HI> 2. 10. <HI>He keepeth the best
wine unto the last:</HI> They therefore in a
manner <HI>degrade</HI> Gods goodnesse, set it re∣trograde,
who make his covenant with
<HI>Abraham</HI> a new-covenant of Grace, when
He gave an old covenant of Works so ma∣ny
years after it.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> They are much mistaken who
account the Law given to the Jews, a meer
<HI>Covenant of works,</HI> though indeed there
was very much of <HI>workish-ness</HI> mingled
therewith. The <HI>face</HI> of the <HI>new covenant</HI>
at the giving of the <HI>Law,</HI> is <HI>dressed,</HI> I con∣fesse,
in old <HI>clothes;</HI> many <HI>old forms</HI> are
used therein, alluding to the covenant of
Works made with <HI>Adam.</HI> Yea, the er∣roneous
Jews (partly through their own
Ignorance, partly thorow their Rabbins,
and Pharisees false glosses thereon) mi∣stook
it for a direct, down-right covenant
of works, resting in the <HI>Rinde,</HI> or outward
<HI>Bark</HI> thereof, and depending on the per∣formance
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
of it for their Salvation.</P>
<P>But let not this Covenant be denomi∣nated
for the most, but the best part there∣of,
let it be expounded, (not as the blind
Jews misinterpreted it, but) as God
graciously intended, and the good Patri∣archs
and Prophets wisely accepted it, for
a <HI>covenant of grace,</HI> wherein Messiah
(though obscurely) was tendered to such,
who could not perform what the rigour
of the Law required. There is one
word in the second Commandment, which
demonstrateth this <HI>Law,</HI> to have <HI>Go∣spel</HI>
in the bowels thereof, namely the
word Mercy, <HI>Exod</HI> 20. 6. <HI>shewing Mercy un∣to
thousands of them that love me and keep
my commandments.</HI> Now Mercy is a <HI>Shi∣boleth</HI>
which a covenant of works can ne∣ver
pronounce, as utterly destructive to
the very nature thereof, and <HI>keeping com∣mandments</HI>
there must be taken, for such
as desire and endeavour to <HI>keep them,</HI>
though falling short of legal exactnesse</P>
<P>But we leave the farther prosecution
of this point to those learned Divines, who
have written just Treatises thereof; con∣ceiving
it more proper for our present
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
purpose, to prove this covenant with <HI>A∣braham</HI>
a new-Gospel-covenant; and
the serious perusal of one verse, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7.
will afford us three arguments for the e∣vincing
thereof.</P>
<P>And I will establish my covenant be∣tween
me and thee, and thy seed after
thee, in their generations, for an ever∣lasting
covenant, to be a God unto thee,
and to thy seed after thee.</P>
<P>Hence we collect it a Gospel-Cove∣nant.</P>
<P>From
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The language, and ex∣pression of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The continuance, and
duration of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The blessings, and benefits con∣veyed
by it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>For the language, and expression, <HI>the
voice is the voice of</HI> Jacob. <HI>The speech agreeth
thereunto</HI> (not to betray it as it did <HI>Peter</HI>
to his shame, and sorrow, but) to disco∣ver
this covenant to its honour, and our
comfort, to be an Evangelical Covenant.
That very phrase, <HI>to be a God unto thee,</HI> is
a Gospel-phrase. Otherwise, how com∣eth
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
he, who upon the breach of the cove∣nant
of works, was left our enemy, our
inraged judge, to be a God unto us? I see
here <HI>Matthew</HI> in <HI>Moses,</HI> the New couched
in the Old Testament. Parallel is the ex∣pression,
<HI>Mat.</HI> 1. 23. <HI>And they shall call his
name</HI> Emanuel, <HI>which (being interpreted)
is God with us. God with us, and to be a
God unto us,</HI> differ something in sound,
nothing in sence.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>for the continuance and dura∣tion
of it.</HI> An <HI>Everlasting Covenant,</HI> that
with <HI>Adam</HI> was but a <HI>short-lasting cove∣nant.</HI>
Some conceive <HI>Adam</HI> never <HI>naturally</HI>
slept in his Innocency, (accounting that
<HI>caused deep sleep, Gen.</HI> 2. 21. before <HI>Eve</HI>
her creation, supernatural) but forfeited
his Innocency before night. As there be
some kind of <HI>insects,</HI> (called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>)
which, Naturalists say, survive but a day;
so some conceive <HI>Adams</HI> integrity of no
longer duration And, though we dare
not certainly close with their opinion (the
Scripture not acquainting us with the date
of <HI>Adams</HI> perseverance in paradise) we
may be confident, that covenant of works
was of no long continuance before it was
broken.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23"/>
This short-liv'd covenant thus expi∣red,
it was never reviv'd again on the same
conditions, but utterly extinguished. Yea,
herein God magnified his mercy, that up∣on
any termes he would treat with man∣kind,
whom he might have condemned as
incapable of any future contract, for once
breaking of Covenant. Yet now he draw∣eth
up a second agreement with them,
being a <HI>covenant</HI> of <HI>grace,</HI> and that <HI>everlast∣ing;</HI>
such his goodnesse, that, though we
(if strictly examined) break it with him,
he will not break it with us. I confesse
<HI>everlasting</HI> in Scripture is sometimes taken
for <HI>long-lasting</HI> (in which sense the Hebrew
tongue accepteth of an <HI>ever</HI> after an <HI>ever</HI>)
but here it is taken truly for eternity, see∣ing,
<HI>whom God loveth he loveth to the end,</HI>
without end.</P>
<P>The third argument to prove the evan∣gelical
nature of Gods covenant with <HI>A∣braham,</HI>
is drawn from the blessings, and
benefits conveyed thereby; whose size
and measure is so great, they are only of
a Gospel proportion, <HI>to be a God unto thee.</HI>
Could lesse be said then this, so short the
words? yet could more be said then this,
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
so large the matter? All things herein are
comprized, a promise to give repentance,
faith, hope, and charity; patience in af∣flictions,
preservation from, or in them,
competency of outward maintenance, per∣severance
unto the end; in a word, grace,
and holinesse here, glory and happinesse
hereafter. How tedious are the instru∣ments
of our age (a span of ground being
scarcely passed under a span of parchment)
in comparison of the concise Grants of our
ancient Kings, some of whose Charters
contain not so many words, as they con∣vey
Manours therein. Yet even those
Patents are prolix, if compared with
Gods Covenant in my text, <HI>to be a God
unto thee,</HI> promising therein more, then
what man can ask, or desire. God hath
set us a pattern, <HI>therefore let thy words be
few,</HI> Eccles. 5. 2. not to be <HI>babling</HI> to him,
in our <HI>prayers,</HI> seeing he is so plain, and
pithy to us in his <HI>promises,</HI> couching all
things in so short an expression.</P>
<P>To put all out of doubt, this Cove∣nant
of Circcumcision made with <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
and his seed, appears to be a Gospel
Covenant, because S <HI>Paul</HI> so expoundeth
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
it. If any scruple arise about the sence of
a Law, to whom should people repair for
satisfaction, but to the makers thereof, if a∣live.
Thus on the emergency of doubts, a∣bout
the nature of this Covenant, we may
and must have recourse unto the Author
thereof. Now the same spirit, who in∣dited
<HI>Genesis</HI> by <HI>Moses,</HI> indited the Epistle
to the <HI>Romans</HI> by S. <HI>Paul,</HI> who plainly af∣firmeth,
<HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 11. that <HI>Abraham recei∣ved
the sign of Circumcision, the seal of righ∣teousness
by faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> It is strange to conceive how
in that age there could be a Covenant of
faith, the word faith appearing proper∣ly
but once, <HI>Habac.</HI> 2. 4. in all the old
Testament, (and once afterwards with
a negation before it in reference to the
Jews) <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. 20. <HI>Children, in whom is
no faith:</HI> Seeing therefore such silence of
<HI>faith</HI> in the Old Testament, (so frequently
resounded in the New) this Covenant
with <HI>Abraham</HI> seemeth suspicious, to be
an old Covenant of Works, and to have
nothing of Gospel therein.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> The <HI>word Faith</HI> only, not the
<HI>thing</HI> signified thereby is wanting in the
old Testament. What Christ and his A∣postles
call <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>believing,</HI> that the
Prophets and pen-men of the old Testa∣ment
expresse by <HI>Trusting.</HI> The Religi∣on
and Creed of the Ancient Patriarchs is
briefly drawn up by <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 22. 4.
<HI>Our Fathers trusted in thee, they trusted and
thou didst deliver them; they cried unto thee,
and were delivered, they trusted in thee and
were not confounded.</HI> I will not say the
Triplication of the word <HI>Trust,</HI> denotes
their belief in the Trinity, Father, Son,
and holy Spirit; but here it plainly ap∣pears,
they had their confidence in, and
dependence on God; (though then not
so clearly revealed unto them) which
sheweth the sameness in substance of their
belief with ours.</P>
<P><HI>Ʋse.</HI> This serveth to confute such
who account the Jews a meer husk, shell,
and shadow of Gods people; as if all the
promises made unto them, meerly termi∣nated
in temporal happinesses. Thus they
feed the Jews bodies with <HI>milk,</HI> and fill
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
their bellies with <HI>hony</HI> (even to a surfeit)
flowing from the fruitfulnesse of the land
of <HI>Canaan;</HI> whilest in the mean time they
starve and famish their souls, excluding
them as incapable of heavenly, and spiri∣tual
blessings.</P>
<P>Their uncharitable errour is ground∣ed
on this argument; because when their
blessings are reckoned up, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. 3. it
extendeth only to the <HI>city, field, fruit of
their bodie, ground, cattle, kine, sheep, &amp;c.</HI>
but no mention of their eternal beatitude
hereafter in heaven. Yea, when <HI>Isaac</HI>
cordially blessed <HI>Jacob,</HI> desiring no doubt
to make the same as compleat, as he could
bestow, and <HI>Jacob</HI> receive, his expressions,
<HI>Gen.</HI> 27. 28. amount no higher then to <HI>the
dew of heaven, the fatness of the earth, and
plenty of corn and wine.</HI> On the other side,
when the Jews curses are solemnly pro∣nounced,
<HI>Deut.</HI> 28. 16. they are confined
to <HI>city, field, basket store, fruit of the body,
land, kine, sheep, &amp;c.</HI> Here a deep silence
of hell, and damnation, so that the smiles
or frowns of God to the Jews, seem to
reach no farther then to their well or ill
being in this life.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="26"/>
To this it is answered, first in general;
by the same argument one may conclude,
that under the Gospel no temporal, or
outward happinesse is promised to those
that fear, and serve God,; because no <HI>ex∣presses</HI>
thereof (descending to the like par∣ticularities
as in <HI>the old</HI>) are found in all
the <HI>new Testament.</HI> I meet but with one
in that nature (tendering an exact <HI>Inven∣tory</HI>
of earthly wealth) namely, <HI>Mark</HI> 10.
30. And the same hath bitternesse as well
as sweetnesse therein; save that the close
thereof maketh recompence for all the
rest. <HI>But he shal receive an hundred fold now
in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters
and mothers, and children, and lands with
persecution, and in the world to come eternal
life.</HI></P>
<P>To come closer to their argument.
Though generally temporal blessings are
only expressed in the Old Testament, yet
in and under them, is spiritual happinesse
contained. Thus when in the fifth com∣mandment,
<HI>long life in the land which God
shall give them,</HI> is promised to dutiful
children, eternity in heaven is included;
and so did the judicious amongst the Jews
<PB N="29" REF="26"/>
alwayes accept, and expound the same.</P>
<P>Most true therefore is S. <HI>Pauls</HI> positi∣on,
1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 8. <HI>Godliness hath the promise
of the life that now is, and of that which is to
come.</HI> But where hath it the promise of
this life? Chiefly in the old Testament,
where temporal good is largely, and clear∣ly;
spiritual, briefly, and dimly pro∣pounded.
Where hath it the promise of
the life to come? Principally in the new
Testament, where spiritual blessings are
fairly and fully; temporal, shortly, and
slenderly presented. Stock thy self with
the one out of the Law, with the other
out of the Gospel, with both out of the

<P>So much for the Covenant made as
inherent in <HI>Abrahams</HI> person; come we
now to consider it as hereditary, and de∣scending
on his posterity. I could name
the Castle, and rich Manour in <HI>England,</HI>
which was setled by Patent from Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> on one of her Courtiers. But,
when the Grant came to be examined un∣der
King <HI>James,</HI> those operative words,
<HI>to him and his heirs,</HI> were found omitted
in that emphatical place of the Patent,
<PB N="30" REF="27"/>
where the estate therein should have been
effectually conveyed. Whereupon the
Grant was interpreted meerly personal,
and forfeited to the Crown on the attain∣ture
of the foresaid Courtier.</P>
<P>God maketh sure work in his Cove∣nant
of Circumcision. To prevent all
miscarriages, and to intail the same on
<HI>Abrahams</HI> posterity, how often doth he
insert, and repeat <HI>him and his seed,</HI> Gen.
17? twice in the 7<SUP>th</SUP> verse, once in the 9<SUP>th</SUP>
verse, once in the 10<SUP>th</SUP> verse, again, in the
12<SUP>th</SUP> verse, <HI>and thy seed after thee.</HI> If in
after-ages a wicked son chance to descend
from-<HI>Abraham,</HI> and the same prove a spi∣ritual
unthrift, yet God hath put it past
his power to alienate the spiritual inheri∣tance
of the Covenant from his children,
they shall not suffer for their fathers de∣fault;
the same being made over to <HI>Abra∣ham
and his seed;</HI> and now we come to
show what persons are included within
the compasse of that relation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the several Acceptations of the
Seed of Abraham in Scripture.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THe seed of Abraham</HI> as it occurs often
in Scripture, so severall are the sences
thereof, and all of them worthy of our
especial notice: But before and above all
other Acceptions, know first it is taken
eminently and transcendently for Jesus
Christ, in whom all Nations should be
blessed.</P>
<P>Even this seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> was Cir∣cumcised,
<HI>Luke</HI> 2. 21. Meerly out of con∣formity,
that Christ might shew himself
<HI>born under the Law,</HI> as sent not to <HI>destroy,</HI>
but <HI>fulfil it.</HI> Indeed those few drops of
bloud, presumed shed by our Saviour at
his Circumcision, might both in their
own Preciousnesse, and Gods Apprecia∣tion
of them, have been satisfactory for
the sins of al mankind. But a <HI>Testament</HI> was
intended, by Divine Providence; and
that could not be made without the Te∣statours
<PB N="32" REF="28"/>
Death, and therefore the very
heart Bloud of Christ, on the Crosse, was
adjudged necessary for mans salvation.</P>
<P>So much for <HI>Abrahams</HI> extraordinary,
come we to his ordinary seed. This ei∣ther
was <HI>immediately,</HI> or <HI>mediately</HI> begot∣ten
by him. We find eight sons of the
first sort, namely, <HI>Ismael</HI> begotten of <HI>Ha∣gar,
Isaac</HI> of <HI>Sarah,</HI> and six more, (see
their names, <HI>Gen.</HI> 25. 2.) of <HI>Keturah.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> How cometh it then to passe
that the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> Gal. 4. 22. saith,
<HI>Abraham</HI> had two sons, the one by a <HI>Bond-maid,</HI>
the other by a <HI>Free-woman,</HI> omitting
all the rest, as if no such persons in Na∣ture.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> These two are mentioned <HI>emi∣nently,</HI>
but not <HI>exclusively</HI> of others. I
will not say, because <HI>Keturah</HI> (though
sometimes called the wife) is elsewhere,
1 <HI>Chro.</HI> 1. 32. stiled but <HI>Abrahams concubine;</HI>
therefore his <HI>Issue</HI> by her is left out by the
<HI>Apostle;</HI> but because (though there was
<HI>History</HI> of more, yet) there was <HI>Mysterie</HI>
but in these two sons of <HI>Abraham,</HI> whose
<PB N="33" REF="28"/>
two Mothers represented the two Testa∣ments.
Had <HI>Abraham</HI> afterwards begot∣ten
an hundred sons, they <HI>all</HI> had not a∣mounted
to the making of <HI>one Testament,</HI>
(but were all reducible to one of the for∣mer
Testaments, compleated in <HI>Ismael,</HI>
and <HI>Isaac.</HI>)</P>
<P>As for <HI>Ismael,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In his Cō∣ment on Ge∣nesis, chap. 17.</NOTE> <HI>Luther</HI> is
peremptory and positive, that,
(though the type of a carnal
people) yet, in truth, his own
person was saved; grounding
his charitable opinion on that expression,
because it is said of him, <HI>Gen.</HI> 25. 17. After
death that <HI>he was gathered to his Fathers.</HI>
A phrase in the same chapter spoken of
<HI>Abraham,</HI> and not applied in Scripture
to wicked men; though it is said of <HI>Ahab,</HI>
2 <HI>Kings</HI> 22. 40. (which amounts to the same
effect) that he <HI>slept with his Fathers.</HI> I will
interpose nothing to the contrary, but had
been more confident of <HI>Ismaels</HI> final hap∣pinesse,
had it been said of him that he
was <HI>gathered to his father Abrahams</HI> bo∣some
being a noted place, <HI>Luke</HI> 12. for
blessed repose.</P>
<P><HI>Abrahams</HI> immediate seed were either
<PB N="34" REF="29"/>
such as were begotten, by him,</P>
<P>1. In his life, or</P>
<P>2. After his death.</P>
<P>Of the former were <HI>Esau,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI>
both of them, being 15. years old, whilest
<HI>Abraham</HI> was yet surviving, as may be de∣monstrated
by the following Computa∣tion.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Abraham</HI> was an <HI>hundred</HI> years <HI>old</HI>
when <HI>Isaac</HI> was <HI>born,</HI> Gen. 21. 5.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Isaac</HI> was <HI>fourty</HI> years old, when
he took <HI>Rebeccah</HI> to <HI>wife,</HI> Gen. 25. 20.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Isaac</HI> was <HI>threescore</HI> years old, when
<HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> were born, <HI>Gen.</HI> 25. 26.</P>
<P>4. All which years cast up together,
amount to an hundred and threescore
years.</P>
<P>5. <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he died, was
an hundred threescore and fifteen years
old;</P>
<P>6. Ergo, <HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> were fifteen
years old before <HI>Abrahams</HI> death; an Age
capable of Instruction. Therefore when
God saith of <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 18. 19. <HI>I know
that he will command his children,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to
keep the way of the Lord. Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI>
his <HI>Grand-children</HI> were literally intend∣ed:
<PB N="35" REF="29"/>
The latter, no doubt, being as wil∣ling
to learn, as his Grand-father <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
was able and industrious to instruct
him.</P>
<P><HI>Abrahams</HI> seed mediately begotten
from him after his death, were either</P>
<P>1. Literally and spiritually, as the <HI>be∣lieving
Jews.</HI></P>
<P>2. Literally, and not spiritually, as the
<HI>unbelieving Jews,</HI> of whose <HI>foederal
right,</HI> largely in the next chapter.</P>
<P>3. Spiritually, and not literally, as
<HI>Proselytes,</HI> and believing Gentiles.</P>
<P><HI>Proselytes,</HI> or <HI>Advenae,</HI> were <HI>Aliens</HI> by
extraction, and <HI>Jewes</HI> by profession;
and these again were either the <HI>Primi∣tive
Proselytes,</HI> or their successours in all
Ages.</P>
<P>By Primitive Proselytes I understand,
those of <HI>Abrahams</HI> family when <HI>Circum∣cision</HI>
was first instituted therein. These
I may call the <HI>Founders</HI> of that <HI>Order,</HI> and
the first stock wherewith that <HI>Society</HI> be∣gan.</P>
<P>Amongst the <HI>succeeding Proselytes,</HI> we
may take notice of two most memorable
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd conspicuous accessions to their com∣pany.
<PB N="36" REF="30"/>
The one, when <HI>Israel</HI> came out
of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and Gods miraculous hand made
many <HI>Converts</HI> to their Religion; when
besides the <HI>six hundred thousand Israelites,</HI>
and <HI>their children,</HI> Exod. 12. 38. <HI>and a mix∣ed
multitude,</HI> went up also with them, and
although this mixed multitude, Numb. 11.
4. <HI>afterwards fell a lusting,</HI> infecting also the
<HI>Israelites</HI> therewith; and probably many
of them then perished; yet certainly a com∣petent
Representation of Pious proselytes
stil continued in the congregation of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>The other remarkable Addition of
Proselytes was <HI>Joshua</HI> 9. 27. When the
<HI>Gibeonites</HI> were condemned by <HI>Joshua</HI> to
the servile work of the <HI>Temple, hewing of
wood,</HI> and <HI>drawing of water;</HI> Whereby no
doubt, thousands of them got the know∣ledge
of the true God; and were there∣fore
called <HI>Nethinims,</HI> people given over
to <HI>divine service.</HI> Yea, what an estimate
God set upon them, plainly appears, by
his careful counting them, after their Re∣turn
from the <HI>Captivity</HI> of <HI>Babylon,</HI> Ezra
2. 43. (with the children of <HI>Solomons ser∣vants</HI>)
in all <HI>three hundred ninety two.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these two grand and conspicu∣ous
<PB N="37" REF="30"/>
Additions of <HI>Proselytes,</HI> there was
scarce any Country confining on <HI>Canaan,</HI>
(as some, a good way distanced thence)
but now and then did drop in a <HI>Proselyte</HI>
into the congregation of <HI>Israel; Rahab,</HI>
the <HI>Hittite, Ruth,</HI> the <HI>Moabite, Naaman,</HI> the
<HI>Assyrian,</HI> &amp;c. And, (to show God stands
as little on the difference of <HI>colours</HI> as <HI>Coun∣tries)
Ebed-Melech</HI> the <HI>Black-more,</HI> the
<HI>Treasurer</HI> of the Queen <HI>Candace</HI> the <HI>Ethio∣pian.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed these Proselytes amongst the
Jews, were divided into two sorts; some
<HI>Proselytes of the gates,</HI> admitted only into
civil society, and cohabitation with them:
others call'd <HI>Proselytes of Justice,</HI> who did
professe, and undertake all the Law, and
these only we account the <HI>seed of Abra∣ham.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, believing Christians are the
spiritual seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and are so
generally reputed in the Scripture.
These to be true born on both sides, must
have,</P>
<P>1. <HI>Abraham</HI> to their Father.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Sarah</HI> to their Mother.</P>
<P>When we see a child like unto his fa∣ther
<PB N="38" REF="31"/>
we use to say of him, <HI>Thy father will
never be dead whilest thou art alive:</HI> so
<HI>Abraham</HI> surviveth, and <HI>Sarah</HI> is still alive
in those, which <HI>John</HI> 8. 39. <HI>do the works of
Abraham.</HI> What these <HI>works</HI> are, must
be collected out of <HI>Abrahams</HI> life, who
was, faithful to God, loving to his wife,
tender to his children, equal to his ser∣vants,
kind to his nephew, courteous to
his neighbours the children of <HI>Heth,</HI> just in
his bargains, valiant to his enemies; in a
word, worthy in all his relations. <HI>Sarah</HI>
likewise is exemplary for her duty to her
husband and other feminine vertues, and
all those are <HI>her daughters,</HI> 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 3. 6.
which imitate the same.</P>
<P>I need not be longer in so plain and preg∣nant
a point; that believing Gentiles are
Spiritually <HI>Abrahams Seed,</HI> so frequently
inculcated by the Apostle in his Epistles to
the Romans and Galatians, who were as
meer Gentiles as we English-men are.
Come we now to show, how far the Seed
of <HI>Abraham</HI> Naturally, though not Spiri∣tually,
participate of the covenant in Cir∣cumcision,
conceiving the clearing there∣of,
of concernment to our present contro∣versie.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. That all visible Members of the Jew∣ish
Church had a foederal Right to
the Sacraments.</HEAD>
<P>WE must carefully dinstiguish be∣twixt
the <HI>reaping of spiritual Bene∣fit
by,</HI> and the <HI>having of a temporal Right to</HI>
the Sacraments. It is confessed that the for∣mer
belong'd wholly and solely to the
true <HI>Israel</HI> of God; but in the latter the
worst and wickedest Jew equally shared
with the best and holiest of that Nation,
as all alike corporally descended from <HI>A∣braham.</HI></P>
<P>For the proof whereof, in the first
place it is worth the observing, how our
Saviour in the same chapter, and dis∣course,
namely <HI>John</HI> the 8<SUP>th</SUP>▪ affirmeth and
denieth the wicked Pharisees to be, and
not to be the Seed of <HI>Abraham.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="32"/>To be, verse 37.</P>
<Q>I know that you are Abrahams seed, but
you seek to kill me, because my word hath no
place in you.</Q>
<P>Not to be, verse 44.</P>
<Q>Ye are of the Devil, and the lusts of your
father you will do.</Q>
<P>Here is no contradiction, but a consent,
if the several respects be considered: By
Pedegree they were; by Practice they
were not; by Linage they were; by life,
they were not; by extraction they were,
by conversation they were not the chil∣dren
of <HI>Abraham.</HI></P>
<P>Now to look only on the Jews in the
first capacity, <HI>who are Israelites according
to the flesh;</HI> we find S. <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. 9. 4.
giving in an Inventory of their Priviledges
which amount to eight particulars; and
it were high injustice in any Christian to
deny the least branch thereof. Theirs
were<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The adoption.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Glory.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Covenants.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The giving of the Law.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The service of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The promises.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The fathers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Christ conceiv'd in the flesh.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="32"/>
Herein the Apostle intendeth not onely
the elect Jewes, but the diffusive body
of that Nation. Yea, in this present point,
with heavinesse of heart, he sadly singleth
out such Apostate Jewes, for whom verse
3. he desired in exchange to be accursed,
and yet even to those did this survey of
priviledges belong.</P>
<P>This is farther cleared by the acknow∣ledgement
of the same Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.
2, 3, 4. affirming that all the Fathers were
<HI>baptized into Moses, all ate and drank of
the same spiritual meat, and drink,</HI> yet
adding afterward, that <HI>with many of them
God was not well pleased.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, it is evidenced by those frequent
phrases in Scripture, wherein the disobe∣dient
Jewes are threatned to be <HI>cut off
from his people,</HI> and <HI>from Gods presence.
Levit.</HI> 22. 3. Such could not be <HI>cut off</HI>
from spirituall holinesse, or happinesse,
wherein they were never truly planted,
and whereof never really possessed, but
onely from being outward members of
that Church, which intitled them to a
true right of the aforementioned prero∣gatives.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="33"/>
Indeed one reason, which makes many
men loth to entertain this truth, to allow a
foederall right to the worst of the Jewes,
is a suspition, that the holding hereof will
betray them to the dangerous opinion of
<HI>falling off from grace,</HI> if that such who
once were actually estated in such a Co∣venant-right,
should afterwards make a
finall defection from the same. Now, as
I cannot blame them to be <HI>jealous with
a godly jealousie,</HI> and to decline what is
introductory of so comfortless an errour,
as maintaining the <HI>apostasie of Saints:</HI> so
I must condemn their over caution here∣in,
<HI>to fear where no fear is.</HI> For, this foe∣derall
right which the wicked Jewes had,
never stamped upon them any character
of saving grace, but was onely a <HI>right
of capacity,</HI> putting them into an actuall
possession of the means, and a possibili∣ty
of salvation it self, if not frustrated
thereof by their own wilfull default.</P>
<P>Suppose now there should happen a
Contest betwixt the worst of Jewes, and
the best of Heathens, about their spiritu∣all
condition, should the Pagan bee so
presumptuous as to affirm himself equal∣ly
<PB N="43" REF="33"/>
advantaged to a capability of happi∣nesse
with the Jew, the other might just∣ly
confute his impudent bragging therein,
alledging that his extraction intailed on
him, a right to Circumcision, with the
Covenant therein, and all the promises
thereto belonging.</P>
<P>All will allow a reall difference be∣twixt
an Usurper, and a Tyrant (though
both be bad) the former, invading what
is none of his own, the latter abusing
what is truely his. Now, should a Pagan,
<HI>quà Pagan,</HI> pretend to the Covenant of
Circumcision, he were guilty of notori∣ous
usurpation; whereas the wicked Jew
too often tyrannically abused that Ordi∣nance,
having a right unto it, but making
no right use of it. And, although some
civil Pagans did outstrip many impious
Jewes in Morall performances, the Jews
might thank their own lazinesse, falling
so far short of the <HI>Mark,</HI> having such
advantage at the <HI>starting,</HI> as a true right,
and title to all Gods Ordinances.</P>
<P>This <HI>foederall right</HI> therefore must not
be denied to the worst of men, within the
Pale of the <HI>Church,</HI> lest the godly receive
<PB N="44" REF="34"/>
prejudice thereby. The Story is suffici∣ently
known of a landed <HI>Innocent,</HI> whose
<HI>Estate</HI> some Courtier begged, on pretence
that he was unable to mannage the same.
The Innocent being brought for triall into
the Princes presence, &amp; questioned about
his ability, returned this answer; <HI>My fa∣ther
being a wise man, begat me who am a
fool, and why may not I who am a fool, beget a
sonne, who may prove a wise man?</HI></P>
<P>To apply this story: Many now adayes
seek to disinherit wicked men of their
Covenant-right in the Church, alledging
their prophanesse to be such, as doth dis∣franchise
them of those Priviledges. May
not such wicked men, (<HI>fools</HI> in <HI>Solomons</HI>
phrase) plead for themselves; My father
being a <HI>Saint</HI> begat me a wicked wretch,
and why may not I beget a <HI>sonne</HI> that may
prove a <HI>saint?</HI></P>
<P>See we this in <HI>Ahaaz,</HI> the posture of
whose generation was such, that he was
fixed in the middle betwixt <HI>Jotham</HI> his
godly <HI>father,</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah</HI> his gracious
<HI>sonne;</HI> hee himselfe being the worst of
men, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2. Who in the time of
<HI>his distresse did trespasse yet more and more
<PB N="45" REF="34"/>
against the Lord,</HI> mending for afflictions
as a Resty-horse with beating, onely the
more untoward for the same. Yet this
<HI>Ahaaz</HI> by his <HI>foederall-right,</HI> served to re∣ceive
a true title to <HI>Circumcision</HI> from <HI>Jo∣tham</HI>
his <HI>father,</HI> and to reach the same
to <HI>Hezekiah</HI> his <HI>sonne;</HI> though enjoying
in himself no spirituall benefit thereby.</P>
<P>And thus having concluded the whole
Body of the Jewish Nation, comprehen∣ded
within the compasse of the Cove∣nant
of Circumcision, I proceed to shew
how the Jewish children at eight dayes
old, were capable to covenant: A Point
having more verity, then evidence
therein.</P>

<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="46" REF="35"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. The Grand Objection answered,
drawn from the Incapacity of
Jewish Infants to Covenant at
eight dayes old.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Goliath-Objection,</HI> generally
brought against the Jewish chil∣dren
bing Covenanters, is taken
from their seeming inability to perform
the <HI>stipulation,</HI> or <HI>counterpart</HI> of a <HI>Cove∣nant.</HI>
Is not a childe called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Greek,
from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>not a word</HI> in his mouth, and
<HI>Infants</HI> in the same sence from a negative
<HI>in</HI> and <HI>fando speaking?</HI> Yea, so much as
a childe can speak, and so much as may
be conjectured by his outward carriage,
he maketh use of his <HI>negative voyce,</HI> and
remonstrates against the Covenant, as un∣willing
to receive the same, seeing every
Infant may probably be presumed to cry
as forced from him by the pain of Cir∣cumcision.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="35"/>
In answer hereunto, first in generall;
It is enough to satisfie a sober soul, and
content a modest minde herein, that God
hath appointed such children at eight
dayes old to be Covenanters, and that al∣so
<HI>nomine poenae</HI> in case the same be omit∣ted.
That God, who never calls any to
any employment, but ever inables them
for the same, at leastwise with such a de∣gree
of sufficiencie which he is pleased to
accept. Such as question the truth hereof,
do tacitly, and interpretatively, charge
God with want of wisdome in his pro∣ceedings.
Let them whisper no longer,
but plainly speak out, that He lacks dis∣cretion
to manage his matters, <HI>Isai.</HI> 40. 13.
<HI>Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord,
or being his counseller, hath taught him?</HI>
The proud objecters might well give him
their advise, hereafter to choose wiser
parties with whom to make a Covenant,
then children of eight dayes old.</P>
<P>What Charter hath this whole World
to shew for its being, other then Gods
bare <HI>fiat, Let it be. I have blessed him,</HI>
(saith <HI>Isaac</HI> of <HI>Jacob, Gen.</HI> 27. 33.) <HI>yea, and
bee shall be blessed.</HI> God hath made eight-dayes-old-children
<PB N="48" REF="36"/>
Covenanters, and they
shall be Covenanters.</P>
<P>More particularly, to come to the Ob∣jection:
I conceive the soul of an Infant
may fitly be compared to the cloud which
went before the Israelites, <HI>Exod.</HI> 14. 20.
dark on the one side, but light on the re∣verse
thereof. That part of the Infants
soul exposed to humane eyes, is dark and
obscure, no abilities at all discovera∣ble
therein; whilest the bright side of
Infants souls is objected to Gods eye, be∣holding
in them what wee cannot per∣ceive.</P>
<P>No wonder if men be <HI>non-plust</HI> about
the actions of Infants souls, when every
Infant is an heap of riddles cast together,
whereof the least and lowest is too great,
and high for man to understand. <HI>David</HI>
ingenuously confesseth, <HI>Psal.</HI> 139. 6. that he
was <HI>fearfully and wonderfully made.</HI> The
fashioning of the members of his body
being so strange a work in nature, that
the <HI>knowledge thereof was too wonderfull
for him, and so high that he could not at∣tain
unto it.</HI> If he was posed with the
cask, the case, and the shell, the admira∣ble
<PB N="49" REF="36"/>
structure of a babes body, let it not
seem strange to us to be puzled with the
operations of an Infants soul, how the
same is able to covenant with God.</P>
<P>It passeth the skill of the greatest Di∣vine,
to clear and evidence the entrance
of Originall sinne into an Infants soul:
Whose spirit, coming immediatly from
God, must needs be pure, and perfect
like the maker thereof. Nor can this
soul, thus pure in it self, be infected from
the body, which being but a livelesse lump
of flesh is incapable of sin, especially so
as to make an active impression on the
soul. Soul, and bodie of Infants, thus
being severally sinlesse, who can conceive
that the union of two clean things, can
produce one unclean? I mean, originall
corruption. Yet we all see by wofull ex∣perience,
that Infants from their concepti∣on
are infected therewith: That it is there
we know, but how it came thither, God
knowes.</P>
<P>If we cannot perceive the manner of
sins poison, no wonder if we cannot con∣ceive
the method of graces antidote in
Infants souls. Let us allow heaven to be
<PB N="50" REF="37"/>
as incomprehensibly miraculous in heal∣ing,
as hell hath been insensibly subtile in
hurting the same. And, seeing God hath
expressed thus much, that Infants are cal∣led
by him to be Covenanters, let us with
humility, and modesty beleeve them, to
be enabled with a proportion of grace, to
discharge their covenant in relation,
though it transcend our capacity to clear
all doubts, and difficulties, which may be
multiplied about the manner thereof.</P>
<P>In further clearing this Objection, know,
that besides such graces which wee are
bound to beleeve in Infants hearts, they
have three things else which assist them in
this Covenant.</P>
<P>1. Their Parents faith tendring them
to God.</P>
<P>2. Gods goodnesse accepting the ten∣der.</P>
<P>3. Their own actuall performance of
the Covenant, if living to years of dis∣cretion.</P>
<P>First, their Parents faith in tendering
them. Appliable to this purpose is that
expression recorded by three of the E∣vangelists,
<HI>brought in a bed by four,</HI> who
<PB N="51" REF="37"/>
finding no door in the side (such the presse
of people) made one in the roof of the
house, and let him down by cords into
the room where our Saviour was. <HI>Jesus
seeing their faith,</HI> Matth. 9. 2. <HI>When Jesus
saw their faith,</HI> Mark 2. 5. <HI>And when hee
saw their faith,</HI> Luke 5. 20.</P>
<P>Two things herein are considerable;
first, that the faith of the bearers was
a motive, and inducement to our Saviour
the more speedily with favour to reflect
on this sick man. Secondly that the words
<HI>their faith,</HI> are taken inclusively, taking
in a <HI>fift faith</HI> to the former <HI>four,</HI> namely
the faith of Him, who lay sick on the Bed.
However, here we see that the beheste of
friends, concurred to the expediting of
his <HI>Cure,</HI> and (though let down but by
<HI>four cords</HI>) he was lifted up into Christs
favour with a <HI>five-fold Cable</HI> of faith, <HI>which
cannot be broken.</HI></P>
<P>Nearer is the Relation betwixt Parent
and childe, then friend and friend. When
therefore a pious Father, Mother, or
(best then, when) both, shall with the
armes of their faith, offer an Infant (who
indeed is a part of themselves) to God
<PB N="52" REF="38"/>
in Circumcision, this must needs bee a
main Motive (through Gods mercy, and
no otherwise) to induce Him graciously
to behold the <HI>Present</HI> tendred unto Him.</P>
<P>Thus the faith of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Sarah</HI>
advantageth <HI>Isaac</HI> into Gods love, the
faith of <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Rebeccah</HI> recommen∣ded
and preferred <HI>Jacob</HI> at his Circumci∣sion
into Gods favour.</P>
<P>Secondly, at Circumcision the childes
weaknesse to covenant is assisted by Gods
acceptance thereof. <HI>That is well spoken,
which is well taken.</HI> How simple and slen∣der
soever a childs performance is at Cir∣cumcision,
how low and little soever his
faith is, God stoops (such his gracious
condescension) to take it up; He makes,
(as I may say) a <HI>long arm,</HI> to reach a <HI>short
one,</HI> and so both meet together.</P>
<P>Lastly, this strengtheneth the Covenant
then made by the childe, that afterwards,
if arriving at years of discretion, he pub∣likely
ratifieth, and confirmeth the same
with his own actuall faith, evidenced to
others in his pious conversation. Men
used to say of <HI>Plato</HI> his Scholers, That
<HI>their Masters Precepts, did freez in them,
<PB N="53" REF="38"/>
till they were about fifty yeers old, and then
began to thaw in them, till the day of their
death,</HI> meaning that the good counsels he
gave them made no visible impression on
the amendment of their manners, till the
heat of their youth was overpast, and
they come to their reduced age. Cir∣cumcision,
may be said to freez in Infants,
as to any eminent outward effect thereof,
during their Minority, the vigor and ver∣tue
thereof is <HI>dormant,</HI> and seeming∣ly
<HI>dead</HI> in them, but when come to the
vse of Reason, then it raiseth and rouzeth
it self, namely when the Party <HI>makes good</HI>
the <HI>Covenant, made</HI> by him before, and
then the strength of that Sacrament had
a powerfull influence on their souls all
the dayes of their lives. And although
there ought to be no <HI>iteration</HI> of outward
Circumcision, which done <HI>once,</HI> is done
for <HI>ever,</HI> yet inwardly to circumcise their
souls, was the dayly task of all devout
Jews, and ought to be our constant im∣ployment,
and a word or two briefly of
the nature thereof.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Circumcision considered as a signe,
and what Mysteries were signified
therein.</HEAD>
<P>THe Principal Mysteries couched un∣der
Circumcision, as a signe, are re∣ducible
to seven particulars, 1. That our
carnall corruption may be spared. 2. Can∣not
be cured. 3. Must not be covered.
4. Must be cut off. 5. This cutting off
must be timely. 6. Must be totall. 7. Will
be painfull.</P>
<P>1. <HI>May be spared.</HI> Listen not to the
suggestions of Satan, perswading us, that
sinne, by long custome, is grown so essen∣tiall
to our souls, as if our mindes should
be maimed, and faculties thereof be crip∣led,
should corruption be taken from us;
Wherefore <HI>laying aside</HI> (saith <HI>James</HI> 1. 21.)
<HI>all filthinesse and superfluity of naughtiness,</HI>
not that we may still retain in our hearts
so much wickednesse, as shall fill them,
(onely parting with that which <HI>runneth
<PB N="55" REF="39"/>
over</HI>) but <HI>all</HI> naturall <HI>filthinesse</HI> is <HI>super∣fluity,
it may be spared.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>It cannot be curred.</HI> What is capa∣ble
of Cure, must have some soundnesse
(though more sicknesse) therein; for
Nature distressed, but not wholly de∣stroyed,
is the subject of Art, which must
have a sound bottom, or foundation to
work upon. If therefore there were any
thing good in our naturall corruption,
there were some hopes of amendment in
the rest. But what saith S. <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 7. 18.
<HI>For I know that in me, (that is in my flesh)
dwelleth no good thing. It cannot be cured.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>It must not be covered.</HI> The onely
way to make God hide his face from our
sins, is for us to open, and not to hide our
sins from him.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Must be cut off.</HI> Dream not of cu∣ring
a <HI>gangrean</HI> with a <HI>lenitive plaister.
Hophni</HI> and <HI>Phinehas</HI> are too incorrigible
to be amended with a few fair words.
Say not to thy corruption, as <HI>Eli</HI> to them,
1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. 23. <HI>Why dost thou such things?
Nay my corruption, it is no good report I
hear of thee, &amp;c.</HI> All this is uselesse, no
way but one, cut it off.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="40"/>

as indulgently hope of themselves, that
they have circumcised their souls, and
yet can never remember that they offer∣ed
any violence to their own Nature, ne∣ver
put their selves to any pain in curbing
their corruption, may justly suspect their
spirituall condition. Had ever any a Tooth
drawn, and was insensible thereof? Surely
<PB N="58" REF="41"/>
such Incisions into our souls, with the lan∣cers
of true repentance, leave an indele∣ble
impression behind them, and that pain
too probably, was never at all indured,
which so soon is wholly forgotten. It is
to be feared rather; the pain will prove
insupportable unto us, some counsell
therfore wil be good to mitigate the same.
Surgeons, when forced to cut off a limb,
generally use two wayes to ease their Pa∣tient.
One by casting him into a sleep,
lately disused because dangerous, <HI>sleep</HI> be∣ing
so <HI>immediate a donative</HI> of God him∣self,
(<HI>Psal.</HI> 127. 2. <HI>For so he giveth his be∣loved
sleep</HI>) that humane receipts for the
same, either under, or over-do the work.
The other by stupifying, and mortifying
by degrees the part to be cut off, so to
render the party lesse sensible thereof.
The same way is prescribed us by the A∣postle,
<HI>Col.</HI> 3. 5. <HI>Mortifie therefore your
members which are upon the earth, forni∣cation,
&amp;c.</HI> The torture will be intolera∣ble
to have our souls circumcised, and
corruptions cut from us whilest we are in
the full feeling thereof, and therefore
ought it to be our endeavour by dayly
<PB N="59" REF="41"/>
mortification to dull our sense of the
same.</P>
<P>So much of Circumcision; and now
let us briefly recollect with the Reader,
what progresse we have made in the pre∣sent
controversie; and by what degrees
we have proceeded. First, we have pro∣ved
the Covenant made with <HI>Abraham</HI> at
Circumcision and Evangelical Covenant.
Secondly, that the same descendeth on all
the children of <HI>Abraham.</HI> Thirdly, that
all believing Gentiles are <HI>Abrahams</HI> chil∣dren.
Fourthly, <HI>That eight-dayes-old-Jew∣ish-children</HI>
were accepted of God as capa∣ble
to covenant. Come we now to shew
that Baptism with Christians, is what
Circumcision was to the Jews; whence
this will naturally and necessarily follow,
that Christian children at the same age,
have as much right to the one, as Jewish
infants had to the other.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="60" REF="42"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. That Baptism succeeds to all the Es∣sentials
of Circumcision.</HEAD>
<P>A Successour must be, as after in time,
so really distinct from that, which
precedes it; otherwise it is not the succes∣sour,
but the same. Those, therefore,
who indeavour to disprove Baptism's suc∣cession
to Circumcision, by alledging ma∣ny
differences betwixt them, do our
Work in desiring to destroy it, whilest
the same differences are but accidental be∣twixt
them.</P>
<P>We shall first observe what such acci∣dental
differences are betwixt Circumci∣sion
and Baptism, and they will appear
such as do not dis-essential the one from
the other.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that all the differen∣ces
betwixt <HI>Circumcision</HI> and <HI>Baptism,</HI> are
on the <HI>gaining side</HI> for us Christians, whose
estate is not impaired, but improved
thereby, <HI>Baptism</HI> being milder in the sign,
<PB N="61" REF="42"/>
freer in the time, larger in the subject.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Milder in the sign;</HI> the Law saith,
<HI>cut off, and be clean,</HI> which is Painful; the
Gospel saith, <HI>wash and be clean,</HI> which is
easie. At Baptism no violent Impression is
made on the <HI>Infant,</HI> only a little water
powred on his <HI>Face.</HI> Washing is so far
from doing wrong even to a new born In∣fant,
that his natural wel-being cannot be
without it, Ezek. 16. 4. <HI>When thou wast new
Born, thy navel was not cut, thou wast not
washed in water to soften thee.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Freer in the time; Circumcision</HI> was
confined to the eighth day, and those e∣qually
guilty who anticipated or protract∣ed
the same. God, in the <HI>Gospel</HI> hath left
<HI>Baptism</HI> to the discretion of Christians, to
accelerate or retard it, as they are advised
by the childs strength, and their own con∣veniency:
He hath given Parents as much
liberty herein, as kind <HI>Elkanah</HI> allowed
<HI>Hannah</HI> his loving wife, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1. 23. <HI>Do
what see meth good unto thee.</HI> Presume we
here that pious <HI>Parents</HI> will not create
needlesse delayes to <HI>Baptise their children,
Ne quod differatur, auferatur,</HI> Lest God,
in the <HI>interim,</HI> take their child away from
<PB N="62" REF="43"/>
them. In which case, as I will not be the
<HI>Judge</HI> to condemn the <HI>Child;</HI> so should I
be <HI>one</HI> of the <HI>Jury,</HI> I would not acquit the
Father.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Larger in the subject;</HI> Circumcision
left out, a just half, or full <HI>moiety</HI> of Man∣kinde,
confin'd <HI>only</HI> to the <HI>Males;</HI> where∣as
Baptism takes in the <HI>weaker sex.</HI> Indeed
we have but one <HI>woman, signally</HI> named,
whom we find <HI>baptized;</HI> namely <HI>Lydia,</HI>
Acts 16. 15. the <HI>seller of Purple,</HI> in <HI>Thyatira;</HI>
But the precedents of more: And let the
ensuing parallel in the same Chapter be
observed.</P>
<BIBL>Acts 8. 3.</BIBL>
<Q>Saul made havock, and haling men
and women committed them to pri∣son.</Q>
<BIBL>Acts 8. 12.</BIBL>
<Q>Philip preached concerning the king∣dom
of God, and they were baptized
both men and women.</Q>
<P>See here the weaker sex joyntly par∣take
in persecutions, and (which was but
equal) did also communicate in the com∣forts.
It was just that those, who with
men had drunk their share in the cup of
<PB N="63" REF="43"/>
bitter affliction, should also have their part
in the cup of Sacramental consolation.</P>
<P>Let none be troubled that only two
places expresly mention the baptizing of
Women. For Scripture proofs are not to
be taken by their number, but weighed in
the ballance; One witnesse from an in∣fallible
mouth is as valid as one thousand.
Yea, one testimony of Scripture, coming
from the Spirit which is 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 28. <HI>all in
all,</HI> is as much as if <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and
every verse therein had avouched the
same.</P>
<P>Here let the weaker sex enlarge their
gratitude to God, on this very account,
that he hath cleared their title to this Sa∣crament
in the Gospel; whose right to
Circumcision under the Law was incum∣bred
with some difficulty. For, suppose
a Jewish woman distressed in conscience,
and complaining that she was excluded
the Sacrament of Circumcision, because
not actually signed with it; and, suppose
a Rabbin, or Levite, endeavouring to satis∣fie
her by the answers Chapter 1. for∣merly
alledged, (<HI>viz.</HI> that she was vertu∣ally,
or reductively circumcised in her fa∣ther,
<PB N="64" REF="44"/>
or husband) possibly all this might
not pacifie her minde; and, though such
a scruple be but a <HI>mote</HI> in it self, yet might
it prove painful in so tender a place, as
conscience, the eye of the soul, is How
thankful therefore ought Christian wo∣men
to be to Gods goodnesse, expresly
admitting them to Baptism, and having
equal right with men in that Sacrament.</P>
<P>These three forenamed circumstantial
differences between Circumcision, and
Baptism, are not of such consequence,
as to disessential them, or to make them
distinct Sacraments; both remaining the
same in effect, those accidental variations
notwithstanding.</P>
<P>For the like may be observed between
the Passeover, and the Lords Supper, and
those alterations also for the benefit, and
behoof of Christians, the later being both
cheaper in price, and freer in time then the
former.</P>
<P>In the Passeover, a lamb was offered;
which, many Christians (such is their po∣verty)
cannot provide for themselves;
and rich men (such is their covetousnesse)
will not provide for others. It is there∣fore
<PB N="65" REF="44"/>
commuted in the Lords Supper, into
a bit of bread, and sip of wine, which on
easier rates may be obtained.</P>
<P><HI>Freer in time;</HI> The Passeover was but
once a year, <HI>Exod.</HI> 12. 6. <HI>on the fourteenth
day of the first moneth;</HI> In the Lords Sup∣per
we are left at large, stinted to no time,
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 25. <HI>Do ye this as oft as ye drink it;</HI>
we may take it for food, or for physick;
when ill, to remove; when well, to prevent
diseases; once a moneth, once a week if
we wil; always provided, that the frequent
repetition of it hinder not the solemn
preparation for it. <HI>But to return to Baptism,
that it succee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to all essentials of Circumcisi∣on,
is proved by these Arguments.</HI></P>
<LIST TYPE="syllogism">
<ITEM>Either Baptism succeeds to the Sacrament
of Circumcision, or else some other Or∣dinance
doth succeed, or else nothing at

no such successor to Circumcision can be

may easily be proved: Graces in
Circumcision are comprised in that ex∣pression,
<HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7. <HI>To be a God unto thee,</HI>
whereof largely before; and the same is
performed in Baptism; whein God so∣lemnly
contracts with his servants to re∣ceive
them into his Covenant, and con∣veyeth
unto them Grace necessary for
their Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>But what need we more Reasons, when

<HI>attest the same?</HI> In whom also ye are Cir∣cumcised
with the circumcision made with∣out
hands, in putting off the body of the sins
of the flesh, by the Circumcision of Christ; bu∣ried
with him in Baptism.</P>
<P>Christians are here said by Baptism to be
spiritually Circumcised; and by the same
proportion, the believing Jews may be said
<PB N="68" REF="46"/>
by Circumcision to be spiritually Bapti∣zed;
such the affinity or rather the essen∣tial
samenesse betwixt these two Sacra∣ments:
Thus <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 1. 4.
<HI>One generation passeth away, and another ge∣neration
cometh, but the earth remaineth for
ever:</HI> So one Sacrament of Initiation
[Circumcision] passeth away, and ano∣ther
[Baptism] cometh; One Sacrament
of Confirmation [the Passeover] passeth
away, and another Sacrament [the Lords
Supper] cometh; <HI>But the Church remaineth
for ever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ob.</HI> Baptism cannot succeed to Circumci∣sion,
because what succeedeth must come
after in time, when its predecessor is de∣parted:
But Baptism for some years went
<HI>abreast</HI> with Circumcision, both were set
a foot together in Church practice. For
Baptism was instituted in our Saviours life
time, used by his Disciples, <HI>John</HI> 4. 2. to
the Jews, and enjoyned immediately af∣ter
Christs Ascension, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19. to be
practised upon all Nations: Now Cir∣cumcision
held in force many years after,
see in <HI>Timothy</HI> (a Jew by the half bloud)
<HI>Acts</HI> 16. 3. was Circumcised by <HI>Paul</HI> him∣self.
<PB N="69" REF="46"/>
Wherefore Baptism contemporary
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th Circumcision, could not be successour
unto it.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is confest, that for some years
Circumcision remained in the Church af∣ter
Baptism was ordained. Have we not
often seen the Moon shining in Heaven
even after the Sun some hours hath been
risen therein; But then she shines dully
and dimly, with a faint and feeble light as
conscious to her self of usurpation, and
guilty of intrusion to the territories and
dominion of the Sun; the Moon being
only made <HI>to rule the night.</HI> So may I say
there was a weak and wan appearance of
Circumcision in the Christian Church af∣ter
Baptism was ordained, and that for
these two reasons.</P>
<P>First, It was continued some time in
the Church for the more decent expiring
thereof. God would not have that Sa∣crament,
which had lived so long in lu∣stre,
dye in shame: And therefore it was
thought fit, that Circumcision, as it began
on a good man, so it should expire on
a gratious Saint: <HI>Abraham</HI> being the
first, and <HI>Timothy</HI> the last; whom we
<PB N="70" REF="47"/>
find Circumcised in Scripture.</P>
<P>Secondly, God foreseeing what an
advantage Satan might take, if his Church
were left <HI>Sacramentless,</HI> to assault the same
in the interval of the going out of the one,
and coming in of the other (as <HI>Ahab</HI> was
wounded, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 22. 34. in the naked
place <HI>betwixt the joynts of his harness</HI>)
would have his Sacraments (rather then
they should fall short) one lap, and fold
over the other, that both should be in be∣ing
at once. Probably, had another go∣vernment
of the Church been prepared,
and fitted; yea, and set up (rather two
together then none at all) before the old
one was demolished, profanenesse, and
damnable heresies, which we now behold,
and bemoan, had not made their progress
so fast, and so far into the English Nati∣on.</P>
<P>The result of all is this: Though <HI>Cir∣cumcision</HI>
did for some time rather <HI>languish</HI>
then <HI>live</HI> after the institution of <HI>Baptism;</HI>
and for the Reasons aforesaid, was con∣tinued
in the Church (used on <HI>Timothy</HI> not
so much to sanctifie him, as to satisfie his
<HI>half-Countrey-men</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI>) yet soon af∣ter
<PB N="71" REF="47"/>
it decently expired, leaving Baptism
to succeed in the Church to all the essenti∣als
thereof; amongst which, this was one
of main importance, That as Children
were admitted to Circumcision, so they
should also participate of Baptism; <HI>Which
by reasons out of Scripture,</HI> God willing,
shall plainly appear.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. What it is to reason out of the Scri∣ptures;
and what credit is due to
deductions from Gods word.</HEAD>
<P>WE do freely confesse, that there is
neither expresse Precept nor Pre∣cedent
in the New Testament for the Ba∣ptizing
of Infants; and yet are confident,
by necessary and undeniable consequence
from Scripture it will be made appear
to be founded thereon. Let us here pre∣mise
and explain a practice of the Apostle
<HI>Paul,</HI> as much conducible to our purpose.
<PB N="72" REF="48"/>
He coming to <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> Acts 17. 2.
Reasoned <HI>with the Jews</HI> out of Scripture.</P>
<P>Three things herein are considerable.
First, being to prove, that <HI>this Jesus whom
he preached was Christ,</HI> he neither did nor
could produce a positive text of Scripture,
wherein the same was affirmed <HI>syllabical∣ly,</HI>
or in so many very words.</P>
<P>Secondly, in proof hereof he did
not bring bare reason, which would
be but ineffectual; especially to prove
that which was meerly an article of Faith.</P>
<P>Thirdly, in his <HI>disputing</HI> he made a
wise composure of both, joyning Scri∣pture
and reason together. Scripture was
the <HI>Well,</HI> Reason was the <HI>Bucket,</HI> S. <HI>Paul</HI>
was the <HI>Drawer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pauls</HI> precedent ought to be followed
by our practice herein. <HI>Scriptura non scri∣bitur,
otiosis: The Scripture was not writ for
the idle, but the industrious.</HI> Yea, to what
intent hath God bestowed reason upon
us, improved in some with Learning and
Education, together with the promise of
his Spirit to conduct us into all necessary
truth; but that we should improve the
same in the serious searching of the Scri∣pture?</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="48"/>
One main motive which induced <HI>Co∣lumbus</HI>
to believe the other side of this
Globe to be peopled with reasonable
souls, and invited him to undertake the
discovery thereof, was a firm apprehen∣sion,
and belief, that God would not create
so glorious a creature as the Sun to shine to
Sea and Fishes alone; but that surely some
men did partake of the benefit thereof. Is it
probable that God would light the three∣fold
lamp of reason, learning, and grace in
mens souls, for no other purpose, or high∣er
design, but meerly that men should
make use thereof in perusing of pam∣phlets,
and reading the works of hu∣mane
writers; chiefly in examining the
word of God, with such consequences,
which naturally may be extracted from
the same?</P>
<P>Some things are, in <HI>Scripture,</HI> as grasse
on the ground, which on the surface there∣of,
is apparent to every beholder; other
things are, in <HI>Scripture,</HI> as mines, and mi∣nerals
in the bowels thereof, no lesse the
product of the earth then the former,
though more industry must be used for
the eduction thereof. <HI>Circumcision</HI> is
<PB N="74" REF="49"/>
of the first <HI>sort,</HI> obvious to a childe that
can read the 17<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Genesis;</HI> But
he must be a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 14. 20.</NOTE> <HI>man of understand∣ing,</HI>
(which we all ought to be)
to whom <HI>Baptism</HI> is visible by deduction
from Scripture.</P>
<P>See we here not only the usefulnesse
and conveniency, but even the absolute
necessity of the profession of Ministers;
not only for the administration of Sacra∣ments,
but for the clearing those necessa∣ry
consequences from Scripture, which at
the first view are not apparent to every
ordinary capacity.</P>
<P>S. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 6. <HI>Let us pro∣phesie
according to the proportion of Faith.</HI>
Now I believe it will generally be granted
that by <HI>Prophesie</HI> here is meant the preach∣ing
of the word. Know then that the
<HI>proportion of Faith,</HI> consists not in one, or
some, or many, but is the result of all
places of Scripture; the universal <HI>Symme∣trie</HI>
of them all, concerning such a point
which is treated of. Here then is the of∣fice
of the Minister, to present to his peo∣ple
(in any matter necessary to be belie∣ved
or practised) the <HI>sence</HI> of the Old and
<PB N="75" REF="49"/>
New Testament; This is sometimes
not conspicuous in any one place, as
being the <HI>collective,</HI> and <HI>constructive Analo∣gie,</HI>
amounting from many particular pla∣ces
compared together.</P>
<P>Here, I say, the Ministers office is called
upon; (in whom <HI>Reason</HI> is or ought to be
cleared and strengthned by his learning)
to manifest and evidence to the people of
his flock, the rise and result of such dedu∣ctions,
how naturally and necessarily they
flow from Scripture. This done, such
of his flock, who of themselves could not
see, will see when shown; who of them∣selves
could not go, will go when led; en∣abled
by Gods blessing on his help, will
both easily apprehend in themselves, and
communicate to such in their family, such
<HI>Scipture-consequences,</HI> which their simpli∣city
could never first have found out by
themselves.</P>
<P>Then will it fare with such people as
with the <HI>Samaritanes,</HI> John 4. 42. who
came to <HI>Christ,</HI> at the womans <HI>invitation,</HI>
but <HI>believed</HI> on him, not because of her
saying, <HI>but because they heard him them∣selves.</HI>
Unlearned people receive not such
<PB N="76" REF="50"/>
consequences for truths, on the credit of
the Learning and Religion of their Mini∣ster,
(though by his direction first ac∣quainted
therewith) but because that
since they have been convinced in their
own judgements and consciences of the
truth thereof, as no doubt the <HI>Thessaloni∣ans</HI>
were, when S. <HI>Paul</HI> (as is aforesaid)
<HI>reasoned with</HI> them <HI>out of Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>But a greater then <HI>Paul</HI> is here to avouch
this practice, even our Saviour himself;
Who, being to confute the <HI>Sadduces,</HI> who
not only denied the resurrection of the
dead, but also that there was neither An∣gel
nor Spirit, <HI>Acts</HI> 23. 8. (existing sepa∣rate
from the body) so that at death the
souls of men expired, and were utterly
extinguished. In refutation of which er∣rour,
our Saviour <HI>reasoned out of Scripture,</HI>
Mat. 22. 31. 32. <HI>But as touching the resur∣rection
of the dead, have ye not read that
which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I
am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isa∣ac,
and the God of Jacob? God is not the
God of the dead, but of the living. God is
not the God of the dead,</HI> that is, he is not
God to that which is annihilated, and null
in nature, but that thing must have an ab∣solute
being in it self, before it can be so
<PB N="77" REF="50"/>
related that God becomes a God unto it.</P>
<P>This text in it self seems at <HI>great di∣stance</HI>
to prove the Resurrection, and
never likely to <HI>meet</HI> the matter in contro∣versie;
unlesse <HI>Reason intercede</HI> to joyn
them both together. The argumentation
being thus framed, and that to which God
pronounceth himself a God▪ hath a true &amp;
real existence. But God pronounceth him∣self
God to <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> some
hundreds of years after their death; Ther∣fore
<HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> &amp; <HI>Jacob,</HI> had stil a true
and real existence. And thus an argument,
which formerly was vertually in the text,
is by the assistance of <HI>Reason</HI> actually ex∣tracted
thence, and effectually applied to
the preset purpose.</P>
<P>Say not, Christ might have chose in the
old Testament, more pregnant and perti∣nent
places then this by him cited to prove
the resurrection; as that <HI>Job</HI> 19. 26. <HI>And
though after my skin, worms destroy this bo∣dy,
yet in my flesh shal I see God:</HI> For, first it is
presumption for any to teach Christ;
which <HI>stone out of the brook</HI> to chuse (as the
smoothest, and fittest) when he is to en∣counter
the <HI>Goliath</HI> of any errour. Se∣condly,
the Sadduces only allowing the
<PB N="78" REF="51"/>
<HI>Pentateuch,</HI> or five books of <HI>Moses;</HI> Christ
worsted them at their own weapons out
of that Scripture, which they acknow∣ledged
for Canonical; setting us an ex∣ample
by reason out of the Word, to
prove those points which are not expresly
contained therein.</P>
<P>To conclude this point; when <HI>Eve</HI> was
brought to <HI>Adam</HI> newly awaked out of
his deep sleep, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 23. he gazed not on
her as a stranger, but welcomed and en∣tertained
her with this cheerful and cour∣teous
expression, <HI>This is now bone of my
bone, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called
woman, because she was taken out of man.</HI>
So should <HI>Scripture</HI> behold those legiti∣mate
<HI>deductions,</HI> which by right reason,
and lawful rules of Logick, are thence
drawn, and derived, it would instantly
own and acknowledge them for its un∣doubted
issue and off-spring; command∣ing
them to be called <HI>Derivative Scripture,</HI>
because taken out of the body and bow∣els
thereof.</P>
<P>Here I pleade not for such violent and
forced consequences, (<HI>bastards</HI> of mens
brains) which some unjustly <HI>father</HI> on
<PB N="79" REF="51"/>
the Scripture, <HI>wresting</HI> it, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 16.
and not <HI>reasoning,</HI> but <HI>wrangling</HI> from it.
Natural and necessary <HI>deductions,</HI> are by
me alone intended; by which we pro∣ceed
to prove, that Baptism is bottomed
on <HI>Reasons out of Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>Here make we this <HI>motion</HI> to the Rea∣der,
and may he resent it according to
the equity thereof. Though we pro∣pound,
and he peruse these our <HI>reasons out
of Scripture</HI> severally, our desire is they
should all be compounded together, and
joyntly presented to his judgement. This
desire proceeds not from any <HI>jealousie</HI> and
<HI>suspition</HI> we have of their invalidity, as ta∣ken
single, but out of a <HI>confidence,</HI> that
though they may be cavilled at (and en∣deavoured
to be broken) as <HI>single arrows,</HI>
they will be unbreakable to him who here
may have his <HI>Quiver full of them.</HI> For as
in a <HI>regular Fort,</HI> though single <HI>flankers</HI>
thereof may be assaulted, yet the whole
will be impregnable; wherein each part
receiveth strength from, and returneth
strength to another; so we conceiv though
each reason severally may be subject to
captious exceptions against it, yet the to∣tal
<PB N="80" REF="52"/>
sum of them all (besides many more
which Godly Divines have and may adde
unto them) amount to the convincing of
such as do not wilfully boult their eyes
against the beams of truth.</P>

<DIV1 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. The first Reason for the Baptizing of
Infants, taken from the Analogie
of Circumcision.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THe first Reason for Infants Baptism
is grounded on proportion of Cir∣cumcision
in this manner.</HI> If that the chil∣dren
of Jews were admitted to Circumcision,
and thereby made members of the Church;
the children of Christians ought to be admit∣ted
to Baptism, and thereby be made mem∣bers
of the same. But the children of the Jews
were admitted to Circumcision, &amp;c. there∣fore
the children of Christians ought to be ad∣mitted
to Baptism.</P>
<P>Herein the <HI>Major</HI> which alone is subject
<PB N="81" REF="52"/>
to doubt and debate, may be proved by
what formerly was explained, in Baptisms
succeeding to all essentials of Circumcisi∣on.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> To this your arguing from pro∣portion
of Circumcision is of no validity;
yea, and of very dangerous consequence:
For on the same account you may extend
the Analogie to the reviving of all the
Jewish Ceremonies, long since dead and
rotten in the grave of our Saviour; Such
<HI>Necromancy</HI> in Conjuring up the Ghosts
of dead Judaism, is unlawful of it self, and
prejudicial to Christian liberty; should
we be put under the Gospel to such slavish
conformity, as to practice something pa∣rallel
to each Ceremony in the old Testa∣ment.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We confesse this exception true
and just, had Circumcision been but a
bare Ceremony and no more; But Cir∣cumcision
had in it more of what was <HI>Sa∣cramental</HI>
then <HI>Ceremonious.</HI> The <HI>Cere∣monious</HI>
part thereof is utterly extinct,
and dyed <HI>Issueless.</HI> But the Sacramental or
<PB N="82" REF="53"/>
Gospel part thereof, as it contained an
everlasting Covenant made with <HI>Abra∣hams</HI>
seed; that is, all true believers, may
be said to survive, in Baptism the true
heir thereof; <HI>Sacramenta non moriuntur,
Sacraments die not,</HI> (whilest the Church
Militant is alive) nor is there any <HI>inter∣vals</HI>
betwixt them; Baptism immediate∣ly
succeeding Circumcision, as is before
declared.</P>
<P><HI>Proceed we to prove the former Argu∣ment
with a new Syllogism;</HI> They who
once in Circumcision were made members of
the Church, and never since were solemnly
outed of the same, remain still in the state of
their membership: But Circumcised Chil∣dren
under the Jews were made members of
the Church, and never since were solemnly
outed of that condition; Therefore they still
remain members.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>Minor</HI> alone is exposed to suspi∣tion
of falshood; and that only in the la∣ter
part thereof: Now let the denyers of
it assign the time, place, manner, and per∣sons,
when, where, how, and by whom
<PB N="83" REF="53"/>
they were cast out of that membership.
Sure I am, seeing the old Testament leaves
them in <HI>peaceable possession</HI> thereof; And
no <HI>firm ejection</HI> of them appears in the
new Testament; it must needs be some
<HI>Apocrypha writing,</HI> or <HI>forged deed,</HI> which
depriveth them of their true <HI>title</HI> there∣unto,
and <HI>tenure</HI> thereof.</P>
<P><HI>For the further clearing hereof, Let us
suppose, a</HI> Jew <HI>about the time of S.</HI> Paul
<HI>converted into a</HI> Christian, <HI>and soon after
made</HI> father <HI>to a</HI> son. <HI>If this</HI> child <HI>in his
infancy may not be admitted to Baptism,
what cause had it no lesse justly then
Grievously to complain? Might it but
borrow a tongue from the standers by,
how pathetically would it expostulate his
condition?</HI> Alas, how sad is my estate?
My father being but a Jew, was at eight days
old made a member of the Church by Circum∣cision:
His infancy was no bar and obstacle
unto him, to render him uncapable of the
Covenant. I had thought now my Father
is turned Christian, that the Child should not
be impaired because his father is improved?
Is a Christians son found in a worse case then
<PB N="84" REF="54"/>
a Jews son was left? I thought the alteration
of our condition by Christs coming was to per∣fect
not diminish what we had before? Chri∣stianity
may be a good Religion for men to
die in, but Judaism was better for Children
to be born in: We Infants who signified some.
thing under the Law, are made cyphers under
the Gospel, no notice being taken of us, until
we are arrived unto years of discretion.</P>
<P>This complaint might be largely pro∣secuted
with more earnestnesse, but a
word is enough, the rather if we consider
what S. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Heb. 8. 6. But now hath he
obtained a more excellent ministry, by how
much also he is a mediator of a better cove∣nant,
which was established upon better pro∣mises.</HI>
What a Scale of <HI>melioration</HI> have
we here, <HI>better,</HI> and better, <HI>excellent,</HI> and
more <HI>excellent.</HI> But if Children since
Christs coming are excluded the Cove∣nant,
which were admitted unto it before,
his is a <HI>less excellent Ministry,</HI> &amp; he the Me∣diator
of a <HI>worse</HI> Covenant upon <HI>worse</HI> pro∣mises,
seeing the same is not extended now
as formerly, to all ages, Sexes and condi∣tions
of people, (children, included under
the Law) being omitted therein?</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="54"/>
Now though many Infants of <HI>Bethle∣hem,</HI>

suffered for him, surely none suffered by
him. But he continued their condition as
good, yea, and bettered the same by his
Incarnation. He who himself was a childe,
as well as a man, and a childe before he
was a man, did tender and improve the
condition of children as wel as of men; and
leaving this we now proceed to a second
<HI>Reason out of Scripture.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. The Second Reason, drawn from the
birth-holinesse of Christian In∣fants.</HEAD>
<P><HI>OUr Second</HI> Reason out of Scripture,
<HI>is bottomed on S.</HI> Pauls <HI>expression,
1 Cor.</HI> 7. 14. for the unbelieving husband
is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving
wife is sanctified by the husband, else were
your children unclean, but now are they holy.
<HI>Now because there is some difficulty a∣bout
<PB N="86" REF="55"/>
the meaning of the words, we will
be the larger in explaining the same.</HI></P>
<P>It appears by the first verse in this cha∣pter,
that the Corinthians by letter had
requested from S. <HI>Paul,</HI> solution and satis∣faction
to sundry <HI>Queries</HI> by them pro∣pounded:
Wonder not that they, who
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 5. were commended by S. <HI>Paul</HI>
to be <HI>enriched in all knowledge,</HI> should now
desire further instruction. For first, they
had all <HI>knowledge,</HI> but not all the degrees
of knowledge. Secondly, they had all
knowledge, in <HI>fundamental necessaries to
salvation,</HI> not in all cases of <HI>occasional e∣mergency,</HI>
such as their questions were.
Thirdly, grant that even in these, they had
<HI>information</HI> before, they now sue for fur∣ther
<HI>confirmation</HI> from the infallible spirit
of the Apostle.</P>
<P>Alas, will some say for the losse of this
<HI>letter</HI> of the Corinthians to S. <HI>Paul:</HI> Pitty
it was that providence did not transmit the
same to posterity; How useful had it been
for us if it had come into our hands? Let
such know, first, this their <HI>letter</HI> was
no part of Canonical Scripture, pen'd by
a fallible Spirit. Secondly, we have still
<PB N="87" REF="55"/>
this <HI>letter</HI> in effect, because we have Saint
<HI>Pauls</HI> answers to the questions therein.
Thirdly, men generally are more curious
to enquire about those parts of Scripture
which they suspect to have miscarried,
then careful to improve those which re∣main,
and are sufficient for our salvati∣on.</P>
<P>Amongst these Questions, this was not
the easiest, whether a believing husband
or wife were to continue in wedlock with
an unbelieving wife or husband, if by pro∣vidence
it so came to passe that one was an
Infidel, the other a Christian. The Ne∣gative
no doubt seem'd probable to some,
and on this account, <HI>that if he who is joyn∣ed
to an Harlot is one body,</HI> then by the
same consequence, Idolatry being spiritu∣all
whoredom, Copulation with an infidel
is unlawful, and infectious.</P>
<P>But S. <HI>Paul</HI> in the foregoing verse de∣termines
the contrary; That in case the
<HI>Infidel</HI> is pleased to dwel with the <HI>belie∣ver,</HI>
they ought so to continue; rendring
a reason thereof in the words afore alledg∣ed
<HI>for the believing husband, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="56"/>The words contain
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A Proposition.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The proof thereof.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Proposition</HI> is <HI>reciprocal,</HI> it turneth
and windeth backwards and forwards,
<HI>the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the
wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified
by the husband;</HI> the proof thereof is in the
ensuing words▪ <HI>else were your children
unclean, but now are they holy.</HI> In the pro∣position
the <HI>Cardinal</HI> word <HI>Sanctifie,</HI> (as
being the main <HI>Hinge</HI> whereon the same
<HI>turneth</HI>) deserves our serious examinati∣on.</P>
<P><HI>Sanctified</HI> here is not taken, <HI>quoad per∣sonam,</HI>
to <HI>enholy</HI> the party so, as to pro∣cure
his or her eternal salvation. If the
holy <HI>Triumvirate</HI> of <HI>Noah, Daniel,</HI> and <HI>Job,
Ezek.</HI> 14. 20. could save <HI>neither son nor
daughter,</HI> but their sole <HI>selves</HI> from a tem∣poral
destruction, much lesse can the
sanctity of a Christian husband or wife,
operate so effectually on his, or her <HI>Pagan
Partner</HI> as to estate them in a saving condi∣tion.
Indeed the wives holy <HI>conversa∣tion</HI>
may be instrumental to her husbands
<HI>conversion,</HI> 1 Pet. 3. 1. But it is God alone
<PB N="89" REF="56"/>
who <HI>sanctifies,</HI> in this high acception there∣of.</P>
<P><HI>Sanctified</HI> then here is taken <HI>quoad usum,</HI>
that is <HI>eous{que},</HI> they are made holy so far in
relation to Marriage, that the christian
may have a lawful, and comfortable con∣verse,
and cohabitation in <HI>bed</HI> and <HI>board</HI>
with the <HI>counter-Pagan.</HI> Thus all meats
(though some of them formerly forbid∣den
as unlawful by the Levitical Law)
1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 5. are <HI>sanctified by the word of
God and prayer;</HI> that is, the use of them
is legitimated, and they made healthful
to the bodies, and lawful to the souls
of such praying Christians as feed upon
them.</P>
<P>See we here first, <HI>Grace where it came,
did not always take one and all in a family;</HI>
God in dispensing thereof, dealeth as <HI>Ja∣cob</HI>
did in blessing <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Manasseh,
Gen. 48. 14. He crosseth his hands witting∣ly,</HI>
taking <HI>a husband out of one</HI> house, a <HI>wife</HI>
out of another; a <HI>wife</HI> out of one <HI>house,</HI> a
<HI>husband</HI> out of another. The reason here∣of,
<HI>Mat. 11. 26. even so father, because it
pleaseth thee,</HI> John 3. 8. <HI>the Spirit blow∣eth
where it listeth.</HI> Thus <HI>Amos</HI> 4. 7. the
<PB N="90" REF="57"/>
earth is often <HI>chequered</HI> with moisture,
and drought, with barrennesse, and fruit∣fulnesse,
the effects thereof; <HI>I cause it to
rain upon one city and not upon another.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Hence we may learn, that
<HI>Dominion is not founded in Grace:</HI> Had it
been so, then the believing wives to un∣believing
husbands, had a just title to de∣ny
any obedience, pleading that their
husbands by their Paganism had forfeited
all power over them; yet the Apostle,
1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 1. enjoyneth subjection, even
to such husbands who did not <HI>obey the
word,</HI> and who as yet were <HI>without the
word.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, and chiefly hence we observe,
<HI>Mixt mariages made against Gods will, do
defile the Religious, but continued according
to Gods will, do sanctifie the profane person.
Solomon</HI> may be a proof of the first, 1 <HI>Kin.</HI>
11. 4. not <HI>converting</HI> his Idolatrous wives,
but <HI>perverted</HI> by them. Namely, because
he crossed Gods commandment, <HI>Deut. 7. 3.
Neither shalt thou make Mariages with them;</HI>
and the reason is added, <HI>for they will turn
thee away from following me. And although
the husband was doubly</HI> advantaged, both
<PB N="91" REF="57"/>
with his <HI>marital authority,</HI> and a <HI>good cause</HI>
on his side, rather to <HI>prevail</HI> on his wife
then to be <HI>imposed on</HI> by her; yet because
there was <HI>Laesum principium,</HI> a fault in his
first Match, the <HI>edge</HI> was taken off from
all his arguments to her, and added to her
arguments against him▪ making them by
Gods just judgement, twice more <HI>pier∣cing</HI>
and <HI>powerful</HI> to seduce him.</P>
<P>Should then a Christian Man wilfully
take a Heathen wife, he could not pretend
that his <HI>Christianity</HI> should <HI>sanctifie</HI> her
<HI>Infidelity,</HI> so far as to make <HI>his bed and
board</HI> comfortable and lawful unto him,
because he crost a positive precept, which
enjoyns the believing party if at liberty,
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 39. to Marry <HI>only in the Lord:</HI>
The Physitians observe, that <HI>faults com∣mitted
in the first concoction, are seldom a∣mended
in the second:</HI> such men had small
hopes to better their condition by con∣verting
their wives after Marriage, who
before Marriage ran so desperate a hazard
against Gods will in his word.</P>
<P>On the other side, when <HI>mixt Marriages
are continued according to Gods will,</HI> they
do sanctifie the profane person: I mean
<PB N="92" REF="58"/>
when both parties at Marriage were ori∣ginally
Pagan, and one of them after∣wards
converted to Christianity. In such
a case a <HI>separation</HI> is not to be made, (as
was done, <HI>Nehemiah</HI> 13. 30. when he <HI>clean∣sed</HI>
the Jews from all their <HI>strange wives</HI>)
but the Christian may continue in wed∣lock,
with the Pagan, without fear of in∣fection,
and with a double comfort.</P>
<P>1. That hereafter his, or her Pagan
partner probably may be made Chri∣stian,
<HI>verse</HI> 16. <HI>for what knowest thou
O wife, whether thou shalt save thy
husband, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>2. That for the present the Pagan com∣pany
is so sanctified unto him, or her,
that all <HI>conjugal acts qua-conjugal</HI>
may be performed betwixt them,
without the least suspition of sinful∣nesse
therein.</P>
<P>Come we now to the proof of the pro∣position:
<HI>else were your children unclean,
but now are they holy:</HI> Not to speak of na∣tural
uncleannesse (as alien from the pur∣pose:)
We will principally insist upon a
threefold <HI>uncleanness</HI> mentioned in Scri∣pture,
with a holinesse parallel thereunto.</P>

holy, as that they need no Baptism.</HI> Where∣as
indeed hence we gather, such children
to be so <HI>holy, that they have a lawful right

</TABLE></P>
<P>Now are we just level, and even to
the sence of the words, and conceive our
<PB N="95" REF="59"/>
selves, to have hit the mark, or meaning
thereof: And thus it is expounded by all
our Protestant Divines. <HI>Musculus</HI> alone
excepted, who (though otherwise a stiff
Champion for Infants Baptism) accounts
the argument drawn from these words
not <HI>cogent</HI> thereunto.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> If you call this Sacramental <HI>ho∣liness,</HI>
why do you confine the effect
thereof to Baptism alone, &amp; why are
not the children of pious parents ad∣mitted
also on their parents account
without any further examination to
the Lords supper, by the vertue of
this (which you terme) Sacramental
holinesse.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is the method of the Church,
not to intrust a member therein with
this second Sacrament, of <HI>confirma∣tion,</HI>
until first he hath given testi∣mony
of his good improving of his
first Sacrament of <HI>Initiation.</HI> Be∣sides,
a child, while a child, is more
properly a part of the parent, and
may be said to <HI>trade under him.</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="60"/>
Whereas when grown a man <HI>he sets up
for himself,</HI> and takes up a <HI>new stock,</HI>
on his own account; This Sacra∣mental
holinesse therefore estates a
childe in a real right to Baptism, and
only in a capability of the Lords Sup∣per
in due time, except excluded
thence by his own wilful unworthi∣nesse.</P>
<P>Thus amongst the Jews every childe▪
descended from <HI>Abraham,</HI> might chal∣lenge
Circumcision as due unto him, but
could not so lay claim to the Passeover
(of which some of his own intervening
uncleannesse might make him uncapable)
except he was adjudged fit by such, whose
place was to search into peoples purity,
who were to partake of the same.</P>
<P><HI>The main observation is this,</HI> Such as
are christianly extracted, though but by the
half bloud, have a whole right to the Sacra∣ment
of Baptism, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 16. If the Root
be holy so are the Branches. <HI>Say not in such</HI>
mungrel matches, <HI>the</HI> root <HI>is but</HI> half holy,
<HI>and therefore but</HI> semi-sanctity, <HI>is as much
as comes to the share of the</HI> branches
<HI>thereof.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="60"/>
For herein the mercy of God is mag∣nified,
that whereas he might have
made the childe, as the <HI>conclusion</HI> to fol∣low
what was worst in the premises of
either Parent, his mercy interpreteth all
according to the better part thereof.
What result could be expected from the
joyning of <HI>hot</HI> and <HI>cold</HI> but <HI>lukewarm?</HI>
What product from the blending of <HI>white</HI>
and <HI>black</HI> but a <HI>motley?</HI> What amounts
from the mixture of <HI>light</HI> and <HI>darkness</HI> but
<HI>twy-light?</HI> but such is Gods goodness to
<HI>pass over</HI> and take no notice of the Paga∣nism
in one parent, whiles the child shall
solely succeed to the purity in the other.
Now if Christian children by the <HI>half-bloud</HI>
be <HI>holy</HI>▪ how clear is those Infants ti∣tle
Religiously descended on both sides?
when <HI>Deus est in utro{que} parente,</HI> Let none
be so cruel as to question their title to the
Sacrament.</P>
<P>IF any then ask, <HI>what advantage then
hath a Christian, and what profit is there of
pious parentage?</HI> We answer, <HI>much every
way;</HI> chiefly because extraction from
them entitles to the Sacrament of Ba∣ptism.
They have also the benefit of their
<PB N="98" REF="61"/>
parents <HI>dry</HI> and <HI>wet</HI> prayers, (even before
their conception) petitioning to God im∣portunately,
to make them be instru∣ments
not to <HI>People Hell,</HI> but <HI>Plant Heaven.</HI>
When growing up, capable to learn, they
have advantage of <HI>precepts (Abraham</HI> will
teach his children) of good <HI>precedents,</HI>
whiles the children of wicked parents see
daily what they should <HI>flie,</HI> these see what
they should <HI>follow;</HI> the advantage of <HI>cor∣rection</HI>
moderately and seasonably used.
All these are the <HI>sap</HI> which the <HI>root</HI> of holy
parentage sends up into the <HI>branches</HI>
thereof, though all of them too often
prove ineffectual, and God (who finally
saveth not <HI>children</HI> for their <HI>parents</HI> sake,
but <HI>parents</HI> and <HI>children</HI> for <HI>Christs</HI> sake)
justly condemneth many children of good
parents, for neglecting all these precious
advantages to salvation.</P>
<P>To conclude. In the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> the
eldest son of a <HI>Commission Captain,</HI> being
born there whilest his father is in the ser∣vice
of the State, is by <HI>the courtesie of the
camp,</HI> enrolled in the souldiers list on his
birth-day, and by the allowance of the
State, receives pay from the time of his
<PB N="99" REF="61"/>
nativity. In the Christian warfare, though
Christ alone be our Captain, every com∣mon
souldier (male or female) enlisted
under him, derives this priviledge to all
his children; that from their very births
they are thus far entred into the <HI>muster∣roll</HI>
of the Church, as to receive pay; I
mean the right, and title to the Sacrament
of Baptism, as being by their very extra∣ction,
not <HI>unclean,</HI> but <HI>Sacramently holy.</HI></P>

<DIV1 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI. The third Reason, taken from the
Holy Spirit, which is given to
little Infants.</HEAD>
<P>THe Third <HI>Reason out of Scripture,</HI> is
thus framed: Such who receive the
Spirit of God may and ought to be Bapti∣zed;
but infants receive the Spirit of
God, therefore they may and ought to be
Baptized.</P>
<P>The Major hereof is in effect the words
<PB N="100" REF="62"/>
of the Text; <HI>Peter</HI> saith, <HI>Acts</HI> 10. 47. <HI>Can any
man forbid water that these should not be Ba∣ptized,
which have received the holy Ghost as
wel as we?</HI> Can he? that is, can he justly? can
he lawfully? can he so do it, as to avouch
it to God and man, when he hath done it?
Though I confesse too many <HI>de facto,</HI> do
it now adayes. <HI>Can any man? we can do
nothing,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>against the
Truth but for the Truth,</HI> 2 Cor. 13. 8. It is
not strength, but weaknesse; for one to
be able to do that which he ought not to
do. <HI>Can any man?</HI> Be he an Apostle, or
even <HI>Peter</HI> himself, MAN. He must be
either worse then a man for his <HI>Envy,</HI> or
lesse then a man by his <HI>Ignorance.</HI></P>
<P>The Minor remains to be proved, that
Infants receive the Spirit of God, whereof
we have two pregnant proofs, one in the
old Testament, <HI>Jer.</HI> 1. 5. <HI>Before I formed
thee in the womb I knew thee, and before
thou camest out of the womb I sanctified thee,
and ordained thee to be a Prophet unto the
Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> This sanctification of <HI>Jeremy,</HI>
intends not such as accompanieth the sal∣vation
of the soul, but meerly importeth
<PB N="101" REF="62"/>
a designation of him to the Prophetical
function, with qualification for the dis∣charge
thereof. It is therefore impertinent∣ly
alledged to prove, that Infants have the
saving Spirit of God.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is confessed that <HI>Jeremy</HI> his
destination to be a Prophet, was a princi∣pal
part of his <HI>sanctifying</HI> here mentioned.
Yet was it not the total thereof, as being
but a sprig and branch of the same, which
extended to Gods forming him according
to his <HI>knowledge</HI> of <HI>approbation</HI> and <HI>hallow∣ing</HI>
him as yet unborn, to be his Saint and
servant.</P>
<P>The second instance in the new Testa∣ment
is that of <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, <HI>Luke</HI> 1. 41.
<HI>Leaping in his mothers womb at the saluta∣tion
of the virgin Mary.</HI> Not that (as
some have mistaken it) that <HI>then his Mo∣ther
was first sensible that she quickned of
him,</HI> seeing it was said before, <HI>vers.</HI> 36.
<HI>This is the sixth moneth with her which was
called barren;</HI> but as it is <HI>vers.</HI> 44. the
babe <HI>leaped in my womb for joy,</HI> knowing
and acknowledging Christ the Saviour of
mankind, and transported with transcen∣dent
gladnesse for the same.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="63"/>
<HI>Object.</HI> But <HI>Jeremy and John the Ba∣ptist,</HI>
were <HI>Jeremy and John the Baptist,</HI> I
mean, signal persons of extraordinary sta∣ture
of grace, above the size of common
Christians. Your Logick is but bad, if
from the induction of two instances, you
infer a general conclusion: As soundly
you might prove, that all <HI>Davids wor∣thies</HI>
were equal in valour and atchive∣ments,
2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 19. <HI>unto the first three,</HI>
as that al infants of Gods children may for
their abilities be matched with <HI>these two</HI>
by you alledged.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I grant no lesse, That these two
instances were extraordinary: However
thus much advantage we gain thereby,
that they plainly prove <HI>the state of Infancy</HI>
to be <HI>receptive</HI> of grace, and of ability to
entertain the same. Let none look on In∣fants
as so <HI>indisposed</HI> and <HI>unorganized</HI> by
reason of their weaknesse, but that the
lownesse of their age is capable of the <HI>ele∣vation</HI>
to sanctity.</P>
<P>Secondly, though we acknowledge
such <HI>redundancy</HI> of the Spirit in the extra∣ordinary
and miraculous proportion
<PB N="103" REF="63"/>
thereof confined to a few persons, in
Christs and the Apostles time, yet we may
no lesse truly then confidently maintain,
that a <HI>sufficiency</HI> thereof as to salvation, is
conferr'd on all Gods servants now adays,
as well as before; Nor is Gods Spirit
<HI>super-annuated</HI> with aged <HI>Naomy,</HI> Ruth,
1. 11. or grown so <HI>barren,</HI> or <HI>effete,</HI> but
that it is still procreative, and produceth
the effects thereof in Gods servants now,
as vigorously as ever before.</P>
<P>Otherwise, most doleful, yea, indeed
desperate were the conditions of Gods
servants now adays, if devoid of the Spirit
of God, <HI>as to the essentials thereof,</HI> having
now a <HI>fiercer foe and worse weapons</HI> to en∣counter
him, then the Christians had in
former ages: <HI>A fiercer foe,</HI> Satan himself
growing subtiler, with the addition of
fifteen hundred years experience; and
crueller, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12. 12. because the shorter
his reign, the sharper his rage: <HI>Worse
weapons</HI> if we be left altogether naked of
the offencive and defencive armor of the
Spirit of God.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but admire at the
practice of some persons now adayes,
<PB N="104" REF="64"/>
boasting of strange measures of the Spirit
bestowed upon them (and we must needs
believe them, <HI>for they say so themselves;</HI>)
yea, such prodigious proportions there∣of,
whereby <HI>per saltum,</HI> they conceive
themselves enabled for such offices, for
which they were never fitted by their
education. And yet the self-same per∣sons
who are thus prodigal in the praise of
their own perfections, assuming so much
of the Spirit to themselves, are most mi∣serably
nigardly to others, and especialy
to Infants denying the least degree of the
Spirit unto them.</P>
<P>Whereas let matters be beheld with an
unpartial eye, and it will appear, that it is
more probable children should partake
of the company of the Spirit, then men
now adayes: May it not justly be suspect∣ed,
that the spiritual pride, uncharitable∣nesse,
self-interest, sinister respects, cru∣elty,
and oppression of many men do
<HI>fright</HI> away <HI>the spirit</HI> from them, how
highly soever pretending to holinesse:
whereas the mildnesse, meeknesse, silence,
humility and patience of a childe, may
invite the society of the spirit the sooner
<PB N="105" REF="64"/>
unto it, and the <HI>Dove</HI> converse rather <HI>with
Doves</HI> then with <HI>Vultures.</HI></P>
<P>To put all out of doubt, we can plain∣ly
demonstrate the fruits of Gods Spirit
and Sanctification in Infants, dying Infants,
and therefore the root therof must be
granted to be in their hearts, which we
thus prove.</P>
<LIST TYPE="syllogism">
<ITEM><HI>Whatsoever is</HI> saved <HI>is fully</HI> sanctified,

<ITEM>But many children (especially of God∣ly
parents) dying children are sa∣ved.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore they are fully sanctified.</ITEM>

<P>He wants judgement that denies the
Major or former part of the syllogism;
And he lacks as much charity who questi∣ons
the Minor hereof; otherwise <HI>Herod</HI>
the cruel Tyrant, who killed only the bo∣dies

the souls of so many Infants, depriving

<DIV1 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="106" REF="65"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XII. The fourth Reason drawn from some
degrees of Faith, conferred on lit∣tle
Infants.</HEAD>
<P>THe Fourth <HI>Reason out of Scripture</HI> is
thus formed; They that have some
degree of Faith, may and ought to be
Baptized; But Infants have some degree
of faith;</P>
<P>Therefore they may and ought to be
Baptized.</P>
<P>The Major is the very same with the
words of the Scripture: The Eunuch
askt of <HI>Philip,</HI> Acts 8. 36. <HI>See here is water,
what doth hinder me to be baptized?</HI> Philip
answered, <HI>if thou believest with all thy heart
thou mayest.</HI></P>
<P>Al the difficulty is in the proof of the Mi∣nor;
For our Adversaries wil say, if the In∣fant
could rejoyne with the Eunuch in
the same place, <HI>I believe that Jesus Christ is
the Son of God,</HI> then the [now most zea∣lous]
opposers would be the most earnest
<PB N="107" REF="65"/>
advancers of their Baptism.</P>
<P>For the proof then of Infants faith,
let us bring another Reason, but still out
of Scripture.</P>
<LIST TYPE="syllogism">
<ITEM><HI>Without faith it is impossible to please
God,</HI> Heb. 11. 6. </ITEM>
<ITEM>But Infants please
God;</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore they have Faith.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Herein the Minor alone is <HI>dubitable,</HI>
and may manifestly be evinced. All men
I know are ready to pretend that they
please God; And Hypocrites themselves
most (odious unto him) as forward as any
to claim this priviledge to themselves. To
put this therefore out of question, it mat∣ters
not what men say, but what God says
herein: We appeal to him (who best
knows his own mind) and he hath <HI>judged</HI>
this case already, <HI>That Infants please him.</HI></P>
<P>Say not if so smal then, were they in∣sensible
of any benefit by the blessing?
not conceiving the meaning of our Savi∣our
therein.</P>
<P>This appears by Christs carriage to∣wards
the <HI>little children</HI> brought unto him
in the Gospel; Concerning whose years
<PB N="108" REF="66"/>
be this premised, that though we have not
the <HI>Register books</HI> of their several ages, yet
we may conclude (at least some of) them
no bigger then Babes. First, because
called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> by S. <HI>Mark</HI> 10. and judicious∣ly
rendred by our Translators, <HI>verse</HI> 13.
<HI>young children,</HI> verse 14. <HI>little children;</HI>
The diminution in the Original word,
being equally appliable either to their
age or stature. The same are termed by
S. <HI>Luke</HI> 18. 15. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and translated <HI>In∣fants,</HI>
alwayes used in Scripture for such
as suck on their mothers breast. Secondly,
they are said to be <HI>brought</HI> by their parents,
as unable to bring themselves. Third∣ly,
Christ took them up in his arms, as not
big enough to <HI>kneel down</HI> and be blessed,
which otherwise was the posture of strip∣lings
upon the same occasion.</P>
<P>That these little children pleased Christ,
is proved by his <HI>expressions</HI> (the best in∣terpreters
of love or hatred in that heart
which could not dissemble) concerning
them, <HI>Mark</HI> 10. 14. <HI>Suffer little children to
come unto me, and forbid them not, for of
such is the kingdom of God.</HI> Of Such, that
is not only of those who are like unto
<PB N="109" REF="66"/>
these, (in which sense our Saviour might
as significatively have said the same of
<HI>Doves</HI> or <HI>Lambs,</HI> that the kingdom of hea∣ven
consists of such who are like unto
them) but of these, and also of those who
imitate them in their innocential qualities.
Such make strange interpretation of the
words, who exclude the <HI>Original,</HI> and
only admit the <HI>Copy;</HI> let in such as are
like to children, and shut out children
themselves from the kingdom of hea∣ven.</P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>complacency</HI> Christ took
in these little children appears by his acti∣ons
unto them, <HI>vers.</HI> 16. <HI>he took them up
in his arms, laid his hands on them, and
blessed them;</HI> See wee such Infants were in
a <HI>blessible condition.</HI></P>
<P>Here we distinguish between childrens
<HI>being sensible of the meaning,</HI> and their
<HI>being capable of the benefit,</HI> by a blessing.
Probably some of the smallest children
here presented unto Christ, understood
not our Saviours language, nor the mean∣ing
of his gestures, until their parents af∣terwards
interpreted the same unto them
as they grew up in years. And yet such
<PB N="110" REF="67"/>
Infants might effectually partake of the
vigour, and vertue of Christs benedi∣ction.
Thus as many though by natural
defect they never had, or by sicknesse have
lost their <HI>Taste,</HI> and by their pallat cannot
distinguish betixt <HI>sweet, bitter, sharp, sowre,</HI>
&amp;c. (and consequently take no pleasure
or delight in what they eat or drink) yet
by the receiving thereof, may have their
hunger and thirst satisfied, and their
strength daily increased; So these Infants
purely passive in our Saviours Arms,
<HI>brought thither</HI> without their <HI>knowledge,</HI>
and <HI>blest there</HI> above their <HI>understanding,</HI>
did nevertheless (some of them no doubt)
really participate of the spiritual comfort
which the emphatical blessing of Christ
impressed upon them.</P>
</DIV1>

<PB N="111" REF="67"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. The Fift Reason drawn from the Ma∣lady
of Original Corruption.</HEAD>
<P>THe Fift <HI>Reason out of Scripture</HI> may
thus be contrived; They who are
subject to the malady of sin, ought
to partake of the remedy against it; But
Infants are subject to the malady of sin;
therfore they ought to partake of baptism
the remedy against it. For the proof of the
<HI>major</HI> or first part thereof, I appeal a∣mongst
Christians, only to the married;
amongst the married, only to the parents
of children. These cannot deny it, but
that against their wills, as the unhappy in∣struments,
they have derived corruption
to their infants, as conveyed in the same
charter of their being unto them.</P>
<P>If any should be so sensless as to deny In∣fants
infected with Original Corruption,
the contrary will be sadly demonstrated
by those several diseases, and death it self,
to which they are subject, before they
<PB N="112" REF="68"/>
have or can commit actual sin. All will
confesse no suffering can follow but
where sin hath gone before, and that In∣fants
deeply share in sufferings, daily ex∣perience
approveth. Some of them
whilest they lie in the Cradle, how lie
they on the rack? Such sighes, such sobs,
such gripes, such groans, such convulsions,
such distortions, enough almost to kill the
hearts of the beholders, relating unto
them, if all pitty be not dead in them
before: Nor can all the rending of the
fathers hair, abate the aching of the childs
head, nor all the rain of the mothers
tears, allay the wind in the babes body.
<HI>Quid teneri infantes in te committere tan∣tum?
quid pueri potuere.</HI> But these little
Lambs wherein have they offended? Their
hands did never hurt others, which could
not help themselves: Their tongues did
never lie, swear, &amp;c. which cannot speak;
Their feet were never swift to shed bloud
which cannot go. All these miseries, and
death at last, fals often, on Infants un∣capable
of actual sin, because of the cor∣ruption
of their nature wherein they were
born and conceived.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="68"/>
Seeing therefore Infants are subject to
the malady of sin, what a cruelty were it
for parents to leave them in this pittiful
case neglecting the remedy for the same?
By the Levitical Law, <HI>Exod.</HI> 21. 33. <HI>If a
man shall open a pit, and not cover it,</HI> he
was to pay the owner for the losse of those
his cattel which fell into it: Parents ha∣ving
opened a pit of original corruption
by the sinfulnesse of their nature, if they
labour not to cover it again, as much as in
them lies, by using the ordinance God
hath appointed for the same, shall not the
souls of their children, if finally falling in∣to
that <HI>pit,</HI> be heavily required at their
hands? Yea, shall man be carelesse and
cruel, where God hath been so kind and
careful in his instituting of Baptism? <HI>Rom.</HI>
6. 3. <HI>That we may be Baptized into Jesus
Christ his death,</HI> as it followeth <HI>vers.</HI> 6.
<HI>that the body of sin may be destroyed,</HI> To
conclude, <HI>Infants</HI> having the body of
sin as well as <HI>adult persons,</HI> and Baptism
being appointed for the destruction there∣of,
such parents are wanting to their own
duty, undervalue Gods ordinance, and
are cruel to the souls of the flesh of their
<PB N="114" REF="69"/>
body that deny Baptism unto Infants.</P>

<DIV1 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. The Sixth Reason, drawn from the
constant Practice of Christian
Churches in all Ages; what cre∣dit
is to be given to a Primitive
Custome.</HEAD>
<P>I Shall now be challenged by such, who
herein dissent in judgement from me,
for breach of promise, starting from
my own principles; that having promi∣sed
<HI>Reasons out of Scripture,</HI> I flie now to
Church-Practice, and Ancient Tradition.
Wherefore to vindicate my self, &amp; (which
is far more considerable) the Truth here∣in,
I will first prove by Gods assistance, by
<HI>Reason out of Scripture,</HI> that the Practice of
the Catholique Church, in all Places, and
at all Times, (especially in such matters,
wherein nothing appears contrary in
Gods Word) obligeth all conscientious
<PB N="115" REF="69"/>
Christians to the observation thereof.
And in the next Chapter we wil shew, that
the Baptizing of Infants hath been the un∣interrupted
Custome of the Church.</P>
<P>Be it premised, that if we look on <HI>Cu∣stomes</HI>
simply in themselves, we shall find
them generally, like the men of <HI>Sodom,</HI>
not <HI>ten good ones,</HI> amongst the many thou∣sands
of them. For what is <HI>Custome,</HI> but
the practice of most men time out of
mind. Now seeing most men, yea, all
men by Nature, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6. 5. <HI>have the ima∣ginations
of their hearts evil,</HI> and that not
for a day, week, or year; but, as the Text
saith, <HI>continually;</HI> no wonder if Customes
be commonly wicked. Yea, such errours,
and vices, which at the first are soft, and
supple, pliable to Reproof, and sensible
of Refutation, contract an hardnesse, by
custome, in continuance of time; yea,
get an incrustation, and such scales over
them, that they become impenetrable to
Scripture and Reason brought against
them. And as <HI>Lahan</HI> deceived plain∣dealing
<HI>Jacob,</HI> in his Marriage, <HI>Gen.</HI> 29. 26.
by pleading the <HI>custome of the Country,</HI>
so it is confessed, that too many in all A∣ges,
<PB N="116" REF="70"/>
in matters both of faith and fact, have
alledged Custome to Patronize their er∣roneous
opinions, and injurious practi∣ses.</P>
<P>But all this ought not to beget in us a
neglect of such Customes, which like
<HI>Melchisedec,</HI> are <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 3. <HI>without father,
without mother, without discent;</HI> whose
first <HI>original</HI> cannot be found out; <HI>as pra∣ctised
in the Church, time out of mind;</HI> no
remembrance, or <HI>record</HI> extant to the con∣trary.
Now as <HI>Melchisedec,</HI> in the same
place, is said to have <HI>neither beginning of
dayes,</HI> and what necessarily followeth
thence, <HI>nor end of life;</HI> so it is but just and
equal that such <HI>Ancient Customes</HI> in the
<HI>Church,</HI> which never had memorable <HI>Rise,</HI>
should never have <HI>Fall</HI> therein; but that
such which probably began at the <HI>first,</HI>
should constantly be continued till the
<HI>last coming</HI> of our <HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>Here I plead not for such <HI>mis-shapen
Customes,</HI> which either run up all in <HI>length,
narrow,</HI> and <HI>slender,</HI> which (though long
in use) never extended to any <HI>wideness</HI> in
the Christian World; or else so <HI>low,</HI> and
<HI>thick,</HI> they only <HI>spread</HI> in <HI>bredth,</HI> (as ma∣ny
<PB N="117" REF="70"/>
<HI>Popish Customes,</HI> generally, but not an∣ciently
used) but never shot up to the
just stature of <HI>Primitive Antiquity.</HI> We
only defend such <HI>wel-grown Customes</HI>
which I call <HI>square</HI> ones, (the form of firm∣ness
and stability) whose <HI>height</HI> and <HI>bredth</HI>
are well proportioned, put in ure by
Christians at all times, and in all places;
conceiving we can demonstrate it, <HI>by rea∣son
from Scripture,</HI> that such Customes
must be presumed, grounded on the <HI>word</HI>
and <HI>will of God.</HI></P>
<P>For proof whereof we produce Gods
promise, and <HI>Lo I am with you always unto
the end of the world, Amen.</HI> Mat. 28. 20.
Every operative word herein deserves
our serious consideration</P>
<P>I am with you unto the end: I am, <HI>A</HI>
verb <HI>of the</HI> present, <HI>joyned with words
of the</HI> future tense; <HI>to shew Gods</HI> Instan∣taneous
assistance <HI>in every moment of</HI> ex∣tremity,
Psal. 46. 1. God is our strength and
refuge a very present help in trouble.</P>
<P><HI>With you:</HI> This cannot be meant only
of the <HI>Disciples</HI> personally, none of them
living to the <HI>end of the world,</HI> seeing <HI>John</HI>
himself, (the surviver of the <HI>whole Jury</HI>)
<PB N="118" REF="71"/>
died about the <HI>year</HI> of <HI>our Lord▪</HI> 102. It is
therefore meant extensively of the <HI>Di∣sciples,</HI>
as they were an <HI>immortal corpora∣tion.
With you:</HI> Selves, and successours,
persons, and posterity. As <HI>Christ: John</HI> 17.
20. Did not <HI>pray for these alone,</HI> so here he
did not promise to these alone; <HI>but to
them also which should believe on him
through their word.</HI></P>
<P>These words, <HI>To be with you,</HI> import
not only a promise of protecting them
from all dangers, but also of directing
them in all doctrines, necessary to be be∣lieved
and practised for their <HI>salvation.</HI>
And this promise being made not so much
to the particular persons, as to the colle∣ctive
body of the Church, is not so effe∣ctually
performed to every individual
Christian, as to the Universal Church,
which amounteth from them all.</P>
<P>We confesse that notwithstanding the
foresaid promise of protection and dire∣ction,
many good men have been guilty
of great errours, and have also fallen by
Gods permission, and just punishment of
their sins into grievous dangers. How∣ever
Divine goodnesse so <HI>doubleth his Files</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="71"/>
about his Church in general, that he will
not suffer the same to be universally in∣fected
in all Ages with any one dangerous
Errour. And therefore <HI>a Church Custome
in all times and places,</HI> must be presumed
conformable to the will of God, because
were it erroneous, it were utterly incon∣sistent
with that solemn promise which
God hath passed to his Church, to <HI>be with
them unto the worlds end.</HI></P>
<P>Such who on the contrary side are high∣ly
opinioned of their private Judgements,
and will not confide in the Universal Cu∣stomes
of the Church: I know not whe∣ther
therein they do shew more want of
Charity in condemning so many Christi∣ans
at once, or plenty of pride in over∣prizing
their own judgements; or store
of profanenesse in doubting, yea, deny∣ing
the performance of Gods promise so
solemnly made of his protecting presence
in the Church, who surely will dispatch
and destroy an errour therein, before it
grow up to be so long liv'd as to become
a Custome.</P>
<P><HI>What a high valuation S.</HI> Paul <HI>set on
Church Customes, appears by his ex∣pression,</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="72"/>
1 Cor. 11. 16. But if any man seem to
be contentious, we have no such custome, nei∣ther
the Churches of God: <HI>For the better
understanding whereof, know that the
Corinthians were guilty of an</HI> innovation▪
<HI>wherein they were an</HI> exception <HI>from the</HI>
rule <HI>of the general practice in all Christian
Churches: The Innovation was this, that
their women used to pray</HI> uncovered, <HI>the
men</HI> covered; <HI>that is, as it is generally in∣terpreted,
the women with short, the men
with long hair. This ill fashion S.</HI> Paul
<HI>confutes with several reasons drawn from
the power of man over his wife, appeal∣ing
also to natural decencie therein.
And at last concludes all with this close;</HI>
But if any seem to be contentious, we have no
such Custome, nor yet the Churches of God.
<HI>As if he had said,</HI> could you Corinthians
prescribe any custome, that in Gods Churches
grave and godly men and women have pray∣ed
as you do, the former covered the latter
uncovered. Then should you alledge much
in your own justification. But I am confi∣dent
on the contrary, that no such custome
can be produced, and therefore your singu∣larity,
is condemned by the joynt practice of
<PB N="121" REF="72"/>
all Gods Churches against them.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> These words, <HI>But if any man
seem to be contentious, we have no such cu∣stome,
neither the Churches of God;</HI> Im∣port
only, that Gods Churches have no
custome to be contentious: Christians
ought to be of a quiet and peaceable
mind, and not to delight in vain janglings
and dissentions.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This cannot be the meaning
of the words: For was ever man so silly
as to suppose and conceive that Gods
Churches should be so irrational as to
have a ridiculous <HI>custome of being conten∣tious?</HI>
The Church is so far from having
such custome (which is a habit resulting
from many acts) that it condemneth each
single act of causelesse contention as wick∣ed
and ungodly. Yea, no civilized
estate, though consisting of meer Pagans,
ever had any <HI>custome to be contentious,</HI> or
did ever delight in <HI>Barrettors:</HI> More then
must be meant herein, that Gods Chur∣ches
had never any such Custome for the
two Sexes so to pray as the Corinthians
did, who herein <HI>ran counter</HI> to the Uni∣versal
practice of Christianity; the Apo∣stle
<PB N="122" REF="73"/>
naming <HI>Churches</HI> in the Plural, which
are the <HI>single instruments</HI> (as the whole
Church is the <HI>consort</HI>) all of them <HI>harmo∣niously
agreeing</HI> in this custome, save only
the jarring Corinthians, who are <HI>out of
tune</HI> by themselves.</P>
<P>If a Church custome carried weight
with it in S. <HI>Pauls</HI> time, when amongst
Christians it could not be above <HI>fourty
years standing;</HI> what a reverence is due to
those customes which have continued in
Gods Church above sixteen hundred
years, amongst which the Baptizing of
Infants is a principal; and if S. <HI>Pauls</HI> ar∣gument
followed negatively, <HI>women ought
not pray uncovered, because the Church hath
no such custome;</HI> the consequence is no
lesse strong from the affirmative, <HI>Children
ought to be Baptized, because the Church in
all ages hath had such a Custome;</HI> The pro∣ving
whereof is the subject of the en∣suing

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. The Antiquity and generallity of Ba∣ptizing
of Infants, proved by the
confession of Pelagius.</HEAD>
<P>DIvers Learned and Godly Divines,
have undertaken, and performed
this task, to prove the constant
practice of Infants Baptism in the Primi∣tive
Church, by the induction of the Au∣thorities
of several Fathers to that pur∣pose.
And as the Angels in <HI>Jacobs</HI> Lad∣der,
<HI>Gen.</HI> 28. 12. Some ascended, others
descended upon it; so in this <HI>scale of au∣thorities,</HI>
some have deduced the practice
downwards from Christs time to our
dayes; others by an inverted method
have raised it upwards from our days to
Christs time, both by different motions
meeting in the same point.</P>
<P>It is our hap, like <HI>Ahimaaz,</HI> to be sent
last on the same errand: the proof of this
point. And although far be such arro∣gance
<PB N="124" REF="74"/>
from me as to hope with him to
come first to our journeys end (and to do
<HI>better</HI> then my <HI>betters</HI> have done before
me) yet thus far wil I follow the example
of <HI>Ahimaaz,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 18. 23. <HI>To run by the way
of the plain.</HI> Having to deal with people
who generally are unlearned, &amp; therefore
the heaping of Quotations in unknown
tongues, were probable to offend, and in∣cense,
rather then to edifie and inform
them, we will imbrace the plainest way
to make the Baptizing of Infants appear
an Antient and general Church Custome
unto them.</P>
<P>This will be proved by the confession of
<HI>Pelagius,</HI> when first we have given an ac∣count
to the Reader what he was, when,
and where he lived, and what opinions he
maintained.</P>
<P>He was a <HI>Britan</HI> by birth, flourishing a∣bout
the year of our Lord <HI>four hundred &amp;
ten;</HI> a man of great learning, and greater
parts, had the same been sanctified unto
him.</P>
<P>In the time of this <HI>Pelagius,</HI> only three
parts of the world were known, <HI>Europe,
Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa;</HI> all which were traced
<PB N="125" REF="74"/>
with the feet of <HI>Pelagius,</HI> who though born
in a <HI>corner</HI> of the World, quickly quitted
his native soyl, and enriched himself with
the experience of <HI>Church-practice</HI> in all
parts.</P>
<P>In
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Europe</HI> where he was born in
<HI>Britain,</HI> and where he lived a
long time in<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg"><HI>Augustine</HI> Epist. 95.</NOTE> <HI>Rome</HI> it self, gain∣ing
there great acquaintance
with <HI>Ruffinus</HI>) which may passe
for the <HI>Epitome</HI> of the then <HI>Chri∣stian
world.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Asia,</HI> where in the Island of
<HI>Rhodes,</HI> or thereabouts, he first
scattered his dangerous Do∣ctrine.
Afterwards he went to
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg"><HI>Augustine</HI> Epist. 92.</NOTE> <HI>Hierusalem.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Africa,</HI> where for some times
he continued in <HI>Egypt,</HI> working
himself into the familiarity of
the learned men therein.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Yea, it is laid to the charge of <HI>Pelagius,</HI>
that to disperse his poysonous opinions
with the more advantage, <HI>saepius mutavit
loca,</HI> he often purposely changed the place
of his habitation.</P>
<P>Amongst the many dangerous doctrines
<PB N="126" REF="75"/>
which <HI>Pelagius</HI> maintained, we will insist
on that alone; the confutation whereof,
makes mainly for our present purpose.
He defended that Infants were conceived
and born without original sin, which came
unto them (when growing in years) not
from an inward <HI>principal of corruption,</HI>
but from their <HI>imitation of outward</HI> ill ex∣amples
presented unto them. S. <HI>Augustine</HI>
undertakes his confutation, and amongst
many other solid Arguments to that pur∣pose,
principally insisteth upon this, that
it <HI>was the custome of the Church in all ages
to Baptize Infants;</HI> which plainly proves
that they were conceived in original sin.
<HI>For that which is clean needs not to be wash∣ed.</HI></P>
<P>This Argument is often inculcated by
S. <HI>Austin</HI> in several places, as namely in
his 150 Epistle unto <HI>Sixtus.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise in his second book of <HI>Mar∣riage
and concupiscence,</HI> in the eighteenth
chapter.</P>
<P>Likewise in his four books to <HI>Bonifa∣cius,</HI>
and every where in his six books a∣gainst
<HI>Julian,</HI> one of <HI>Pelagius</HI> his schollers.</P>
<P>Likewise in his first book of <HI>imperfect
<PB N="127" REF="75"/>
work</HI> against the same, chapter 48. 54. and
115.</P>
<P>Lastly, in his second book of <HI>imperfect
work,</HI> chapter 120. and 180. To spare
making more instances, the matter being
notoriously known to any, who have the
least skill in the works of that worthy Fa∣ther.</P>
<P><HI>Now how easie had it been for</HI> Pelagi∣us
<HI>to answer this argument, by denying
childrens Baptism to be a Church cu∣stome,
had not his conscience been con∣vinced
of the truth thereof: How might
he have rejoyned,</HI> Original sin cannot be
proved from the Baptizing of Infants, <HI>which
is</HI> but a modern custome, &amp; an innovation in
the Church of God. What the Sodomites said
of <HI>Lot,</HI> Gen. 19. 9. <HI>This one fellow came
in to sojourn and will he needs be a judg?
may be said of</HI> Infants Baptism: This cu∣stome
is new and novel, lately crept into the
Chuch (as yet rather a sojourner, then an in∣habitant
therein) and must this regulate
matters in a judicial way, so that arguments
must be deduced from the same? Besides, I
have been a Traveller, and have conversed
with most Churches in Christendome, being
<PB N="128" REF="76"/>
born in <HI>Britaine</HI> (a little world by it self;)
I have been in the great world abroad: Jew
and Gentile, East and Western Churches
have I observed: <HI>Hierusalem</HI> that was, and
<HI>Rome</HI> which is, so eminent for Religion, are
places wherein I am well acquainted. <HI>This
I know some Churches observe, others
neglect, some use,</HI> others slight the Bapti∣sing
of Infants. <HI>Nor</HI> can it be accounted a ge∣neral
custom of the Church which is but local,
and partial, in a word, both <HI>NEW</HI> and <HI>NAR∣ROW,</HI>
as neither coming down from Christ,
nor extended over all Christendome.</P>
<P>But <HI>Pelagius</HI> endeavoured to evade
S. <HI>Austins</HI> argument by another device;
namely, by pleading that Baptism was
admitted to Infants, <HI>not to wash away their
Original sin, but to bring them to the king∣dome
of heaven.</HI> A fancy which he was
the first, and (he and his) the last to main∣tain
it.</P>
<P>The result of all is this; Seeing <HI>Pela∣gius</HI>
was so great a schollar, knowing full
well how to manage a bad cause to its
best advantage; and seeing he was so
great a Traveller, who had not <HI>eat his bread
all in one place,</HI> but had roved up and
<PB N="129" REF="76"/>
down to know the customes of the
Church, and yet feeing by his silence (ur∣ging
nothing against it) and by his shift∣ing
(seeking otherwise to evade it) he ac∣knowledgeth
the truth of Infants Ba∣ptism;
we conclude the same in his days
received for an Ancient and Universal
practice of the Church. For why should
he adventure the breaking of his bones,
(or at leastwise the bruising of his flesh) by
leaping out of the <HI>window,</HI> who hath a
<HI>wide door</HI> set open unto him? Why should
he make so poor and pittiful, so base and
beggerly an escape, to avoid S. <HI>Austins</HI> ar∣gument
against him (by forming a frivo∣lous
fancy of his own) who had a ful, free,
and fair passage at pleasure to go forth,
durst he but have denied the Baptizing of
Infants to have been a general Church cu∣stome
in his time?</P>
<P><HI>To conclude this point, the argu∣ment
of</HI> Jephthah <HI>to the King of</HI> Ammon,
<HI>carrieth great weight therewith,</HI> Judg. 11.
26. <HI>proving</HI> Israels <HI>right to the Land
which they possest, and the</HI> Ammonites
<HI>pretended unto:</HI> When Israel dwelt in
Heshbon, and her towns, and in Aroer and
<PB N="130" REF="77"/>
her towns, and in all the cities that be along
by the coas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on three hundred years,
why there fore did ye not recover them within
that time?</P>
<P>In like manner may we urge it against
the adversaries of childrens Baptism. If
the Ancient Church conceived the Bapti∣zing
of Infants an usurpation, and in∣croachment,
injurious and unlawful, why
did not the Church of God in so long a
time cast out the custome which made so
unjust an invasion therein? For S. <HI>Au∣stin</HI>
lived about the fift Century after
Christ▪ when Pedo-baptism was in a
<HI>peaceable passission</HI> of Church practice, and
<HI>Pelagius</HI> himself (sufficiently impudent)
was so modest and ingenious not to deny
the same, though such a denial had con∣duced
much to his own advantage.</P>
<P>I have done, when I have told the Rea∣der
that S. <HI>Austin</HI> brought the <HI>Baptizing of
Infants</HI> as an argument to prove <HI>Original
sin;</HI> and in our age (wherein <HI>Original sin</HI>
is on ought to be granted by all) we al∣ledge
the same as a reason to prove the ne∣cessity
of <HI>Infants Baptism;</HI> and surely so
solid is the argument <HI>reciprocally,</HI> that
<PB N="131" REF="77"/>
both may be firmly grounded on the
same.</P>

<DIV1 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. The Grand Objection, drawn from
the silence of Scripture herein,
Answered.</HEAD>
<P>OUr Adversaries in this point, gain
not a greater advantage against us
amongst common people, then by urging
of that, which indeed we confesse, no li∣teral
precept or practice for Pedo-baptism
in Scripture. By popular improving of
which argument, they not only gain to
themselves the reputation of a strict ad∣herence
to the Word, and will of God,
but also asperse us with the dangerous
imputation of wil-worship, and Popish
inclinations.</P>
<P><HI>Yea, which is more, they threaten us
with a curse pronounced,</HI> Rev. 22. 18.
If any man shall adde unto these things, God
<PB N="132" REF="78"/>
shall adde unto him the plagues that are writ∣ten
in this book.</P>
<P>In Answer whereunto; In the first
place we request our Adversaries to re∣member,
that this place by them cited
out of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> like a two edged
sword, cuts on both sides; for it follow∣eth
immediatly, <HI>And if any shall take away
from the words of the book of this prophesie,
God shall take away his part out of the book
of life.</HI> See here a curse incurr'd, as well
by the defect, as the excesse. And be it
reported to our opposites in this point,
whether denying such consequences,
which infallibly flow from Scripture,
be not taking away from the words, as
well as mutilating, or abstracting the nu∣merical
words from the same.</P>
<P>More particularly I answer; Bapti∣zing
of Infants appears not to such who
only <HI>read the Scripture,</HI> but is plainly visi∣ble
to those who also <HI>search the Scriptures,</HI>
(which <HI>John</HI> 5. 39. is the duty of all judi∣cious
Christians) as by <HI>reasons out of Scri∣pture</HI>
we have made it to appear.</P>
<P>Here will it not be amisse to mind our
adversaries in this point, that they account
<PB N="133" REF="78"/>
themselves concerned in conscience to be∣lieve
and practice many things as necessa∣ry
to salvation, which notwithstanding
are built on the same foundation with the
<HI>Baptism of Infants,</HI> namely not on the ex∣presse
letter of Scripture, but undeniable
consequences arising from the same.</P>
<P>But I conceive such instancing, though
lawful yet not expedient, in this unhappy
juncture of time, <HI>lest Satan get an advan∣tage
over us, for we are not ignorant of his
devices;</HI> and lest such instancing, though
intentionally good in us, prove occasio∣nally
evil to others, by casting scruples
into mens consciences who are quiet,
for the present. There needs more allay∣ing
of old, then raising of new jealousies
in divinity, more needful to settle, then
scatter mens belief, in our dayes, wherein
so many deniers, and more doubters, in
most Articles of Faith.</P>
<P><HI>Indeed the</HI> words of the wise, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12.
11. are as goads or as nailes fastened by the
masters of the assemblies; <HI>But such buil∣ders
must be wary, lest whilest they</HI> fasten
<HI>one</HI> nail <HI>they do not</HI> loosen <HI>another.</HI></P>
<P>However to prove this point, I will
<PB N="134" REF="79"/>
embrace a way, as sure to clear the mat∣ter,
and more safe, not having any dan∣gerous
influence on the times. This may
be done by removing the instance, from
our age; and fixing the same in the time
of Gods Church amongst the Jews▪ Now
none will deny but that <HI>wil-worship,</HI> or ad∣ding
to Gods Word, and his Service, was
as utterly unlawful amongst them, as
amongst us Christians; Yet the most re∣ligious
amongst them, used that as their
bounden duty, and necessary to Gods ser∣vice
which hath no original expresly in
the word of God.</P>
<P>For proof hereof, we shall offer three
things to the readers consideration.</P>
<P>1. Repairing to <HI>Synagogues</HI> amongst the
<HI>Jews,</HI> was a necessary part of Gods
service.</P>
<P>2. The same was not grounded on any
expresse of Scripture.</P>
<P>3. But consequentially on several pla∣ces,
prudentially joyned together.</P>
<P>For the first, It plainly appeareth by
Christs constant practice, <HI>Luke</HI> 4. 16. <HI>And
as his custome was, he went into the syna∣gogue
on the sabbath day.</HI> As sure as a <HI>se∣venth
<PB N="135" REF="79"/>
day</HI> return'd every <HI>week,</HI> so certain∣ly
did our <HI>Saviour</HI> visit the <HI>synagogue.</HI> It is
also evident by the continual custome of
all pious <HI>Jews,</HI> Acts 15. 21. <HI>For Moses of
old time hath in every city them that preach
him, being read in the synagogues every sab∣bath
day.</HI> To destroy these <HI>synagogues</HI> was
accounted a wicked work, witnesse Gods
servants their passionate complaint,
<HI>Psal.</HI> 74. 8.</P>
<P>And again, to erect them was an ac∣ceptible
act, alledged by the <HI>Pharisees</HI> as
an argument to endeer the <HI>Centurion</HI> unto
our <HI>Saviour,</HI> Mat. 8. <HI>he loveth our nation
and hath built us a synagogue.</HI> Lastly, it was
esteemed a heavy punishment, equiva∣lent
to our <HI>excommunication,</HI> John 9. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
<HI>to be put out of the synagogue.</HI></P>
<P>Yet <HI>repairing</HI> to <HI>synagogues,</HI> or the
<HI>erecting</HI> of them was not founded on any
positive precept in Gods word. Indeed
the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> and afterward the <HI>Temple,</HI>
were of Divine <HI>institution</HI> where all <HI>males</HI>
were commanded to present themselves
<HI>thrice</HI> a year; namely at the <HI>Passeover,</HI> the
<HI>feast of Trumpets,</HI> and <HI>Tabernaclos.</HI> But
these <HI>synagogues</HI> (which I may terme <HI>Chap∣pels
<PB N="136" REF="80"/>
of ease,</HI> to the <HI>mother-Temple</HI>) no writ∣ten
law obliged men either to the foun∣ding
or frequenting of them.</P>
<P>Yet that the same was grounded on
rational <HI>deductions</HI> from <HI>Scripture,</HI> may
infallibly be evinced. The text saith,
<HI>Exod.</HI> 20. <HI>Remember thou keep holy the sab∣bath
day.</HI> And reason dictated unto them;
First, that peoples presence at publick
service was a principal part of sanctifying
the <HI>sabbath.</HI> Secondly, that it was im∣possible
for them to repair to the Tem∣ple,
and return to their houses, such
their distance betwixt them. Thirdly,
therefore it was necessary some <HI>room of
receipt</HI> should be provided, sequestred
from common uses, wherein people
should meet together. Lastly, another
text affirming, <HI>That the Priests lips should
preserve knowledge.</HI> It was proper for
them, and the <HI>Levites</HI> dispersed in all <HI>Is∣rael,</HI>
on the <HI>sabbath,</HI> in the <HI>synagogue,</HI> to
read <HI>Moses</HI> to the people. Thus we
find the first <HI>foundation</HI> of <HI>synagagues,</HI> not
on the floating <HI>sands</HI> of humane fancy, but
<HI>firm rock</HI> of Gods <HI>Word;</HI> Though not di∣rectly,
yet by consequence collected from
the same.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="80"/>
In a word, as chambers and houses
were for mens personal &amp; family devoti∣ons,
every day, or as oft as they pleased, &amp;
as the Temple was for the national service
of the <HI>Jews, thrice</HI> every year, so Syna∣gogues
were interposed in the middle be∣twixt
both; for Towns and Cities to
serve God on the Sabbath day: the whole
nation meeting thrice a year, every City
once a week, as private persons every
day, and as oft as they pleased.</P>
<P><HI>Suppose now that a</HI> Priest <HI>amongst the</HI>
Jews, <HI>should presse an obstinate</HI> Jew <HI>to
repair to the</HI> Synagogue, <HI>how might he
have returned this answer according to
the</HI> Principles <HI>of our</HI> Anti-pedo-baptists?
I will go up to the Temple thrice every year,
and there I will not appear empty-handed:
But I will not on the sabbath present my self
in the Synagogue, which meeting is not <HI>JURE
DIVINO,</HI> a meer civil institution, ground∣less
on Gods word; shew me a place of Scri∣pture
injoyning my attendance in a Syna∣gogue,
and I will become your convert; Till
which time I will not only my self refrain my
appearance there, but wil also account it wil∣worship,
in all such as there assemble them∣selves.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="81"/>
I believe not one of our <HI>Adversaries,</HI>
in our present <HI>Controversie,</HI> which are in∣genuous,

amongst the <HI>Jews,</HI> for <HI>refractory</HI> and
<HI>obstinate:</HI> Yea, they will conceive him,

for his schismatical <HI>singularity.</HI>

anger to say unto him, as once <HI>Nathan</HI> to

Baptism, which (though not in so

consequence infallibly founded on Gods
Word.</P>
<P>Now although I freely confesse, no
litteral precedent of <HI>Pedo-baptism</HI> in Scri∣pture,
yet such an one therein is present∣ed
unto us, which although it will not
confute our opposites, it will confirm us
in our judgements; and though it be not
able, <HI>Titus</HI> 1. 9. to <HI>convince the gainsayers,</HI>
yet it will strengthen us in the <HI>Truth:</HI>
When the <HI>principal</HI> is known of him self to
be sufficient, any <HI>security</HI> with him will
be accepted, and the following instance
may be cast in, as <HI>over-weight,</HI> to such
minds, who already have their full mea∣sure
<PB N="139" REF="81"/>
of perswasion in this point.</P>
<P><HI>Namely, when it is said,</HI> Acts 16. 15.
Lydia was Baptized and her houshold: <HI>And
again,</HI> Acts 16. 33. <HI>of the Jaylor,</HI> was ba∣ptized,
he, and all his, straight way. <HI>Also</HI>
1 Cor. 1. 16. I baptized also the houshold
of Stephanas.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Jaylor;</HI> That Children (if he
had any) were comprised under the ex∣pression,
of <HI>all his,</HI> is sufficiently known
by <HI>Satans</HI> interpretation, <HI>Job.</HI> 1. 12. of Gods
commission, <HI>Behold all that he hath is in
thy power;</HI> and Gods consenting thereun∣to,
when permitting him by vertue there∣of,
to destroy all <HI>Jobs children.</HI> And
whereas in the other two instances, the
baptizing of whole <HI>housholds</HI> are exprest,
we must rationally conceive that some in∣fants
were amongst them.</P>
<P>I must confesse I can tell the time,
when there were three housholds of
young folk in the world (and then but
three housholds of young folk in the
world) namely, the three sons of <HI>Noah,</HI>
and his daughters in law in the <HI>Ark,</HI> and
yet not one <HI>Infant</HI> betwixt them all. But
this was a rare and mystical accident:
<PB N="140" REF="82"/>
Again to hold the ballance even, I can
tell the time when in a large Country
every famil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> offered a <HI>first-born,</HI> namely
in <HI>Egypt,</HI> Exod. 12. 3. <HI>There was not a
house where there was not one dead.</HI> Which
S. <HI>Austin</HI> accounts miraculous, God pur∣posely
making every family fruitful, that
it might yield a fit object for his own ju∣stice.</P>
<P>But to wave these instances of extra∣ordinary
dispensation; take three houses
together, indifferently numerous, such
as those of <HI>Lydia,</HI> the <HI>Jaylor,</HI> and <HI>Stepha∣nas</HI>
must be presumed to be, (considering
the garbe of that age, wherein most of
mens moveable wealth consisted in men
and maid servants, with the children be∣gotten
by them) and it is utterly impro∣bable
but some infants will be amongst
them. For a great family is like unto an
Orenge tree, which at the same time hath
buds and blossoms and knobs, and green
and half ripe, and full ripe Orenges on it
all together. I mean, infants, children,
striplings, youths, men of perfect, redu∣ced,
decayed ages.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. An Objection Answered, drawn from
the inability of Infants to repent
and believe.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough we conceive this formerly
satisfied, yet finding it to recur in
our proceedings, we will repeat some∣thing
in our larger Answer thereunto.
We perceive many men infidels in the
point of infants faith, and do not believe
that they do or can believe; whose di∣strust
is principally grounded on these
two causes; partly because infants can∣not
evidence their believing to others,
partly because men cannot conceive the
manner of infants belief.</P>
<P>To the first of these we say, it is inju∣rious
to conclude infants incapable of be∣lieving,
because they cannot manifest it
to others. On the same account, and
with as much truth and right, one might
deny reasonable souls to infants, because
<PB N="142" REF="83"/>
they neither do nor can make any expres∣sion
thereof.</P>
<P>Let matters be measured by outward
appearance, and the young ones of bruit
beasts, seem more rational, (though in∣deed
it be but <HI>natural instinct</HI> in them)
then any childe whatsoever. A Lamb
new wean'd, and Chicken new hatch'd,
know their Dam, can stand, go, do many
things in order to their self-preservation
better then a new-born infant, and yet no
wise man will pronounce them more rea∣sonable
then a childe.</P>
<P>Yea, give me leave a little here to make
an useful digression.</P>
<P>There is no one mistake w<SUP>ch</SUP> hath betray∣ed
mens judgements to more absurdities,
in the points of <HI>Circumcision</HI> and <HI>Baptism,</HI>
then a misapprehension in making the bo∣dy
the standard of the <HI>soul,</HI> and measu∣ring
the same by the proportion thereof.
I am afraid there be too many, who con∣ceive
souls like the pipes in an Organ,
some longer, some shorter, some lesser,
some larger; and fancy degrees of their
dimensions, variable with their ages. So
that a new-born infant should have a smal
<PB N="143" REF="83"/>
soul, a weaned childe a soul somewhat
greater, and so successively, that the souls
of boyes, youths▪ striplings, men, should
gradually exceed one another in great∣nesse.</P>
<P>Yea, I am afraid, that some do farther
extend this their false apprehension, even
to imagine, that at the last day of Judge∣ment,
the souls of such who died in their
infancy shall appear before Gods Tribu∣nal,
little <HI>diminutive Spirits.</HI> This con∣ceit
makes men behold infants with dis∣dainful
eyes, accounting them but <HI>Cy∣phers,</HI>
which signifie but little in nature,
and nothing in Religion. To rectifie their
erroneous judgements, let them know,
that all reasonable souls as created by
God, and first infused into bodies, are e∣qual
in their essence; and that something
extrinsical and adventitious, causeth that
grand disparity betwixt souls in their
natural, moral, and supernatural opera∣tions.</P>
<P>1. In their <HI>natural,</HI> as the wise man,
and the fool are equal in their death,
<HI>Eccles.</HI> 2. 16. so also in their birth, not
only in the manner thereof▪ but in this re∣spect
<PB N="144" REF="84"/>
of an adequation of all the essenti∣als
of their souls. The different tempers
of their brains, and more or lesse perfect
fabrick of their bodies, differenceth them
in their <HI>actions,</HI> who in their <HI>beings</HI> are a∣like.</P>
<P>2. In their <HI>moral.</HI> That which makes
the difference betwixt them is this▪ First,
<HI>education</HI> bestowed on one more then a∣nother,
whereby he arrives at a perfecti∣on
above his equals. Secondly, Habits
of vertues or vices, which one hath ac∣quired
more or lesse then the other.</P>
<P>3. In their <HI>supernatural.</HI> Only the di∣stinction
ariseth from infused graces,
more plentifully conferred on one then
another, and from the holy improve∣ment
thereof, which one, frugal in good∣nesse,
makes above him which is an un∣thrift
therein.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>species,</HI> or <HI>kind</HI> with all spe∣cifical
perfections, are not partial to one
<HI>individuum,</HI> to make that a <HI>favourite</HI> more
then another, but all indifferently partake
thereof: And as amongst the Israelites,
<HI>Exod. 16. 18. all had their just omer of
manna;</HI> so the man, yea the giant, hath
<PB N="145" REF="84"/>
no more of the reasonable soul then the
Dwarfe or the Infant, all share alike in the
essence thereof.</P>
<P>The same may be said of the souls of
<HI>Children and men.</HI> The essentials of a childs
soul are as large and ample to all purposes
and intents, as that of a man. The <HI>house∣keeper</HI>
is the same, though pent for rooms
he cannot make the like entertainment.</P>
<P>Indeed we read, <HI>Rev. 20. 12. I saw the
dead, great and small, stand before God:
and the books were open, &amp;c.</HI> But the <HI>in∣equality</HI>
there, relates not unto their <HI>souls</HI>
and the essences thereof, but to their
conditions wherein they were estated
when alive, <HI>Psal. 49. 2. Low and high,
rich and poor together.</HI></P>
<P>What matters it then, though Chil∣dren
cannot discover, and though men
cannot perceive their belief? It follows
not but that God may see, what a child is
not sensible of in it self nor others in it.
God judgeth not as man judgeth, nor
doth he see as man seeth. Man only be∣holdeth
the out-side of childrens opera∣tions,
loaden with defects arising from
their bodily indisposition; Gods sees the
<PB N="146" REF="85"/>
heart, and (what mainly moveth therein)
the soul, and (age being meetly <HI>circum∣stantial</HI>
and <HI>accidental</HI> thereunto) it ma∣keth
no odds at all in Gods discovery
therein, who can see in them that <HI>beliefe,</HI>
which we cannot behold.</P>
<P>But suppose the worst that Infants nei∣ther
do nor can believe, yet this cannot
be a bar to their Covenanting in Baptism,
no more then it was to the Jewish children
in Circumcision. Their tender age knew
not what a Covenant with God meant.
Nor had they feeling how thereby they
were engaged to keep the Law; Nor un∣derstood
what did belong to the inward
Circumcision of the heart, yet were
vouchsafed to be <HI>foederati cum Deo;</HI> So it
can be no bar to the children of Christian
parents to receive a seal of covenantship
with Christ, albeit they at that time want
reason to know the nature of a Covenant,
nor how they put on Christ, nor what it is
to believe, and to be washed clean from
sin. There is no more absurdity or incon∣sequence
upon one then the other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. Other Objections Answered.</HEAD>
<P>THe Grand Objections thus cleared,
such as remain will be easily satisfied,
as followeth.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> It is pride and presumption
for any to account themselves fitter and
forwarder for Baptism, then Christ him∣self
was. Now Christ himself was not
Baptized, <HI>Luke 3. 23. till he began to be a∣bout
thirty years of Age,</HI> none ought there∣fore
to prevent that date of time in their
Baptism.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Though <HI>Christ</HI> was not <HI>bapti∣zed</HI>
till <HI>thirty</HI> years of Age, remember he
was <HI>circumcised,</HI> Luke 2. 21. on the eighth
day. Secondly, <HI>Christ</HI> was not Bapti∣zed
out of necessity, (needing no soul-physick,
who had no soul-sicknesse) but a
voluntary design to <HI>Baptize baptism,</HI> and to
give a soveraign vertue thereunto. Third∣ly,
Many of <HI>Christs</HI> actions were for our
instruction, not imitation. Christ pre∣sently
<PB N="148" REF="86"/>
after his <HI>Baptism</HI> fasted fourty days,
and fourty nights, which the urgers of this
argument will not pretend unto.</P>
<P>Discover we here a corruption too
rife in all our hearts: Such is the froward∣nesse
of our crosse-grain'd nature, that
we lazily stand still and admire such acti∣ons
of <HI>Christ,</HI> which we ought to follow,
and vainly strive to follow those his acti∣ons
which we ought to admire. Oh that
we all would learn of him, <HI>Mat. 11. 29.
to be meek and lowly of heart,</HI> to think
more humbly of our selves, and more
charitably of others; I say would we
could <HI>learn this thing of Christ,</HI> and leave
such things to Christ, which were perso∣nal
in him, and not precedential to us.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> Had <HI>Christ</HI> in his judgement, al∣lowed,
and approved the <HI>baptizing</HI> of <HI>In∣fants,</HI>
surely he would have baptized such
children, which, <HI>Mark</HI> 10. were brought
unto him, whereas his omission thereof,
plainly argues <HI>Christs</HI> disaffection to the
same.</P>
<P><HI>Answ. Christ</HI> in his own person Bapti∣zed
<PB N="149" REF="86"/>
none at all, as we read, <HI>John</HI> 4. 2. an
office improper for him to perform. How
unfit had it been for our Saviour thus to
Baptize those Infants, <HI>I Jesus Baptize this
Infant into the Name of Jesus?</HI> If S. <HI>Paul</HI> ac∣counted
it beneath his <HI>place</HI> to <HI>Baptize,
1 Cor. 1. 17. For Christ sent me not to Ba∣ptize,
but to preach the Gospel:</HI> How much
was the <HI>ministration</HI> thereof too <HI>mean</HI> for
our <HI>Saviour?</HI> Indeed <HI>Christ</HI> came in all
humility, to be a pattern of patience unto
us, and condescended to mean imploy∣ments,
as (<HI>John</HI> 13. 5.) <HI>the washing of his
Disciples feet;</HI> yet alwayes he observed,
(though not <HI>state</HI>) decency in all his acti∣ons,
and stood much, though not on the
pomp, on the propriety of what he per∣formed;
as here in his declining to Baptize
any. When a <HI>Lord</HI> hath <HI>signed</HI> a <HI>Letter</HI>
with his <HI>own hand,</HI> it is usual with him to
consign the sealing thereof to his <HI>Secretary</HI>
or some other servant; so when Christ
had instituted Baptism, and with his own
hand confirmed the soveraign vertue of
that Sacrament, it well befitted his digni∣ty
to command, and his disciples duty to
perform the administration thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="87"/>
<HI>Object.</HI> Grant that Christ, for the rea∣sons
by you alledged, concluded it unfit∣ting
for himself to Baptize those Infants,
yet had he approved <HI>Pedo-baptism</HI> in his
own judgement, he would have designed
some of his Disciples for the doing there∣of.
This not done, we may infallibly in∣fer
his dislike of the same.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> A negative argument of this na∣ture
is of no validity. <HI>No mention is made
of these Infants Baptizing.</HI> Ergo, <HI>they were
not Baptized:</HI> we may observe a grada∣tion
in the Evangelists relating this story,
<HI>Luke</HI> 18. 17. mentioneth their blessing
only without any manner of gesture at all
used by our Saviour unto them. <HI>Mat.</HI> 19.
15. only takes notice that Christ <HI>laid his
hands on them, and departed thence,</HI> Mark
10. 16. registreth all three remarkable
actions, <HI>He took them up in his arms, laid
his hands on them, and blessed them;</HI> Saint
<HI>John</HI> addeth, <HI>chap.</HI> 21. 21. And there are
also many other things which Jesus did,
<HI>which are not written,</HI> amongst which for
ought appears to the contrary, the Bapti∣zing
of these infants might be one of them.
<PB N="151" REF="87"/>
However grant they were not formally
and solemnly Baptized, yet we may ob∣serve
Baptism consisteth of two parts, the
<HI>application of water,</HI> which we may call
the <HI>body,</HI> and <HI>the impression of the blessing,</HI>
which we may terme the <HI>soul</HI> of Baptism.
The later which indeed was the principal,
was here conferr'd on babes, which shews
them capable of the other, as being the
lesse Spiritual part of the Sacrament.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> Sacraments ought not to be
prostituted to profane persons, <HI>Mat. 7. 6.
cast not pearls before swine;</HI> But many In∣fants
are impious and profane, therefore
they ought not to be Baptized.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This Objection may with e∣qual
advantage, be also enforced against
the Baptizing of men arrived at years of
discretion, many of them are profane in
their hearts, though they cunningly dis∣semble
the same. Hypocrites will never
be kept out of the Church; Be the doors
thereof barr'd and bolted never so close,
they will creep in at the windows; yea,
through the chinks and crevesses thereof:
<PB N="152" REF="88"/>
As for Infants, Baptism ought to be deny∣ed
unto them if they manifested any pro∣fanenesse:
Till which time charity com∣mands
us to believe them not <HI>Swine,</HI> but
Lambs, and capable of the Sacrament.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> Children are unable to discharge
an essential requisite to Baptism: Seeing

Christs own Commission, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19,
20.</P>
<Q><P>1. Go ye therefore and teach all Nations.</P>
<P>2. Baptizing in the Name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the
holy Ghost, &amp;c.</P>
<P>3. Teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I have commanded you.</P></Q>
<P>Here we have the safe and sure posi∣tion
of Baptism as God himself ordered it:
It is placed in the middle betwixt adou∣ble
<HI>teaching,</HI> one in the <HI>front,</HI> and ano∣ther
in the <HI>rear</HI> thereof; a <HI>precedent teach∣ing</HI>
must usher in Baptism, and the <HI>subse∣quent
teaching</HI> must afterwards wait upon
it; Children therefore being incapable
of this praevious and preparative teaching
are incapable also of Baptism which de∣pendeth
thereupon.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="88"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> The method prescribed here
by Christ to his Apostles, was only to be
used by them in their preaching to pure
Pagans grown up to be men, and this
their commission properly extended unto
the Gentiles, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Going therefare,</HI> that is in
due time leaving this land of <HI>Pale∣stine,</HI>
(wherein you live for the pre∣sent)
when you shall be accomplish∣ed
with the Spirit, make your pro∣gresse
into far distant parts, and there
<HI>teach.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>All Nations,</HI> the word pro∣perly
importing Heathens formerly
unacquainted with God &amp; his word.
Such people must first be taught be∣fore
they may be Baptized.</P>
<P>This text therefore may justly be char∣ged
against the <HI>Papists</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> where
thousands of Natives were cruelly driven
with whips to the Font to be baptized,
before they were ever Catechized in any
rudiments of Christian Religion, but
cannot at all be objected against the ba∣ptizing
of infants, the children of Chri∣stian
<PB N="154" REF="89"/>
parents; the teaching of Heathen
(and those of full age) being only intend∣ed
in this command.</P>
<P>Thus have we given the true and genu∣ine
sence of these words, <HI>Go ye therefore
and teach all Nations baptizing them, &amp;c.</HI>
However we will not omit another in∣terpretation
which godly Divines give
thereof, consonant to Scripture phrase.
They render the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>make
disciples,</HI> in which sence they maintaine
that infants are capable of <HI>disciple-ship,</HI>
and may be inlisted therein. For
proof hereof they produce <HI>Acts 15. 10.
why tempt ye God, to put a yoak upon the
neck of the disciples.</HI> Now this <HI>yoak</HI> was
Circumcision, which some stickled so zea∣lously
for, and these <HI>disciples</HI> were in∣fants
eight days old on whom that Sacra∣ment
was fastened. In this sence children
may be <HI>taught,</HI> that is, <HI>discipled</HI> before
baptism, and so the text nothing favour∣ing
the purpose of the objectors, though
I rather adhere to the former answer, as
most proper to the text.</P>
<P>Here will it be seasonable to interpose
an admonition to parents. You see in
<PB N="155" REF="89"/>
<HI>Christs commission</HI> to his Disciples, the
Divine method in dispensation of ordi∣nances
to Ethnicks: 1. Teach. 2. Baptize.
3. And Teach. But towards the children
of Christian parents, it is, 1. Baptize.
2. Teach and teach. What is wanting in
the <HI>precedent,</HI> Teach, let it be supplied
over and above in the <HI>consequent Teach,</HI>
to make amends for the <HI>preparatory Teach,</HI>
before baptism (whereof infants age is
incapable) let there be a <HI>duplicate,</HI> dou∣ble
your endeavours in the <HI>confirming
Teach,</HI> so soon as they shal be able to learn.
Line upon line, Precept upon precept▪ here
a little, and there a little, dropping in in∣struction
as the vessel is able to receive.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Scripture, (as we have formerly
observed (always signifieth a sucking child:
Now it is said of <HI>Timothy,</HI> 2 Tim. 3. 15.
that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>from a childe</HI> he had known

<P><PB N="156" REF="90"/>
Now let parents think to cast off their
care on those who are <HI>Sponsores</HI> or <HI>Susce∣ptores,</HI>
Godfathers to their children: as
I deny not an ancient and useful institution
of them in the Primitive times, so can I
not but bemoan, that our age hath turned
the same into a formality or Christian
complement: <HI>Judah</HI> said to <HI>Simeon,</HI> Judg.
1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Come up with me into my lot, and I
likewise will go up with thee into thy lot;</HI> So
men exchange and barter this office be∣twixt
them, <HI>answer thou for my child to day,
and I on like occasion will answer for thine,</HI>
the <HI>civility</HI> is discharged by both, when the
<HI>christianity</HI> too oft is performed by nei∣ther:
I look therfore on Godfathers gene∣rally,
as on brasse Andirons, standing more
for sight then service, ornament, then use,
whiles the main weight and stresse in per∣forming
the promise, must lie on the pa∣rents
themselves do discharge, in <HI>teaching</HI>
and <HI>teaching</HI> their Baptized Infants.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> The deaf and dumb are not
to be admitted to Baptism, though adult
and full grown, because of their inability
to give an account of their faith: But chil∣dren
<PB N="157" REF="90"/>
are ranked in the same form with the
deaf and dumb, therefore they ought not
to be admitted unto Baptism: This is the
thirty sixth▪ and last argument, (amongst
many frivolous ones) alledged by the
Transilvanian Anabaptists, against the
baptizing of infants, placing, belike, much
confidence therein, to <HI>hem</HI> and conclude
all the rest.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Both propositions are false:
First, If the dumb and deaf can with signs
and gestures (which nature hath made in
them marvelously expressive) evidence
and testifie their faith, they must be ad∣mitted
to Baptism, as the third Councel
of <HI>Carthage</HI> did decide. Secondly, Chil∣dren
are not in the same, but a better con∣dition:
Those <HI>Mutes</HI> after maturity, can
never recover their hearing and speech
but by miracle, whereas Infants naturally
are capable of both in due season.</P>
<P>We read <HI>Mark</HI> 7. 32. that they brought
one to our Saviour that was deaf, and <HI>had
an impediment in his speech,</HI> not that he
was only troubled with a lisping, or sta∣mering,
but that he was directly dumb,
<PB N="158" REF="91"/>
as appears by the peoples acclamations,
<HI>vers.</HI> 37. when the miracle was wrought
upon him, <HI>he maketh both the deaf to hear,
and the dumb to speak;</HI> and generally those
infirmities are twins, going both together;
yet Christ discovered in him a sufficiency
of faith, such as he was pleased to accept
for his bodily cure.</P>
<P>How more comfortably then may
Christian parents presume that God will
graciously behold their Infants, who
though deaf (that is not hearing to under∣stand)
and dumb, not able to speak, may in
processe of time arrive to the use of both.
That God I say, who when with a favou∣rable
eye he looks for goodnesse in any
heart, findeth and fixeth it there by his
favourable looking for it.</P>
<P>Besides, such persons defective in their
senses, (though full in age) may, <HI>ponere
obicem,</HI> by their <HI>prave dispositions</HI> put a
<HI>bar</HI> or <HI>obstacle,</HI> wilfully to defeat the ef∣fect
of Baptism, and their right thereun∣to.</P>
<P>This cannot be done by infants; their
very worst enemies who deny them <HI>actu∣al</HI>
faith, yea, any <HI>dispositive degree</HI> there∣unto,
<PB N="159" REF="91"/>
dare not charge them with what I
may terme <HI>positive infidelity.</HI> As for ori∣ginal
sin, that can be no bar, because Ba∣ptism
was designed by God for the wash∣ing
away thereof.</P>
<P>God is no Mountebank, his <HI>receipts</HI> do
the deed for which they were prescribed:
Indeed if the <HI>patient,</HI> (besides that disease
for the cure whereof Gods <HI>receipt</HI> is given
him) shall by his own intemperance wil∣fully
contract a new malady, no wonder
if this Physick fall short of the cure for
which it was intended; But infants, not
being able to draw on themselves any
other sin, we cannot but in charity be∣lieve
their undoubted right unto, and be∣nefit
by baptism.</P>

<HI>Quaternion.</HI></P>
<P>The first are the Children of <HI>Profane
Parents,</HI> living within the pale of the
Church, such as I may sorrowfully terme
<HI>Pagan Christians;</HI> Christians by their pro∣fession;
<HI>Pagans</HI> by their notorious visible
debauched conversation: Otherwise I
confesse the words <HI>pious</HI> and <HI>profane</HI> in our
modern <HI>Religious Canting,</HI> made by ma∣ny
words of <HI>party</HI> and <HI>interest,</HI> to cry up
or decry such who in <HI>private opinions,</HI> or
<PB N="161" REF="92"/>
<HI>civil concernments</HI> agree with, or dissent
from them; The question is if such pro∣fane
Parents <HI>alone</HI> tender their children
to baptism, and desire the same, whether
or no ought they to be admitted there∣unto?
I say <HI>alone,</HI> for if a good Grand∣father
or Grand-mother (the mediate
Parent) survive, conjoyn with them in
such a <HI>tender,</HI> the case is sufficiently clear,
that Baptism cannot be denied unto it.</P>
<P>I answer. If any one, related as kin∣red
or friend to this childe, will under∣take
conditionally (<HI>viz.</HI> if he himself live,
and God blesse his endeavours, farther
then which, parents themselves ought
not to promise and cannot perform) for
the education thereof, as <HI>Judah</HI> in another
case, for the <HI>bringing up</HI> of his brother
<HI>Benjamin</HI> out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> Gen. 43. 9. <HI>I will
be surety for him, at my hands shalt thou re∣quire
him,</HI> baptism ought not to be denied
unto it.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> But suppose such an under∣taker
cannot be found, seeing <HI>he who ha∣teth</HI>
[especially Spiritual] <HI>suretiship is
sure,</HI> Prov. 11. 15. and one may justly
<PB N="162" REF="93"/>
suspect according to the proverb, <HI>Ezek.</HI>
16. 44. <HI>As is the mother, so is the daughter;</HI>
that such a childe will follow the vicious
examples and dispositions of his parents.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Here I desire the Reader to call
to mind (to spare my repetition thereof)
what formerly Chap. 4. we have written
of wicked mens sharing in the <HI>foederal
right</HI> to Circumcision. Let him also con∣sider
the Apostles words, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 16.
<HI>If the root be holy so are the branches.</HI> Now
the <HI>root</HI> we know is <HI>under ground,</HI> and <HI>un∣seen;</HI>
and, although the immediate pa∣rents
be bad, yet charity commands us to
believe, that, some generations removed,
the ancestors of this child (whom Divine
Providence <HI>appointing the bounds of habi∣tation,
Acts</HI> 17. 26. would have born
within the <HI>pale</HI> of the Church) might be
holy and religious. We have a saying,
<HI>Every beggar is descended from some King,
and every King is descended from some beg∣gar.</HI>
Truer it is, that (if the pedegrees
of people were strictly examined) <HI>every
pious person is extracted from some profane,
and every profane from some pious ancestor;</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="93"/>
a motive in my opinion not to deny ba∣ptism
to the childe of bad parents if de∣siring
the same. Passe we from them to
<HI>Bastards,</HI> against whose baptizing some
object.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> Bastards amongst the Jews
were not to be Circumcised, which may
thus be proved: It was fashionable for
the mother at her purification, to present
her Circumcised son in the Temple to the
Lord, as may appear by the example of
the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> Luke 2. 22. But Bastards,
<HI>Deut.</HI> 23. 2. were forbidden entrance in∣to
the congregation, unto the tenth gene∣ration:
Therefore they were not Circum∣cised.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> By the <HI>not entring into the con∣gregation
of the Lord,</HI> is meant, <HI>munus pub∣licum
in populo Dei ne gerito; let him not
bear office in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> people of God.</HI> Indeed
<HI>Jephthah,</HI> though the <HI>son of an harlot,
Judg.</HI> 11. 2. was chosen a <HI>General,</HI> because
necessity constrained it; and Military of∣fices;
(where valour alone was a suffici∣ent
qualification) were not confined to
<PB N="164" REF="94"/>
the regularity requisite to religious em∣ployments:
Otherwise certain it is, first,
that wantonnesse in this kinde was too
frequent amongst the Jews; our com∣mon
expression to <HI>commit folly</HI> with a
woman, being borrowed from <HI>Thamars</HI>
words to <HI>Amnon,</HI> 2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 13. 12. <HI>do not
thou this folly.</HI> Secondly, that bastards
so begotten, were excluded Circumcisi∣on,
is what no wise or learned author
durst ever affirm.</P>
<P>More particularly: If the parents of
bastards publickly professe their peni∣tence
to the congregation, they are re∣mitted
to the same estate they were in
before the fault committed, and their
children to be held as of unstain'd ex∣traction.
Far be it from me to scatter
any thing, which may occasion the least
countenance to wantonnesse in any. What
said the rest of the Israelites, to the Reu∣benites?
<HI>Josh.</HI> 22. 17. <HI>Is the iniquity of
Peor too little for us, from which we are not
cleansed until this day?</HI> that they should
contract (as they suspected) the guilt of a
new idolatry. Is <HI>original</HI> sin too little to
condemn a child, but that parents must
<PB N="165" REF="94"/>
<HI>double-hatch</HI> their children with guilt of
their adulterous nativity? However, for
the comfort of the penitent, know that
only <HI>four females</HI> are mentioned in our
Saviours pedegree, and all of them <HI>stig∣matized.</HI>
1. <HI>Thamar</HI> incestuous. 2. <HI>Ra∣hab</HI>
an harlot. 3. <HI>Ruth</HI> a Moabitesse (and
therefore a dog, no sheep of <HI>Israel:</HI>) And
4<SUP>ly</SUP> the wife of <HI>Ʋriah,</HI> certainly an adulte∣resse,
and too probably privy to the mur∣der
of her husband. Thus Christ came, as
for sinners, so from sinners, &amp; those noted
ones, for uncleannesse, whose children
notwithstanding were undoubtedly Cir∣cumcised.
As no <HI>bar of bastardy</HI> can bolt
out an infants right to the Sacrament,
nor his benefit, by it if God will have it en∣ter
therein. Proceed we from these, to
<HI>exposed children,</HI> left on bulkes and ben∣ches
by their parents deserting them,
whose title to baptism seems doubtful,
and difficult to many on this account.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> The Children of those who
are worse then infidels may not be bapti∣zed.
But the parents of these children are
worse then infidels, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 8. because,
<PB N="166" REF="95"/>
<HI>not providing for them of their own house.</HI>
Therefore they ought not to be bapti∣zed.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Such who out of carelesnesse
or cruelty, wilfully refuse to maintain
their own, are in this particular act mo∣rally
worse then infidels (of whom many
high Christians fall short in civil perfor∣mances;)
yea, worse then birds, and
beasts, which hatch, and suckle their own
young ones. Yet they are not in a spiri∣tual
capacity worse then infidels, as if
thereby they had forfeited their Sacra∣mental
right for them, and theirs. Be∣sides,
charity herein commands us to pre∣sume
the best. That these parents are
not with the <HI>Ostrich, hardned against their
young ones, as though they were not theirs;</HI>
but that there being a long combate be∣twixt
their industry, and poverty, the
latter at last got the conquest; and they
thereby forced to leave their children to
a general providence. An act which may
rather be in some sort excused, then de∣fended;
yea, the cause thereof rather pit∣tied,
then the deed it self in any sort ex∣cused.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="95"/>
Say not, such poor parents, over∣burthened
with charge of children,
ought to complain to the officers of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Church, who (no doubt) on the
discovery of their sad condition, would
order their relief. Yea, it is suspici∣ous
the cause of their poverty is not
excusable, whose pride is so damna∣ble,
that they would not seasonably
confesse the same to such, who might,
and ought to be helpful unto them.
All this is confessed, with many more
<HI>grains of guilt,</HI> which might be cast
into the <HI>scale</HI> of the parents; but of
no weight on the other side, against
the children, and therefore ought not
to hinder their baptism, I mean con∣ditionally,
in case they were former∣ly
<HI>baptized.</HI> Here I will not instance
in <HI>exposed children,</HI> who afterwards
have proved eminent instruments of
Gods glory in the Church and Com∣mon-wealth;
so that, <HI>Psal. 27. 10.
when their father and mother forsook
them, then the Lord took them up;</HI>
yea, advanced them to high prefer∣ment:
<PB N="168" REF="96"/>
I say, I purposely forbear
such instancing, lest the remembrance
of the meannesse of their original,
should any whit abate our deserved
respect unto their memories.</P>
<P>It is fashionable in such cases (e∣specially
in popular places) for the
whole parish to be <HI>loco parentis,</HI> and
to be interpreted as the parent, for the
education of such exposed children.
For my own part I had rather bring
oyl to, then cast water on any chari∣table
design. Yet give me leave, on∣ly
to admonish such to take heed, that
that be not neglected of all, which is
expected of many. It is the argument
urged by <HI>Aristotle</HI> against <HI>Plato</HI>'s fancy,
that all children should be brought up
by the care, and at the cost general of
all alike, that what is every mans work
is no mans work; and it is to be fear∣ed,
the catechizing, and instructing
such children, will not effectually be
done by any, where all are equally
engaged unto it, except some be emi∣nently
and particularly designed for
the same.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="96"/>
Children of Pagans <HI>remain, taken
from them when infants: What the o∣pinion
of the Ancients was herein, we
may learn from</HI> Fulgentius, De Veritate
praedest. lib. 1. <HI>who saith,</HI> Parvulum paren∣tibus
infidelibus violenter ablatum, aut
furto surreptum, si ad sanctum baptis∣mum
quorumlibet Sanctorum pia chari∣tate
producatur, &amp; mox ut baptizatus
fuerit de hac vita discedat, factum esse
haeredem Dei, &amp; cohaeredem Christi.
That a little child violently taken, or se∣cretly
stolen from infidel parents; if by
the pious charity of any Saints, it be
brought to holy baptism, and by and by
so soon as it hath been baptized depart
this life, is made the heir of God, and co∣heir
of Christ.</P>
<P>However, because some may think
this goes too far, and that a difference
ought to be made betwixt children
of Christian parents, who have (as
<HI>Tertullian</HI> phraseth it) <HI>Seminis praeroga∣tivam,
The priviledge of the seed whence
they spring;</HI> and those of meer Hea∣thens:
And because all things ought
<PB N="170" REF="97"/>
to be done in the Church, <HI>decently and
in order;</HI> it is fittest and safest, that the
baptizing of such infants be deferred,
till they be able in their own persons to
give an account of their faith. Such
cautious deferring of the Sacrament,
offereth no injury, nor occasioneth
any danger unto them, but will tend
at last to their greater advantage.</P>
<P>When Mr <HI>Cranmer,</HI> (after Arch-Bishop
of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and Martyr) was
appointed in <HI>Cambridge, Poser extra∣ordinary</HI>
of the sufficiency of such who
Commenced in Divinity; he denyed
many their Degrees for want of com∣petent
ability for the same: Some of
these, compelled by their repulse to
an harder study of the Scriptures, ar∣rived
at eminency afterwards (and by
name Mr <HI>Barret</HI> of <HI>Norwich</HI>) and would
commend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Fox</HI> Marty∣rol. p. 1860.</NOTE> and extoll
Dr <HI>Cranmer,</HI> who by
putting them back, put
them forward to attain a better degree
of knowledge, and perfection. If the
Church bestows her <HI>negative voice</HI> on
<PB N="171" REF="97"/>
such children of Pagans, refusing to
baptize them till responsible for them∣selves;
they will have cause hereafter
to blesse God, and thank the Church
for the same, when the principles of
Religion shall be more firmly fasten∣ed,
and the practice thereof more
kindly ripened in them by such for∣bearance
of Baptism.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. Two historical Observations, on
the Adversaries of Infants
Baptism.</HEAD>
<P>IT is worth our observation to con∣sider,
who was the <HI>author</HI> from
whom, and what the <HI>company</HI> with
whom this opposition of Infants Ba∣ptism
began</P>
<P>For the first; I find one <HI>Balthasar
Pacimontanus,</HI> about the year of our
Lord, 1527. first spreading this do∣ctrine:
pretending, belike, that he
fetcht the first principles thereof out
of <HI>Luthers</HI> works, which gave <HI>Luther</HI>
the occasion to writ against him,
justly to assert himself herein. This
<HI>Balthasar</HI> was afterward burnt at <HI>Vien∣na</HI>
for an Heretick.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="98"/>
I cannot learn what heretical opi∣nions
this man maintained, that the
demerit of them should deserve death.
If it were only for denying infants ba∣ptism,
I conceive all the spectators at
his suffering bound to have endeavour∣ed
by their tears to have quenched the
fire. Indeed I would have all of his
opinion <HI>burnt;</HI> but how? as <HI>Luther</HI>
saith, <HI>Igne charitatis:</HI> and as <HI>Solomon</HI>
said long before him▪ <HI>Prov. 25. 22. By
heaping coals of fire on their heads,</HI> of
meeknesse, and moderation, if in any
competent time they might be re∣claimed.
Possibly <HI>Vienna,</HI> being the
Emperours Court, where the Roman
faction managed all at their pleasure,
some mixture of Protestant Doctrine
in his opinions might sharpen the rage
of Papists against him.</P>
<P>But it is more then suspicious, that
not this, but the complication of other
pernicious tenents caused his executi∣on.
The rather because we find, that
the Transylvanian Ministers, <HI>Anno</HI>
1567. set forth two books, one against
<PB N="174" REF="99"/>
the <HI>Trinity,</HI> the other against the <HI>In∣carnation
of Christ;</HI> and at the end of
both added their <HI>thirty six arguments</HI>
against the baptizing of infants.</P>
<P>Men who are dark, and conceal'd
in themselves, lying at a close guard,
are best discovered by their society;
<HI>Company</HI> is the clearest comment on
the text of a reserved person. True, this
held not in our Saviour, being piety
it self, though conversing with Pub∣licans
and sinners, for whose conver∣sion
he was sent, and ordained. But
generally it fails not but that men con∣jecture,
and conclude the inclinations
of persons, from those with whom
they constantly associate. Would it
not therefore make any conscientious
Christians, justly wary to entertain
the doctrine of Anti-pedo-baptism,
when he sees it ushered into the world,
with two such hideous and hellish He∣resies
going before it?</P>
<P>Some will say, there was no
affinity in kindred, or familiarity
in acquaintance, nor dependency
of interest, but a meer casual co∣incidency
<PB N="175" REF="99"/>
betwixt these <HI>three Treatises.</HI>
Who knows not, but an honest man
may on the road accidentally travel
with strangers, whose faces he never
saw before, without any <HI>privity</HI> to
their bad designs? For my own part
I was never bred in the <HI>school of Tyran∣nus,</HI>
and am loath to load the doctrine
of <HI>Anti-pedo-baptism,</HI> with the bur∣den
of more badnesse then it hath of it
self; yet give me leave to say, it may &amp;
ought be <HI>taken on suspicion,</HI> because
coming in the company of two such
Blasphemous books from the same
Authors; yea, let it be <HI>confined,</HI> and
<HI>kept in durance,</HI> until it hath cleared
its own innocency, which must be
done by shewing better <HI>testimonials</HI>
for the truth thereof, then any
which hitherto it hath produced.</P>
<P>My prayers shall be, that what is
said of <HI>Jeconiah, Jer. 22. 30. write ye
this man childless.</HI> So this error in de∣nying
baptism to infants, may not be
<HI>procreative</HI> of any other in the main∣tainers
thereof. May he, who binds
<PB N="176" REF="100"/>
the Sea in a <HI>girdle of sand,</HI> and saith to
the waves thereof, <HI>Job 38. 11. Hitherto
shalt thou come, and no farther;</HI> erect
strong rampiers to bound and bank
the defenders hereof, that here they
may stop▪ stay, stand still, without
making their progresse into worse,
and more dangerous errours. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Phil. 3. 15.</BIBL>
<Q>And if in any thing, ye be otherwise minded,
God shall reveal even this unto you.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>1. <SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is no less pleasant than pro∣fitable
for a Christian soul
seriously to consider the ad∣mirable
unity and comforta∣ble
concord which was betwixt the Saints
and Servants of God in the infancy of the
Church, after <HI>Christs</HI> ascension, <HI>Acts 1. 14.
These all continued with one accord.</HI> Acts 2. 1.
<PB N="2" REF="101"/>
They were all with one accord in one place. 2. 46
Continuing daily with one accord in the
Temple. <HI>So again,</HI> Acts 4 24. Lift up their
voice to God with one accord. <HI>And again,</HI>
Acts 5. 12. All with one accord in <HI>Solomons</HI>
porch.</P>
<P>2. Some perchance may impute this
their unity to the paucity and fewness of the
Professours of the Gospel in that age. It is
no wonder (will they say) if an handfull of
men did agree, which is impossible now a∣days
in the numerosity of so many Christi∣ans.
But know, that even then there were
enough, even amongst the <HI>three thousand</HI>
Converts made by S. <HI>Peters</HI> Sermon, to
furnish out (allowing a <HI>Leader,</HI> and <HI>Follower</HI>
to each Faction) <HI>fifteen hundred</HI> several <HI>Di∣visions.</HI>
No, it was not their small number,
but the vigorous acting of the Spirit of
unity on their Hearts which kept them in
such agreement. God foreseeing, <HI>Rents</HI>
would quickly ruine his Infant Church,
bound them together the faster in the <HI>hand</HI>
of <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P>3. But alas, this unity was too fine ware
<PB N="3" REF="101"/>
to have much measure thereof. The virgi∣nity
of it was first lost, <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 1. about a
money-matter, (and money we know parteth
the dearest friends, many differences arising
about the question, what should be <HI>jure di∣vino,</HI>
and what <HI>jure humano,</HI> but more about
<HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum</HI>) the unequal [conceived]
distribution of the <HI>collection-money</HI> for the
Poor. The Heathen Philosopher bitterly in∣veighed
against the <HI>Schismatical Number</HI> of
<HI>Two,</HI> which durst make the first defection,
and departure from the intireness of <HI>One.</HI>
But we have too just cause to bemoan this
unhappy difference, which first <HI>brake the
Ranks,</HI> made the first jarring in the musick
of the Primitive Church.</P>
<P>4. The second sad difference was, <HI>Acts</HI>
15. 1. about the unseasonable and unreason∣able
pressing of <HI>Circumcision,</HI> by some as
absolutely necessary to salvation, <HI>Except ye
be circumcised after the manner of</HI> Moses, <HI>ye
cannot be saved.</HI></P>
<P>5. The third dolefull falling out, we
finde in the same Chapter, <HI>v.</HI> 39. being so
much the sadder than either of the former,
<PB N="4" REF="102"/>
because happening not btwixt infirm and
ignorant (though pious) people, but those,
who for grace and knowledg were most emi∣nent,
and formerly had been familiar and
intimate bosom-friends, <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas.</HI>
Then the Devil endeavoured to deal with
Gods Church, as <HI>Sampson</HI> served the Tem∣ple
of <HI>Dagon, Judg.</HI> 16. 29. <HI>He took hold of
the two middle pillars, upon which the house
stood, and on which it was born up,</HI> and no
doubt by shaking and clashing them toge∣ther,
had shattered the whole Fabrick, had
not divine providence prevented it, sanctify∣ing
their <HI>division</HI> into the <HI>multiplication</HI> of
the Gospel.</P>
<P>6. It is enough to satisfie, (if not to sur∣fet)
us, to insist onely on this <HI>first three,</HI>
these <HI>original</HI> dissentions in the Primitive
Church, which ever since have too truly
been copied out. As lately in the <HI>Acts of
the Apostles,</HI> we often met, <HI>with one accord,
with one accord,</HI> with one accord; so look∣ing
into their <HI>Acts,</HI> who (though no Apo∣stles)
are <HI>Christians▪</HI> we more frequently finde,
<HI>with many discords, with many discords, with
many discords,</HI> such their dissenting in opini∣ons,
<PB N="5" REF="102"/>
and disagreeing in affections. It will
therefore be a seasonable subject for us to
treat of, how we ought to behave our selves
to such Brethren as for the present dissent
from us in judgment, and what hope we may
justly conceive of their future agreement
with us. Hearken herein to my Text, out
of which we may extract, not onely counsel
what to do, but also comfort what to hope
in this kinde. <HI>And if in any thing, ye be o∣therwise
minded, God shall reveal even this
unto you.</HI></P>
<P>7. The words, (though short in them∣selves)
contain the <HI>Uuhappiness,</HI> and the
happiness, of the Servants of God. And
know to your comfort, the Unhappiness is
first, and the Happiness comes after, to close
and conclude all; and <HI>and all is well, that ends
well,</HI> yea the unhappiness is but <HI>suppositive,</HI>
what <HI>may be;</HI> the happiness <HI>positive,</HI> what
<HI>shall be.</HI> The unhappiness, is this, a possibili∣ty
of good men in matters of religion, to be
otherwise minded one from another. The
Happiness is a gracious Promise, that such
who erroniously dissent, from their Brethren,
shall in due time agree when the Truth shall
be revealed to them.</P>

<P>8. <HI>Ye,</HI> that is, literally, <HI>ye Philippians</HI> in
the pale of Gods Church. However let us
give this <HI>Ye</HI> the true dimensions thereof.
Let us not extend it too far as to include Pa∣gans
or such pretended Christians, as wil∣lingly
overturn all the foundations of Reli∣gion.
Nor let us contract this <HI>Ye</HI> too small,
as to confine it to the <HI>Philippians</HI> alone,
which reacheth all Christians, though dis∣senting
in the superstructures, consenting
in the Fundamentalls of Religion. If there
be a Ye or a Your in all this Epistle, to the
<HI>Philippians</HI> (as Chap 4. 5. <HI>Let your moderation
be made known to all men</HI>) which enjoyneth
any precept, certainly all Christians, as well
as the <HI>Philippians,</HI> are obliged and engaged
to the performance of it; at their own pain
and perill of the neglect thereof. Where∣fore
by the same rule of proportion, Every
Christian may justly claim a right and in∣terest
in all promises made to the <HI>Philip∣pians,</HI>
and this among the rest the Revela∣tion
hereafter of truths unto them, hitherto
concealed from them.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="103"/>
9. <HI>And if in any thing.</HI> Any thing. Far
be it from us to shrink a larg Text with a
narrow comment S. <HI>Paul</HI> sayeth <HI>any thing,</HI>
let not us say <HI>somthing,</HI> Be they <HI>otherwise
minded,</HI> in matter of <HI>Fact,</HI> or of <HI>Faith,</HI> or
of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> or of <HI>Discipline,</HI> what ever it
be, (for it needs must be <HI>nothing,</HI> which
comes not with the reach or compass
of <HI>any thing</HI>) God will reveal it unto them.
Here let us take notice, what was the last
matter, which immediately moved S. <HI>Paul</HI>
to fall on this expression.</P>
<P>In the foregoing <HI>verses</HI> S. <HI>Paul</HI> had pro∣pounded
a Riddle or seeming contradicti∣on
to flesh and bloud; for he had said.</P>
<BIBL>Vers. 12.</BIBL>
<Q>Not as though I were already
perfect, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
<BIBL>Vers. 15.</BIBL>
<Q>Let us therefore as many as be
perfect, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
<P>That perfection which first he denyed in
himself, presently he avoweth both in him∣self
and many others. This Riddle it seems
it would not sink into the Heads of some
of the weaker <HI>Philippians,</HI> how the same
Person at the same time should be imper∣fect
in deed, execution, performance, yet
<PB N="8" REF="104"/>
perfect in desire, intention, endeavour. But
well it is for us, that some amongst the
<HI>Philippians,</HI> through ignorance were other∣wise
minded, whose error herein gave the
happy occasion to S. <HI>Paul,</HI> from Gods
mouth to pronounce this comfortable pro∣mise,
both to them and us and all dissenters,
that <HI>if any be otherwise minded, God will re∣veal
even this unto them.</HI></P>
<P>10. DOCT. <HI>Godly men as long as they
live in this world will dissent in many mat∣ters
of religion.</HI> The reason is, because none
know either <HI>Perfectly</HI> or <HI>Equally,</HI> in this
life. Not perfectly, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 12. <HI>Now we
know in part.</HI> Not equally; for though men
understood <HI>imperfectly</HI> in this life, yet if all
understood <HI>equally imperfectly,</HI> upon the
supposition of equal <HI>ingenuousness</HI> to their
<HI>Ingenuity</HI> (that is, that they would readily
embrace what appears true unto them) all
would be of the same judgment. <HI>But alas,</HI> as
none sees clearly, so scarce any two see equal∣ly
some are <HI>thick-sighted,</HI> some <HI>short-sighted,</HI>
some <HI>pur-blind,</HI> some <HI>sand-blind,</HI> some <HI>half-blind,</HI>
and the worst of them (blessed be
God) better then <HI>stark-blind.</HI> These diffe∣rent
<PB N="9" REF="104"/>
degrees of sight, cause the difference
of judgment amongst Christians.</P>
<P>11. A sad instance, hereof, we have, in
the differences about the Sacraments of
<HI>Baptism</HI> and the <HI>Lords Supper.</HI> What by
divine goodness was intended and in∣stituted
to unite and conjoyn Christians,
hath by mans frailty, and Satans sub∣tilty
been abused to make many Rents
and divisions. About the time when, the
Parties on whom, the manner how,
Baptism is to be administred. But where
Baptism hath divided her <HI>Thousands,</HI> the
Lords Supper hath divided her <HI>Ten Thou∣sands.</HI></P>
<P>12. Amongst all the ordinary pot-herbs
which grow in Gardens none more wholesom
than sage, (especially at some times of the
year,) whose Latine name <HI>Salvia,</HI> carrieth
much of <HI>health</HI> therein. Whereupon it is, that
the envious <HI>Toad</HI> commonly nesleth it self
under the roots thereof. Spitefully to im∣poison
that which otherwise is so usefull
for mankinde. Satan being sensible of the
great good which generally may redound
<PB N="10" REF="105"/>
to men by the charitable receaving of the
Lords Supper, hath imbittered it with dis∣cords
and dissention, betwixt Papists and
Protestants about Transubstantiation; <HI>Lu∣therans,</HI>
and <HI>Calvinists</HI> about Consubstan∣tiation;
<HI>Calvinists</HI> and <HI>Calvinists</HI> about the
gesture of genuslection and Persons to be
admitted to the Sacrament. And thus mens
dissenting in judgments being too plainly
proved, arising from their proness to err,
come we now to the gracious promise of
their information in the truth, <HI>God will
reveal even this unto you.</HI></P>
<P>13. See here S. <HI>Pauls</HI> charity. He say∣eth
not, let him be <HI>Anathema Maranatha,</HI>
or let him be <HI>cast out of the Synagogne,</HI> or
<HI>let him be to you as a heathen or a Publican</HI>
but onely <HI>God will reveal even this unto him.</HI>
Here take notice of S. <HI>Pauls</HI> different pro∣ceedings
with three sorts of people. First,
with thee <HI>otherwise minded</HI> in my Text,
such, who though not <HI>Orthodox,</HI> are peace∣able
in <HI>Israel▪</HI> and err onely in the lesser
and ligher points of Religion. For these, no
punishment capital, or corporal, no penal∣ty
of pain, or shame in purse or person, but
<PB N="11" REF="105"/>
onely a patient expectation of their amend∣ment,
with a comfortable promise of the
same.</P>
<P>14. Secondly with such as <HI>make ship∣wrack
of faith and a good conscience,</HI> under∣stand
it onely in relation to their own <HI>ad∣venture</HI>
therein, maintaining Doctrine de∣structive
to Salvation. Of these were <HI>Hy∣meneus</HI>
and <HI>Alexander,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 20. <HI>Whom
he delivered unto Satan,</HI> that is (as it is ge∣nerally
expounded) by Church Censures
cut off from <HI>God</HI> in the <HI>visible Church</HI> and
then being cut off from him, we know to
whose share they do fall.</P>
<P>15. Thirdly, to such, as not content to
confine their damnable errours to their own
bosom, are active to infect others therewith:
of these he speaketh, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 12. <HI>I would they
were even cut off that trouble you.</HI> In which
phrase surely more is imported than a bare
Excommunication. For that spiritual Artil∣lery
S. <HI>Paul</HI> ever carried about him: why
then should he <HI>wish</HI> what he could <HI>work?
desire</HI> what he could <HI>do?</HI> if so pleased. It is
probable therefore that he could have wisht
them cut off with temporal death.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="106"/>
16. Here we say nothing of such Doctrines
as bear <HI>Heresie</HI> and <HI>treason</HI> impaledtogether,
pregnant with Sedition to raise tumults in a
State. These we leave to the cognizance and
censure of the civil Authority; and shall
proceed on the promise of the Revelation of
truth to the first sort of dissenting brethren.</P>
<P>17. <HI>Quest.</HI> What, more Revelation
still? When shall Christians come to an
end? When shall we say, <HI>It is finished?</HI>
When shall they certainly know the full
measure of all which they are to believe and
practice as necessary to salvation?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Here be it premised, that the <HI>Phi∣lippians</HI>
at this time wherein S. <HI>Paul</HI> wrote
unto them might expect extraordinary Re∣velations,
(and those <HI>additional</HI> to the Scri∣pture
then in being) on an account more
probable to receive them, than any now a∣days
can expect the same. For when S. <HI>Paul</HI>
wrote this Epistle, some of the Gospels
(and particularly that of S. <HI>Johns</HI>) were
not yet penned, which though placed before
the Epistles (as containing the History of
our Saviours life which was first in time)
yet were written afterwards. But seeing long
<PB N="13" REF="106"/>
since the Canon of the Scripture is com∣pleated,
yea, <HI>signed</HI> and <HI>sealed</HI> by God, and
delivered to mankinde, it is not onely vain,
but wicked for men to look for more Reve∣lations,
of such things which men ought to
know and believe to their salvation. But to
answer the question more particularly.</P>
<P>18. There are two sorts of Revelations.<LIST>
<ITEM>One doth <HI>revelare credenda,</HI> reveal
those things which we are to be∣lieve.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The other doth make us <HI>credere reve∣latis,</HI>
more quickly and firmly as∣sent
to what hath formerly been
delivered in the Scripture.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The first sort of Revelations are ceased in
this Age. As for the second sort we may
look for them, pray for them, and labour
them, as which God hath promised to be∣stow,
and which the godly dayly receive.
Such Revelations our Saviour gave to the
two Disciples travelling to <HI>Emaus, Luke</HI> 24.
27. <HI>When he expounded unto them all the
Scriptures.</HI> And in the same Chapter, <HI>v.</HI> 45.
to the rest of the Disciples, <HI>When he opened
their understanding, that they might under∣stand
<PB N="14" REF="107"/>
the Scriptures.</HI> He made not the Scri∣ptures
<HI>more▪</HI> but more plain unto them; not
larger, but clearer unto them. Such a Re∣velation
is intended in the text, to make er∣roneous
persons more clearly to apprehend,
and more firmly to adhere to the truth in
Gods word.</P>
<P>19. But <HI>quando, when,</HI> and <HI>quousque▪ how
long Lord holy and true,</HI> how long shall thy
servants go on in their errours and igno∣rance?
When shall they without fail re∣ceive
this promised Revelation, to have the
truth manifested unto them. I answer, my
text (beloved) hath not told the time, and
therefore I cannot tell it you. You will say,
If the text had told the time, you could
have told it me. Be it so, and now both you
and I must contentedly be ignorant thereof.
Yet, not to satisfie the curious, but the con∣sciencious
so far as I may, I will more than
conjecture that the punctual time, when this
Revelation shall be made.</P>
<P>20. Of all the years of thy life, in that
year, moneth, week, day, hour, minute, and
(if any will be so hypocritical as to subdi∣vide
<PB N="15" REF="107"/>
minutes) in that moment wherein the
hid providence of Heaven shall discover to
be most for Gods glory, and for thy good.
Thou canst not wisely wish it to be any whit
before that time, and I do confidently assure
thee, it shall not be any whit after it.</P>
<P>21. And yet I dare not be over confident
to promise thee, that such Revelation of the
truth shall certainly happen to thee in this
life. Many of Gods good servants have
gone to the grave with grievous errours
which they have maintained. Yea, it is no
absurdity to maintain, that the blessed in
Heaven are as yet ignorant of many truths,
and that there shall be an accession unto
them, as of glory, so of knowledg in the
Day of Judgment. Yea, many things of
Gods proceedings shall not be revealed un∣to
them, untill <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 5. the day of the
Revelation of the righteous judgment of
God.</P>
<P>22. <HI>Quest.</HI> But suppose it be never at all
revealed unto a man, what is to be conceived
of his final condition who liveth and dieth a
stiff defender of a <HI>damnable doctrine?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="108"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> Give me leave in the first place to
distinguish of <HI>damnable doctrines,</HI> a phrase ac∣ceptive
of two senses. If <HI>damnable</HI> be taken
<HI>passively,</HI> for that which ought to be <HI>damned</HI>
or <HI>condemned,</HI> then every errour is in it self a
<HI>damnable</HI> errour. Discretion adviseth us to
refuse not onely poyson, but unwholesom
food; and we ought to condemn a falshood
<HI>quatenus</HI> a falshood, though it may be con∣sistent
with salvation. But if <HI>damnable</HI> be
taken <HI>actively</HI> (in which sense it is used,
2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 1. <HI>Who privily shall bring in damn∣able
Heresies, even denying the Lord that
bought them</HI>) for that which <HI>damneth</HI> or
condemneth the maintainer thereof, then
onely <HI>fundamental</HI> errours in Religion are
<HI>damnable doctrines.</HI> This premised, we an∣swer
to the question, Gods goodness so
keepeth his servants, that he will not suffer
them to fall into damnable errours in
the last and worst acception thereof. As for
smaller errours, which deserve to be con∣demned,
but are not so pestilent as to de∣stroy
the maintainers thereof, they are par∣doned
through the mercy of God and me∣rits
of <HI>Christ,</HI> on the death-bed of such as
defend them.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="108"/>
23. All good Christians pray with <HI>Da∣vid,</HI>
if not in the same words, to the same
sense, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19. 12. <HI>Cleanse me from my secret
sins.</HI> Whereby is meant, not onely such sins,
as we desire and endeavour to hide and keep
secret from men, but also such as are hidden
and kept secret from us, such our <HI>ignorance</HI>
as not to <HI>know,</HI> or <HI>self-love,</HI> as not to <HI>ac∣knowledg</HI>
them to be sins. Now all such er∣rours
consistent with salvation are remitted
unto the maintainers thereof, under the
mass, bulk, and heap of <HI>secret sins,</HI> though
they be not, and indeed cannot be particu∣larly
repented of, because concealed from
him; who committeth them.</P>
<P>24. Come we now to shew how men
ought to prepare their own hearts for the
more speedy receiving, and sure retaining of
such <HI>Revelations.</HI> Say not, all such prepara∣tions
are useless. The Dove of the Spirit
will not build in a Nest of this making, but
in one of her own providing. For such pre∣vious
disposing of our selves is acceptable
to God, and will expedite the coming of
Revelations unto us. Indeed in the first act
of Conversion we are purely passive, and
<PB N="18" REF="109"/>
can in no degree prepare our selves being
<HI>dead in trespasses and sins.</HI> But being once
freed by grace, we are free; and may, and
must by lawfull means move Gods Spirit to
move us, according to S. <HI>Pauls</HI> counsel,
2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 6. <HI>Stir up the grace of God that is in
thee.</HI></P>
<P>25. First, divest thy self of <HI>Pride.</HI> What
saith <HI>Solomon: Prov.</HI> 13. 10. <HI>Onely by
pride cometh contention. Onely by pride,</HI> as if
such were the <HI>pride</HI> of <HI>pride,</HI> that it scorneth
and disdaineth to admit a <HI>partner,</HI> or <HI>fellow∣cause</HI>
with it self to cause contention. And
although <HI>pride</HI> sometimes be pleased out of
state, to accept of other vices in raising of
Discords, yet still she preserveth her self
Paramont, making use of all the rest onely
as subservient unto her.</P>
<P>26. Now proud men create to them∣selves
two needless fears, which make them
so obstinately embrace their errours. The
first is, that if they alter their opinions,
they must confess that formerly they have
erred, which confession stabbeth Pride, (and
Pride is dextrous in stabbing others) under
<PB N="19" REF="109"/>
<HI>the fifth rib.</HI> For all men by nature desire to
be, and to be accounted <HI>petty Popes,</HI> having
the <HI>spirit of infallibility</HI> fastened unto their
<HI>chairs,</HI> so that their opinions shall pass for
oracle of undeniable truth.</P>
<P>27. The other is, that they shall be brand∣ed
by men for levity and inconstancy, if once
they offer to change their judgments. This
makes many of them to say sullenly and
surlily with <HI>Pilate, John</HI> 19. 22. <HI>What I
have written I have written.</HI> What I have
said, I have said; what I have done, I have
done; what I have defended, I have defend∣ed;
I will not abate an ace, remit a tittle,
recede an hair from my former opinions.
Whilest others turn as fast as the Weather∣cock,
I will stand as firm as the Steeple, the
rather because otherwise I shall incur the in∣famy
of inconstancy.</P>
<P>28. Whereas let it be but seriously con∣sidered,
and the renouncing of an errour
which we formerly maintained, argueth not
frailness but firmness, not levity but con∣stancy
in us. For this is or ought to be the
grand and general resolution of all Christi∣ans
<PB N="20" REF="110"/>
to imbrace any truth, which appeareth
unto them out of the Word of God.
Wherefore when a Christian renounceth a
particular errour, this is not inconstancy;
because crossing the late and lesser boughs,
but it is constancy; because concurring with
the first and fairest Root of his Resolution,
namely, always to those with the revealed
truth.</P>
<P>29. This hath been the practise of pious
people in all ages. The hand of S. <HI>Augu∣stine</HI>
never seemed so fair and so handsom,
as when he wrot backward, I mean, when
he wrot his <HI>Retractations.</HI> Pale faces, which
otherwise are well proportioned, never look
so lovely, as when they are casually betray∣ed
to a blush, which supplies that colour in
their cheeks which was wanting before.
Good men who once maintained an errour,
never appear more amiable in the eys of
God and the godly, as when blushing with
shame (not to be ashamed for) at the remem∣brance
of their former faults, which maketh
them more thankfull to God, more humble
in, more carefull over themselves, and more
charitable to others.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="110"/>
30. Well in the first place devest thy
self of pride, and know that <HI>David</HI> tels us,
how all those ought to be qualified, whom
God intendeth to teach, <HI>Psalm</HI> 25. 9. <HI>The
meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek
will he teach in his way.</HI> The proud are
improper to be Gods Scholars, who con∣ceive
themselves able to be his Teacher▪
and wise enough to instruct him.</P>
<P>31. Secondly devest thy self of Passion,
than which nothing more prejudicial to the
judgment. Fire is accounted an hurtfull
object to the eye, as water is esteemed an
helper thereof to look upon it, comforting
and uniting (as the other scattereth) the
visive beams. What then when the be∣holder
is all fire, I mean all passion and
choller, is it probable that during this tem∣per,
the spirit will descend upon him?
Observe the carriage of <HI>Elisha,</HI> 2 <HI>K.</HI> 3. 15.
(being in an high rapture of anger with
<HI>Joram.</HI> King of <HI>Israel</HI> for his submissive
applications unto him in his distress when
he and three Armies were likely to die of
thirst) and now saith he, bring me a Min∣strel
namely, by Musick to pacifie himself
<PB N="22" REF="111"/>
and to dispose his soul for the regular re∣ception
and solemn entertainment of the
spirit▪ which accordingly came to pass
<HI>when the Minstrel played the hand of the
Lord came upon him.</HI></P>
<P>32. See we here in the first place, that
it is lawfull to use all good means to invite
the Spirit to descend upon us. <HI>The Spirit
of the Prophets,</HI> was never <HI>so subject to the
Prophets,</HI> as to come at their call and com∣mand.
Secondly though <HI>Eshishah</HI> in anger for
the man was holy anger (justly offended with
King <HI>Joram,</HI> for making Idolatrous Priests
his <HI>choise</HI> in prosperity, and Gods Prophet
his <HI>refuge</HI> in adversity) yet he was sensible
to himself, that he was disturbed and dis∣composed
therewith. And though the
cause of his anger was just, and <HI>matter</HI> of
his anger commendable, yet possibly the
<HI>measure thereof,</HI> might be faulty, (<HI>Elisha</HI>
being like <HI>Eliah,</HI> and <HI>Eliah a man subject
to like passions as we are,</HI> James 5. 17. And
He might see in himself (what others saw
not in him) that he was too much trans∣ported
with passion, and perchance did too
much insult on the present perplexity and
<PB N="23" REF="111"/>
extremity of King <HI>Jehoram.</HI> Wherefore
conceiving that He in <HI>the still voice,</HI> would
not come to one in so loud a <HI>passion,</HI> he
calls for a Minstrel, so to reduce, pacate,
and compose his Soul, that it might return
to a quiet temper: Whence it plainly ap∣pears,
what an enemy Passion is generally
to the receiving of Gods Spirit, and that
all those which desire a Revelation of the
truth unto them, must labour to devest
themselves thereof.</P>
<P>33. Thirdly devest thy self of Cove∣tuousness.
Here take notice, how easily men
are perswaded to embrace those opinions
(though never so erroneous,) which bring
in profit unto them: for instance; One with
weak sinnews of <HI>Logick,</HI> &amp; worse colours of
<HI>Rhetorick</HI> will quickly perswade a Country∣man
to be a convert in this point, that he
is not bound to pay Tithes to his Minister.</P>
<P>34. On the other side it is hard to wean
men from sucking on those Opinions
which are sweetned unto them by commo∣dity.
<HI>For by this craft we get our gain,</HI> Acts
19. 25. No wonder if the Pope zealously
<PB N="24" REF="112"/>
maintaineth Purgatory, seeing that Purga∣tory
so plentifully maintaineth the Pope.
The same may be said of other lucrative
errours in their Religion, Pilgrimages, Par∣dons,
Prayers to the Saints, Prayers for the
dead, <HI>&amp;c. Scylla omnes suos divitiis implevit,</HI>
it was the policy of that cunning Senatour
to enrich all of his party tyed by their
purse-strings the faster unto him; whereas
the Antifaction of the <HI>Marians</HI> being no∣thing
so well monied by their Patron
cleaved not so stedfastly unto him. Gain∣full
errors soon gain and long keep such as
desire them; whereas speculative opinions
which terminate onely in the brains having
little influence on mens practise and less
on their profit are nothing so taking of men,
and men nothing so tenacious of them.</P>
<P>35. As for the errour of such as deny
the Baptising of Infants, we have cause to
conceive the greater hopes of their return∣ing
to the truth, because that their Opini∣on
can not make them a <HI>thred,</HI> or a <HI>shoo∣latchet</HI>
the richer by the maintaining there∣of.
<HI>Tully</HI> saith of our <HI>Brittainy</HI> in his time,
(when <HI>Caesar</HI> rather discovered than con∣quered
<PB N="25" REF="112"/>
it) that it had naturally, <HI>Ne micam
auri aut argenti,</HI> not <HI>a crum of gold or silver,</HI>
as within the bowels of the earth thereof.
So may I say of the Doctrine of <HI>Anti∣poedo-baptism,</HI>
it is a bare and poor opinion,
<HI>Gold and Silver it hath none,</HI> and therefore,
(alone of it self) is never probable to en∣rich
the patrons and defenders thereof.</P>
<P>36. And yet as <HI>Tully:</HI> went a little too
far, in condemning <HI>Brittain,</HI> as utterly de∣void
of Silver oar, and is disproved by the
industry of our Age, which some years
since hath discovered Silver mines in <HI>Wales,</HI>
so possibly this opinion may be more advan∣tagious
to the defenders thereof, than is ob∣vious
to the eye of every common beholder.
It may be it may make them more capable
of preferment, and that either they are or
conceive themselves to be in a better proxi∣mity
to advancement by maintaining there∣of
as more favourably reflected on than
others; as if this opinion gave the most re∣al
testimony of their good affections to the
present government, whereby they appre∣hend
themselves: the next <HI>reversions</HI> to
preferment I believe they mistake them∣selves
<PB N="26" REF="113"/>
therein, and that no such partiality
is in the present state. However let them
examine their own souls and devest them∣selves,
of covetousness in case they be con∣scious
to themselves that expectation of
profit inclines them to this opinion.</P>
<P>37. Come we now to Positive counsels,
what we ought to perform. And here I am a∣fraid
some will be offended at the simplicity
&amp; plainness of them. There is a book entitu∣led,
<HI>De medecinis facilè parabilibus, of me∣dicines
which may easily be procured,</HI> and very
good for such w<SUP>ch</SUP> take Physick <HI>in forma pau∣peris.</HI>
Yea generally it is conceived nothing
so much detracteth from the worth of those
medicines, as the cheapness and common∣ness
thereof, so that if we did but fetch
from the <HI>East Indies,</HI> what now groweth in our
gardens, it would then be accounted a preci∣ous
Drug which now we esteem a common
Potherb. In like manner I fear that these our
counsels, shall be undervalued for the usu∣alness
and obviousness of them. If a Soul-Mount-abank,
should prescribe such new fangled
means, which was never heard of
before, he should get more patients than all
<PB N="27" REF="113"/>
the grave Physicians of the City. How∣ever
we will adventure to prescribe these
plain means which God hath prescribed un∣to
us.</P>
<P>38. First, pray to God, that he that o∣peneth
and no man shutteth, and shut∣teth
and no man openeth, would be plea∣sed
in his own due time to reveal all neces∣sary
truths unto thee. Secondly, be dili∣gent
in reading Gods Word. <HI>Luther</HI> did
profess that when he first began to write
against the Pope, many fancies were put in∣to
his head, plausible to flesh and bloud, but
groundless on Scripture, which made him
daily to pray, <HI>Domine in verbo, Domine in
verbo,</HI> Lord teach me in thy Word.</P>
<P>39. Thirdly, be carefull in keeping the Lords
day, not with any superstitious but godly
observation thereof. On what day did
God reveal the <HI>Revelation</HI> to S. <HI>John?</HI> On
the Lords day, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1. 10. Thus Princes use
to bestow their Boons, and confer their fa∣vors
chiefly on those days, which more pro∣perly
are called their days; as on the Anniver∣saries
of their Births or Coronations. Fourthy,
<PB N="28" REF="114"/>
Repair to the place of Gods Publick Ser∣vice.
Fifthly, as the Magistrate bears not
the <HI>Sword</HI> in vain, the Minister bears not
the <HI>Word</HI> in vain. But least we Ministers
should seem to plead our own cause herein
we leave this to God to plead for us.</P>
<P>39. <HI>Object.</HI> But some erroneous per∣sons
will be ready to say unto me, as the
young man did to our Saviour in the Go∣spel,
<HI>All these things▪ have I done from my
youth.</HI> I have constantly prayed, and care∣fully
read, and conscienciously kept the
Lords day, and diligently repaired to the
publick Ministery, and have endeavoured to
devest my self of pride, passion, and co∣vetousness,
and yet no errour is revealed to
me, which I formerly maintained. Hereup∣on
I conclude my self to be in the right.
Our <HI>English</HI> Proverb, as it hath much of
rudeness, so it hath no less of truth therein,
<HI>One is not bound to see more than he can.</HI>
And I conceive I am in no errour, because I
follow my present light, and all the means
of your prescription have made no alterati∣on
on my understanding.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="114"/>
40. <HI>Answ.</HI> Give me leave to be jea∣lous
over these Objectors, with a godly jea∣lousie.
I exspect not the validity of my Re∣ceits
prescribed, but suspect their effectual
application thereof, whether or no they
have sincerely practised the same; this I
am sure, as <HI>men</HI> can scarcely (for the main)
give <HI>other,</HI> so <HI>Angels</HI> can give no <HI>better.</HI></P>
<P>41. And here I shall deceive their ex∣pectation,
who conceive that on the ill suc∣cess
of the former Receipts, I should pro∣ceed
to prescribe other means, whereby a
brother dissenting from the truth, shall be
reclamed unto it. Onely I remember a pas∣sage
of <HI>Eliah,</HI> 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 18. 34. when accord∣ing
to his command, they had once poured
water upon the Altar, <HI>And he said, Do it
again, and they did so the second time; and
he said, Do it the third time, and they did it
the third time also.</HI> The next seven years,
(if thou livest so long) pray, reade, keep
the Lords day, attend on Gods publick Or∣dinance,
and in case the truth be not then
revealed unto thee, the next seven years (if
thou livest so long) do the like. I have no
alteration, but a meer repetition, of what
<PB N="30" REF="115"/>
already hath been prescribed: and there∣fore
we proceed to give instructions to such
who by the benefit of these means are actu∣ally
reclamed from their errours A word
or two how they should behave them∣selves.</P>
<P>42. First, practise our Saviours precept
to S. <HI>Peter, Luke</HI> 22. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>When thou art con∣verted
strengthen thy brethren.</HI> Never con∣ceive
thy self in the <HI>peaceable possession</HI> of a
truth, untill such time as thou hast impart∣ed
it to others: the rather because it is
more than probable, that by thy example,
(if of any eminency) thou hast invited
others to, or confirmed others in their er∣rours▪
and therefore in civility and Christi∣anity
thou stand'st obliged to undeceive
them.</P>
<P>43. In <HI>Hungaria</HI> they have a custome,
that a Gentleman wears so many Feathers
as he hath killed <HI>Turks</HI> And truly, a <HI>Fea∣ther</HI>
may pass for the lively Emblem of the
glory of this world, wagged with the winde,
and lighter than vanity it self: Alas, what
a toy is a Feather? It is real happiness in∣deed,
<PB N="31" REF="115"/>
<HI>Dan.</HI> 12. 3. <HI>They that turn many to
righteousness shall shine as the stars for ever
and ever.</HI></P>
<P>44. But O how glorious in Heaven will
S. <HI>Peter</HI> appear? who at the preaching of
one Sermon gained <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 4. <HI>three thousand
souls.</HI> What a Constellation, what a Firma∣ment
of stars will he alone be?</P>
<P>45. <HI>See the</HI> pathetical expostulation, <HI>and
the</HI> ingenuous <HI>confession of S.</HI> Paul <HI>before
King</HI> Agrippa, Acts 26. 8. <HI>His</HI> pathetical ex∣postulation,
Why should it be thought a thing
incredible with you, that God should raise the
dead? His ingenious confession▪ I verily
thought with my self that I ought to do many
things <HI>contrary,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>How freely and fully
doth he acknowledg his fault, labouring to
lessen the errours of others by the alleadg∣ing
the example of his own former infir∣mities.</HI></P>
<P>46. This wrought so far with <HI>Agrippa,</HI>
that it made him a <HI>Demi, Almost a Christian.
Paul</HI> did both in his own and <HI>Apollos</HI> part
<HI>to plant</HI> and <HI>water,</HI> but God was not
pleased.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="116"/>
47. Who knoweth what may come to
pass? Happy Musick if in like manner we
might but live to hear some of our; yet dis∣senting
brethren, after their returning to the
truth, to argue the case thus with those
which as yet remain in their errours. How
ought they to counsel others to the truth,
and <HI>Paul</HI>-like, to comfort them with their
own Precedent, that such as err may season∣bly
be reclamed.</P>
<P>48. Come we to shew how the standers
by, and all other <HI>orthodox</HI> Christians ought
to contribute their assistance to the recla∣ming
of their erroneous brethren to the
truth. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> speaking of Cures, saith,
that all parties concerned must lend their
assistance, as the <HI>Physician, Patient,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>those that are present,</HI> (conceived re∣lated
to the sick man) must all lend their as∣sisting
hand to the work. So in spiritual
Cures, even the spectators (idle ones Chri∣stianity
allows none) are parties, and must
contribute their help in so good an imploy∣ment.
For whom these councels are pro∣per.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="116"/>
49. First▪ load them not with opprobri∣ous
Language, of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> and the like.
Be more charitable in thy words to them,
and thoughts of them. Though they should
account us <HI>Dogs,</HI> let us account them <HI>Sheep,</HI>
but what <HI>Sheep? wandring Sheep.</HI> Though
they esteem us <HI>Bastards,</HI> we will esteem
them <HI>children,</HI> but what <HI>children? prodigal
children.</HI> We will think better of them than
they think of us, (though not so well as
they think of themselves) and no discreet
person will conclude, our faith the worse, be∣cause
our charity is the more.</P>
<P>50. Secondly, widen not the wound be∣twixt
us, to make it worse than it is. And if
thou hast occasion to state the controversie
betwixt us and them, deal fairly in the mat∣ter.
Do not paint them of a blacker com∣plexion
than they be, neither represent their
opinions partially to their disadvantage.</P>
<P>51. Here under favour I conceive, that it
is fit at a Disputation in the Schools, to
charge them home, with all the dangerous
or absurd Consequences, which result na∣turally
from their erroneous opinions. We
<PB N="34" REF="117"/>
may bring a just <HI>action</HI> against them, and at
the <HI>suit</HI> of <HI>Logick</HI> arrest them for maintain∣ing
such abominable Consequences: we
may lay the ugly <HI>Brats</HI> at their fathers
doors, that they may have the shame and
pain in getting them, the cost and charge to
provide for them. As <HI>is the Mother, so is the
Daughter.</HI></P>
<P>52. But in case our <HI>dissenting brethren</HI>
shall disclame such Consequences, and sin∣cerely
from their hearts detest and abhor
such damnable Deductions which notwith∣standing
naturally and inevitably flow from
their own erroneous principles, conceive
that, though they may be prest with such
consequences in the Schools they may not
be charged with them <HI>in foro conscientiae.</HI>
But that onely they are answerable to God
for the primitive errour, and not for such
derivative ones, which notwithstanding are
the undoubted off-spring thereof.</P>
<P>53. Lastly, when they shall recant their
errours willingly, chearfully, greedily, give
unto them <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 9. <HI>the right hand of fellow∣ship.</HI>
Indeed the <HI>left hand</HI> by <HI>vulgar tradi∣tion</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="117"/>
(not to say <HI>mistake</HI>) is presumed nearer
to the <HI>heart,</HI> but the <HI>right hand</HI> if not by na∣ture
(by custome) is the stronger and firm∣er.
Say not, I must make some difference
betwixt those, that never left, and those
who lately returned to the truth. My <HI>right
hand</HI> I must reserve for such who never wan∣dred
from the right way, my <HI>left hand</HI> shall
serve those who were brought back unto it.
O no, love both alike, and though the af∣fection
of thy heart be equal to both, if
there be any odds in thy behaviour, express
most love to those <HI>Reverts,</HI> so to invite
more to come over to the truth.</P>
<P>54. Do any hear my Sermon this day
who dissent from me, and many other, (and
indeed from all the practise of the ancient
Primitive Church) in the point of baptiz∣ing
of Infants. O let such consider what
hath been said by us in this point, and God
give them understanding, and on the ap∣pearing
of truth unto them, let them inge∣niously
renounce their own erroneous opi∣nions.</P>
<P>55. Never be ashamed to do that, which
<PB N="36" REF="118"/>
wil bring safety to your selves, glory to God,
joy to Angels, grief to none but such as re∣joyce
at your destruction. We may observe
in Horses, that after a stumble, for some paces
they go better and quicker than before. Some
impute this to their fear, to be beaten, and
desire to avoid it; others to their generosity,
to make amends for their former fault, with
double diligence.</P>
<P>56. <HI>Be not like the Horse and Mule which
hath no understanding, Psalm</HI> 32. 9. that is,
do not imitate them in their brutish head∣strongness.
Yet be like the Horse and Mule
in their commendable conditions, (as crea∣tures
far above Pismires, and Lillies) imi∣tate
those generous principles which the in∣stinct
of Nature hath put into them. Re∣cover
what is past in your stumbling by
your future activity; in going the faster in
the path of truth and righteousness.</P>
<P>57. To conclude, there is for the present
a great Gulph and distance betwixt you and
us in our opinions. Indeed though we should
desire it, we dare not approach nearer unto
you in point of judgment. S. <HI>Paul</HI> saith
<PB N="37" REF="118"/>
even of his brother S. <HI>Peter, Gal.</HI> 2. 5. <HI>To whom
we gave place, no not for an hour, that the
truth of the Gospel might continue with you.</HI>
We may not yield to you, no, not a hairs
breadth. We have already <HI>in stating the
Controversie</HI> betwixt us, drawn as near as we
can without betraying the truth, prejudicing
Gods cause, and our own consciences. And
having gone to the very marches and out∣bounds
of the truth, we there stand on tip∣toes
ready to embrace you if you come to
us, and no otherwise.</P>
<P>58. But as for difference in <HI>affection,</HI> seeing
we conceive your error not such as intrench∣eth
on salvation, (because not denying but
deferring Baptism) and onely in the out limbs
(not vitals of) Religion, wherein a latitude
may and must be allowed <HI>to dissenting bre∣thren,</HI>
we desire that herein the measure of
our love may be without measure unto you.
Lightning often works wonders when it
breaketh the Sword, it doth not so much as
bruise the Scabbard; Charity is a more hea∣venly
fire, and therefore may be more mira∣culous
in its operations. You shall see that
our love to you, as it doth detest and desires
<PB N="38" REF="119"/>
to destroy your errours, so it will at the same
time, it will safely keep, and preserve your
erroneous persons.</P>
<P>59. For mine own particular, because I
have been challenged (how justly God and
my own conscience knoweth) for some mo∣rosenes
in my behaviour towards some <HI>dis∣senting
brethren,</HI> in my Parish, this I do pro∣mise,
and God giving me grace I will per∣form
it. Suppose there be one <HI>hundred</HI> pa∣ces
betwixt me and them in point of affecti∣on,
I will go <HI>ninety nine</HI> of them, on condi∣tion
they will stir the <HI>one odd</HI> pace, to give
them an amicable meeting. But if the Legs
of their Souls be so lame, or lazy, or sullen,
as not to move that one pace towards our
mutual love, we then must come to new
<HI>propositions.</HI> Let them but promise to stand
still and make good their station, let them
not go backward, and be more imbitter'd
against me than they have been, and of the
<HI>hundred paces,</HI> in point of affection, God
willing, Ile go <HI>twice fifty</HI> to meet them. As
for matter of judgment I shall patiently
and hopefully expect the performance of
Gods promise in my Text, when to those
<PB N="39" REF="119"/>
which are otherwise minded in the matter of
<HI>Infants Baptisme,</HI> God will reveal even this
unto them. Amen.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen I look on the
<HI>Crest</HI> of your ancient
<HI>Arms, (A Mitre
powdered w<SUP>th</SUP> Cros∣ses</HI>)
I read therein an abridgment
<PB REF="122"/>
of the <HI>Devotion</HI> of those darker
dayes: the <HI>Mitre</HI> shewing your

<HI>Cross,</HI> their <HI>atchievements</HI> in the

<P>Yea I fancie to my self each an∣cient

Neh. 4. 17. <HI>With a Trowel

(afterwards converted into a

<HI>Cathedral</HI>) was solely founded by
one of that <HI>Family.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Devotion of those
dayes, wherein the world knew no
better, and scarce any other. Since
the Reformation, your <HI>Noble
House</HI> hath not had less heat for
having more light. Your Charity
hath not been extinguished, but re∣gulated,

<P>As for your particular, that

<P>Acceptance is more then it can ex∣pect,

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSAL. 37. 37.</BIBL>
<Q>Mark the Perfect, behold the
Ʋpright; for the end of that
man is Peace.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS and the 73. <HI>Psalm</HI> are of
the same subject, wherein
<HI>David</HI> endeavours to cure
an Epidemical disease, with
which the best Saints and
servants of God are often
distempered: Observe in this <HI>Disease,</HI> the
<HI>nature, danger, cause</HI> and <HI>cure</HI> thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="125"/>
The <HI>Nature,</HI> namely fretting fits of the
soul, at the consideration of the constant
peace, plenty and prosperity of wicked men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Danger</HI> thereof, It causeth the Con∣sumption
of the spirit, and is destructive to
the health of the soul. Yea, when this disease
comes to the <HI>Paroxism,</HI> the height and heat
thereof, it becometh dishonourable to God;
aspersing and be-libelling him, as if he wanted
Goodness, and would not; or Power, and
could not; or Justice, and doth not order
matters better then they are.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cause</HI> thereof it proceedeth from a
double defect in men:</P>
<P>1 Want of <HI>Faith</HI> to trust in God.</P>
<P>2 Want of <HI>Patience</HI> to wait on God.</P>
<P>This is the reason why the practice of these
two graces is so often inculcated by <HI>David</HI> in
this Psalm.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cure</HI> thereof: <HI>David</HI> applyes many
Cordials, (for less then Cordials will not do
the deed) seeing by his own confession, <HI>Ps.</HI>
73. 21. <HI>His heart was grieved</HI> with his fretting
fits. We will onely instance on the two
last.</P>
<P>One is a serious consideration, <HI>ver.</HI> 35 of the
short pleasure and certain pain of the wicked.
It was a good prayer of a <HI>good man, Lord keep
me from a temporal heaven here, and an eternal
<PB N="3" REF="125"/>
hell hereafter.</HI> True it is, <HI>Psalm</HI> 73. 4. that to
the wicked, <HI>there are no bands in their death:</HI>
and no wonder, when they have all bands af∣ter
death.</P>
<P>The second is a studious observation of the
<HI>perfect Mans</HI> condition, who though meeting
with many <HI>intermediate</HI> broils and brunts,
and bickerings in this life: yet all at last winds
up with him in a comfortable close, and hap∣py
conclusion, <HI>Mark the Perfect, behold the
Ʋpright, for the end of that man is peace.</HI></P>
<P>Observe in the words two general parts:</P>
<P>1 <HI>The</HI> description of the Dead.</P>
<P>2 <HI>The</HI> direction to the Living.</P>
<P>In the <HI>description of the Dead,</HI> we have two
particulars:</P>
<P>1 What he was. A practicer of Perfection
and Uprightness.</P>
<P>2 What he is. A possessour of a peaceable
end.</P>
<P>In the <HI>direction to the Living</HI> we have an
invitation, or rather an injunction to mark
and behold.</P>
<P>1 What was done by the man, when
living: his Holiness.</P>
<P>2 What was done to the man, when dead:
his Happiness.</P>
<P>This our Sermon being now preached in
the juncture of the old and new Year: What
<PB N="4" REF="126"/>
better subject to end the old, then to speak
of the description of the dead? What fitter
matter to begin the new, then to treat of the
direction to the living? <HI>Mark the Perfect, be∣hold
the Ʋpright: for the end of that man is
peace.</HI></P>
<P>Before we enter on the words, it will be a
charitable work to reconcile the seeming va∣riance
betwixt the two Translations: I mean
that which is commonly prefixed at the be∣ginning,
and what is constantly inserted in
the middle of our Bibles.</P>
<P>The Old Translation.</P>
<Q>Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing
that is right, for that shall bring a man peace
at the last.</Q>
<P>The New Translation.</P>
<Q>Mark the Perfect man, and behold the Ʋpright,
for the end of that man is peace.</Q>
<P>See here a vast difference betwixt the di∣vers
rendring of the words: <HI>If the Trumpet,</HI>
1 Cor. 14. 8. <HI>give an uncertain sound, who shall
be prepared for the battel?</HI> But where shall the
unlearned, though honest hearted Reader,
<PB N="5" REF="126"/>
dispose of his belief and practice, when
there be such irreconcileable differences in
the <HI>Translation</HI> of Gods Word.</P>
<P>I answer, the seeming difference ariseth
from the latitude of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> words, so
extensive in their signification: for <HI>Shemor</HI>
which in my text is translated, <HI>Mark,</HI> accord∣ing
to the first and most frequent acception
thereof: signifieth also in a secondary sense,
to <HI>Keep, seeing those things which we mark, we
also keep, at the least for some short time in our
memorie.</HI> The same may be said, that the
word <HI>Behold,</HI> in my Text, is rendered in the
<HI>Old Translation, take heed,</HI> seeing the <HI>Hebrew</HI> wil
bear both: <HI>Tham</HI> and <HI>Jaschar,</HI> most commonly
and constantly denote the <HI>Concrete, Perfect, Ʋp∣right,
Righteous,</HI> and <HI>Innocent:</HI> But sometimes
signifieth the abstract also, Perfection, Up∣rightness,
Innocencie. Let not therefore the
two Translations fall out, for they are <HI>Bre∣thren,</HI>
and both the <HI>sons</HI> of the same <HI>Parent,</HI>
the <HI>Original:</HI> Though give me leave to say
the youngest <HI>child</HI> is most like the <HI>father,</HI> and
the newest <HI>Translation</HI> herein, most naturally
expresseth the sense of the <HI>Hebrew.</HI></P>
<P>Let none cavil that such laxity in the <HI>He∣brew</HI>
words occasions uncertainty in the
meaning of the <HI>Scripture:</HI> For God on pur∣pose
uses such words importing several sen∣ses;
<PB N="6" REF="127"/>
not to distract our heads, but dilate
our hearts, and to make us <HI>Rechoboh, Room</HI> for
our practice in the full extent thereof, <HI>Psal.</HI>
119. 92. <HI>Thy commandement is exceeding broad,</HI>
and is penned in words and phrases, accep∣tive
of several senses, but all excellent for us
to practice: So that both Translations may
be happily compounded in our endeavours,
<HI>Mark the perfect, keep innocency, and behold the
upright, and take heed to the thing that is right;
for the end of that man is peace:</HI> and that shall
bring a man peace at the last.</P>
<P>Begin we with the description of the dead,
<HI>Perfect,</HI> and what is a good Comment there∣on,
<HI>Ʋpright.</HI></P>
<P>Object. <HI>It is impossible this world should
afford a</HI> perfect man. <HI>What saith</HI> David, <HI>Psal.</HI>
14. 2. The Lord looked down from Heaven upon
the children of men, to see if there were any that
did understand and seek after God. They are all
gone aside, they are altogether become filthy, there
is none that doth good, no not one. <HI>But what
saith</HI> Solomon, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 2. 12. For what can the
man do, who commeth after the King, even that
which hath been done already. <HI>But what shall he
do that cometh after the</HI> King of Heaven? <HI>can</HI>
Subjects <HI>hope that their discoveries will be
clearer then their</HI> Soveraigns? <HI>shall man</HI> living
<HI>on</HI> earth <HI>see more then God</HI> looking <HI>from</HI> hea∣ven?
<PB N="7" REF="127"/>
<HI>he could not meet with</HI> one good, <HI>where
then shall we mark a</HI> perfect man?</P>
<P><HI>Answ. David</HI> in the place alledged, de∣scribes
the general corruption <HI>ad prae varicatio∣nem</HI>
of all mankind by nature; in the latitude
whereof we confess the perfect man in my
Text was involved. As all Metals when they
are first taken out of the earth, have much
dross and oar, but by art and industrie may
afterwards be refined: so the man in my text
was equally evil with all others by nature, till
defecated by grace, and by Gods goodness re∣fined
to such a height of puritie as in some de∣gree
will endure the touch, and become <HI>per∣fect.</HI></P>
<P>In a fourfold respect may a servant of God
be pronounced Perfect in this life.</P>
<P>1 <HI>Comparatively,</HI> in reference to wicked
men, who have not the least degree or desire
of goodness in them. Measure a servant of
God by such a dwarf, and he will seem a pro∣per
person, yea, comparatively perfect.</P>
<P>2 <HI>Intentionally:</HI> The drift, scope, and pur∣pose
of such a mans life, is to desire perfecti∣on,
which his desires are seconded with all the
strength of his weak endeavours: He draw∣eth
his bow with all his might, and Perfecti∣on
is the mark he aimeth at, though too of∣ten
his hand shakes, his bow starts, and his
arrow misses.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="128"/>
3 <HI>Incho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tively:</HI> We have here the <HI>begin∣ing</HI>
and the <HI>earnest</HI> as of the Spirit, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 22.
So of all spiritual graces, expecting the full
(not <HI>payment,</HI> because a meer <HI>gift,</HI> but) <HI>re∣ceipt</HI>
of the rest hereafter. In this world we
are a <HI>perfecting,</HI> and in the next, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12. 23.
<HI>we shall come to the spirits of just men made per∣fect.</HI></P>
<P>But blame me not, Beloved, if I be brief in
these three kinds of Perfections, rather touch∣ing
then landing at them, in our discourse;
seeing I am partly affraid, partly ashamed to
lay too much stress and weight on such slight
and slender foundations. I hasten with all
convenient speed to the fourth, which one is
worth all the rest. A servant of God in this
life is perfect.</P>
<P>4 <HI>Imputatively:</HI> Christs perfections through
Gods mercy being imputed unto him. If I be
worsted in my <HI>front,</HI> and beaten in my <HI>main
Battel,</HI> I am sure I can safely <HI>retreat</HI> to this my
invincible <HI>Reer:</HI> In the agonie of temptation
we must quit <HI>comparative perfection.</HI></P>
<P>Alass, Relation is rather a <HI>shadow</HI> then a <HI>sub∣stance:</HI>
quit <HI>intentional perfection,</HI> being con∣scious
to our selves how oft our actions cross
our intentions. Quit <HI>inchoative perfection;</HI> for
whilest a servant of God compareth the little
<PB N="9" REF="128"/>
goodness he hath with that great proportion
which by Gods law he ought to have, he con∣ceiveth
thereof as the pious Jews did of the
Foundation of the second Temple, <HI>Haggai</HI> 2.
3. <HI>Is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as no∣thing?</HI>
But stick we may and must to <HI>impu∣tative
perfection,</HI> which indeed is Gods act,
cloathing us with the <HI>Righteousness of Jesus
Christ.</HI></P>
<P>This is the reason the Saints are unwilling
to own any other <HI>perfection:</HI> for though God
<HI>Job</HI> 1. 1. is pleased to stile <HI>Job</HI> a <HI>perfect man,</HI>
yet see what he saith of himself, <HI>Iob</HI> 9. 20. <HI>If I
say that I am perfect, it shall also prove me per verse.</HI>
God might say it, <HI>Iob</HI> durst not for fear of
pride and presumption. Indeed <HI>Noah</HI> is the first
person, who is pronounced <HI>perfect</HI> in <HI>Scripture,
Gen.</HI> 6. 9. But mark I pray what went in the
verse before: <HI>But Noah found grace in the eyes
of the Lord.</HI> Not that his <HI>finding grace</HI> is to be
confined to his particular preservation from
the Deluge, (which was but one branch or
sprig of Gods grace unto him.) But his whole
person was by Gods goodness accepted of,
<HI>Noahs</HI> perfection more consisting in that ac∣ceptance
then his own amiableness, approved
not so much because God found goodness in
<HI>Noah,</HI> but because <HI>Noah</HI> found grace in
God.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="129"/>
Come we now in the description of the
Dead, to <HI>what he is, The end of that man is
peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> Some will object that daily expe∣rience
confutes the truth of this Doctrine,
what more usual then to see Gods servants
tossed, tumbled, tortured, tormented, often
ending their painful lives with shameful
deaths. <HI>Cushi</HI> being demanded by <HI>David</HI> to
give an account of <HI>Absaloms</HI> condition, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI>
18. 32. made this mannerly and politique re∣turn:
<HI>The enemies of my Lord the King, and all
that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that
young man is.</HI></P>
<P>But some will say, if this be a <HI>peaceable
end,</HI> to lead an afflicted life, and have an
ignominious death, may the enemies of God
and all goodness, the infringers of our Laws
and Liberties, the haters of Learning and Re∣ligion,
the destroyers of Unity and Order,
have their souls surset of such a <HI>peaceable
end.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Resp.</HI> In answer hereunto we must make
use of our Saviours distinction, the same for
substance and effect, though in words there
be variation thereof. Being taxed by <HI>Pilate</HI>
for treason against <HI>Caesar;</HI> he pleaded for him∣self,
<HI>Ioh.</HI> 18. 36. <HI>My kingdom is not of this world:</HI>
So say we, to salve all objections, our <HI>peace,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="129"/>
that is the <HI>peace</HI> in our Text, (and God make
it <HI>ours,</HI> not only to treat and hear, but partake
thereof,) <HI>is not of this world,</HI> consisteth not in
temporal or corporal prosperity; but is of
a more high and heavenly nature. Indeed this
<HI>peace</HI> is <HI>in</HI> this world, but not <HI>of</HI> this world;
begun here in the calm of a clear and quiet
conscience, and finished hereafter in the Ha∣ven
of endless happiness. When the <HI>man</HI> in
my Text, becomes perfectly <HI>perfect,</HI> he shall
then become <HI>perfectly peaceable.</HI></P>
<P>However we may see that sometimes (I
say not alwayes) God sets a signal character
of his favour on some of his servants, enjoy∣ing
at their end a generall calm, and univer∣sal
tranquillity towards all to whom they are
related. Amongst the many priviledges of
Saints reckoned up <HI>Job</HI> 5. none more remark∣able
then that verse 23. <HI>For the Stones of the
field shall be at league with thee, and the beasts
of the field shall be at peace with thee.</HI> Have we
here a <HI>Dichotomy</HI> of all wicked men, or a
sorting of them all into two sides.</P>
<P>Some are <HI>Stones,</HI> like <HI>Nabal</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 25. 37.
stupid, sottish, senseless; no Rhetorick
with its expanded hand, no Logick with
its contracted fist, no Scripture, no reason,
no practice, no precedent can make any im∣pression
upon them, so that the best of men
<PB N="12" REF="130"/>
may even despair to get their good will. Well
the way to do it, and procure a perfect peace
with them, is to please God.</P>
<P>Others are <HI>beasts</HI> like the <HI>Cretians, Tit.</HI> 1.
12. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, so fierce, so furious, so craf∣ty,
so cruel, no medling with them without
danger. As the former could not conceive,
so these will not abide any rational debate
with them. The former were too low and
silly, too much beneath: these high and
haughty, too much above perswasion to
peace; mention but the name thereof, and
they <HI>Psal.</HI> 112. <HI>prepare themselves to bat∣tel.</HI></P>
<P>The art then to make these friends with a
man, is only this, to endeavour to please the
high God of heaven; and then <HI>Solomons</HI>
words will come to pass, <HI>Prov.</HI> 16. 7. <HI>When a
mans wayes please the Lord, he maketh even his
enemies to be at peace with him.</HI></P>
<P>It once came to pass in <HI>England</HI> (and but
<HI>once</HI> it came to pass in <HI>England</HI>) namely, when
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See his life lately printed.</NOTE> Sir <HI>Thomas Moor</HI> was <HI>Lord Chan∣cellor,</HI>
that the <HI>Cryer</HI> in <HI>Chancery</HI>
being commanded to call the next
<HI>cause,</HI> returned this answer, <HI>there were no more
causes to be heard.</HI> Not that there was no
more on the <HI>file</HI> for that day (which is ordi∣nary
and usual) but, which is strange, that
<PB N="13" REF="130"/>
then there was no more <HI>sutes</HI> depending in
the whole Court of <HI>Chancery,</HI> but that all
ripened for Trial, were decided. Then was
<HI>Janus</HI> his Temple shut clean throughout
<HI>England,</HI> in Cases betwixt <HI>Plaintiff</HI> and <HI>De∣fendant,</HI>
relating to equity and conscience.
Whether this proceeded from the peacea∣bleness
of people in that age, not so quarrel∣some
and litigious as in ours: or from the
goodness of the Judge, either, happy, pri∣vately
to compound differences without any
sute; or dextrous, publickly to decide them
with all expedition.</P>
<P>But when some good man hath lyen on
his <HI>death bed,</HI> though having many sutes in
his life, all then are ended and composed.
Call the <HI>sute</HI> betwixt this man and his <HI>God,</HI>
long since it is attoned, and both made friends
in <HI>Christ.</HI> Cal the <HI>sute</HI> betwixt this man and his
<HI>conscience,</HI> it is compremised, and both of them
fully agreed. Cal the <HI>sute</HI> betwixt this man and
his <HI>enemies, Stones</HI> and <HI>Beasts,</HI> it is compound∣ed,
and they at peace with him. Call the
<HI>sute</HI> betwixt this man and all other Creatures,
it is taken up, and he and they fully reconci∣led.
Thus I say sometimes, not alwayes,
God graceth some of his servants that they
depart in an <HI>universal peace,</HI> a personal fa∣vour
indulged to some select Saints. But ge∣nerally
<PB N="14" REF="131"/>
and universally all the true servants of
God, whatever their outward condition be,
go from <HI>peace</HI> to <HI>peace;</HI> from the first fruits
of peace in their conscience, to the full fruiti∣on
thereof in heaven. <HI>Mark the perfect, be∣hold
the upright: for the end of that man is
peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Come we now to the</HI> direction of the Li∣ving:
Mark the Perfect, behold the Ʋp∣right.</P>
<P>It is not said, Gaze on the <HI>Perfect,</HI> Stare on
the <HI>Ʋpright,</HI> this men of themselves are too
<HI>prone</HI> to do without any bidding: nay, con∣trary
to Gods positive command, <HI>Heb,</HI> 10. 33.
<HI>Whilest ye were made a gazing stock by re∣proaches
and afflictions.</HI> And <HI>David</HI> in the
person of Christ complains, <HI>Psal.</HI> 22. 17. <HI>they
look and stare upon me:</HI> partly with eyes of
wonder, as on so many Monsters and Prodi∣gies,
1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4. 4. <HI>Wherein they think it strange
that you run not with them to the same excess of
Riot:</HI> partly with the eyes of scorn, as on so
many miserable wretches. Indeed God and
wicked men agree in this point, <HI>that good men
are not worthy to live here.</HI> But upon different,
yea, contrary accounts, God esteems them
<HI>too good to live here, Heb.</HI> 11. 38. <HI>Of whom the
world was not worthy.</HI> Wicked men conceive
them <HI>too bad to live here, Act.</HI> 22. 22. <HI>Away
<PB N="15" REF="131"/>
with such a fellow from off the earth, for it is not
fit that he should live.</HI> Which makes them to
<HI>behold the perfect and upright,</HI> with scorn and
contempt.</P>
<P>However <HI>mark the Just, behold the Ʋpright,</HI>
do it solemnly, do it seriously, not with a cur∣sory
look, fix thy sight, and for some time;
let it dwell on so eminent an Object. <HI>Mark
the perfect,</HI> as a Schollar marks his copie to
write after it. Then will it come to pass with
thee as with <HI>Moses, Exod.</HI> 34. 29. He so long
had seen the back-parts or Suburbs of Gods
glory, that the <HI>skin of his face shone,</HI> guilded
with the reflexion thereof. So those who
<HI>mark the Perfect and behold the Ʋpright,</HI> not
only with a <HI>fore-cast,</HI> but chiefly with a <HI>reflex∣ed
look,</HI> cannot but be gainers thereby. For
the godly, who, as S. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2. 15.
<HI>shine as lights among a crooked and perverse Na∣tion
in the world,</HI> will make such as effectual∣ly
mark them, become like unto them, and
shine accordingly. We see that such who
look on <HI>Bleer-eyes,</HI> have their own sight in∣fected
therewith; and those who diligently
<HI>mark,</HI> and stedfastly fasten the eyes of their
souls, on the <HI>perfect</HI> and <HI>upright man,</HI> will in
process of time, partake of their <HI>perfection.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ʋse.</HI> 1. It serveth to confute such, who,
though living long in this world, and conver∣sing
<PB N="16" REF="132"/>
with varietie of persons, yet mark and
observe nothing at all. If a privy inspection
might be made into the Diaries and Journals
of such mens lives, how would they be found
filled with empty cyphers, whose total sum
amounts to just <HI>nothing.</HI> When Messengers
and Trumpeters come into the Castles and
Garrisons of their enemies, commonly they
are brought <HI>blindfolded,</HI> that they may
make no dangerous discoveries to report to
their Party at their return. What out of Po∣licie
is done to them, that many out of idle∣ness
and ignoranc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do to themselves, mask
and hood wink their souls, do take notice of
nothing in their passage through this world.</P>
<P>Others mark but only such things which
are not remarkable. <HI>Dina</HI> marks, but what?
<HI>Gen.</HI> 34. 1. <HI>The fancie-ful fashions of the daugh∣ters
of Canaan:</HI> and we may generally observe,
that all observations follow the humour of
the Observers, so that what vice or vertue in
him is predominant, plainly appears in their
discoveries. The Covetous man marks, but
whom? those who are rich and wealthy. The
ambitious man, but whom? those that are
high and honourable. The lascivious man
marks, but whom? such as are beautiful and
wanton: few there be of <HI>Davids</HI> devout dis∣position,
who <HI>mark the Perfect, behold
<PB N="17" REF="132"/>
the Ʋpright; for the end of that man is peace.</HI></P>
<P>2 <HI>Ʋse.</HI> Let all who desire this peaceable
end, labour whilest living to list themselves
in the number of those who are <HI>perfect</HI> and
<HI>upright.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Ahaaz</HI> coming to <HI>Damascus,</HI> was so
highly affected with an Idolatrous <HI>Altar</HI> which
he there beheld, that he needs would have
that Original Copyed out, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 16. 10.
And the like made at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> according to
<HI>the fashion of it, and all the workmanship there∣of.</HI>
Fool, to preferre the pattern of the infer∣nal
pit, before the pattern in the Mount. But
this his prophane action will afford us a pious
application.</P>
<P>You that have marked the Just and beheld
the Upright, ought to be affected with the
piety of his life, cannot but be contented with
the peaceableness of his <HI>end.</HI> This therefore
do; Such who are pleased with the pattern
of his <HI>perfection</HI> and <HI>uprightness,</HI> go home, and
raise the like fabrick, erect the like structure
for all considerable particulars in your own
soul.</P>
<P>Vain and wicked was the wish of <HI>Balaam,
Numb.</HI> 23. 10. <HI>Let me dye the death of the righ∣teous,
and let my last end be like his.</HI> He would
<HI>commence per saltum,</HI> take the Degree of Hap∣piness,
without that of Holiness; like those
<PB N="18" REF="133"/>
who will live <HI>Papists,</HI> that they may <HI>sin</HI> the
more freely; and dye <HI>Protestants,</HI> that they
may be <HI>saved</HI> the more certainly. But know
that it is an impossibility to graft a peaceable
death upon any other stock, but that of a pi∣ous
life.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Ʋse.</HI> Let it retrench our censuring of the
final estate of those whom we know led god∣ly
lives, and we see had shameful deaths. Let
us expound what seems doubtful at their
death, by what was clear in their life. A true
conclusion may sometimes be inferred from
false premises: but from true premises the
conclusion must ever be true. Possibly a
good life in the next world, may follow a bad
one in this; namely, where (though late) sin∣cere
repentance interposeth. But most certain
and necessary it is, that a good life here must
be crowned with a good condition hereafter.
What then though. <HI>John Baptist</HI> lost his head
by <HI>Herods</HI> cruelty, he still <HI>held his head</HI> in the
<HI>Apostles</HI> phrase, <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 19. By a lively faith con∣tinuing
his dependance on, and deriving life
and comfort from Jesus Christ, in which re∣spect
he may be said to have dyed in peace.</P>
<P>There is a sharp and bitter passage in <HI>Scrip∣ture,
Luk.</HI> 9. 23. And yet if the same be sweet∣ned
with a word or two in my Text, it may
not only easily be swallowed, but also will
<PB N="19" REF="133"/>
certainly be digested into wholsome nourish∣ment:
the words are these, <HI>and let him take
up his Cross daily and follow me.</HI> His Cross; some
will say, I could comfortably comport my
self to carry such a mans Cross, his is a slight,
a light, and easie; mine a high, a huge and
heavy Cross. Oh but children must not be
choosers of that rod where with they are to be
corrected; that is to be let alone unto the
discretion of their father. Men may fit cloaths,
but God doth fit Crosses for our backs: no
Cross will please him for thee to take up, but
<HI>thy Cross,</HI> only that which his providence hath
made thee the proprietarie thereof. Well
take it up, on this assurance, that the <HI>end there∣of
shall be peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Take up thy Cross.</HI> Is it not enough that I be
passive, and patiently carry it when it is laid
upon me? What a Tyranny is this for me to
<HI>cross my self</HI> by <HI>taking up my own cross?</HI> But
God will have it so, thou <HI>must take it up:</HI> that
is, First thou must freely confess that nothing
hath befaln thee by chance or fortune, but by
Gods all-ordering Providence. Secondly,
Thou must acknowledge that all afflictions
imposed upon thee, are the just punishment
of thy sins deserved by thee; if inflicted more
heavily, seeing all things is mercy which is on
this side of hel fire. This it is to <HI>take up thy cross</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="134"/>
do it willingly, <HI>for it will be peace at the last.</HI></P>
<P>The last is the worst word, <HI>Daily.</HI> Not
that God every day sends us a new affliction,
but he requires that every day we should put
on a habit of <HI>patience,</HI> to undergo whatsoever
cross is laid upon us. This I conceive to be <HI>Da∣vids</HI>
meaning, <HI>Psal.</HI> 73. 14. <HI>and chastened eve∣ry
morning. Daily,</HI> superstitious Fryers never
esteem themselves ready till they have put on
their Crucifix, and religious Protestants must
never accompt themselves ready till they
have put on their cross.</P>
<P>The Papists have besprinkled their Calen∣dar
with many <HI>festivals,</HI> having no foundati∣on
in <HI>Scripture,</HI> or ancient Church History.
One day they call the <HI>Exaltation of the Cross,</HI>
which is <HI>May</HI> 3. another the <HI>Invention of the
Cross,</HI> which is <HI>September</HI> 14. But we must
know there is one day of the <HI>Cross</HI> more, <HI>Day</HI>
which continueth from the beginning to the
end of the year, namely, the <HI>Assumption of the
Cross;</HI> every one must take it up daily, do it, &amp;
do it willingly, for the <HI>end thereof wil be peace.</HI></P>
<P>And yet there is a fourth thing remaining
in the Text, when we have took up our Cross
we must follow Christ; it is not enough to take
it up, and then stand still, as if suffering gave
us a <HI>supersedeas</HI> for doing; but God at the
same time will have our <HI>hands, back,</HI> and <HI>feet</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="134"/>
of our <HI>soul</HI> exercised; <HI>hands</HI> to take up, <HI>back</HI>
to bear our <HI>Cross,</HI> and <HI>feet</HI> to follow him; and
happy it is for us, though we cannot go the
same pace, if we go the same <HI>path</HI> with our
<HI>Saviour;</HI> for the end thereof will be peace.</P>
<P>O the amiableness of the word <HI>Peace!</HI> oh
the extensiveness of the word <HI>End! Peace?</HI>
what can be finer <HI>ware? End?</HI> what can be
larger <HI>measure?</HI></P>
<P>The amiableness of Peace, especially to us,
who so long have prayed for it, and payed for
it, and sought for it, and fought for it, and yet
as yet in <HI>England</HI> have not attained it. For the
<HI>Tragoedy</HI> of our war is not ended, but the
<HI>scene</HI> thereof removed, and the Element only
altered from <HI>earth</HI> unto <HI>water.</HI> Surely had we
practised <HI>Davids</HI> precept, <HI>Psal.</HI> 34. 14. <HI>Eschew
evil and do good. seek peace and ensue it,</HI> before
this time we had obtained our desire. It is to
be feared we have been too earnest prosecu∣tors
of the last, and too slow performers of
the first part of the verse: great have been
our desires, but small our deeds for peace.
Had we <HI>eschewed evil and done good,</HI> God ere
this time, would have crowned our wishes
with the fruition of peace.</P>
<P>The Marriners <HI>Act.</HI> 27. 30. (men skilful to
shift for themselves at Sea) had a private pro∣ject
for their own safety, namely, to quit their
<PB N="22" REF="135"/>
crazie ship, (with the souldiers and passengers
therein,) and secretly to convey themselves
into the boat. But their design miscarried be∣ing
discovered by S. <HI>Paul</HI> to the souldiers, <HI>who
cut the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</HI></P>
<P>All men ought to have a publick spirit for the
general good of our Nation, the success where
of we leave to the al-managing providence of
the God of heaven and earth. But I hope it wil
be no treason against our State, and I am sure it
wil be safe for us, who are but private persons
to provide for the securing of our souls, and
to build a little Cock-boat, or smal Vessel of a
<HI>quiet conscience</HI> in our own <HI>hearts,</HI> thereby
to escape to the Haven of our own Happiness?
We wish well to the great <HI>Ship</HI> of our whole
Nation, and will never desert it so, but that
our best prayers and desires shall go with it.
But however providence shall dispose thereof
we will stick to the petty Pinnace of Peace in
our own consciences. Sure I am, no souldiers
shall be able to cut the <HI>Cables,</HI> I mean no for∣cible
impression from <HI>without,</HI> shall disturb
or discompose the peace which is within us.</P>
<P>O the extensiveness of the word <HI>End!</HI> It is
like the widows oyl, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 4. 6. Which mul∣tiplyed
to fill the number and bigness of all
Vessels brought unto it, so here bring dayes
weeks, months, years, myriads, millions of
<PB N="23" REF="135"/>
years end will fill them all, yet it self is never
filled, as being the endless end of eternity.</P>
<P>We will conclude all with a passage of <HI>Co∣lumbus,</HI>
when he first went to make discove∣rie
of the new world. Long time had he sail∣ed
and seen nothing but Sea, insomuch as the
men and Marriners with him begun to muti∣ny
resolving to go no further, but return
home again. Here <HI>Columbus</HI> with good words
and fair language pacified them for the pre∣sent,
perswading them to sail forward for one
month more. That month elapsed, he over∣intreated
them to hold out but 3 weeks lon∣ger:
that three weeks expired, he humbly
and heartily sued unto them, that for his sake
they would sail on but 3 dayes more, promi∣sing
to comply with the Resolutions of re∣turning,
in case that within those 3 dayes, no
encouragement to their contrary was disco∣vered.
Before the ending whereof they de∣scryed
<HI>fire,</HI> which was to them a demonstra∣tion
that it was not subjected on water, and
w<SUP>ch</SUP> invited them for the finding out of those
<HI>Islands,</HI> whereby others afterwards discover∣ed
the whole <HI>Continent.</HI></P>
<P>Whilest we live here below in our bodies,
and sail towards another world in our souls
and desires, we must expect to meet with
much disturbance in our distempered passi∣ons:
<PB N="24" REF="136" MS="y"/>
yea, such as sometimes in the hour of
<HI>temptation</HI> will amount to a <HI>mutiny;</HI> and much
dishearten us when <HI>tost</HI> with the <HI>tempest</HI> of
afflictions we can <HI>make no land,</HI> discover no
hope of <HI>happiness.</HI> It must then be our work
to still and <HI>calm</HI> our <HI>passions,</HI> perswading them
to persevere, and patiently to proceed, though
little hope appear for the present. Not that
with <HI>Columbus</HI> we should indent with our
souls to expect any set-time of years, months
or dayes, (this were <HI>unlawful,</HI> and with the
wicked, <HI>Psal.</HI> 78. 41. <HI>To limit the Holy One of
Israel</HI>) but <HI>indefinitely</HI> without any notation
of time: Let us till on our souls by degrees,
a <HI>while,</HI> a <HI>little while,</HI> yet a <HI>very little while</HI> to
depend on God, and go on in goodness. Then
at last a <HI>pillar of fire,</HI> a comfortable light of a
conscience cleared through the blood and
merits of Christ will appear unto us, not only
contenting us for the present, but directing us
for the future to that bliss and happiness en∣joyed
by the Subject of my Text, <HI>Mark the
Perfect, behold the Ʋpright; for the end of that
man is Peace.</HI> AMEN.</P>
