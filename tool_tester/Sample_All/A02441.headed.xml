<L>COme hither Booke, take counsell. He that goes</L>
<L>Into the world, meetes with a world of foes.</L>
<L>Thy Mother was my <HI>Muse,</HI> a gentle Dame,</L>
<L>Who much ador'd <HI>Appollo's</HI> sacred name:</L>
<L>Then being free-borne, know that thou art going</L>

<L>Yet wonder not, that I haue got no friend</L>
<L>To write in thy behalfe! What! should I send</L>
<L>Thee, like a Seruingman, with Letters? No.</L>
<L>The World shall see thee first; and seeing, know</L>
<L>Whether thou merit'st prayse: none shall haue cause</L>
<L>To be condem'd of folly in the applause.</L>
<L>Of thy harsh lines, the worst that can be thought</L>
<L>Is this, That none would write, they were so naught.</L>
<L>Alas, poore Booke, hunt not thou after prayse,</L>
<L>Nor dare to stretch thy hand vnto the Bayes</L>
<L>Vpon a Poets head: let it suffice</L>
<L>To thee and me, the world doth vs despise.</L>
<L>For 'tis a mad World, and it turnes on hinges,</L>

<L>Meddle not with them, lest thou get a yerke:</L>
<L>And yet their venamous breath (as on a Glasse)</L>
<L>No sooner lighteth, but away doth passe.</L>
<L>Then feare them not. The Wise, which know thee best,</L>
<L>Will entertayne thee, as a welcome Ghest;</L>
<L>Prayse that's prayse-worthy, winke at faults but small,</L>
<L>Like thy conceits, and prayse thy vayne withall.</L>
<L>Yet be not proude, though thou their prayse dost gayne,</L>
<L>Remembring what is writ is writ in vayne.</L>
<L>Tis for a better pen then mine to say</L>
<L>By God 'tis good, and if you lik's you may.</L>
