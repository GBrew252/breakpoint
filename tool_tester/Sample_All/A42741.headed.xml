<DIV2 N="pike" TYPE="fish">
<HEAD>Of the <HI>Pike,</HI>
And how to Take Him several
wayes.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His <HI>Pike</HI> is the King and
Commander of all
Fresh-Water <HI>Fish;</HI>
therefore I begin with
him first: And he is
Ravenous, that I my
self, at <HI>Boately,</HI> near
<HI>Oxford,</HI> with my
Trole, took a great Over-grown <HI>Pike,</HI>
that was within an Inch of a Yard-long;
and when he came to be opened, he had
an other large one, of above a Quarter
of a Yard-long, in his Belly: And I will,
upon occasion, bring evidence, that the
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<HI>Pike,</HI> which was taken out of the others
Belly, had a small Bird that is used to
lodge in the Reeds, in the Pouch of it:
But no more of this. Now for my pro∣mise,
which was, How to catch this</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of a pike</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>His feeding is generally of <HI>Roach,
Dace, Gudgeons,</HI> or <HI>Froggs;</HI> but above
all, he delighteth most in Fair <HI>Gudge∣ons:</HI>
and where there is not store of
small <HI>Fish,</HI> he feeds of a Weed called,
<HI>Pike-rell-Weed.</HI></P>
<P>Now your first way of Taking a <HI>Pike,</HI>
that I shall teach, is, By a frixed Bait,
which is done (if in a standing Water)
by having a Line of about twenty Yards
long, made fast to a stick, stuck in the
ground; and having baited your Hook
with a Live <HI>Gudgeon, Roach,</HI> or <HI>Dace,</HI>
throw it as far as conveniently you can,
or in the like-liest place you see for a
<HI>Pike,</HI> leaving two Yards, or there-a∣bouts,
loose upon the ground by your
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
Peg, that you may see when your Line
is run out strait; at which time be as∣sured,
that you have got a <HI>Pike.</HI> You
may make use of as many Lines as
you please, the more you Lay out,
the like-lier you are to have the more
Sport.</P>
<P>But if you would take a <HI>Pike</HI> in a Ri∣ver,
or any other Moving Water, I will
shew you the best way ever inven∣ted,
which you may perceive by the
Figure.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram of a method for fishing for pike</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Take a piece of Cork, about little
more than a quarter of an Inch thick,
cut it round, as you see in the Figure,
and then hollow it round the sides, to
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
lap or wind your Line in, which must
be about twelve Yards; tye it fast
round the Cork, and tye a Hook to it,
baited with a live Bait, as you see in the
Figure: And when you have left so
much of the Line, at the end the Fish
hung to, as you think will reach half
depth of the Water you intend to fish
in, catch your Line in the Cleft of the
Stick, which must be put through the
Cork, as you see the Figure; and this
will boy up your Bait, at any distance
you place it.</P>
<P>This being done, throw your Cork,
Line, and Fish, all into the middle of the
Water you intend to fish; if in a Ri∣ver,
the Stream will carry it down; in
a Mere or Pond, the Wind will give
it Motion: So that, if you have but
two or three of these, you need not
fear Sport enough.</P>
<P>Now, when the <HI>Pike</HI> bites, his snatch∣ing
so eagerly, as they generally do,
pulls your Line out of the Cleft in the
Stick, and gives him the whole length
of the Line, to pouch your Bait with:
This being done, he will run up and
down a little, but will presently be
tyred; but let him go whither he
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
will, you need not fear; For, your
Boy will continually be above Wa∣ter.</P>
<P>Now to take him, you must have a
strong piece of three twist Pack-thred,
of thirty Yards long, with a Plummet
at the end, of a quarter of a Pound
weight; which cast beyond the Line,
between your Boy and the <HI>Pike,</HI> and
let it sink; and it will bring you both
Boy and <HI>Pike:</HI> So that, try all the
wayes that are, you will find none so
pleasant or profitable as this, to take
a <HI>Pike.</HI></P>
<P>Many use to Troule for a <HI>Pike;</HI>
but that is so easie, that I shall not
spend time in giving Directions: For,
it will be far easier learnt, by once go∣ing
with any Person that understands
it, in ones day time, than is possible to
be Taught by a Printed Direction. So
much for the Taking of him. Now for
the Dressing of him.</P>
<P>All <HI>Pikes,</HI> that are not half a Yard
long, are fitter to be Fryed or Boyled,
than any other way; but for a <HI>Pike</HI> to
exceed that Length, either little or more,
Roast him in this manner:</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="10"/>
First, Open your <HI>Pike</HI> at the Gills,
and if need be, give a little cutt to∣wards
his Belly; out of these take his
Guts, but keep his Liver, which you
are to shred very small with Tyme,
Sweet-Marjerome, and a little Winter-Savory;
to these put some Pickled
<HI>Oysters,</HI> and some <HI>Anchovies,</HI> two or
three of both, the last whole (for the
<HI>Anchovies</HI> will melt, and the <HI>Oysters</HI>
should not); to these add a Pound of
Sweet-Butter, which you are to mix
with the Herbs that are shred; and
let them all be well Salted: those being
mixed with a Blade or two of Mace,
must be put into the <HI>Pike</HI>'s Belly, and
then his Belly sowed up so close, that,
if possible, it may keep all the Butter
in his Belly. Take not off his Scales:
Then you are to thrust the Spit through
his Mouth, out at the Tayle: And
then with five or six split Stixs, or very
thin Lathes, with a good quantity of
Filliting. These Lathes are to be tyed
round about the <HI>Pikes</HI> Belly, from his
Head to his Tayle, and the Tape tyed
something thick to prevent his break∣ing
or falling from off the Spit. Let
him be Roasted very leasurely, and
<PB REF="10"/>
<PB REF="11"/>
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
often Basted with Claret VVine, and
<HI>Anchovies,</HI> and Butter, mixt together;
and also, with what Moysture falls
from him into the Pan.</P>
<P>VVhen you have Roasted him suffi∣ciently,
you are to hold under him,
(when you unwind, or cutt the Tape
that tyes him) such a Dish as you in∣tend
to eat him out of, and let him fall
into it, with the Sauce which is
Roasted in his Belly; and by this means
the <HI>Pike</HI> will be kept unbroken, and
compleat. Then, to the Sauce which
was within, and also in the Pan, you
are to add a fit Quantity of good But∣ter,
and to squeeze the Juyce of three
or four Oranges: Lastly, You may
either put into the <HI>Pike,</HI> with the
<HI>Oysters,</HI> two Cloves of Garlick, and
take it whole out, when the <HI>Pike</HI> is
cutt off the Spit; or, to give the Sauce
a Hogo, let the Dish (into which you
let the <HI>Pike</HI> fall) be rubbed with it.
The using, or not using of this Garlick, is
left to your Discretion.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Trout. The Nature of His Breed∣ing,
and the Place of His
Haunts; and How to
take Him either with
<HI>Worm, Minnow,</HI> or
<HI>Fly.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HE is an Excellent <HI>Fish,</HI> and high∣ly
admired by all People, in all
Nations. He hath some-thing of
the Nature of Venison, being so like to
a <HI>Buck,</HI> that he comes-in, and goes
out of Season, even as the <HI>Stag</HI> and
<HI>Buck</HI> do.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12"/>
He may claym Place of all Fresh-Water
<HI>Fish,</HI> for Precedency, and Dain∣tiness
of Tast; for, the most Curious
Palats, when he hath been in Season,
have admired him.</P>
<P>He is at his Perfection in <HI>May,</HI> and
doth Decline, as before, with the
<HI>Buck.</HI></P>
<P>He Spawn's generally about <HI>October,</HI>
or <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>His Haunts are in gravelly clear <HI>Ri∣vers,</HI>
in the most Shady Places. He
delights much near <HI>Wires,</HI> and <HI>Flud∣gates,</HI>
and any Falls of <HI>Waters.</HI></P>
<P>His Baits are, usually, that he is
Caught with, a <HI>Worm,</HI> or a <HI>Minnow,</HI>
or else with a <HI>Flye, viz.</HI> either Natural,
or Artificial <HI>Flye.</HI></P>
<P>First of <HI>Worms;</HI> there are many,
as Earth-VVorms; others that are
bred of Plants, as the Dug'd-VVorme;
others of Excrements, or
in the Bodies of Creatures, as the
<HI>Maggot,</HI> or <HI>Gentle,</HI> &amp;c. But of all
these, the <HI>Dew,</HI> or <HI>Lob-Worm,</HI> and
the <HI>Brandling,</HI> are the best for a
<HI>Trout.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13"/>
And if you would catch so large a
<HI>Trout</HI> as this,
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of a trout</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>
take the <HI>Lob-Worme.</HI> And your best
way is to put them to some Mosse, till
they are poor, by cleansing themselves;
and then, by giving them the Yolk of an
Egg, they will become lively, and fit for
use: But if you are straitned for
VVorms, squeeze some VVall-nut
Tree-Leaves in water, which poured up∣on
the ground, will make them rise out
of hand.</P>
<P><HI>Now to Bait your Hook neatly, that
it may Trole or Runn upon the Ground,
without Tangling, or Catching against
any Sticks, Gravel, or Weeds, ob∣serve:</HI></P>
<P>If you have a big <HI>Lob-Worme,</HI> put
your Hook into it, some-what above
the middle, and out again, a little be∣low
the middle; having so done, draw
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
your Worme above the Arming of your
Hook. But note, That at the entring
of your Hook, it must not be at the
Head-end of the Worme; because the
Point of your Hook may come out to∣wards
the Head-end: and having
drawn him above the Arming of your
Hook, then put the Point of your
Hook again into the very Head of
the Worme, till it come near the place
where the Point of the Hook first came
out, and then draw back that part of
the Worme that was above the Shank,
or Arming of the Hook, and so Fish
with it.</P>
<P>But if you mean to Fish with two
Worms, which you may do: If one
be not big enough, then put the second
Worme, before you turn back the
Hook's head of the first Worme. So
a little trying will make you Expert;
and you may Fish without danger of
Stopping or Catching upon any gravel,
or the like.</P>
<DIV3 N="minnow" TYPE="bait">
<HEAD>For the <HI>Minnows.</HI></HEAD>
<P>They may be had easily in <HI>March</HI> or
<HI>April;</HI> for then they appear in the
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
River, where you may take them at
your Pleasure: Of which, for to take
a Trout, the middle size are best, and
must be so put upon your Hook, that
it must turn round, when it is drawn
against the Stream; and for the nim∣bler
turning thereof, put it upon a big si∣zed
Hook, which put in, at his Mouth,
and out at his Gill; then your Hook
being drawn two or three Inches be∣yond
his Gill, put it again into his
Mouth, and the Point and Beard out
at his Tayle; and then tye the Hook,
and his Tayle very neatly, with a
white Thred or Silk, which will make
it the apter to turn quick in the Wa∣ter:
That being done, pull back that
part of your Line, which was slack, when
you put your hook into the <HI>Minnow,</HI> the
second time: So that, it shall fasten the
Head; and the Body of the <HI>Minnow</HI>
shall be almost straight on your Hook.
Then try how it will turn, by drawing it
cross the Water, or against the Stream;
and so turn the Tayle to your right or
left hand, till it turns to please you; if
not, you're not likely to catch any thing;
if you cannot get a <HI>Minnow,</HI> a <HI>Loach</HI>
or a <HI>Stickle</HI>-bag, will serve neer as
<PB REF="14" MS="y"/>
<PB REF="15"/>

well: If you can get an Artificial <HI>Min∣now</HI>
at the Shops, you had best take
one with you, lest you fail else∣where.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="flies" TYPE="bait">
<HEAD>As for <HI>Flyes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I think either for <HI>Trout,</HI> or any other
<HI>Fish,</HI> that will rise at <HI>Flyes,</HI> those that
they rise-at most, that Season when
you Fish for them, are the best to take
them with; and there are so many,
that I cannot (for fear of making my
little Piece swell beyond its Price) stand
to name them.</P>
<P>Now, as to the <HI>Artificial Flyes,</HI> take
only this Rule with you; that is, To
provide all Colours of Silk, and Fea∣thers,
and such things as are conveni∣ent
for the making of them: and ne∣ver
go about to make one, Artificially,
without a Natural one before you,
what-ever it is you would imitate:
But you had better go, or send, to the
<HI>Three Fishes,</HI> over-against the little <HI>North-Door</HI>
of St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> where
you may have them Better and Chea∣per,

<P>THey are a <HI>Fish,</HI> that love to keep
one another Company dearly,
and flock together much: They
are at worst in <HI>April,</HI> at which time
they Spawne; But are not long before
they come in Season again.</P>
<P>He loves (all the Summer) the Shal∣low,
and Sharp Streams, and lies lur∣king
under Weeds, and feeds most on
Gravel, against a rising Ground; For,
he Roots with his Nose like a Hog, and
Nests himself in the Gravel.</P>
<P>He loves also such places as <HI>London-Bridge,</HI>
or any deep Place, where the
Fierceness of the Water, stirs the Gra∣vel;
where he will take hold of Mosse,
or Weeds, that the Water, though ne∣ver
so fierce, is not able to stir him.</P>
<P>He is mighty Curious in his Baits,
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
and if they be not Sweet and Clean, he
will not touch them; therefore you
must have your Wormes well scoured
with Mosse, and he will bite at a well-scoured
Lob-worme, as boldly, as at
any Bait whatsoever: But your best
way will be, to Bait the Place where
you intend to Fish for them, with some
Lob-Wormes, cutt to pieces, a night
or two before you go to Fish.</P>
<P>You cannot Bait too much; nor well
Fish too early, or late, for him.</P>
<P>Gentiles are also a good Bait for him;
but then they must not be scoured. Ma∣ny
use Cheese, which is also a good
Bait.</P>

<P>First, scale him, and then wash him
clean, and take out his Guts; and to
that end, make the Hole as little, and
as near to his Gills as you can possibly:
and especially make clean his Throat from
the Grasse, and VVeeds, that are usu∣ally
in it (for else if that be not
clean, it will make him tast mighty
Sowr); having so done, put some
Sweet Herbs into his Belly, and then
tye him with two or three Splinters to
a Spit, and Roast him, basted often
with Vinegar; or rather Verjuce and
Butter, with good store of Salt mixed
with it; <HI>And so much of the</HI> Chub, <HI>or</HI>

Way to <HI>Fish</HI> for him, and

<P>NOw if you have a mind to Catch
this <HI>Carp,</HI> that is so Cunning, and
Difficult to be Caught;</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of a carp</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> You must expect to have your
Patience sufficiently tyred, if you Fish
for a <HI>River-Carp;</HI> and like-wise in some
<HI>Ponds</HI> too: If you intend to do any
good with him, you must be at him ei∣ther
early or late; For, they will not
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
bite in the middle of the day. You must
(if you fish in a Pond for a <HI>Carp</HI>) first,
throw in Blood and Grains, or the like,
to bring them to the place where you
would Fish; and then some of the
same Bait which you intend to Angle
with.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carp</HI> bites either at Worms or
Paste.</P>
<P>The blew-Marsh or Medow-Worm,
is best for him. When he is in the Hu∣mour,
he will some-times bite at a large
Gentle: And for Pastes, there are more
sorts, than there are sorts of Fishes;
but sweet-Pastes are best, that are made
either with Sugar or Honey: Which
(that you may the better beguile him,
he being so cunning) should be thrown
where you intend to Fish, an hour or
two before you undertake your skill
with your Angle-Rod: And your best
Bait is made of the Flesh of a <HI>Rabbet,
Kitling,</HI> cutt small; and Bean-Flower:
and if that may not be gotten, other
Flower; mix them together, and put
thereto either Honey, or Sugar; and
beat them together in a Mortar, some∣time
working them in your Hands,
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
being very clean, and make it into a
Ball or two, as you think fittest for your
use.</P>
<P>If you Fish for a Carp with Gentles,
put upon your Hook a small piece of
Scarlet about this bigness <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram showing size of bait</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>, it being
soaked in Oyle of <HI>Peter,</HI> or <HI>Rock-Oyle,</HI>
and you are like-lier to Kill this cun∣ning
Fish this way, than by any other:
But still, as you are Fishing, Chew a
little Bread in your Mouth, and cast it
into the Place where you fish.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To Dresse a <HI>Carp.</HI></HEAD>
<P>If you can take him alive, scove him,
and rub him clean with VVater and
Salt: But scale him not then. Open
him, and put him, with his Blood, and
Liver (which you must save when you
open him) into a small Pot or Kettle.
Then take Sweet-Marjerome, Tyme,
and Parsley, of each half a handful;
A Sprig of Rose-Mary, and another of
Savory; bind them in two or three
small bundles, and put them to your
<HI>Carp,</HI> with four or five whole Onions,
twenty Pickled Oysters, and three An∣chovies;
Then put upon the <HI>Carp</HI> as
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
much Claret as will cover him; and
season your Claret well with Salt,
Cloves, and Mace, and the Rinds of
Oranges and Lemmons. Cover your
Pot, and set it on a quick Fire, till it
be sufficiently boyled: then take out
the <HI>Carp,</HI> and lay it with the Broth into
the Dish, and pour upon it a quarter
of a Pound of Fresh Butter, melted,
and beaten with half a dozen Spoon∣fuls
of Broth, the Yolkes of two
or three Eggs, and some of the Herbs
shred. Garnish your Dish with Lem∣mons,
and so Serve it up.</P>

<P>TO take this <HI>Fish,</HI> called the <HI>Bream,</HI>
<FIGURE>

observe, That <HI>Breams</HI> do most of all
love <HI>Ponds,</HI> and <HI>Meres;</HI> but the chiefest
way to Take them, is; first, Get as big
a <HI>Red-Worm</HI> as you can find without a
knot: Get a pint of them, or more, in an
Evening, in a Garden, after a Showr of
Rain; and put them, with clean Moss,
well washed, pick'd, &amp; the Water squee∣zed
out of the Mosse, as dry as you can,
into an Earthen-Pot; and change the
Mosse for three or four dayes, for three

<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
weeks, or a month together; and then
your Baits will be in a good conditi∣on.</P>
<P>Having your Baits ready, get your
Tackling in this manner; Take three
long Angling-Rods, and as many, and
more Silk-Lines, and as many large
<HI>Goose-,</HI> or rather <HI>Swan-</HI>Quill-Floats;
Then take a piece of Lead made
thus <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of a lead weight</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> and fasten them to the lower
end of your Lines: Then fasten your
Link-Hook also to the Lead; and to
the end of your Line: Let there be about
a foot, or ten inches, between the Lead
and the Hook, (but be sure the Lead
be heavy enough to sink the Float or
Quills under-water, and not the Quill
to bear up the Lead); and the Link,
next your Hook, must be smaller than
the rest of your Line; if you dare
venture for fear of a <HI>Pike,</HI> or <HI>Pearch.</HI></P>
<P>Now, the Worm being well baited, it
will crawle up and down, as far as the
Lead will give it leave; which much en∣ticeth
the <HI>Fish</HI> to bite without Suspition.</P>
<P>Your Float must be (part of it) an
Inch above the Water: Then where
you think there is <HI>Fish,</HI> Angle: But
first note, That you must bait your

<P>AN <HI>Eele</HI> is Caught by more Baits
than any other Fish; For, they
are so greedy, that they will bite
at powder'd-Beef; and be taken with
a <HI>Lob-Worm,</HI> or a <HI>Garden-Worm;</HI> with
a <HI>Minnow,</HI> or Gut of a <HI>Hen, Chicken,</HI>
or the Guts of any <HI>Fish:</HI> But the <HI>Eele</HI>
may be (especially) taken with a very
little <HI>Lamprey;</HI> but some call it a Pride:
and may (in the hot Months) be found
in the River <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>Now an <HI>Eele</HI> never (except it be by
chance) stirs in the day-time; and
therefore, are usually Caught in the
night, by laying a Line, with a many
Hooks to it, cross a <HI>River</HI> or <HI>Pond;</HI>
baited with some of the afore-said
Baits: But these are Things so com∣mon,
that it is not worth while to write

of. But there is a very pretty way to
take them, which is called <HI>Snigling,</HI>
which is thus; Observe your time
(which must be in a hot Summers-day)
when the Water is lowest, you may take
a strong small hook, tyed to a small strong
Line, about a yard long: And then (be∣cause
that the <HI>Eeles</HI> hide themselves un∣der
Board-Planks, about <HI>Floud-gates,</HI>
or <HI>Wires,</HI> or <HI>Mills,</HI> or in Holes in the
<HI>River-Banks,</HI>) you may put into one of
these Holes, or between any Boards
about a Mill, or under any great Stone,
or Plank, or any Place where you think
an <HI>Eele</HI> may hide, or shelter her self)
there (by the help of a short Stick)
put-in your Bait; but leasurely, and as
far as you can conveniently; And if
there be an <HI>Eel</HI> there, he will certainly
gorge up your Bait; and you need
not doubt to have him, if you pull him
not out too soon, but by degrees: And
see, here he comes.</P>

<P><HI>First,</HI> Wash him in Water and Salt,
and then pull off his skin, below his
Rent, or Navel, and not much farther:
Having done that, take out his Guts as
clean as you can; but wash him not.
Then give him three or four Scotches
with a Knife; and put into his Belly,
&amp; into these Scotches, Sweet-Herbs, and
<HI>Anchovies,</HI> and a little grated <HI>Nut meg;</HI>
and your Herbs, and <HI>Anchovies</HI> must al∣so
be cutt very small, and mixed with
good Butter and Salt. Having done
this, then pull his skin over all but his
Head, which you must cutt off. By the
reason you may tye the skin over the end
where his Head grew, it must needs
keep all his Moysture within his Skin.</P>
<P>Then tye him to a Spit, with Tape or
Pack-thred, and Roast him leasurely;
and baste him with Water and Salt, till
his skin breaks: And then with Butter,
having Roasted him enough, let what
was put into his Belly, and what he
dropt, be his Sawce: <HI>And so far of</HI>

<P><HI>FIrst,</HI> You must be provided
with a good <HI>Angle-Rod,</HI> of
at least four Yards, when
it is at the shortest; which
must be Taper all the way:
And to take in so many
pieces, that you may make it of what
length you please. Then you must go,
<PB N="36" REF="31"/>
and buy some Hooks, of all these
sizes, <HI>viz.</HI>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>Next, You must be provided with
excellent strong, round, long, and white
or gray Stone-Horse-Hair; Silk to whip
your Hooks with, and Wax to wax the
Silk.</P>
<P>Then must you have <HI>Swans,</HI> and
<HI>Goose</HI>-quill-Floats, of all sizes; And
for <HI>Chub</HI>-Lines, or <HI>Barbel</HI>-Lines, you
may buy them Cheaper of Silk and
Hair, than you can make them: But
for Hair-Lines, you will not meet with
any to be sold, that you can do any
good with, in <HI>Hackney-River:</HI> Therefore,
being thus provided, begin to make
(first) a Line for the <HI>Chub,</HI> or <HI>Cheven;</HI>
putting eight Hairs in the first Link next
your Rod; and so make it Taper (by
leaving out a Hair every other Link) till
you have made it; when it comes to
the last, to be but four or five Hairs at
<PB REF="31"/>
<PB REF="32"/>
<PB N="37" REF="32"/>
the bottom; to which, tye such a Hook
as is before described for the <HI>Chub.</HI></P>
<P>Next, You must put on a Float, one
of the largest you have; and Lead, in
manner following: So that Line, Float,
Lead, Hook, and all (being fixed toge∣ther)
will be thus
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of a fishing line with float, lead and hook</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Now, for your <HI>Roach,</HI> and <HI>Dace</HI>-lines,
they must be far more fine; for, you
must not (by any means) exceed above
one Hair, at, or next the Hook, or two
at the most; for, if you do, where you
take one <HI>Fish,</HI> they that Fish with a single
Hair, will catch half a dozen: And ob∣serve,
that, be it for what <HI>Fish</HI> you will,
the finer you Fish, the more, and larger
<HI>Fish</HI> you will Catch. But you must ne∣ver
be without your Landing-Hook, or
Landing-Net.</P>
<P>You may for <HI>Roaches,</HI> put three hairs
next your Rod, and two about the mid∣dle;
but at the bottom only one: And
these Lines ought to be a yard, or a
half-yard shorter than your Rods, for
<PB N="38" REF="33"/>
your conveniency of striking your Fish:
And you must fit them with three sizes
of Float, though you have Hair at the
Hook; that is to say, the larger Float∣ed
Line for swift Streams, the middling
size for Streams that run slow, and the
smallest of all, which ought to be of a
<HI>Duck</HI>'s Quill: for those which scarce move
at all, you must leaden them with small
Shot, eight Inches from the Hook; and
then you will find this Line to be thus
Compleat,
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of a fishing line</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>When you have two or three of a
sort of these Lines, and Shots, and
Floates, Links, Hooks, and Supplies
for every thing that you can possibly
use; then go to Mother <HI>Gibert</HI>'s, at
the <HI>Flower-de-Luce</HI> at <HI>Clapton,</HI> near
<HI>Hackney</HI> and whilst you are drinking
of a Pot <HI>Ale,</HI> bid the Maid make you
two or three Peny-worth of <HI>Ground-Bait,</HI>
and some <HI>Paste</HI> (which they do
very neatly, and well); and observing
of them, you will know how to make
<PB N="39" REF="33"/>
it your self for any other Place: which
is too tedious here to Insert.</P>
<P>Then go down to <HI>Cunnis-Hole,</HI> or else
<HI>Maries-Hole;</HI> where pull out your
<HI>Tackle,</HI> and Fish there-abouts; First,
Plumming your Ground exactly, that
your <HI>Paste</HI> may swim within half an Inch
of the bottom.</P>
<P>The Plummets must be made of Lead,
with a Pin in them, after this man∣ner,
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of lead plummets</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>
some bigger,
and some lesser, according to the size of
your Line: And be sure that you find
your Ground eeven at the bottom; and
if it be between two little Ascents, the
Place is the better.</P>
<P>Then seeing your Float swim, accor∣ding
as you would have it, you must (in
that very Place) throw in some of your
Ground-Bait; and if it be in a Stream,
you must knead a little Pibble Stone, in∣to
some of your Ground-Bait, in the fa∣shion
of a Ball, of this size;
and that will sink it to the
bottom, which other∣wise
the Water would
cary away: And when
you have thrown in five
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram showing size of float</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="40" REF="34"/>
or six of these Balls, you may Fish there.</P>
<P>The more you are out of sight the
better; and you must be sure that you
put not a bigger Bait upon the Point of
your Hook, of your <HI>Red-Paste,</HI> than
this size, <HI>viz.</HI> <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram showing size of bait</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>; For, if you do, the <HI>Fish</HI>
will bob &amp; bob at it, and make you think
you have a Bite, when you have not.</P>
<P>Now, you must observe, That your
Float swim just over the Place, where
your <HI>Ground-Bait</HI> lies; and then obser∣ving
(with a diligent and quick Eye)
the first Motion of your Float, that then
you strike gently; and, according as
as you find the weight of the Fish you
have hold of, to play him: You need not
doubt of Sport enough, following but
these Directions.</P>
<P>There is an excellent <HI>Stand,</HI> in the
second <HI>Meddow,</HI> on the left-hand, be∣yond
the <HI>Ferry,</HI> under a <HI>Willow-Tree;</HI>
in the midst of the <HI>Meddow,</HI> by the
Water-side.</P>
<P>But in my former Piece (where I did
speak of the <HI>Chub</HI>), I did promise that I
would give farther Directions for the
Taking of him; So that, now, I intend
to perform it. And now, when you
have filled your Basket of <HI>Roach,</HI> and
<HI>Dace;</HI> or else the Wind is so high, that
<PB N="41" REF="34"/>
you cannot well Angle for them, or
that you find they will not bite; then I
would have you try this way (which
I am going about to teach you) to Take
a <HI>Chub:</HI> And first, observe, That here
are large ones in <HI>Hackney;</HI> and there∣fore,
provide you strong Silk, and
Hair Lines, with your <HI>Swan</HI>'s-Quill-Floats,
as was before directed: And
walk either up or down the River, till
you see a Place clear from Weeds, that
you can swim your Float half a score
yards without danger of Entangling:
But if you knew the place before, it
would be better; for fear your coming
too near the Water should fright away
the <HI>Chubs,</HI> that may, peradventure, be
there: But this must be in such a Place
as I told you before (in my Discourse
of the <HI>Chub</HI> or <HI>Cheven</HI>); where the <HI>Chub,</HI>
or <HI>Cheven</HI>'s Haunts are.</P>
<P>Then must you keep as much out of
sight as you can, that you can but just
see the Top of your Float swim; And
having baited your Hook with a Pellet
of <HI>Paste</HI> thus big <FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram showing size of pellet</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>, you must first
throw in a Ball of your Ground-bait, about
<PB N="42" REF="35"/>
as big as a Walnut without a stone in it,
a little broken between your Fingers;
and then follow it with your baited
Hook, and it is very likely you will
have a Fish within eight or ten Swims,
or else there is none there. But trying
two or three likely Places, you need
not doubt of having a good <HI>Chub,</HI> or
<HI>Cheven.</HI> If you fail in your Expecta∣tion
of <HI>Chub-Fishing,</HI> then be upon the
Drable for a <HI>Barbel,</HI> which is in this na∣ture:
You must have a strong Line, of
about six yards long of Hair and Silk;
which must be put (before you fasten
it to your Rod) through a piece of
Lead thus
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>diagram showing line and lead</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>
that it may slip to and fro, if any thing
bite at it; and that the Water may
move it upon the Ground, which will
entice the <HI>Barbel</HI> to bite without Suspi∣tion
of Danger: And being baited with
a good <HI>Lob-Worm,</HI> it is not much to be
questioned, but you will Catch a <HI>Bar∣bel.</HI></P>

<HEAD>How to Make the <HI>Ground-Bait.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOw, by reason that some People
in the Country may be ignorant
of the way of Making this <HI>Ground-Bait,</HI>
I thought meet to let such know,
that it is made by cutting a two-penny,
or three penny Loafe (according to the
quantity you would make) into Slices,
and lay them in soake into a Platter of
fair Water; which, being soaked half
a quarter of an Hour, powr the Water
from it; and with Bran, make the Bread
up into a Stiffe <HI>Paste;</HI> and then make
that <HI>Paste</HI> up into two or three large
Balls for your use; which you must
make use of according to my former
Directions. But note, If you Fish in
a <HI>Pond</HI> you need not put Stones into
your Bait, but rather Crumble it.</P>
</DIV2>

<P>THis is made by the cutting off, of

is two or three dayes old; and
holding it in your hands, being clean
washed, about two Minutes in fair Wa∣ter
till it be soaked; then squeeze out
the Water: and (with a little Pains in
working of it in your hands) it will
come to be a very stiffe <HI>Paste,</HI> and hang
mightily upon the Hook without wa∣shing
off. You may colour it with a lit∣tle
red Lead, either more or less, ac∣cording
as you find it most agreeable to
the colour of the Water where you
Fish.</P>
<P>There are many sorts of <HI>Pastes;</HI> but
I esteem this the best for any Fish, ex∣cepting
a <HI>Carp;</HI> for, they love sweet
<HI>Pastes</HI> best, as those made of <HI>Bean-Flower,
Honey,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I might say more, but I think this suf∣ficient;
only letting you know, that if
you would be set-out like a <HI>Fisher-man,</HI>
as you ought to be: Then, when-ever
<PB N="45" REF="36"/>
you go out to Fish, faill not to have
with you, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>A good Coat for all Weathers.</P>
<P>An <HI>Apron</HI> to put your <HI>Ground-Bait,
Stones,</HI> and <HI>Paste</HI> in.</P>
<P>A Basket to put your <HI>Fish</HI> in.</P>
<P>A neat-<HI>Rod</HI> of about four Foot long, in
several pieces, one within another.</P>
<P>Two or three Lines fitted up, of all
Sorts.</P>
<P><HI>Spare</HI> Hooks, Links, Floats, Silk, Wax,
Plummets, Caps, Floats, <HI>and a</HI> Lan∣ding-Nett,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And if you have a Boy to go along with
you, a good <HI>Neats-Tongue,</HI> and a
Bottle of <HI>Canary</HI> should not be wan∣ting:
To the Enjoyment of which I
leave You.</P>
