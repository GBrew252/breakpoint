<HEAD>To the Honorable sir George Cary Knight, sonne and heire to my Lord Chamberlaine, gouernour <HI>of the Ile of Wight, and Knight Marshall of England,</HI> Tho. Churchyard <HI>wisheth great worldly hap, encrease of honor, and heauenly bles∣sednes.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N remembring many curtesies, good turnes, rare fauor, and friend∣ship flowing from your Honorable disposition in this ebbing age, I vowed being found in seruiceable maner to requite: but sicke, am for∣ced to write the opinions of many Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen (captaines and cheefe∣taines of great charge) touching the court and the wars. And for that I serued vnder them, I set downe the words I heard many of them speake of those two honorable points, and discourses. First at Lawndersey sir Thomas Wyet, Wallop, Bellingam, &amp; many more knights there. Then at Bollain the Lord Poynings, sir Rafe Elderkar, sir Iames Crofts, and other knights there. The Lord Gray at Giens, sir Harry Palmer, sir Lewis Dyue, sir Richard Bray, &amp; many more there. At Hams the Lord Dudley, and many gentlemen there. At Callis the Lord Haward, sir William Drury, sir Anthony Ager, sir Thomas Corn∣wallys, and a number of knights and gentlemen there. In Flaunders sir Anthony Sturley, captaine Matson, Sy∣byll, Horssey, Ieynks, Plonket, Hynde, and many more captaines there. At Metts in Lorraine captaine Farnam, and in that towne the Lord Admirall that now is, I be∣ing without with sundry English Gentlemen there. In
<PB REF="3"/>
France captaine Krayar, Sutton, Twytty, Blunt, Dry∣uar, and numbers of captaines there. In Scotland where I was taken prisoner, sir William Winter, sir William Woodhouse, and many knights and captaines there: the Lord Clynton our Admirall then. At Burty Cragge sir Iohn Luttrell. At Dondee captaine Marry Church, and sundry gentlemen there. In Haddington sir Iames Wilford, sir Arthur Manering, and many other knights and captaines there. In Lawtherfort, sir Hue Wyllowby, captaine Colby, captaine Hales, and many more there. In Ireland sir William Bellingam, sir Anthony Sellen∣ger, sir Henry Sydney, sir Iames Crofts: all these then deputies, and many knights and captaines there, at their commaundment. In Anwerpe after these things my selfe the chiefe captaine there then. In Brabant, Zeland, and Holland vnder sir Thomas Morgan, sir Humfrey Gylbart, and sundry knights, there seruing a great sea∣son. In Scotland before vnder the Lord Gray at the siege of Leeth, where sir William Pellam, sir George Haward, sir Andrew Corbet, and a number of knights were, be∣sides many captaines and gentlemen of good woorth. In Gyens when it was lost, a captaine my selfe, and ta∣ken prisoner vnder the old Lord Gray, sir Harry Palmar, master Cripps, and other captaines there. In Ireland againe vnder sir Harry Sydney, where sir Harry Har∣rington, sir Edward Moore, sir Nicholas Bagnall, and a great company of knights and captaines were, from whom I went to the noble Earle of Ormond. In Garn∣zey, with sir Thomas Leighton in good credit and charge a good while. In Anwarpe againe, when sir Iohn Norrice, sir Thomas Morgan, sir Edward Hobby, and a number of honorable personages brought ouer Moun∣sior

thither. Thus making those seruices and many more a benefit to my knowledge, &amp; gathering some od notes and sentences among those Honorable and marshall people, I bethought me thereof now in my last sicknes peraduenture, and willing not to smoother them vp in silence, haue published as followes in verse, what the opinion of many dead and aliue hath been both of ho∣norable Court and Warres: dedicating the whole iudgement thereof to your good consideration, bicause you are Knight Marshall of England, and knowes much of marshall causes. After whose good liking I do com∣mend the work to the whole world, humbly desiring you to reade with good will, iudge with milde discretion, and rather commend than condemne: not thereby crauing better credit than it may merit, nor lesse thanks than an honest writer looketh for: though not finely written yet faithfully meant in plainest termes, bicause cunning phrases sauour of the schoole, where seldome I haue sto∣len any great learning, nor robbed good schollers of their bookes. If God freely gaue, I haue frankly bestowed it, neither a niggard of my verses, nor sparing of my words, but spending my muse and matter as plentifully as though I had good store thereof: take it in good part so the writer stands pleased, God so knoweth, who en∣crease you in honor and durable credit. </P>

<L>WElth, pomp and pride, with malice of the mind</L>
<L>Bred wars &amp; broils, between two brethren furst,</L>
<L>The one feard God, the other most vnkind,</L>
<L>For his foule fact, in world was held accurst.</L>
<L>Though wars began, throw pride and great offence,</L>
<L>As rods are made, to scourge leud vicious life,</L>
<L>Yet fearfull wars, hath wrought great goodnes sence,</L>
<L>And planted peace, where was but blooddy strife:</L>
<L>Wars makes men looke, to soule and body too,</L>
<L>Which in no sort, proud peace can neuer doo.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who sees but death, aud danger feareth God,</L>
<L>A greater feare, no man aliue may haue,</L>
<L>As horse fears whip, and scholler fears the rod,</L>
<L>So sword is feard, that quickly brings a graue.</L>
<L>Wars makes men meeke, vertuous, valiant and wise,</L>
<L>Hardy and bold, forward, faithfull and true,</L>
<L>Goodnes imbrace, and villany despise,</L>
<L>Killeth old vice, and forms a man anue:</L>
<L>Quickneth the sprites, and kindleth courage still,</L>
<L>That else growes cold, weake, resty, dull and ill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wars is no trade, for milksops, dawes and dolts,</L>
<L>Meacocks of kinde, and cowards from their birth,</L>
<L>A spur for old Iades, a snaffle for yoong colts,</L>
<L>For lusty lads, the greatest ioy on earth,</L>
<L>Breeds gallants vp, puts lions harts in men,</L>
<L>Breathes blood and life, into a trembling brest,</L>
<L>Makes hand draw sword, and fling away the pen,</L>
<L>Mount a great horse, and clap the launce in rest,</L>
<L>And woonders do, as Samson did in feeld,</L>
<L>Whose stoutnes made, the proud Philistines yeeld.</L>

<L><PB REF="11"/>Wars wisely made, Brings triumph to the towne,</L>
<L>Sends victors out, to fetch great wealth from far,</L>
<L>Keepes kings in seat, giues honor to the crowne,</L>
<L>And no great fame is found where is no war.</L>
<L>Set wars aside, bid men go spin and card,</L>
<L>Distaffs are fine, when launce is flung away,</L>
<L>Make no more knights, let cowards be prefard,</L>
<L>Set lowts aworke, bid soldiers then go play:</L>
<L>So pluck downe wars, and set vp Robin Whood,</L>

<L>Wars was a wand, for wantons that were wilde,</L>
<L>It made them tame, and greater maruels wrought,</L>
<L>But where you see, that wars are clean exilde,</L>
<L>Stout people faint, and kingdom coms to naught:</L>
<L>Venus and lust, are great togither still,</L>
<L>Right taketh wrong, and reason rules no whit,</L>
<L>Weake knees must bow, strong head will haue his wil,</L>
<L>And bayard blinde, in teeth doth take the bit:</L>
<L>Thus want of wars, confounds a woorthy state,</L>
<L>And breeds at home, both quarrels and debate.</L>

<L>Wars was and is, and shall be till worlds end,</L>
<L>Till iudgement day, you shall haue little peace,</L>
<L>You say it is, a scourge that God doth send,</L>
<L>A common plague for sin that shall not seace,</L>
<L>Thinke so and make of wars your profit then,</L>
<L>For soule at least. thus wars ve ought to loue,</L>
