<HEAD>To the Right Hono∣rable,
Phillip Earle of Arundell: Phillip
Stubbes wisheth helth of body &amp; soule, fauour
of God, increase of Godly honour, re∣ward
of laudable vertue, and eter∣nall
felicitie, in the Heauens,
by IESVS Christ.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">NOBILITAS Patriae DECVS</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Lord our God (right
honorable) hauing by the power of
his word, created Heauen and Earth,
with all thinges what soeuer, for the
comfort and vse of Man: the last of
all other (euen the sixt daye) made
Man after his owne similitude and
likenesse, that in him he might be glorified aboue all
other Creatures. And therfore, wheras in making of
other thinges, he vsed onely this Woord, FIANT, be they
made, or let them be made: when he came to make Man,
as it weare aduysing himselfe, and asking councell at his
wisdome, he said, FACIAMVS HOMINEM, let vs make▪ Man,
that is a wōderful Creature: and therfore is called in greek
MICROCOSMOS, a litle world in himself. And truely he
is no lesse, whether we consider his spirituall soule, or his
humaine body. For what Creature is theare vppon the
face of the Earth comparable to man, either in body or in
mind? what creature hath a soule immortall inherent in
his body, but onely Man? what Creature can forsee things
<PB REF="3"/>
to come, remember things past, or iudg of things present,
but onely man? what Creature beareth the ymage of God
about with him, but Man? what Creature is made so erect
to behould the Heauens, as man? What Creature may be
likened to man, either in proportiō of body, or gifts of the
soule? And (finally) what Creature hath the promise of the
resurrectiō &amp; glorificatiō of their bodies, &amp; of eternall life
but onely Man? Than seeing the Lorde hath made Man
thus glorious, and preferred him in euery degree, before al
other Creatures (the Angelicall Creatures set a part) it is
manifest, he hath done it to some end &amp; purpose, namely,
that he might be glorified in him, and by him aboue all
other his works, according to the measure of his integritie
excellency and perfection. And hereby we may learn that
it is the will of GOD, that we bend all our force to the
aduauncing of his glorious Name, the edification of his
People, and the building vp of his Church, which he hath
redemed with the bloud of his deare Sonne.</P>
<P>Which thing (mee think) is notably figured foorth vn∣to
vs in the .25. of EXODVS wher the Lord commaunded
Moyses to build him a Tabernacle, or howse of prayer, to
this end and purpose (doubtles) that therin his lawe might
be read, his Ceremonies practised, Sacrifices, Victimates &amp;
Holocaustes offred, and his glorious Name called vppon
and obeyed. To the erection wherof, euery one conferred
some what, some brought gold, some siluer, &amp; some brasse,
lead &amp; tinne, other brought silk, purple, skarlet, and other
ornaments, and the meanest brought some what, namely,
skins heare, sand, lyme, morter, wood, stone, and such like.
Euen so (right honorable) would the Lord haue euery one
to conferre some what, euen such as he hath, to the buil∣ding
of his spirituall howse, the Church purchased with
the bloud of Christ. Wherfore seeing it is so, that euery
one is to further this spirituall building to his possible
power, I haue rather chosen with the simplest, and meanest
sort to bring, though but heyre, sand, skins, lyme, morter,
<PB REF="3"/>
wood or stones, than altogether to contribute nothing.</P>
<P>Not doubting, but that the chief Maister and Builder
of this howse, Christ Iesus, will not dislike, but accept of
my poore contribution, no lesse than he did of the poore
wydowes Mite, to whom was imputed that she had cast
more, in Gazophilatium Templi, into the treasury of the
Temple, than all the rest: for what she wanted in effect,
that she supplyed in affect, And for that also the Lord our
GOD committing his talēts to euery one, whether more
or lesse, not onely requireth of vs the same againe simply,
but also, as a straight computist, demaundeth interest and
gaine of euery one of vs: &amp; for that not only, he is a mur∣therer
&amp; a Homicide before God, who slayeth or killeth,
a Man with materiall sword▪ but he also, vho may preuent
the same, and will not. And not onely, he is guiltie of
haynous transgression that committeth any euill really,
but also he who consenteth to it as he doth, who holdeth
his peace, or he who by any means might auoid it, and ei∣ther
for negligence wil not, or for feare of the world dare
not. Therfore, albe it, that I haue receiued, but one poore
talēt, or rather the shadow of one, yet least I might be re∣proued
(with that vnprofitable Seruaunt) for hyding my
small talent in the Earth▪ not profiting therwith at all, ei∣ther
my self, or others, I haue aduētured the making of this
litle treatise, intituled, (The Anatomy of Abuses,) hoping
that the same (by diuyne assistance) shall somewhat con∣duce
to the building of this spirituall howse of the Lord.</P>
<P>And although I be one (most honorable Lord) that can
do least in this Godly course of life (palpable barbarisme
forbidding mee so much as once to enter into Wysdomes
school) yet for that somewil not, for feare of losing world∣ly
promotion (though in the meane tyme they lose the
Kingdome of Heauen,) Other some dare not for displea∣sing
the world: I say, for these, &amp; semblable causes toge∣ther,
with the zeale and goodwill I beare vnto my Coun∣trey,
and feruent desire of their conuersion and amende∣ment,
<PB REF="4"/>
I haue taken vpon me the contryuing of this book:
Which GOD, graunt may be with like plausible alacritie
receiued, as with paines and good will, I haue published
it, for the benefit of my Cuntrey, the pleasure of the God∣ly,
and amendement of the wicked. And I doubt not,
that as none, but the wicked, and peruerse whose gawld
backes are tutched, will repyne against mee, so the Godly
and vertuous, will accept of this my labour, and trauaile
herein, whose gentle fauour and goodwill, shall coun∣terpoyse,
(and farre surmount with mee) the maligne sto∣macks,
and stearn countenances of the other. After that
I had (right honorable) fully perfected this booke, I was
minded, notwithstanding, both in regard of the straunge∣nes
of the matter it intreateth of, and also in respect of the
rudenesse of my penne, to haue suppressed it for euer, for
diuerse and sundrie causes, and neuer to haue offred it to
the viewe of the world. But, notwithstanding, being ouer∣come
by the importunat request, and infagitable desire of
my freinds, I graūted to publish the same, as now you see,
is extant.</P>
<P>But, when I had once graunted to imprinte the same, I
was in greatter doubt than before, fearinge, to whome I
might dedicate the same so rude and impolished a worke.
And withall I was not ignorant, how hard a thing it is in
these daies to finde a Patrone of such books as this, which
sheweth to euery one his sin, and discouereth euery Mans
wicked waies, which indeed, the vngodly cā not at any hād
abyde, but as it were mad-mē disgorging their stomacks
(Cum in Authorē tum in codicem plenis buccis,
&amp; dentibus plusquàm caninis rabidè feruntur:)
they rage, they fume and rayle both against the AVTHOR
and his booke. Thus (vacillante animo) my minde
wandring too and fro, and resting, as it weare in extasie
of despaire, at last I called to mind your honorable Lord∣ship,
whose praises haue pearced the Skyes, and whose lau∣dable
vertues are blowen, not ouer the realme of England
<PB REF="4"/>
onely, but euen to the furthest costs and parts of the world.</P>
<P>All whose vertues, and condigne prayses, if I should
take vppon mee to recounte, I might as well number the
starres in the Sky, or grasse of the Earth.</P>
<P>For, for Godly Wysdome, and zeale to the truth, is
not your good Lordship (without offence be it spoken)
comparable with the best? For sobrietie, affabilite, and
gentle curtesie to euerie one, farre excelling many.</P>
<P>For your great de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otion and compassion to the poore
oppressed, in all places famous: For Godly fidelitie, to
your Soueraigne, loue to the CVNTREY, and ver∣tues
in generall, euerie where most renowmed.</P>
<P>But least I might obscure, your Worthie commenda∣tions
with my vnlearned penne, (lytle, or no thing
at all emphaticall) I will rather surcease, than further
to proceed, contenting my selfe rather to haue giuen a
shadowe of them, than to haue ciphered them foorth,
which indeed are both infinit, and inexplicable.</P>
<P>In consideration (whereof) not withstanding that
my Booke be simpler, baser, and meaner, than that it may
(without blushing) present it self to your good Lord∣ship
(being farre vnworthie of such an honorable Per∣sonage)
yet accordinge to your accustomed clemency
I most humbly beseache your good Lordship to receiue
the same into your honors Patrociny and protection, ac∣cepting
it as an infallible token of my faithfull heart,
seruice, and good will towardes your honorable Lord∣ship:
For proofe whereof, would GOD it might once
come to passe, that if not otherwyse, yet with my hum∣ble
seruice, I might shewe foorth the faithfull and euer
willing heart I beare in brest to your good Lorde∣ship,
protesting before Heauen and Earth, that though
power want yet shall fidelitie, and faithfulnes faile neuer.</P>
<P>And because, this my Booke is subiect (my verie good
Lord (to as many reproches, tauntes and reproofes, as euer
was any litle book (for that few cā abyde to haue their sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="5"/>
detected) therfore I haue had the greatter care to commit
the same to the guardance and defence of your honour,
rather than to manie others, not onely for that GOD hath
made your honour a Lamp of light vnto the world, of true
nobilitie and of al integritie and perfection, but also hath
made you his substitute, or vicegerent, to reforme vices,
punish abuses, and correcte sinne.</P>
<P>And as in mercie he hath giuen you this power and au∣toritie,
so hath he giuen you a hungrie desire to accom∣plish
the same according to his will: Which zeal in your
sacred brest, the LORD increase for euer.</P>
<P>And as your Lordship knoweth, reformation of maners
and amendement of lyfe, was neuer more needfull, for,
was pride (the chiefest argument of this Booke) euer so
rype? Do not, both Men and Women (for the most part)
euery one in generall go attyred in silks, veluets, damasks,
satans, and what not? which are attyre onely for the no∣bilitie
and gentrie, and not for the other at anie hand? Are
not vnlawfull games, Playes and Enterluds, and the like
euery where vsed? Is not whordome, couetousnes, vsurie &amp;
the like daylie practised without all punishment or lawe?</P>
<P>But hereof I say no more, referring the consideration,
both of these and the rest, to your Godly wysdome. Besea∣seaching
your good Lordship, to perdon my presumption
in speaking thus much, for (Zelus domini huc adegit me:)
the zeal of my God hath dryuen me heather.</P>
<P>Knowinge, that the LORD hath ordeined you, to
himselfe a chosen vessell of honour, to purge his Church
of these Abuses, and corruptions, which as in a table are
depainted and set foorth in this litle booke.</P>
<P>Thus I cease to molest your sacred eare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s any further with
my rude speaches, most hūbly beseaching your good Lord
ship not onely to admit this my Book into your honours
patronage and defence, but also to persist the iust Defen∣der
therof, against the swynish crew of rayling ZOILVS
and flowting MOMVS, with their complices, to whome
<PB REF="5"/>
it is easier to depraue all things, than to amend any thing
them selues. Which, if I shall perceiue to be accepted of
your honour, besides that I shal not care for a thousand o∣thers,
disliking the same, I shall not only think my self to
haue receiued a sufficiēt guerdon for my p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es, &amp; shalbe
therby greatly incoraged (if GOD permit) hereafter, to
take in hand some memorable thing to your immortall
prayse, honour and renowne, but also shall daylie pray to
GOD, for your good Lordship long to continue,
to his good pleasure and your harts desire,
with increase of Godly honour, re∣ward
of laudable vertue, and
eternall felicitie in the
HEAVENS, by
Iesus Christ.</P>

<HEAD>A PREFACE
TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Thought it conuenient (good
Reader,</HI> who soeuer thou art, y<SUP>t</SUP>
shalt read these my poore labou∣res)
to admonish thée (least hap∣ly
y<SUP>u</SUP> mightest take my woords
otherwise than I meant them)
of this one thing: That wheras in the processe
of this my booke, I haue intreated of certen ex∣ercyses,
vsually practised amongest vs, as name∣ly
of Playes and Enterludes, of dauncing, ga∣ming,
and such other like: I would not haue
thée so, to take mée, as though my speaches ten∣ded,
to the ouerthrowe and vtter disliking of all
kynd of exercyses in generall: that is nothing
my simple meaning. But the particulare Abu∣ses,
which are crept into euery one of these seue∣rall
exercyses, is the onely thing, which I think
worthie of reprehension.</P>
<P>For, otherwise (all Abuses cut away) who séeth
not, y<SUP>t</SUP> some kind of playes, tragedies and enter∣luds
in their own nature, are not onely of great
anciētie, but also very honest and very commen∣dable
<PB REF="6"/>
exercyses, being vsed and practised in most
Christian common weales, as which containe
matter (such they may be) both of doctrine, eru∣dition,
good example and wholsome instruction?
And may be vsed in tyme and place conuenient,
as conducible to example of life and reformation
of maners. For such is our grosse &amp; dull nature,
that what thing we sée opposite before our eyes,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o pearce further, and printe déeper in our harts
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd minds, than that thing, which is hard onely
with the eares, as <HI>Horace,</HI> the hethen <HI>Poët</HI> can
witnesse. <HI>Segnius irritant animum, dimissa per
aures, quàm quae sunt hominum occulis obiecta.</HI>
So, that when honest &amp; chast playes, tragedies,
&amp; enterluds, are vsed to these ends, for the Godly
recreatiō of the mind, for the good example of life,
for the auoyding of that, which is euill, and lear∣ning
of that which is good, thā are they very tol∣lerable
exercyses. But being vsed (as now com∣monly
they be) to the prophanation of the Lord
his sabaoth, to the alluring and inuegling of the
People from the blessed word of God preached,
to Theaters and vnclean assemblies, to ydlenes,
vnthriftynes, whordome, wantōnes, drunkēnes,
and what not? and which is more, when they
are vsed to this end, to maintaine a great sort of
ydle Persons, doing nothing, but playing and
loytring, hauing their lyuings of the sweat of
other Mens browes, much like vnto dronets de∣uouring
y<SUP>e</SUP> swéet honie of y<SUP>e</SUP> poore labouring bees,
<PB REF="7"/>
than are they exercyses (at no hand) sufferable.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But being vsed to the ends that I haue said,
they are not to be disliked of any sober, and wise
Christian.</P>
<P>And as concerning dauncing, I wold not haue
thée (good <HI>Reader</HI>) to think that I condemne the
exercyse it self altogether, for I know the wisest
Sages and the Godlyest Fathers and Patriar∣ches
that euer liued, haue now and than vsed the
same, as <HI>Dauid, Salomon,</HI> and many others: but
my woords doo touch &amp; cōcerne the Abuses there∣of
onely. As being vsed vppon the Sabaoth
day, from morning vntill night, in publique as∣semblies
and frequencies of People, Men &amp; wo∣men
together, with pyping, fluting, dromming,
and such like inticements to wantonnesse &amp; sin,
together with their leapinges, skippings, &amp; other
vnchast gestures, not a few. Being vsed, or ra∣ther
abused in this sort, I vtterly discommend it.</P>
<P>But vppon the otherside, being vsed in a mans
priuat-chamber, or howse for his Godly solace,
and recreation in the feare of GOD, or other∣wise
abroade with respect had to the time, place
and persons, it is in no respect to be disalowed.</P>
<P>And wheras I speake of gaming, my meaning
is not, that it is an exercise altogether vnlawful.
For, I know that one Christian may play with
another, at any kind of Godly, honest, ciuile ga∣me,
or exercise, for the mutuall recreation one of
the other, so that they be not inflamed with co∣ueitousnes,
<PB REF="7"/>
or desire of vnlawfull gaine: for the
cōmaundemēt saith, thou shalt not couet: wher∣fore,
if any be voide of these affections, playing ra¦ther
for his Godly recreation, than for desire of
filthie lucre, he may vse the same in the feare of
God: yet so as the vse therof be not a let, or hin∣derance
vnto him, to any other Godly exploit.</P>
<P>But, if a man make (as it weare) an occupation
of it, spending both his tyme and goods therein,
frequenting, gaming howses, bowling allyes,
and such other places, for gréedinesse of lucre, to
him it is an exercise altogether discommendable
and vnlawfull. Wherfore, as these be exercy∣ses
lawfull, to them that know how to vse them
in the feare of GOD, so are they practises at no
hand sufferable to them that abuse thē, as I haue
shewed. But take away the abuses, the thinges
in themselues are not euill, being vsed as instru∣ments
to Godlynes, not made as spurres vnto
vice. There is nothing so good, but it may be a∣bused,
yet because of y<SUP>e</SUP> abuses, I am not so strict,
that I wold haue the things, themselues remoo∣ued,
no more than I wold meat and drinke, be∣it
is abused, vtterly to be taken away.</P>
<P>And wheras also I haue spoken of the excesse
in Apparell, and of the Abuse of the same, as wel
in men, as in women generally, I wold not be
so vnderstood, as though my speaches extēded, to
any, either noble, honorable, or worshipful: for, I
am so farre from once thinking that any kind of
<PB REF="8"/>
sumptuous, or gorgeous attire is not to be worn
of any of them, as I suppose them rather Orna∣ments
in them, than otherwise.</P>
<P>And that they both may, and for some respects,
ought to were such attire (their birthes callings,
functions and estats requiring the same) for cau∣ses
in this my Booke laid downe, as maye ap∣peare,
and for the distinction of them from the
inferiour sorte, it is prouable both by the Woord
of GOD, Ancient Writers, and common
practise of all ages, People and Nations, from
the beginning of the World, to this day.</P>
<P>And therfore, when I speake generally of the
excesse of Apparell, my meaning is of the infe∣riour
sorte onely, who for the most parte do farre
surpasse, either noble, honorable, or worshipfull,

corruption of our nature, and the intest∣ine

Iesus, to walke in newnesse of life and to
worke our saluation in feare and trembling,
as the Apostle saith, and our sauiour Christ
biddeth vs so work, as our workes may glo∣rifie
our heauenlye Father. But (alas) the
contrarie is most true, for there is no sinne,
that was euer broached in any age, which
florisheth not nowe. And therfore the fear∣full
daie of the Lord cannot be farre of: at
which day all the World shall stand in fla∣shing
fier, and than shall Christ our Sauiour
come marching in y<SUP>•</SUP> clowdes of heauen, with

<HI>Anima quae peccauerit, ipsa morietur</HI>
y<SUP>e</SUP> soule that sinneth shall dy: wherfore surcease
to sorow or greeue any more for them: for they

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh brother, ther is no christē mā, in
whose hart shineth <HI>scintillula aliqua pietatis,</HI>
any sparke of God his grace, which will not
gréeue to sée his brethren &amp; sisters in the Lord,
members of the same body, coheyres of y<SUP>e</SUP> same
kingdom, &amp; purchased with one &amp; the same ine¦stimable
price of Christ his bloud, to runne
thus desperatlie into the gulphe of destruction
and laberinth of perdition. If the least and
meanest member of thy whole body, be hurt,
wounded, cicatriced or brused, doth not the
hart, and euerie member of thy body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mutuall harmonie of one member with an other</NOTE> feele the
anguish and paine of the grieued parte, seking
&amp; endeuouring them selues, euery one in his
office &amp; calling, to repaire the same, and neuer
ioying, vntill that be restored again to his for∣mer
integritie &amp; perfection? Which thinge in
the balance of Christian charity, consideratly
weighed, may mooue any good Man to mourn
for their defection, and to assay, by all possible
means, to reduce them home again, that their
soules maie be saued in the daye of the Lord.
And the Apostle commandeth vs, that we be
<HI>(alter alterius emolumento)</HI> an ayde and helpe
one to an other. And that we do good to all
men, <HI>dum tempus habemus,</HI> whylest we haue
tyme. To wéepe with them that weepe,
to mourne with them that mourne, and
<PB REF="15"/>
to be of like affection one towardes an other.
And common reason aduertiseth vs, that wee
are not borne for our selues onelie: for, <HI>Ortus

vendicant.</HI> Our Countrey challengeth
a part of our byrth, our brethren and frendes
require an other parte,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No mā born for himselfe.</NOTE> and our parentes (and
that <HI>optimo iure</HI>) doe vendicate a third parte▪
Wherefore I will assay to doe them good (if I
can) in discouering their abuses, and laying o∣pen
their inormities, that they séeing the grée∣uousnes

diseases, may in time seeke to the true Phisiti∣on,

which both are deadly in their owne nature,
and which offende the maiestie of God moste.
Mée thinke you shake hands with the sworne
enemies of God the Papistes, who say, there
are two kindes of sinne, the one veniall, the o∣ther
lethall or deadly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">All sinne in it owne na∣ture is mor∣tall.</NOTE> But you must vnder∣stand,

And againe, there is no sinne so gréeuous,
which the grace and mercy of God is not able
<PB REF="16"/>
to counteruaile withal, &amp; if it bee his pleasure
to blot it out for euer. So y<SUP>t</SUP> you see now, there
is no sinn so venial, but if the mercie of God,
be not stretched out, it is damnable: nor yet a∣nie
sinne so mortall, which by the grace and
mercie of God, may not bee done away. And
therfore as we are not to presume of the one,
so wee are not to despaire of the other. But to
returne againe to y<SUP>e</SUP> satisfying of your request.
The greatest abuse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The greatest abuse which offendeth god most▪ is pride.</NOTE> which both offendeth god
moste, &amp; is there not a little aduaunced, is the
execrable sinne of Pride, and excesse in appa∣rell,

incessantly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wherfore haue you intēded to speak

some other purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philo.</SPEAKER>
<P>For no other cause,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pride the be∣gyning of all euill.</NOTE> but for that I
thinke it to bee, not onely euill and damnable
in it owne nature, but also the verie efficient
cause of all euills. And therfore the wise man
was bolde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ECCLES. 10.</NOTE> to call it <HI>Initium omnium malo∣rum,</HI>
the beginning and welspring of al euils.
For as from the roote all natural thinges doe
grow, &amp; take their beginning: so from y<SUP>e</SUP> cursed
<PB REF="16"/>
roote of pestiferous Pride do all other euilles
sproute, and thereof are ingenerate. Therfore
may Pride be called not improperly, <HI>Mater∣cula

nothyng lesse: And in respect of himselfe, con∣tempneth,
vilefieth and reproacheth all men,
thinking none comparable to him selfe, whose
righteousnes, notwithstanding, is lyke to the

<P>And this sinne of Apparell (as I haue sayde

the sinne of the heart, hurteth none, but the
Author, in whom it bréedeth, so long as it bur∣steth

Pride of the mouth (whiche consisteth, as I

<P>This is but a visour, or cloke, to hide

to ancient writers,) the <HI>Egyptiās</HI> are said, ne∣uer
to haue chāged their fashion, or altered the
forme of their first Attire, from the beginning
to this day: as <HI>Iacobus Stuperius, lib. de diuer
sis nostrae aetatis habitibus, Pag.</HI> 16, affirmeth:
The <HI>Grecians,</HI> are saide, to vse but one kynde
of Apparell without any chaunge: that is to
<PB REF="19"/>
wit: a longe Gowne, reaching downe to the

<P>The <HI>Germaynes,</HI> are thought to be so pre∣cise
in obseruing one vniforme fashion in Ap∣parell,
as they haue neuer recéeded from their

these wordes: <HI>Non enim mores leuiter mu∣tare
vetustos, Germanus vnqnam consueuit
incola:</HI> Whiche in Englysh Uerse, is thus
muche in effect.</P>
<L>¶The Germayne people neuer vse,</L>
<L>lightly to chop and chaunge</L>
<L>Their customes olde, or els Attyre,</L>
<L>wherin abroade they range.</L>
<P>¶The <HI>Muscouians, Athenians, Italians,
Brasilians, Affricanes, Asianes, Cantabri∣ans,
Hungarians, Ethiopians,</HI> or els, what
Nation soeuer, vnder the Sunne, are so farre
qehinde the people of <HI>Ailgna,</HI> in exquisitnesse
of Apparell, as in effect, they estéeme it litle or
nothyng at all, so it repell the colde, and couer
their shame: yea, some of them are so smally
addicted therto, that settyng apart all honestie
and shame, they go cleane naked. Other some
meanly apparelled, some in Beasts skinnes,
some in haire, &amp; what euer they can get: some
in one thing, some in another, nothing regar∣ding
eyther hosen, shoes, bands▪ ruffes, shirts,
or any thing els. And the ciuilest nations that
are, bee so farre estraunged from the pride of
<PB REF="19"/>
of apparell that they esteme him as brauelye
attyred that is clothed in our carzi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, frizes,
ruggs, and other kinds of cloth, as we do him
that is clad all ouer in silkes, veluets, satens,
damasks, grograins, taffeties, and such like.
So that herby you sée, that they speak vntruly
that say, that other nations exceede them in
brauerie of apparell. For it is manifest that
all other Nations vnder the sun how strange,
how new, how fine, or how comly soeuer they
think their fashiōs to be, when they be cōpa∣red
with the dyuerse fashions, &amp; sundrie for∣mes
of apparell in <HI>Ailgna,</HI> are most vnhand∣same,
brutish and monstrouse. And herby it
appeareth that no People in the World is so
curiouse in new fangles, as they of <HI>Ailgna</HI> be.
But graūte it were so, and admit that others
excelled them, (which is false) shall we do
euill, because they do so? shall their wicked∣nesse
excuse vs of sinne, if we commit the like
&amp; worse? shall not the soule that sinneth dye?
wherfore let vs not sinne of presumptiō, with
the multitude, because they do so, least we be
plagued with them because we doe the like.
Moreouer those Cuntreyes are rich and wel∣thie
of them selues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other coun∣treyes not to be blamed though they, go in silk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> veluets, and why:</NOTE> abounding with all kinde
of preciouse ornaments, and riche attyre, as
silks, veluets, Satens, damasks, sarcenet,
taffetie, chamlet, and such like (for al these are
made in those foraine cuntreyes) and therfore
<PB REF="20"/>
if they weare them, they are not muche to bee
blamed, as not hauing anie other kind of cloa¦thing
to couer themselues withall. So if wee
would contente our selues with such kinde of
attire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Coun∣tryes esteme not so muche of silkes, vel∣uets, as we do.</NOTE> as our owne Countrey doeth minister
vnto vs, it were much tollerable. But wee
are so surprised in Pride, that if it come not
from beyond the seas, it is not worth a straw.
And thus we impouerish our selues in buying
their trifling merchandizes, more plesant thā
necessarie, and inrich them, who rather laugh
at vs in their sléeues, than otherwise, to sée our
gret follie in affecting of trifles, &amp; departing w<SUP>t</SUP>
good merchandizes for it. And howe litle they
estéeme of silkes, veluets, satens, damasks, and
such like, wee maye easely see, in that they sell
them to vs for wolles, frizes, rugges, carzies,
and the lyke, whiche they coulde neuer doe, if
they estéemed of them as much as we doe. So
that you sée they are forced of necessytye to
weare such riche attyre, wanting other things
(whereof we haue store) to inuest themselues
withall. But who séeth not (excepte wilfullie
blynde) that no necessitie compelleth vs to
weare them hauing abundāce of other things
to attire our selues with, both hansomer, war¦mer,

a meane is to be keept, for, <HI>omne extremum

(in the feare of God) to innoble, garnishe &amp; set

into the harts of the people, to offend against

And as for the priuat subiects, it is not at any

therof, as euery one is permitted to flaūt
it out, in what apparell he lust himselfe, or

verie hard to knowe, who is noble, who is
worshipfull, who is a gentleman, who is not:
for you shall haue those, which are neither of

<P>To think that the Lorde our God is

weare, as much, as to say, that stinking pride,

that the more we syn the more we increase
his prayse and glorye. But the Lord oure
God is so farre from dilightinge in sinne,
that he adiudgeth them to eternall Death,

Than who is he that will take pleasure in

chiefest reuerence is onely to be attributed to
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wherfore man is to be worshiped and had in reuerence.</NOTE> whose sacred brest, is fraught with ver¦tue,
as it may well be called, the <HI>Promptuarie</HI>
or <HI>Receptorie</HI> of true wisdome and Godlines,
but also (in parte) for their byrthes sake, pa∣rentage
and consāguinitie, and not only that,
but also, in respect of their callings, offices and
functions, whether it be in the Temporal Ma∣gistery
a or Ecclesiastical presbitery (so lōg as
they gouerne godly and well:) For, the A∣postle
sayth, that those Elders which gouerne
wel amongst vs, are worthie of double honor:
But yet, the mā whom God hath blessed with
vertue and true godlynes, thoughe he be ney∣ther
of great byrth nor callynge, nor yet any
Magistrate whatsouer, is worthie of more re∣uerence
and estimation then any of the other,
without the ornaments of y<SUP>e</SUP> minde &amp; gifts of,
vertue aboue said. For what preuayleth it to
be borne of worshipfull progenie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gentilitie without ver∣tue is no gē∣tilitie.</NOTE> and to be
destitute of all vertue, which deserueth true
worship? what is it els, then to carie a golden

thyng els, then a goldē Coffyn or painted Se∣pulchre,
makyng a fayre showe outwardly,
but inwardly is full of all stinche, &amp; lothsom∣nes?
I remember once I red a certaine storie
of one, a Gentleman by byrth and parentage,
who greatly reproched, and withall disdayned
an other, for that he was come to great autho¦rytie
<PB REF="27"/>
onely by vertue, being but a poore mans
child by byrthe: What? saith the Gentleman
by birth, arte thou so lustie? Thou arte but a
coblers sonne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The exor∣dium of vir∣tue, is the ex∣ordium of gentilitie, &amp; worship, and want of the one, is the de∣cay of the o∣ther.</NOTE> and wilt thou compare with
me, being a Gentleman by byrth, and calling?
To whome the other answeared, thou arte no
Gentleman, for thy gentilitie endeth in thee
and I am a Gentleman, in that my gentilitie
beginneth in me. Meaning (vnlest I be decei∣ued)
that the wante of virtue in him, was the
decay of his gentility, and his vertue was the
beginning of true gentilitie in him selfe: for
virtue therfore, not for apparell, is euerye one
to be accepted. For if we should accept of men
after apparell onely respecting nothinge els,
thā shold it come to passe, that we might more
esteme of one, both meane by birth, base with∣out
virtue, seruyle by calling, &amp; poore in estate,
more than of some by birthe, noble, by virtue
honorable and by callinge laudable. And the
reason is because euery one, tagge and ragge,
go brauer, or at least as braue as those that be
both noble, honorable and worpshipfull.</P>

<SPEAKER>Spud.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Philo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indéed I suppose that the summe of

<PB REF="28"/>
or as muche holynesse in the apparell, as in

there be hoylnesse in apparell (as who is so in∣fatuat
to beleue it) than it followeth that the
holynes pretended is not in them, &amp; so be they
plaine Hipocrits to make shew of that, which
they haue not. And if y<SUP>e</SUP> holines by there attire
presaged be in them selues, thā is it not in the
garments, &amp; why do they than attribute that
to the garments, whiche is neither adherente
to the one nor yet inherent in the other? Or if
it wer so, why do they glory of it to the world,
but I leaue them to their follie, hastinge to
other matters more profitable to intreate of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spud.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I haue hard them reason thus.
That which is good in it own nature, cannot
hurt:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An argument trimly con∣tryued.</NOTE> apparell is good, and the good Creature
of God, <HI>ergo</HI> no kynde of apparell can
hurte. And if there be anie abuse in it, the
apparell knowethe it not. Therfore take
awaye the abuse, and let the apparell re∣maine
still, for so it maye (say they) without
anie hurte at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philo.</SPEAKER>
<P>These be well seasoned reasons, and
substantiall asseuerations in déed, but if they
haue no better arguments to leane vnto, than
these, their kingdome of Pride will shortlie,
fall without all hope of recouerie againe.</P>
<P>The apparell in it owne nature is good,
and the good Creature of God (I will not de∣nie)
<PB REF="28"/>
and cannot hurte except it be thorowe
ouer owne wickednesse abused. And therfore
wo be to them that make the good Creatures
of God instruments of dampnation to them
selues, by not vsing them, but abusing them.
And yet not withstanding, it maye be said, to
hurte, or not to hurte, as it is abused, or not a∣bused.
And wheras they would haue the a∣buse
of apparell (if any be) taken away, and
the apparell to remain still, it is impossible to
supplant the one, without the extirpation of
the other also. For it is trulye said, <HI>sublata
causa, tollitur effectus:</HI> But not, <HI>subrepto effe∣ctu,
tollitur causa.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vnpossible to take away pride, except sumptuouse apparell be taken away also.</NOTE> Take away the cause, and
the effecte falleth, but not contrarylye, take
away the effect, and the cause falleth. The
efficiente cause of Pride is gorgiouse attire,
the effect is pride it selfe ingenerate by attire:
But to begin to plucke awaie the effecte (to
wit pride) and not to take awaye the cause
first (namelie sumptuouse attyre) is as if
a man intendinge to suppl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t a Trée by the
rootes, should begin to pull <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he fruite, and
braunches onelye, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or to pull downe hea∣uen,
should dig in the earthe, workinge alto∣gether
preposterouslie, and indyreclye.</P>
<P>And the reason is, these two collaterall
Cosins, apparell, and Pride (the Mother
and Daughter<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apparell and pride combi∣ned togethe∣as mother, &amp; daughter.</NOTE> of mischiefe) are so combi∣nate
together, and incorporate the one in
<PB REF="29"/>
the other, as the one can hardlie be dyuorced
from the other, without the distructiō of them
both. To the accomplishmente wherof God
graunte that those holsome lawes, sanctions,
and statuts, which by our most gracious and
serene princesse (whome Iesus preserue for
euer) and her noble, and renoumed Progeni∣tors,
haue beene promulgate, and enacted her∣tofore,
may be put in execution. For in my
opinion, it is as impossible for a man, to were
preciouse apparell, and gorgiouse attyre, and
not to be proude therof (for if he be not proud
therof, why doth he weare suche riche attire,
wheras meaner is both better cheape, easier
to be had, as warme to the bodie, and as de∣cent,
and comly to any chast christians eye?)
as it is for a man to cary fire in his bosōe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vnpossible not to be proud of rich attyre.</NOTE> and
not to burne. Therfore would God euery mā
might be compelled to weare apparell, accor∣ding

some who ruff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> now in silks, veluets, satēs,

takeing this occasion to giue the King
to vnderstand the inormious abuse thereof,

out of his whole dominion &amp; kingdome. I read

his face, saying, it is méet (o king) that I spit
in the fowlest place. This good <HI>Philosopher</HI>
(as we may gather) went about to withdraw
the king from taking pleasure or delight, in

of his owne filthynes, miserie, &amp; sinne,
not rysing vp into pride, and spitting against
heauen, as he did, by dilighting in prowde at∣tyre

will assay (<HI>pro virili mea, omnibus neruulis

I can, to satisfie your desire. Wherefore to be∣gin
first with their Hattes.</P>
<P>Sometimes they were them sharp on the
crowne, pearking vp like a sphere, or shafte of
a stéeple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diuersity of hattes in Ailgna.</NOTE> standing a quarter of a yard aboue y<SUP>e</SUP>
crowne of their heades, some more, some lesse,
as please the phantasies of their mindes. O∣thersome
be flat, and broad on the crowne, like
the battlements of a house. An other sort haue
round crownes, sometimes with one kinde of
hande, sometime with an other, nowe blacke,
now white, now russet, now red, now gréene,
now yellowe, now this, nowe that, neuer con∣tent
with one colour, or fashion two dayes to
an ende. And thus in vanitie they spende the
<PB REF="33"/>
Lorde his treasure, consuming their golden
yeares, and siluer dayes, in wickednes &amp; sin.
And as the fashions bee rare and straunge, so
are the thinges wherof their Hattes be made
diuerse also: for some are of silke, some of vel∣uet,
some of taffetie, some of sarcenet, some of
wooll,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sundrie things wher∣of hattes be made.</NOTE> &amp; which is more curious, some of a cer∣taine

bought you maye bee sure. And so common a
thinge it is, that euerie Seruingman, Coun∣treyman,
and other, euen all indifferently, do
weare of these hattes. For he is of no account
or estimation amongst men, if hee haue not a
veluet, or a taffatie Hatte, and that muste bee
pincked and cunningly carued of the beste fa∣shion.
And good profitable Hattes bee they, for
the longer you weare them, the fewer holes
they haue. Besides this, of late there is a new
fashion of wearing their Hattes sprung vp a∣mongst

<P>Did the women of the former world

<P>The Women of the former age you
may be sure neuer appareled themselues like
one of these: But least you should thinke, that
y<SUP>e</SUP> Godly onelie lyued thus austerly, you shal
heare how litle the very hethē and barbarian
Women haue, and do at this present estéeme
of apparell, as <HI>Stuperius</HI> witnesseth, whose
words are these speking of the Egiptian w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣men:
<HI>Vestimenta sciunt nec noua pristini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
mutare, verum semper his in cultibus gaudent
perpetuo tempore congredi, quascunque gen∣tes

thus turned into English verse.</P>
<L><PB REF="54"/>The Egiptian Matrones neuer vse</L>
<L>Their fashion of attyre to change,</L>
<L>But euer keep one forme to chuse</L>
<L>Although they visite Nations strange.</L>
<P>AND as all Writers doo affirme, all the
Women there, indifferētly to with their
haire hanging downe, with a broade hat
vppon their heads, and other attyre as playne
as the rest, soo farre are these People from
Pride, and hunting after strange fashions as
our Women doo.</P>
<P>The Women of <HI>Affrica</HI> are witnessed
by the fame <HI>Stuperius,</HI> and others, to be so
farre from affecting strange fashions, or cu∣riosity
in aparel, that they cloth themselues in
a manner al ouer, <HI>ferinis pellibus,</HI> with beasts
skinnes, furres, and such like. And this they
think so riche attire, as they vse it altogether,
when they celebrat their festiual solēne daies,
or when they go abrode to be séene.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brasilian</HI> Women estéeme so litle of
apparell also as they rather chose to go naked
(their secret partes onely being couered) then
they wold be thought to be proud, or desirouse
of such vanities.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cantabrian</HI> Women likewyse with
many others do the same. In High <HI>Germany</HI>
the Women vse in effect one kind of apparel,
or habite, without any differēce at all, nothing
like other Natiōs delighting in new fangles:
<PB REF="54"/>
yea the wiues there, are so far from pride, that
they will not disdaine to carie all their house∣hould
stuffe and other trinckets about with
them vppō their backs in tyme of extremitie.
These Mayds &amp; Uirgins go very plain, with
kerchers only on their heads, their haire han∣ging
down behinde, in token of Uirginitie.</P>
<P>Thus you see, euery Natiō, how barbarous
soeuer, are much inferiour to y<SUP>e</SUP> people of <HI>Ailg∣na</HI>
in pride &amp; excesse of apparell: and yet these
examples I alledge not to th'end I wold wish
all others to vse y<SUP>e</SUP> same, or y<SUP>e</SUP> very like brutish
kind of auster habite, but to shew how farre
they be from Pride, &amp; how much the other be
wedded to y<SUP>e</SUP> same. And as for the vertuous &amp;
godly christian women from the beginning of
the world, they haue so litle cared for the vain
glory of apparell, &amp; so litle (or rather nothing
at al) were they a quainted therwith, as they
hunted for nothing els so much as for the or∣naments
of the mind, as wisdom, continency,
chastitie, &amp; true godlynesse, thinking the same
bewtie sufficient. They coūted it great shame
to cloth their bodies with sumpteous apparel,
&amp; their minds to be naked, &amp; voide of true ver∣tue.
So, if these womē wold seek after y<SUP>e</SUP> bew∣tie
of y<SUP>e</SUP> mind, they wold not affect apparell so
much, for if they be faire in body alredy, than
néed they not gorgeous apparel to make them
fairer: &amp; if they be deforme in body, it is not y<SUP>•</SUP>
<PB REF="55"/>
that can make them fairer. And either their
bewtie consisteth in them, or in their apparel:
If in them, than not in the Apparell, &amp; so it is
meere foolery to were them. And if in apparel,
than not in them, and so cannot the garments
make them fayre, whome God, &amp; nature hath
made otherwise: wherfor, look in what shape,
forme, or condition euerye one is created by
God, let him content himselfe with the same,
without any alteratiō or chaunge, with prai∣se
to his Creator.</P>

the pride of the heart<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pride of the heart.</NOTE> with eternal dam∣nation

<P>Also, it is manifest, that the pride of appa∣rel,
riseth first from the corruptiō of the heart,
as the effects from the cause, the fruite from

which, notwithstanding, it hurteth not out∣wardly,

<PB REF="55"/>
be damnable in it owne nature before
God, than must it néeds be, that the Pride of
apparell, (which sheweth it selfe to the world,
both offensiue to GOD, and hurtfull to mā,
and which also is the fruite of the pride of the
heart, and throweth almost as many as be∣hold

<P>There was a man whose name was <HI>W.

vserer (and yet pretending alway a sin∣gular
zeale to religion, so that he wold seldom
tymes go without a byble about him, but sée
the iudgements of God vpon them that will
take his word in their mouthes, and yet lyue
cleane contrarie, making the word of God a
cloke to couer their sinne and naughtynesse
withall) who vppon occasion of busines visi∣ting
<HI>Lewedirb</HI> a place appointed for the cor∣rectiō
of such that be wicked lyuers, saw there
a famous whore, but a very proper Woman,
whō (as is said) he knew not, but whether he
did, or not, certē it is, that he procured her de∣lyuery
from thence, bayled her, &amp; hauing put
away his owne wife before, kept her in his
chamber, vsing her at his pleasure. Whylest
these two mēbers of y<SUP>e</SUP> deuil were playing the
vile <HI>Sodomits</HI> together in his chamber, &amp; ha∣uing
a litle pan of coles before them wherin
was a very litle fire, it pleased GOD euen
in his wrath, to strike these two persons dead
in a moment. The Woman falling ouer the
pan of coles, was burned that all her bowels
gushed out, the man was founde lying by, his
<PB REF="65"/>
cloths in some partes being scorched and bur∣ned,
&amp; some partes of his body also. But which
is most wonderfull, his arme was burned to
the very boone, his shirte sleeue, and dublet, not
once perished, nor tutched with the fire. Wher¦by
may be thought &amp; not without great proba∣bilitie
of truth, that it was euē the fire of God
his wrath from Heauen, and not any natural
fire from the earth. And in this wonderfull, &amp;
fearfull maner weare these cupple founde:
which God graunt may be a documēt to all y<SUP>e</SUP>
heare or read the same, to avoyde the like of∣fence,
and to all Magistrates, an Example to
see the same punished with more seueritie, to
the glorie of God, and their owne discharge.</P>
<P>But so farre are some, from suffering con∣digne
punishment for this horrible sinne, that
they get good maintenance with practising the
same. For shall you not haue some, yea many
thousands, that liue vppō nothing els, and yet
go clothed Gentlewomenlike, both in their
silks and otherwyse, with their fingers clog∣ged
with rings, their wrists with bracelets, &amp;
Iewels, and their purses full of gold and sil∣uer?
And here of they make no conscience, so
their Husbands know it not. Or if they doo,
some are such peasants, and such maycocks,
that either they will not, or (which is truer)
they dare not reproue them for it. But &amp; if the
Husband once reproue them for their misde∣meanour,
<PB REF="66"/>
than they cōspire his death, by some
meane or other. And all this commeth to
passe, because the punishment therof is no ex∣tremer,
as it ought to be. And some both Gen∣tlemen
and others (wherof some I know)
are so nusled herein, that hauing put awaye
their owne wyues, do kéepe whores openly,
without any great punishment for it, and ha∣uing
be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne conuented before the magistery,
and there béene deposed vppon a booke to put
away their whores, haue put them foorth
at one doore, and taken them in at the other.</P>
<P>And thus they dally in their othes with the
Lord, and stoppe the course of the lawe, with
<HI>rubrum argentum,</HI> wherof they haue store to
bestowe vppō such wickednesse, but haue not
a mite to giue towards any good purpose.</P>
<P>Wherfore, in the name of GOD, let all
men that haue put away their honest wyues
be forced to take them again, and abandon all
whores, or els to taste of the law. And let all
whores, be cut of with the sword of right iud∣gement.
For, as long as this immunitie and

the reason is, for that there is not sinne in all
the World, but these whores, and whore∣maisters

<P>ALL Stage-playes, Enterluds and Com∣medies,

to be handled, reuerently, grauely, and sagely,
with veneration to the glorious Maiestie of
God, which shineth therin, and not scoffingly,
flowtingly, &amp; iybingly, as it is vpon stages in
Playes &amp; Enterluds, without any reuerence,
worship, or veneration to y<SUP>e</SUP> same: the word of
our Saluation, the price of Christ his bloud, &amp;
the merits of his passion, were not giuen, to

be derided, and iested at as they be in these

is vsed (euery Man knoweth) in these playes

taught, that the word is GOD, and God is
the word. Wherfore, who so euer abuseth this
word of our God on stages in playes and en∣terluds,
abuseth the Maiesty of GOD in the

God himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuerence to the maie∣stie of God du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> is neuer to be thought of, or

<P>The Fathers as they were men
had their errors and erred as men, for <HI>Ho∣minis
est errare, decipi et labi:</HI> it is naturall
for man to erre, to be deceiued &amp; to slide from
the trueth. Therfore the Apostle saith: follow
mée in all things as I follow Christ: but to y<SUP>e</SUP>
intent that they who perpend the Examples

may sée their owne impietie &amp; grosse igno∣rance
discouered, I wil cōpendiously set down
the true sence and meaning of euery place, as
they haue cyted them perticulerly. For the
first: wheras they say that the Women came
foorth in daunces with timbrels and Instru∣ments
of Ioy to méet <HI>Dauid</HI> and <HI>Saule,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sa. 18.</NOTE> I
aske them for what cause they did so?<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first pil∣lare of daun¦cing ouer∣throwen.</NOTE></P>
<P>Was it for wantonnes or for very ioye of
hart, for their Uictorie gotten ouer the <HI>Phili∣stines</HI>
their sworne Enemies? Was it
in prayse of GOD? or to stirre vp filthie lust
in them selues, or for nicenes onely, as our
daunces bée?</P>
<P><PB REF="101"/>Did men and women daunce togither, as is

no good reason to say such and such did so, ther¦fore
it is good, or we may doo so, but all things
are to be poysed in y<SUP>e</SUP> balance of holy scripture
and therby to be allowed or disalowed, accor∣ding
to the meaning of the holy Ghost, who is
only to be heard and obeyed in his woord.</P>
<P>The <HI>Israelitish</HI> women hearing of the fame
of <HI>Dauid,</HI> and how he had killed their deadly
enemie <HI>Goliath,</HI> came foorth to méet him play¦ing
vpon instrumēts, dancing &amp; singing songs
of ioye and thanks-giuing to the Lord who
had giuen them victorie and deliuered them,
from the deadly hostilitie of him, who sought
their distruction euery way. Now what ma∣keth
this, for our le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, wanton, nice and <HI>vbi∣quitarie</HI>

Theirs was a godly kind of dācing in praise

<P>For these great and inestimable benefits and
blessings receiued at the hands of God, they
played vpon Instruments of musick, leaped,
daunced, and sung godly songs vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> Lord,
shewing by these outward gestures y<SUP>e</SUP> inward
ioy of their harts and mindes. Now what
conduceth this, for the allowance of our luxu∣rious

<P>We neuer read, that they euer daunced,
but at some wonderfull por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, or straunge
iudgment of God, and therfore, made not a

their third Reason: The <HI>Israelits</HI> daūced be∣fore
the Calf in <HI>Horeb.</HI> And what than?
They made a Golden Calf, and adored it,
maye we therfore do the like? They com∣mitted
ydolatrie there, therfore is ydolatrie
good, because they committed it?</P>
<P><PB REF="102"/><HI>Adam,</HI> disobyed GOD, and obeyed the
deuil: is obedience therfore to the deuil good,
because hee did so?</P>
<P>Therfore wée must not take héede what
man hath doon héertofore, but what God hath
commaunded in his woord to be doon, and that
followe, euen to the death. But to be short,
as it is a friuilous thing to say, because they
committed Idolatrie, therfore may wée doo
the like, so it is no lesse ridiculous, to say, be∣cause
they daunced, therfore wée may doo the
same: for as it is not lawful to commit Idola∣trie,
because they did so, so is it not lawfull
to daunce, because they daun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.</P>
<P>So that if this place inferre any thing for
dauncing, it inferreth that wee must neuer
daunce but before a golden Calf, as they did:
but I think by this time, they are ashamed of
their dances: therfore, of this place I néed to
sayn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more, giuing thē to note, that this their
dauncing in respect of the end therof, was
farre dissonant from ours: for they daunced
in honour of their Idol, wee clean contrary
though neither the one nor the other be at a∣ny
hand tollerable.</P>
<P>Their fourth reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their .4. Reason.</NOTE> Did not <HI>Dauid</HI>
daunce before the Ark, say they? very true:
and this place (as the rest before) refelleth
their customarie dauncings of men and wo∣men
togither moste excellentlie. For
<PB REF="103"/>
<HI>Dauid</HI> danced him selfe alone, without either
woman, or musicall Instrument to effemi∣nate
the minde. And this dauncing of <HI>Dauid</HI>
was no vsuall thing, nor frequēted euery day
but that one time, and that in prayse of God,
for the deliuerie of the Ark of God his testa∣ment
out of the hands of the Infidels and he∣then
people: the ioy of this holy Prophet was
so vehement, for this great blessing of GOD
(such a feruēt zeale he bore to the trueth) that
it burst foorth into exterior action, y<SUP>•</SUP> more to in¦duce
others to prayse God also. Would God
we would dance as <HI>Dauid</HI> daunced héer, for
the deliuerie of his alsauing woord out of the
hands of that <HI>Italian Philistin</HI> &amp; archenemy of
all trueth, the Pope of <HI>Roome,</HI> for in this re∣spect
I would make one to daunce, to leap, to

Lord (making a rashe vowe) that if it would
please his Maiestie to giue him victorie ouer
his Ennemies, he wold sacrifice the first ly∣uing
thing that shuld meet him frō his house:
It pleased GOD that his sole daughter and
heire hearing of her Fathers prosperous re∣turn
(as the maner of the Cuntrey was) ran
foorth to meete her Father playing vppon in∣struments,
in praise of GOD, and dauncing
before him for ioye. Now what prooueth this
for their daunces? Truely, it ouerthroweth
them if it be well considered: for first, we read
that she did this but once, we daylie: She in
prayse of God, we in prayses▪ of our selues:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wherfore &amp; how the Daughters of Iepthath daū∣ced.</NOTE>
she for ioy of her Fathers good successe, we to

And moreouer, this sheweth, that wo∣men
are to daunce by themselues (if they wil

importeth the Tert, making no mention of
any other her collegues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ther. 6. Reason. Iudith. Ca. 15.</NOTE> or Companions dan∣cing

to <HI>Holofernes,</HI> &amp; by some meanes or other
to work his destruction: who guided by the
hand of God, attempted the thing &amp; brought
it happely to passe. For she cut of his head
with his owne fauchine, wrapping his body
in the canopie, wherin he lay sléepingly possest
as he was with y<SUP>e</SUP> spirit of drunkennesse: this
done, the Women of <HI>Israell</HI> came together,
and went to visit this worthie Woman, and
to cōgratulat her prosperous successe, with in∣struments
of musick, singing of Godly songs,
and dauncing for ioye, in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nor and prayse to

as cōmonly the world doth now adaies?
This also ouerthroweth the dauncinges of
Men and Women together in one companie:
for though there was an infinite number of
People by, yet the Text saith, there daunced
<PB REF="104"/>
none, but onely Women, which plainly ar∣gueth
the vnlawfulnesse of it in respecte of
Man. And this being but a particular fact
of a sort of imprudent Women, shall we

<P>It was a custome in those dayes, when God

<P>For, if <HI>Herode</HI> with séeing her daunce, was

whatsoeuer she wold desire, though it were
half of his Emperie, or Kingdome: what wold
he haue béene, if he had daunced with her?
and what are those that daunce with them,
hand in hand, chéek by chéek, with bussing
and kissing, slabbering and smearing, most
beastly to behold? in so much, as I haue heard
many impudently say, that they haue chosen
their Wyues, and wyues their Husbands by
dauncing: Which plainely proueth the wic∣kednesse
of it. Their .viij. reason:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their. 8. Reason. Luc. 7.</NOTE> Did not
Christ rebuke the People, for not dauncing,
saying: we haue pyped vnto you, but you haue

reproued them, for not excercysing the same.</P>
<P>This is a Metaphoricall, or Allegoricall

<PB REF="105"/>
and gladsome maner.</P>
<P><HI>Ihon</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> he piped vnto them, that
is, he preached vnto them, austeritie of life, to
mourn for their sinnes, to repent, to fast, pray
and such like. Our Sauiour Christ he py∣ped
(that is) preached vnto them, the glad &amp;
comfortable tidyngs of y<SUP>e</SUP> Gospell, yet at nei∣ther
of these kinde of concions, they were any
whit mooued, either to imbrace Christ, or his
gospell: Wherfore he, sharply rebuketh them,
by a similitude of foolishe Children sitting in
the market place, and piping vnto them that
wold not daunce. This is the true vndoubted
sence of this place, which, whether it ouer∣throw
not all kinde of lewd dauncing (at lest
maketh nothing for them) allowing a certen
king of spirituall dauncing, and reioysing of
the heart vnto God (that I may suspend my
owne iudgement) let wyse men determine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 3. Their. 9. Reason.</NOTE></P>
<P>Their .ix. Reason: Saith not <HI>Salomon,</HI> there
is a time to wéep, &amp; a time to laugh, a time to
mourn, and a time to daunce? This place is
directly against their vsuall kinde of daun∣cing.
For, saith not the Text, there is a time,
meaning, somtime, now and than, as the <HI>Is∣raelites</HI>
did in prayse to GOD, when anie
notable thing happened vnto them, and not
euery daye and howre as we do, making an
occupatiō of it, neuer leauing it, vntil it leaue
vs. But what, and if <HI>Salomon</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Salomō mea∣neth a certen kind of a spi∣tuall daūcing or reioying of the heart.</NOTE> speaketh here
<PB REF="106"/>
of a certen kind of spiritual dauncing, and re∣ioysing
of y<SUP>e</SUP> heart in praise to GOD? This
is easily gathered by the circumstances of the
place, but specially by the sentence precedent
(<HI>vz.</HI> there is a time to mourn, &amp; a time to dā∣ce

&amp; a tyme to daūce or reioyse, for the vnspeak∣able

&amp; passion of Iesus christ. How much this pla∣ce

(if it be censured in the imparciall bal∣lance
of true iudgement) all y<SUP>e</SUP> world may sée
aud iudge. And now to draw to an end, I will
come vnto their <HI>vltimum refugium.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their vltimū refugium.</NOTE> That is:

y<SUP>e</SUP> Prophet speaketh of a certē kind of spi∣rituall
dauncing and reioysing of the heart to
y<SUP>•</SUP> Lord for his graces &amp; benefits in mercie be∣stowed

dauncing, which the word of God doth allow

like rammes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why our feet were giuē vs.</NOTE> skip like goats, &amp; leap like mad

<P>All lewde, wanton, &amp; lasciuious daun∣cing
in publique assemblies &amp; conuenticles,
without respect either of sex, kind, time, place,
Person, or any thing els, I by the warrant of
the word of God, do vtterly condemne: But
that kind of dauncing which is vsed to praise
and laud the name of God withall (as weare<NOTE PLACE="marg">What daun∣cing is con∣demned by the word of God.</NOTE>
the daūces of the people of the former world)
either priuatly or publiquely is at no hand to
be dysallowed, but rather to be greatly com∣mended.
Or if it be vsed for mans comfort,
recreation, and Godly pleasure▪ priuatly (eue∣ry
sex distincted by themselues) whether with
musick, or otherwyse, it cannot be but a very
tollerable exercise, being vsed moderatly, and
in y<SUP>e</SUP> feare of God. And thus, though, I condē∣ne
all filthie, luxurious and vncleane daun∣cing,
yet I condemne not al kind of dauncing
generally. For certen it is, the exercyse it self,
in it own nature, qualitie &amp; proprietie, though
to some it is lawfull, to othersome vnlawfull
in dyuerse respects, is both ancient &amp; general,
hauing been vsed euer in all ages, as wel of y<SUP>e</SUP>
Godly, as of y<SUP>e</SUP> wicked, almost from the begin∣ning.
Wherfore, when I cōdemne the same
in some, my meaning is, in respecte of the
manifold abuses therof. And in my iudge∣ment
as it is vsed now a dayes, an occupatiō
being made of it, and a continuall exercyse,

without any difference or respect had either to

vpon the Sabaoth day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reading of wicked bookes</NOTE> but also uppon any o∣ther

reproouing vice, and teaching vertue, a∣way
with it, for no man (almost) though they
make a floorish of vertue, and godlynes, will
buy it, nor (which is lesse) so much as once

<P>Truely I cannot tell, excepte it be

(which thing happeneth now and than) for

tould you, and (notwithstanding) do not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spud.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a great corruption &amp; Abuse,
doubtles, and worthie of great punishment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ph.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so truely, for if they be good lawes tending
to the glorie of GOD, the publique
weale of the Cuntrey, and correctiō of vices,
it is great pytie that money should buy them
out. For what is that els, but to sell vertue,
for lucre: Godlynes, for drosse, yea mens souls
for corruptible money? Therfore those that
sell them, are not onely Traitors to GOD,
to their Prince and Countrey: but are also
the Deuils Marchants, and ferrie the bodies,
and soules of Christians, as it were in <HI>Cha∣rons</HI>
boate to the <HI>Stigian</HI> flood of Hell, bur∣ning
with fire and brimstone for euer.</P>
<P>And those that buy them are Traitors to
GOD, their Prince and Countrey also.</P>
<P>For if the lawes were at the first good (as
GOD he praised al the lawes in <HI>Ailgna</HI> be)
why shuld they be suppressed for money, and
if they were euill, why were they diuulged,
but had rather béene buried in the wombe of
their Mother before thy had euer séene y<SUP>e</SUP> light.</P>
<P>And why were lawes instituted, but to be
executed? Els it were as good to haue no
lawes at all (the People lyuing orderly) as
to haue good lawes, and thē not executed.</P>
<P>The Prince ordeining a law, may lawfully
repeale &amp; adnull the same againe, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ō speciall

causes &amp; considerations, but no inferiour ma∣iestrat
or subiecte what so euer, may stop the
course of any lawe made by the Prince with
out daunger of damnation to his owne soule,
as the Word of GOD beareth witnesse.</P>
<P>And therfore, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to those men, that will
not execut the sentence of the lawe (being so
Godly, and so Christian as thei be in <HI>Ailgna)</HI>
vppon Malefactors and Offenders.</P>

<P>Séeing it is so, that al flesh hath cor∣rupted

<P>The day of the Lord cannot be farre

portents, strang miracles, fearful signes, and
dreadfull Iudgements hath he sente of late
daies, as Preachers &amp; fortellers of his wrath
due vnto vs, for our impenitēce &amp; wickednes
of life. Hath he not caused the earth to trēble
and quake? the same Earth to remooue from
place to place? the seas and waters to roare,
swell &amp; brust out, and euerflow their bankes
<PB REF="125"/>
to the destruction of many thousands? hath he
not caused the Elements and Skyes, to send
foorth flashing fire? to raine downe wheat, a
wonderfull thing as euer was heard, and the
like? hath he not caused wonderfull Eclypses
in the Sunne and Moon, with most dreadfull
coniunctions of Starres and Planets, as the

of? haue not the clowdes distilled downe a∣boundance
of rayne and showres, with all
kinde of vnseasonable wether, to the destroy∣ing
(almost) of al thinges vppon the Earth?
haue we not séene Commets, blasing starres,
firie Drakes, men, feighting in the ayre, most
fearfully to behold? Hath not dame Nature
her selfe denied vnto vs her operation, in sen∣ding
foorth abortiues, vntimely births, vggle∣some
monsters and fearfull mishapen Crea∣tures
both in man &amp; beast. So, that it séemeth
all the Creatures of God are angrie with vs
and threaten vs with destruction, and yet we
are nothing at all amēded (alas) that shal be∣come
of vs? Remēber we not there is a God
that shal iudge vs righteously? that there is a
Deuill, who shall torment vs after this lyfe
vnspeakably, if we repent not? At that day,
the wicked shall find that there is a Material
Hell, a place of all kinds of tortures, wherein
they shal be punished in fire and brimstone a¦mongest

Deuils world without end, how light so euer
they make account of it in this World.</P>

mention of Hell, or of the paines therof in the
other World, they make a mocke at it, thin∣king
they be but metaphoricall speaches, one∣ly
spoke to terrifie vs withall, not otherwyse.
But certen it is, as there is a God, that will
reward his Children, so there is a Deuill
that will remunerat his Seruaunts: And
as there is a Heauen, a Materiall place of
perfect ioye prepared for the Godly, so there is
a Hell, a Materiall place of punishmēt for the
wicked and reprobat, prepared for the Deuil
&amp; his Angels, or els the word of God is in no
wyse to be credited, which blasphemie, once to
think, God kéep all his Children from.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spud.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they will easily auoid this, for
they say▪ it is writ, at what time so euer a sin∣ner
doth repent him of his sinne, I wil put all
his sin out of my remembrance saith y<SUP>e</SUP> Lord.</P>
<P>So that, if they maye haue thrée words at
the last, they will wish no more. What think
you of these felowes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think them no men, but Deuills,
no Christians, but worse thā <HI>Tartarians,</HI> and
more to be auoided than y<SUP>e</SUP> poison of a serpent:
for the one slayeth but the body, but the other,
both body &amp; soul for euer. Wherfore, let euery
good Christen Man take heed of them, and
<PB REF="126"/>
auoid them. For, it is truely said, <HI>cum bo∣nis
bonus eris, &amp; cum peruersis, peruerseris:</HI>
with the good, thou shall learne good, but
with the wicked, thou shall be peruerted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think than, that that cannot
be a true repentance, which is deferred to the
last gaspe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ph.</SPEAKER>
<P>No truely: For true repentance must
spring out of a lyuelie faith▪ with an inward
lothing, hating and detesting of sinn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. But
this deferred repentāce springeth not of faith,
but rather of the feare of death which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>éeth
imminent before his eyes▪ of the grief and te∣diousnes
of paine, of the Horror of Hell, and
feare of God his ineuitable iudgement, which
he knoweth now he must néeds abyde: And
therfore, this can be no true repentance. For
there is two maner of repētāces, y<SUP>e</SUP> one a true
repentāce to life, the other a false repentance
to death: As we maye sée by <HI>Iudas,</HI> who is
said, to haue repented, and which is more, to
haue confessed his faulte, and which is most
of all, to haue made restitution, and yet was
it a false repentance. And why? because
it sprang not out of true faith, but as before.</P>
<P><HI>Peter</HI> repented, and wéept bitterly, and
was saued therby, though he neither made cō∣fession,
nor satisfaction: and why? Because it
sprang of a true and lyuely faith. So these fe∣lowes
may say they repent, but except it be a
<PB REF="126"/>
true repētance springing of faith, it can serue
thē no more to life than the pretensed repen∣tance
of <HI>Iudas</HI> did serue him to saluation. Let
them beware, for <HI>Cain</HI> repented, yet is he
condemned.</P>
<P><HI>Esau,</HI> did repent, yet is he condemned.</P>
<P><HI>Antiochus,</HI> did repent, yet is he condem∣ned:
<HI>Iudas</HI> did repent, yet is he condemned,
with infinite moe: And why so? Because
their prolonged repentaunce sprange not of
faith, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus they may sée, that euerye light affe∣ction,
is no true repentance: And that it is not
ynough to say at the last, I repent, I repent.
For, vnles it be a true repentāce indeed, it is
worth nothing. But indeed, if it weare so, that
man had, <HI>liberū arbitrium,</HI> free wil of himself,
to repent truely when he wold, and that God
promised in his word to accept of that repen∣tance,
it weare another matter. But repen∣tance
is, <HI>donum Dei,</HI> the gifte of God, <HI>de sur∣sum
veniens a patre luminum,</HI> comming from
aboue frō the Father of light, &amp; therfore it is
not in our powers to repent when we will.
It is the Lord y<SUP>t</SUP> giueth the gift, when, where
&amp; to whom it pleaseth him: &amp; of him are we to
craue it incessantly by faithfull prayer, &amp; not
otherwise to presume of our owne repentāce,
when indeed we haue nothing lesse, than a
true repentance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="127"/>
<SPEAKER>Spud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Than thus much I gather by your
words, that as true repentance (which is a
certen inward grief, and sorrow of the heart,
cōceiued for our sinnes, with a hatred and lo∣thing
of thesame) erueth to saluation thorow
the mercie of GOD in Christ, so fained re∣pentance
saueth not from perdition.</P>
<P>And therfore, we must repent dayly and
howrely, and not to deferre our repentaunce
to the last gaspe as many doo, than which, no∣thing
is more perilous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philo.</SPEAKER>
<P>True it is, for maye not he be cal∣led
a great Foole, that by deferring and pro∣longing
of repentance to the last cast (as they
say) will hazard his body and soule to eter∣nall
damnation for euer? Wheras by daily
repentaunce he maye assure him selfe both of
the fauour of GOD, and of life euerlasting
(by faith) in the mercy of GOD, thorow the
most precious blood of his deare Sonne, Ie∣sus
Christ, our alone Sauiour and Redemer,
to whome be praise for euer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now must I néeds say as the Wyse
King <HI>Salomon</HI> said, all things are vaine and
transitorie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All things are vaine and va∣nitie it selfe.</NOTE> and nothing is permanent vnder
the Sonne, the workes of men are vnperfect
and lead to destruction, their exercyses are
vaine, and wicked altogether.</P>
<P>Wherfore, I setting apart all the vanities
of this lyfe, will from hencefoorth consecrate
<PB REF="127"/>
my selfe to the seruice of my GOD, and to
follow him in his Woord, which onely is per∣manent
and leadeth vnto life.</P>
<P>And I most hartelie thanke the Lord God
for your good Company this day, and for your
graue instructions, promising by the assistan∣ce
of God his grace, to followe and obey them
to my possible power all the daies of my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philo.</SPEAKER>
<P>God giue you grace so to do, and eue∣ry
Christen man els,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ioyes of this life tread the path to death.</NOTE> and to auoid all the va∣nities,
and deceiuable pleasures of this life: for
certenly they tread the path to eternal destru∣ction,
both of body and soule for euer, to as
many as obey them.</P>
<P>For, it is vnpossible to wallowe in the
delights and pleasures of this World, and to
lyue in ioy for euer in y<SUP>e</SUP> Kingdom of Heauen.
And thus we hauing spent the daye, and also
cōsummate our iorney, we must now depart,
beseaching GOD that we may both meete
againe in the Kingdome of Heauen, there to
raigne and lyue with him for euer, through
Iesus Christe our Lorde, to whome with
the Father, and the holy Spirit be
all honour &amp; glorie for
euer more
Amen.</P>
