<HEAD>THE
Epistle Dedicatory,
TO
SIMON SCROOP, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
Of Danby, in Yorkshire.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Am extreamly pleas'd with this Oppor∣tunity
of renewing that Acquaintance,
which I had the Honour and Happiness
to begin with you at the College (where you
laid the Foundation of that fine Gentleman
you since have prov'd, and where you gave
such early, and certain Promises of your fu∣ture
Merit) and at the same time of doing
Justice both to the Respect, and Honour I
have for you, Sir; and to the Value, and
Esteem I ever had for the Person and Me∣mory
of Mrs. <HI>Behn,</HI> by making you a Pre∣sent,
that has more than once already met
with a publick and general Applause; and
by securing these Admirable and Diverting
Histories from being prostituted to a Person
unworthy of the Honour: And were she alive,
<PB REF="3"/>
she would be infinitely fond of my <HI>Choice;</HI>
in whom she would have found all the admi∣rable
Qualifications, that make up the Cha∣racter
of a noble Patron, and a generous
Friend, an HEREDITARY HONOƲR,
and a PERSONAL VIRTƲE; in whom
she wou'd have found an ancient Descent dig∣nified
with your own particular Honour,
Justice, Sweetness of Temper, Affability,
Generosity, and Sense; in whom she wou'd
have found such a Felicity of Address, as
makes your Discourse at once convince, and
charm; a sprightly Wit, and sound Judg∣ment,
which are eminent both in your Con∣versation
and Conduct, in the Choice and
Exercise of your Virtues: In whom she
wou'd have found Generosity without Pro∣fuseness;
a native Propensity to do good to
others, without injuring your Posterity; a
just Consideration of the Object of your Boun∣ty,
before you bestow a Benefit; and then
the Favour doubl'd by preventing the Expecta∣tion,
and saving the Person oblig'd the Con∣fusion
of asking; in whom she wou'd have
found <HI>Prudence</HI> without <HI>Cunning,</HI> the deli∣berate
Effect of a true Judgment; not the
hasty and mean Result of meer Interest and
Design. In whom therefore she wou'd have
made no doubt of finding the noble Souls and
Principles of <HI>Mecenas, Proculeus, Cotta,
<PB REF="3"/>
Fabius, Lentulus, Gallus,</HI> or <HI>Messala;</HI> a
Soul exalted with a generous Ambition of no
vulgar Praise; for to be a Protector, and
Encourager of the Muses, is an uncommon
Glory; the Prerogative of but a few, <HI>Quos
aequus amavit Jupiter,</HI> and more Ages have
gone to the producing a <HI>Good Patron,</HI> than
a Good Poet.</P>
<P>Not but that Poetry in every Age, and
Nation has pleas'd, and found among the
rich and powerful, such as <HI>Juvenal</HI> describes
in his time,
<Q><L>—Didicit jam dives avarus</L>
<L>Tantum admirari, tantum laudare disertos</L>
<L>Ut pueri Junonis avem.—</L></Q>
who give an empty Admiration, and a bar∣ren
Praise, but want Magnificence of Soul
enough to reward, or preserve the Author of
their Pleasure. They have nothing to spare
from their Profuseness in their <HI>Trifles;</HI>
their Follies are too expensive to allow any
thing to <HI>Learning, Good Sense,</HI> and di∣vine
Poetry, which like Honesty, are only
prais'd and starve.</P>
<Q><L>Non habet infoelix Numitor quod mittat amico,</L>
<L>Quintillae quod donet habet; nec defuit illi</L>
<L>Unde emeret multâ pascendum carne leonem</L>
<L>Jam domitum; constat leviori bellua sumptu</L>
<L>Nimirum, &amp; capiunt plus intestina Poetae.</L></Q>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
<HI>Sophocles</HI> might get the Government of
a Province for writing a good Play: <HI>Tyr∣taeus</HI>
the Command of an Army; but that
golden Age of Poetry is gone; and at this
distance, looks almost like that fabulous one
the <HI>Grecian</HI> Poets describ'd. For now (and
almost ever since) no Arts are encouraged,
that are not immediately employ'd in the Ser∣vice,
Ornament, or Pleasure of the <HI>Body,</HI>
and those that adorn the <HI>Mind</HI> thrown aside
as superfluous; and as useless as <HI>Ragou</HI>'s
Shirt, which wou'd make one think, if (as
our spiritual Writers call it) the Body be but
the Garment or Habit of the <HI>Mind,</HI> that the
Minds of most Men are meer <HI>Beaux</HI> wholly
lost in their Dress, and insensible to all that
does not either discompose, or adjust that.</P>
<P>Hence 'tis evident, That whatever pre∣tence
the rest of the World have to complain
of the Times, the Poets only have a just
Cause to do it: For let the Times be never
so hard, all other Mysteries and Faculties
thrive, and meet with new Supplies: The
<HI>Sharper</HI> (as numerous as his Tribe is) still
finds fresh <HI>Bubbles;</HI> the <HI>Knight of the Post</HI>
fresh-bad Causes; Whores and Bawds fresh
Cullies; <HI>Brawny Fools</HI> fresh City-Wives,
or disappointed <HI>Quality; Taylors</HI> fresh
<HI>Fashions; Usurers</HI> fresh <HI>Spend-thrifts;
Lawyers</HI> fresh <HI>Clients; Courtiers</HI> fresh
<PB REF="4"/>
<HI>Bribes,</HI> fresh <HI>Projects,</HI> and fresh <HI>Places;
Soldiers</HI> fresh <HI>Plunder;</HI> and <HI>Divines</HI> fresh
<HI>Livings;</HI> But the Poet scarce fresh Straw,
and now 'tis as of old,
<Q><L>—Utile multis</L>
<L>Pallere, &amp; toto vinum nescire Decembri.</L></Q>
I might have made it <HI>Anno,</HI> but out of
Respect to the Verse. Poetry can get no
fresh <HI>Star</HI> to shine on it; no fresh Patron to
encourage it, that it might be fullfill'd, what
was long since written of it by <HI>Petronius
Arbiter</HI>—
<Q><L>Qui pelago credit, magno se foenere tollit;</L>
<L>Qui pugnas, &amp; Castra petit praecingitur Auro;</L>
<L>Vilis Adulator picto jacet ebrius Ostro,</L>
<L>Et qui sollicitat nuptas ad praemia peccat:</L>
<L>Sola pruinosis horret facundia pannis</L>
<L>At{que} inopi lingua, defertas invocat Artes.</L></Q>
'Tis Encouragement that advances all Arts,
especially Poetry; which requires a free, un∣disturbed
and easie Life, void of all Cares
and Sollicitudes, which confound the noble
Idea's and Images that shou'd fill a Poet's
Mind. If <HI>Virgil</HI> had miss'd the Patronage
of the Prince of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, he had
never been the Prince of Poets.</P>
<Q><L>Nam si Virgilio Puer, &amp; tolerabile desit</L>
<L>Hospitium, caderent omnes à crinibus Hydri, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
An enlivening Bottle, a pleasing Conversa∣tion,
and an opportune Retreat of shady
Groves, Hills, Vales, and purling Streams,
are things that give fresh Vigour; to the
weary'd Pinions of a soaring Muse,
<Q><L>O! quis me gelidis in montibus Aemi</L>
<L>Sistet, &amp; ingenti Ramorum protegat Umbra.</L></Q></P>
<P>Poetry, the supream Pleasure of the mind,
is begot and born in Pleasure, but oppress'd,
and kill'd with Pain. So that this Re∣flection
ought to raise our Admiration of
Mrs. <HI>Behn,</HI> whose Genius was of that force
like <HI>Homer</HI>'s, to maintain its Gayety in
the midst of Disappointments, which a
Woman of her Sense and Merit, ought never
to have met with: But she had a great
Strength of Mind, and Command of Thought,
being able to write in the midst of Com∣pany,
and yet have her share of the Con∣versation,
which I saw her do in writing
<HI>Oroonoko,</HI> and other parts of the following
Volume; in every part of which, Sir, you'll
find an easie Style, and a peculiar Happi∣ness
of thinking. The Passions, that of
Love especially, she was Mistress of, and
gave us such nice and tender Touches of
them, that without her Name we might
discover the Author, as <HI>Protogenes</HI> did
<HI>Apelles,</HI> by the Stroak of her Pencil.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
In this Edition, Sir, are three Novels
not Printed before, and considerable Addi∣tions
to her Life; from all which, I'm per∣swaded
you will draw a very agreeable Enter∣tainment,
which I always wish you in your
Conversation with the Muses, for we often
seek the Company that pleases us, among
which, if I shall hereafter, by the Indulgence
of a better Fortune, be able to place any
thing worthy your Perusal; I shall enjoy a
very sensible Satisfaction for
<Q>Principibus placuisse viris non ultima laus est.</Q>
and I cou'd find no readier way to obtain so
agreeable an Event, than thus by putting my
self with so powerful a Bribe, as Mrs. <HI>Behn</HI>'s
Histories under your Protection, Sir, where
the Malice of my Enemies, or the Malig∣nity
of my Misfortunes, will never be able to
give any uneasie, at least anxious Thoughts to,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>

<HEAD>Advertisement to the READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Stile of the Court of the King
of <HI>Bantam,</HI> being so very different
from Mrs. <HI>Behn</HI>'s usual way of Writing,
it may perhaps call its being genuine in
Question; to obviate which Objection,
I must inform the Reader, That it was a
Trial of Skill, upon a Wager, to shew
that she was able to write in the Style of
the Celebrated <HI>Scarron,</HI> in Imitation of
whom 'tis writ, tho' the Story be true.
I need not say any thing of the other
Two, they evidently confessing their ad∣mirable

<HEAD>THE
HISTORY
OF THE
LIFE
AND
MEMOIRS
OF
Mrs. BEHN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Written by one of the Fair Sex.</HEAD>
<P>MY intimate Acquaintance with the
admirable <HI>Astrea,</HI> gave me, natu∣rally,
a very great Esteem for her;
for it both freed me from that Folly
of my Sex, of envying or slighting Excellencies
I cou'd not obtain; and inspir'd me with a no∣ble
Fire to celebrate that Woman, who was an
Honour and Glory to our Sex; and this Re∣printing
her incomparable Novels, presented
me with a lucky Occasion of exerting that De∣sire
into Action.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7"/>
She was a Gentlewoman, by Birth, of a good
Family in the City of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in <HI>Kent;</HI> her
paternal Name was <HI>Johnson,</HI> whose Relation
to the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> drew him for the ad∣vantageous
Post of Lieutenant-General of many
Isles, besides the Continent of <HI>Surinam,</HI> from his
quiet Retreat at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to run the hazar∣dous
Voyage of the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> with him he
took his chief Riches, his Wife and Children;
and in that Number <HI>Afra,</HI> his promising Dar∣ling,
our future <HI>Heroine,</HI> and admir'd <HI>Astrea;</HI>
who, ev'n in the first Bud of Infancy, discover'd
such early Hopes of her riper Years, that she
was equally her Parents Joy and Fears; for
they too often mistrust the Loss of a Child,
whose Wit and Understanding outstrip its
Years, as too great a Blessing to be long enjoy'd.
Whether that Fear proceed from Superstition,
or Diffidence of our present Happiness, I shall
not determine; but must pursue my Discourse,
with assuring you, none had greater Fears of
that Nature, or greater Cause for 'em; for,
besides the Vivacity and Wit of her Conversa∣tion,
at the first Use almost of Reason in Dis∣course,
she wou'd write the prettiest, soft-en∣gaging
Verses in the World. Thus qualify'd,
she accompany'd her Parents in their long Voy∣age
to <HI>Surinam,</HI> leaving behind her the Sighs
and Tears of all her Friends, and breaking
Hearts of her Lovers, that sigh'd to possess,
what was scarce yet arriv'd to a Capacity of
easing their Pain, if she had been willing. But
as she was Mistress of uncommon Charms of
Body, as well as Mind, she gave infinite and ra∣ging
Desires, before she cou'd know the least
her self.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7"/>
Her Father liv'd not to see that Land flow∣ing
with Milk and Honey; that Paradise, which
she so admirably describes in <HI>Oroonoko;</HI> where
you may also find what Adventures happen'd
to her in that Country. The Misfortunes of that
Prince had been unknown to us, if the Divine
<HI>Astrea</HI> had not been there, and his Sufferings
had wanted that Satisfaction which her Pen has
given 'em in the Immortality of his Vertues, and
Constancy; the very Memory of which, move
a generous Pity in all, and a Contempt of the
brutal Actors in that unfortunate Tragedy-Here
I can add nothing to what she has given
the World already, but a Vindication of her
from some unjust Aspersions I find, are insinua∣ted
about this Town in Relation to that Prince.
I knew her intimately well; and I believe she
wou'd not have conceal'd any Love-Affair from
me, being one of her own Sex, whose Friend∣ship
and Secrecy she had experienc'd; which
makes me assure the World, there was no Af∣fair
between that Prince and <HI>Astrea,</HI> but what
the whole Plantation were Witnesses of: A ge∣nerous
Value for his uncommon Vertues, which
every one that but hears 'em, finds in himself;
and his Presence gave her no more. Beside, his
Heart was too violently set on the everlasting
Charms of his <HI>Imoinda,</HI> to be shook with those
more faint (in his Eye) of a white Beauty;
and <HI>Astrea</HI>'s Relations, there present, had too
watchful an Eye over her to permit the Frailty
of her Youth, if that had been powerful enough.
As this is false, so are the Consequences of it
too; for the Lord, her Father's Friend, that
was not then arriv'd, perish'd in a Hurricane,
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
without having it in his Power to resent it.
Nor had his Resentments been any thing to her,
who only waited the Arrival of the next Ships,
to convey her back to her desir'd <HI>England:</HI>
Where she soon after, to her Satisfaction, ar∣riv'd,
and gave King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second so plea∣sant
and rational an Account of his Affairs there,
and particularly of the Misfortunes of <HI>Oroonoko,</HI>
that he desir'd her to deliver them publickly
to the World; and satisfy'd of her Abilities
in the Management of Business, and the Fidelity
of our <HI>Heroine</HI> to his Interest: After she was
marry'd to Mr. <HI>Behn,</HI> a Merchant of this City,
tho' of <HI>Dutch</HI> Extraction, he committed to her
Secrecy, and Conduct, Affairs of the highest
Importance in the <HI>Dutch</HI> War; which obli∣ging
her to stay at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> presented her
with <HI>The Adventures of Prince</HI> Tarquin, <HI>and his
false wicked Fair One</HI> Miranda: The full Ac∣count
of which, you will find admirably writ
in the following Volume.</P>
<P>But I must not omit entirely some other Ad∣ventures,
that happen'd to her during this Ne∣gotiation,
tho' I cannot give so just and large
a Representation of them as I willingly wou'd.</P>
<P>I have told you, that as her Mind, so her
Body was adorn'd with all the Advantages of
our Sex. Wit, Beauty, and Judgment, seldom
meet in one, especially in Woman (you may
allow this from a Woman) but in her they
were eminent; and this made her turn all the
Advantages each gave her to the Interest she
had devoted her self to serve: And whereas the
Beauty of the Face is that which generally takes
with Mankind, so it gives 'em most commonly
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
an Assurance, and Security from Designs; for
they suppose that a beautiful Woman, as
she is made for the Pleasure of others, so chiefly
minds her own; and in that they are not
much mistaken, for they pursue the same Course
with the rest of the World, Pleasure; but then
'tis as various as their Tempers, and what they
generally imagine may have the least share in
many of them. The Event, I'm sure, shew'd
that, in <HI>Astrea</HI> (at this time at least) the Plea∣sures
of Love had not the Predominance, when
she diverted the Hopes, which the Vanity of a
<HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant of great Interest and Authority
in <HI>Holland,</HI> had entertain'd of a successful
Passion, to the Service of her Prince, and his
own shameful Disappointment.</P>
<P>They are mistaken who imagine that a <HI>Dutch∣man</HI>
can't love; for tho' they are generally
more phlegmatick, than other Men, yet it some∣times
happens, that Love does penetrate their
Lump, and dispense an enlivening Fire, that
destroys its graver, and cooler Considerations;
at least it once prov'd so on this Spark, whom
we must call by the Name of <HI>Vander Albert,</HI> of
<HI>Ʋtrecht.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Antwerp</HI> is a City of great Opulence and Com∣pass,
and before the Separation of the Seven
Provinces from the other Ten, the <HI>Emporium</HI> of
<HI>Flanders,</HI> and is yet a Town of considerable
Trade and Resort; 'tis in the <HI>Spanish Nether∣lands,</HI>
and yet near Neighbour to the Domi∣nions
of the <HI>States.</HI> For which Reason, our
<HI>Astrea</HI> chose it for the Place of her abode,
where she might with the greater Ease hear
from, and meet with <HI>Vander Albert;</HI> who be∣fore
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
the War, in her Husband's time, had been
in love with her in <HI>England,</HI> and on which she
grounded the Success of her Negotiation. <HI>Albert,</HI>
as soon as he knew of her Arrival at <HI>Ant∣werp,</HI>
and the publick Posts he was in wou'd
give him Leave, made a short Voyage to meet
her, with all the Love his Nature was capable
of, (and which by chance was much, and more
refin'd than most of his Countrymen, at least
according to our common Notions of 'em,)
and after a Repetition of all his former Pro∣fessions
for her Service, press'd her extreamly
to let him by some signal Means, give undenia∣ble
Proofs of the Vehemence and Sincerity of
his Passion; for which he wou'd ask no Reward,
till he had by long and faithful Services con∣vinc'd
her that he deserv'd it.</P>
<P>This Proposal was so reasonable, and so ex∣treamly
suitable to her present Aim in the Ser∣vice
of her Country, that she accepted it; and
having the Reward in her own Power, as well
as the Judgment of his Deserts, she put him to
that use, which made her very serviceable to
the King. I shall only instance one piece of In∣telligence,
which might have sav'd the Nation
a great deal of Money and Disgrace, had Cre∣dit
been given to it. The latter end of the
Year 1666. <HI>Albert</HI> sent her Word by a special
Messenger that he wou'd be with her at a Day
appointed, which nothing cou'd have oblig'd
him to, but his Engagements to her; but his
Affairs requiring his immediate Return into
<HI>Holland,</HI> he had sent that Express to get her
to be alone, and in the way those few Minutes
he cou'd stay with her.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
The time comes: <HI>Astrea</HI> is punctual to the Ap∣pointment,
and <HI>Albert</HI> informs her, that <HI>Cor∣nelius
de Wit,</HI> who with the rest of that Family,
had an implacable Hatred to the English Na∣tion,
and the House of <HI>Orange,</HI> that was so
nearly related to it, had with <HI>d' Ruyter</HI> pro∣pos'd
to the States, to sail up the River of
<HI>Thames,</HI> and destroy the <HI>English</HI> Ships in their
Harbours; since, by the Proposal of a Peace,
the King of <HI>England</HI> had shewn so little of the
Politician, or was so rul'd by evil Counsellors,
that he never thought of treating with Sword
in Hand; but to save the Expence of fitting
out a Fleet, had expos'd so considerable a part
of it to the Resentment of the Enemy. This
Proposal of <HI>de Wit,</HI> concurring with the Advice
which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Partisans in <HI>England</HI> had given
'em, was well receiv'd, and you may depend
on it, my Charming <HI>Astrea,</HI> that it will be put
in Execution (said <HI>Albert</HI>) for I can further as∣sure
you, that we have that good Correspon∣dence
with some Ministers about the King, that
being ensur'd from all Opposition, we look on
it as a thing of neither Danger nor Difficulty.</P>
<P>When <HI>Albert</HI> had discover'd a Secret of this
Importance, and with all those Marks of a sin∣cere
Relation of Truth, <HI>Astrea</HI> cou'd not doubt
but he had sufficient Grounds for what he had
told her, and scarce allow'd that little time that
<HI>Albert</HI> staid to the Civilities due for a Service of
that mighty Consequence; and this Interview
was no sooner ended, but she got ready her
Dispatches for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But all the particular Circumstances she gave,
nor the Consequence of it, if it should be ef∣fected,
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
cou'd gain Credit enough to her Intelli∣gence,
to make any tolerable Preparations
against it: And all the Encouragement she met
with, was to be laugh'd at by the Minister she
wrote to; and her Letter shew'd, by way of
Contempt, to some who ought not to have
been let into the Secret, and so bandy'd about,
till it came to the Ears of a particular Friend of
hers, who gave her an Account of what Re∣ward
she was to expect for her Service, since
that was so little valu'd; and desir'd her there∣fore
to lay aside her politick Negotiation, and
divert her Friends with some pleasant Adven∣tures
of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> either as to her Lovers, or
those of any other Lady of her Acquaintance;
that in this she wou'd be more successful than
in her Pretences of State, since here she wou'd
not fail of pleasing those she writ to.</P>
<P><HI>Astrea</HI> vex'd at this Letter, and the Treat∣ment
she had met with, for a Service the An∣cients
wou'd have decreed her a Triumph,
gave over all sollicitous Thought of Business,
and resolv'd to comply with her Friends Re∣quest
in what she wou'd take so much Pleasure
in the Narration of. But soon after she had
the Satisfaction to see her incredulous Corre∣spondents
sufficiently punished for neglecting
her Advice, and by their Mismanagement, find
e'ery particular thing come to pass that she had
forewarn'd 'em of. Nay, and some powerful
Men fall under the Censures of the People for
the Misfortunes, their Pride, Folly, or private
Designs had brought upon them. But to re∣turn
from this short Excursion, to her Letter.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur Remarks upon my politick Capacity,
tho' they are sharp, touch me not, but
recoil on those that have not made use of the
Advantages they might have drawn from thence;
and are doubly to blame. First in sending a
Person, in whose Ability, Sense, and Veracity,
they cou'd not confide; and next, not to un∣derstand
when a Person indifferent tells 'em a
probable Story, and which if it come to pass,
wou'd sufficiently punish their Incredulity; and
which if followed, wou'd have put 'em on their
Guard against a vigilant and industrious Foe,
who watch'd e'ery Opportunity of returning
the several Repulses, and Damages they had
met with of late from them. But I have often ob∣serv'd
your busie young Statesmen, so very opi∣nionated
of their own Designs, that they are
so far from encouraging those of another, if
good, that they cannot forgive their Proposal,
and sacrifice a publick Good to their particular
Pride.</P>
<P>But I have let these <HI>Idle</HI> Reflections (for such
must all be that regard our wretched Statesmen)
divert me from a more agreeable Relation: To
comply therefore with your Request, in its full
Extent, I shall give you an Account of both my
own Adventures, and those of a Lady of my
Acquaintance; and with her I'll begin, for 'tis
but civil to give place to a Stranger. I shall
convey her to your Knowledge by the Name of
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<HI>Lucilla.</HI> She is of a gay, airy Disposition,
middle-siz'd, fine black Eyes, long flowing
dark Hair. Nature has drawn her Eye-brows,
which are dark, much finer than Art usually
does those of the affected Beauties of our Ac∣quaintance;
her Mouth is small, her Lips
plump, ruddy, and fresh, I won't say moist;
her Hand small; Fingers long and taper, and
her Shape better than is usual among the <HI>Flemish</HI>
Ladies: To this I must add, That her Wit is
much above the common Rate.</P>
<P>With all these Accomplishments, you may
imagine that she was not without her Admirers;
among which Number, none came so near her
Heart, as the eldest Son of <HI>Ramirez,</HI> an old
sordid Miser, that loved his Money much above
his Sons, or ev'n himself; which made the Al∣lowance
he gave his Two Sons but very small,
and not fit to enable them to make any tole∣rable
Figure in the World. For the real Names
of these two Brothers, I must give that of <HI>Mi∣guel</HI>
and <HI>Lopez,</HI> and for the Grace of the Matter,
add Don to 'em.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Miguel,</HI> and Don <HI>Lopez,</HI> I know not
how they came by 'em, had Souls as brave
and generous as that of their Fathers was
wretched and base; they with Pain saw their
many Advantages of a liberal Education their
Fathers Covetousness robb'd 'em of; and by
their natural Parts, and winning Behaviour,
touched their Relations so nearly, that they
long contributed to their Improvement, ev'n
till now the Brothers were become two
of the most accomplish'd and gallant Youths of
the City; their Quality gave them Admittance
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
to the best Families, and their Accomplishments
to the Hearts of the fairest Ladies: but few ever
pass'd farther than the Confines of theirs;
and the lighter touches of an Amoret was all
that made them sigh, till they saw the incom∣parable
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> and her fair Cousin, of whom
not knowing her, I shall say nothing. Don
<HI>Miguel,</HI> as gay as he was, and as insensible as
he fansied himself, no sooner saw <HI>Lucilla,</HI> but
he found the Difference betwixt the Force of
her Eyes, and those of the rest of the Ladies
of his Acquaintance: And as a Proof of it, he
was not sooner touch'd with Love, than Jea∣lousie;
for her Cousin sitting by her, he ob∣serv'd
his Brother's Eyes often cast that way,
and was very uneasie at it; and that Friendship
that grew up with their Years, and increas'd
as they grew, found now a sudden Check. I
will not, like your Romance-Writers, give
you an Account of all his private Reflections on
this Occasion, nor the Conflict and Struggling
betwixt his old Guest Friendship, and this new
Intruder Love. It is enough to tell you, that
assoon as Opportunity serv'd he took Care to
put himself out of Pain, or at least to give
himself a Certainty, whether his Brother was
his Rival or not; and was not a little pleas'd,
that <HI>Lucilla</HI> had only found the way to his
Heart, while his Brother saw nothing so fair
as her Cousin. Don <HI>Miguel</HI> and Don <HI>Lopez,</HI>
as they were in Love, so they were too accom∣plish'd
to be unsuccessful; and there remained
no Obstacle to their Happiness, but their Fa∣ther's
Avarice, which wou'd never be brought
to any Reason, in allowing them what was fit
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
for Persons of their Rank. They coming
therefore to a Consultation, what Measures to
take to cure their Father of so ungenerous Di∣stemper
of the Mind; and by that Means, ac∣complish
what they both longed for more than
Glory.</P>
<P>They found their Father's Avarice had not so
engross'd his Soul, as to beat off all Sentiments
of Religion; on the contrary, he was extreamly
credulous of all the superstitious parts of religion,
and particularly of all Narrations of Spectres,
Witches, Apparitions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they therefore con∣cluded
to attack him on that side that cou'd
make the least Defence. He constantly spent
part of the Morning in telling his Money, and
counting his Bags: His Sons therefore having
procur'd a Pick-lock to his Closet, took Care to
place in it a Figure that was very dreadful, so
that the old Gentleman shou'd find him count∣ing
his Bags and Money when he came in;
which happen'd accordingly. He was not a
little frighted, and hastily retir'd, nor came
thither again in three or four Days, but on his
next coming, he was extreamly surpriz'd, to
find the Number of his Bags increas'd, which
for some time had been lessen'd e'ery Morning,
so that he concluded it was a Reward of his Ab∣stinence
from a Sight that pleas'd him too much:
Yet was so well pleas'd with this Increase, that
he repeated his Visits for three or four Mor∣nings
together, and found his Bags decrease on
that. He was very much troubled in Mind,
and consulting his Confessour on all that had
happen'd, he assur'd him it cou'd be none but
the Devil he had seen; and that he was
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
to fear the Consequence of taking Possession of
any of the Money so left there by that evil
Spirit, and it was much to be doubted whe∣ther
he had not exchang'd the whole. So con∣cluding
with some wholsome Advice against
Avarice, he dismiss'd his Penitent, who again
for some time forbore his Closet; and on his
next Visit, finding all he had ever loss'd retur∣ned,
and abundance more added, a Fit of Ava∣rice
coming on him, he resolv'd to try if he
cou'd out-wit the Devil; and by removing it
from that Place, which he suppos'd taken Pos∣session
of by the foul Fiend, secure both the
Money and his own Peace of Mind. Accor∣dingly
in the Night he digs a hole in the Gar∣den,
and conveys all the Bags into it, and co∣vers
them safely up. His Sons the next Day,
coming to the Closet, and finding all removed,
were not a little disappointed and troubl'd, to
think how they shou'd at least recover that
Money which was lent 'em by their Friends to
carry on this Design. All the Difficulty lay in
discovering where their Father had hid it, and
to do that nothing occurr'd that wou'd hold
Water, till Don <HI>Lopez</HI> concluded to make once
more the Experiment of his Fear of Appari∣tions,
against the next Night; therefore they
prepared the Chamber for their Design, and
invited some of their Friends, on purpose to
make the old Gentleman drunk; which having
effected, he was carefully carried to Bed, and
three or four Statues, out of the Garden, con∣vey'd
up into his Room, and placed on each
side and corner of his Bed, with People behind
'em to flash and make lightning, to discover to
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
him these imaginary Spectres. All things being
in this Order, a Mastiff Dog, with a great Iron
Chain, was let into the Room, the ratling of
which, in a little time, waken'd the old Gen∣tleman,
who began to pray very heartily; but
Fear still prevailing, as in Despair, made him
think to get out of the Room, when he heard
the Noise on the other side of the Room, the
most distant from the Door. On his first Mo∣tion
to rise, the Person behind the Image
flash'd with his Lightning, and discover'd a
white pale Ghost to the frighted Miser: So he
started back into his Bed again, and thus he
was serv'd on each side till in Despair, and rea∣dy
to die with Fear, he cou'd scarce utter so
much as one Prayer. Then he heard a Voice
with a thousand Terrours and Threats, de∣mand
him, he having taken the price of his
Soul in the Money he had removed: The old
Man replied, with a thousand Crosses to guard
himself, That the Money was in such a place,
and that he wou'd surrender not only that, but
his own too, to be at ease. When they had
thus got the Knowledge of the place where
the Treasure was hid, they easily, in the Fear
he was in, convey'd away the Statues, and left
all things in Order, as if nothing had happen'd;
and repairing to the Garden, found the Money,
but took no more thence but what they had
before put there.</P>
<P>The next Day, the old Gentleman sends for
them to his Chamber, ill with the Fright, and
lets 'em know, That he had thus long been in
an Errour, in setting his Mind on hoarded Bags,
which ought to be plac'd in Heav'n at his
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
Years; but having had various Warnings a∣gainst
it, he now resolv'd a new Life, and in
order to that, wou'd immediately settle his
Affairs. So he divided his Estate equally be∣twixt
them; and having found his own Sum
of Money left, as he thought by the Devil, he
gave a third part to charitable uses, and divided
the other betwixt his Sons, and retir'd to a
Monastery, where he soon made a very Reli∣gious
End.</P>
<P>The Sons having, by these means, gain'd
their Point, did not long deferr the Happiness
for which they undertook this; and thus was
my Friend <HI>Lucilla,</HI> and her Cousin, made the
most fortunate of our Sex, if Love and Money
cou'd make 'em so.</P>
<P>But I have been too long in this to add some
pleasant Adventures of my own, which I must
defer till the next Opportunity, having only
room enough left to subscribe my self your
Friend and Servant,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' our Courtiers will not allow me to
do any great Matters with my Politicks,
I'm sure you must grant, that I have done so
with my Eyes, when I shall tell you I have
made two <HI>Dutch</HI>-men in Love with me. <HI>Dutch</HI>-men,
do you mind me; that have no Soul for
any thing but Gain; that have no Pleasure,
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
but Interest or the Bottle; but in Affairs of
Love, go to the most sacred part of it more
brutally than the most sordid of their four-footed
Brethren; nay, they are so far from
the Warmth of Love, that through their Fleg∣matick
Mass there is not Fire enough to give
'em a vigorous Appetite, so far are they from
the fineness of a vehement Passion. Yet I, Sir,
this very numerical Person your Friend, and
humble Servant, have set two of 'em into a
Blaze. Two of very different Ages (I was go∣ing
to say Degrees too, but I remember there
are no Degrees in <HI>Holland) Vander Albert,</HI> is
about Thirty Two, of a hail Constitution,
something more sprightly than the rest of his
Country-men, and tho' infinitely fond of his
Interest, and an irreconcilable Enemy to Mo∣narchy,
has by the Force of Love been oblig'd
to let me into some Secrets that might have
done our King, and if not our Court, our
Country no small Service. But I shall say no
more of this Lover, till I see you, for some par∣ticular
Reasons which you shall then likewise
know. My other is about twice his Age, nay,
and Bulk too, tho' <HI>Albert</HI> be not the most bar∣bary
Shape you have seen. You must know
him by the Name of <HI>Van Bruin,</HI> and was intro∣duc'd
to me by <HI>Albert</HI> his Kinsman, and oblig'd
by him to furnish me in his Absence with what
Money, or other things I shou'd please to
command, or have Occasion for, as long as he
staid at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where he was like to continue
some time, about a Law Suit then depending.
He had not visited me often, before I began to
be sensible of the Influence of my Eyes, on this
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>
old piece of worm-eaten Touch-wood: but he
had not the Confidence (and that's much) to
tell me he lov'd me, and Modesty, you know,
is no common Fault of his Country-men: Tho'
I rather impute it to a Love of himself, that he
wou'd not run the Hazard of being turn'd into
ridicule on so disproportion'd a Declaration;
he often insinuated, that he knew a Man of
Wealth and Substance, tho' stricken indeed in
Years, and on that Account not so agreeable as
a younger Man, that was passionately in love
with me: Desir'd to know whether my Heart
was so far engag'd, that his Friend shou'd not
entertain any hopes. I reply'd, That I was sur∣priz'd
to hear a Friend of <HI>Albert</HI>'s, making an
Interest in me for another, that if Love were a
Passion I was any way sensible of, it cou'd ne∣ver
be for an old Man, and much to that
purpose. But all this wou'd not do, in a Day or
Two I receiv'd this Eloquent Epistle from him;
for he had heard <HI>Albert</HI> praise my Wit, and he
thought, that what he writ to one so qualify'd,
must be in an extraordinary Style, which I shall
give you as near as I can, in our Language;
and which I indeed was indebted to an Inter∣preter
my self for, tho' 'twas writ in <HI>French,</HI>
which I have some Knowledge of.</P>

<P>I Have strove often to tell you the Tempests
of my Heart, and with my own Mouth scale
the Walls of your Affections, but terrified with
the Strength of your Fortifications, I concluded
to make more regular Approaches, and first
attack you at a farther Distance, and try first
what a Bombardment of Letters wou'd do;
whether these Carcasses of Love, thrown into
the Sconces of your Eyes, wou'd break into
the midst of your Breast, beat down the Court
of Guard of your Aversion, and blow up the
Magazine of your Cruelty, that you might be
brought to a Capitulation, and yield upon rea∣sonable
Terms. Believe me, I love thee more
than Money; for indeed thou art more beau∣tiful,
than the Oar of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and I had rather
discover thy <HI>terra incognita,</HI> than all the Sou∣thern

bright and terrible as her Guns, thy Nose like

the well-wrought Mortar, whence the Grana∣do's
of thy Tongue are shot into the Gun-room
of my Heart, and shatter it to pieces; thy
Teeth are the grappling Irons that fasten me
to my Ruin, and of which I wou'd get clear
in vain; thy Neck is curious and small, like the

very Top-mast Head, beneath which thy love∣ly
Bosom spreads it self like the Main-sail be∣fore
the Wind; thy Middle's taper as the Bolt-sprit,
and thy Shape as slender and upright as
the Main-mast; thy Back-parts like the gilded
carv'd Stern, that jets over the Waters, and
thy Belly, with the Perquisites thereunto be∣longing,
the Hold of the Vessel, where all the
rich Cargo lies under Hatches; thy Thighs,
Legs, and Feet, the steady Keel that is ever
under Water. Oh! that I cou'd once see thy
Keel above Water! And is it not pity that so
spruce a Ship shou'd be unman'd, shou'd lie in
the Harbour for want of her Complement, for
want of her Crew! Ah, let me be the Pilot to
steer her by the <HI>Cape of good Hood,</HI> for the
<HI>Indies</HI> of Love. But Oh! Fair <HI>English Woman!</HI>
Thou art rather a Fireship gilded, and sum∣ptuous
without, and driven before the Wind to
set me on Fire; for thy Eyes indeed are like
that, destructive, tho', like Brandy, bewitch∣ing;
Alas! they have grappl'd my Heart, my
Fore-castle's on fire, my Sails and Tackling
are caught, my upper Decks are consum'd, and
nothing but the Water of Despair keeps the
very Hulk from the Combustion, so you have
left it only in my Choice, to drown or burn.
O! for Pity's sake, take some Pity, for thy
Compassion is more desireable, than a strong
Gale when we are got to the Wind-ward of a

like a Chain-shot, have brought the Main-mast

<P>I Receiv'd your Extraordinary Epistle, which
has had extraordinary Effects, I assure you,
and was not read without an extraordinary
Pleasure. I never doubted the Zeal of your
Country-men, in making new Discoveries; in
fixing new Trades; in supplanting their Neigh∣bours;
and in engrossing the wealth and Traffick
of both the <HI>Indies;</HI> but I confess, I never ex∣pected
so wise a Nation shou'd at last set out
for the <HI>Island of Love;</HI> I thought that had been
a <HI>Terra del Fuego</HI> in all their Charts, and avoid∣ed
like Rocks and Quick-sands; nay, I shou'd
assoon have suspected them guilty of becoming
Apostles to the <HI>Samaoids,</HI> and of preaching the
Gospel to the <HI>Laplanders,</HI> where there is no∣thing
to be got, and for which Reason the

very Jesuits deny 'em Baptism; as of setting
out for so unprofitable a Voyage as <HI>Love.</HI> Hark
ye, good Sir, have you throughly consider'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
what you have done? Have you reflected on
the sad Consequences of declaring your self a
Lover; nay, and an old Lover too to a young
Woman! To a Woman that wou'd expect all
the Duties of <HI>Gallantry,</HI> ev'n from a young Ser∣vant;
but great, and terrible Works of Super-erogation
from an antiquated Admirer. Have
you enough examin'd what Degrees of Gene∣rosity
<HI>Love</HI> necessarily inspires? that Foe to In∣terest;
that hereditary Enemy of your Coun∣try?
Nay, have you thought whether by hold∣ing
this Correspondence with Love, you may
not be declar'd a Rebel, an Enemy to your
Country, and be brought into Suspicion of
greater Intelligence with the <HI>French,</HI> by enter∣taining
their Gallantry and Love, than <HI>de Wit,</HI>
by all his Intrigues with that <HI>Monarch?</HI> I con∣fess
I tremble for you. Alas! alas! How de∣plorable
a Spectacle wou'd it be to these Eyes,
to see that agreeable Bulk dismember'd by the
enrag'd Rabble, and Scollops of your Flesh sold
by Fish-wives for Gelders and Duckatoons! have
you maturely consider'd the evil Example you
set your Neighbours, who may be influenc'd
by a Person of your Port and Figure: And
shou'd the Evil by this Means spread <HI>Holland,</HI>
we're undone, for then there were some Dan∣ger
of <HI>Honesty</HI>'s spreading, and then good∣night
the best Card in all your Hands for the
winning the Game and Money of <HI>Europe!</HI> Lord,
Sir, think, what a dreadful thing it is to be
the Ruine of ones Country! but if publick Evils
<PB N="22" REF="17"/>
don't affect you, have you set before the Eyes
of your Understanding, the Charge of fitting
out such a Vessel (as you have made me) for
the <HI>Indies</HI> of Love; and I fear the Profits will
never answer the Expence of the Voyage.</P>
<P>There are Ribbonds and Hoods for my Pen∣nons;
Diamond Rings, Lockets, and Pear-Necklaces
for my Guns of Offence and Defence;
Silks, Holland, Lawn, Cambrick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for
Rigging; Gold and Silver Laces, Imbroideries
and Fringes fore and aft for my Stern and for
my Prow; rich Perfumes, Paint and Powder,
for my Ammunition; Treats, rich Wines, ex∣pensive
Collations, Gaming Money, Pin-Money,
with a long <HI>Et caetera</HI> for my Cargo; and Balls,
Masks, Plays, Walks, Airing in the Country,
and a Coach and Six for my fair Wind.</P>
<P>You may see by my Concern for your Interest,
and Person, that the Approaches you have
made, have not been a little successful, and if
you are but as furious a Warriour when you
come to storm, as you are at a Bombardment,
the Lord have Mercy upon me.</P>
<P>But to deal ingeniously with you, I doubt
your Prowess in two or three particular Re∣trenchments,
which I fear you'll hardly be able
to gain. There is first your <HI>Age,</HI> a formidable
Bastion you'll scarce carry; then your mighty
Bulk will with the last Difficulties, be brought
to treat with my Love; but what is yet more
dreadful, your Treachery to <HI>Vander Albert,</HI> is
a <HI>Fort</HI> that must prove impregnable; if any
thing can be so to such a <HI>Pen</HI> and such a <HI>Head.</HI>
But if you carry the Town by dint of Valour,
I hope you'll allow me Quarter, and be as

<HI>Van Bruin</HI> more than <HI>Vander Albert.</HI> O! but
you say I'm too old too—but that's more
than you know you little Wag, you; and
thereby hangs a Tale. I'm not green Wood
indeed, and Sixty or Sixty Five has the Ad∣vantage
of so many Years seasoning; in all

But then you object my betraying my Friend—but
that shews, that you are not so witty as
you wou'd be thought—for is any Man so
much my Friend, as I am to my self: I, that
never part from my self as long as I live, as I may
from <HI>Vander Albert,</HI> and shou'd I not then pre∣fer
a Friend that will certainly always stick
to me, to one that may desert me the next

Friend, to be true to <HI>Vander Albert.</HI> But
what do you talk of Friendship, I'd sooner
deny my Faith for <HI>you,</HI> than for a New Rich
<HI>Japan Traffick.</HI> But Words are superfluous,
when you parley, 'tis a Sign you will hearken
to a Capitulation, and deliver up the Fort if
you like the Terms; and to shew you that
what you propos'd has not terrify'd me, I send
you <HI>Cart-Blank</HI> to fill up your self—for

<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Most Magnanimous Hero,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have made me extreamly proud of my
self, to find I can come into a Competi∣tion
with the only Cause and Effect of your
National Valour <HI>Punch,</HI> and <HI>Snick</HI> or <HI>Snee:</HI>
Nor am I less pleas'd, to find you so notable a
Logician, for I love Reasoning with an infinite
Passion, especially in a Lover; and it must be
allow'd, that you have gain'd your Point in the
Defence of your Bulk, and might for a farther
Vindication have added, That Elephants have
danc'd on the Ropes, which shews their Bulk
destroy'd not <HI>their</HI> Activity, and by Conse∣quence—but
a Word to the Wise—When
the Sons of God went in to the Daugh∣ters
<PB N="26" REF="19"/>
of Men, they begat a Race of Giants—well,
I don't know, If our Planets shou'd hap∣pen
to be in Conjunction, what strange things
might come to pass, and what a wonderful
Race we shou'd produce; but I'm satisfy'd,
that betwixt the Gayety of the Mother, and
the robust, portly, Activity of the Father,
cou'd not be less than dancing Elephants. You
have indeed, surprizingly, vanquish'd my Ob∣jection
of your Age, and I shall take Care to
use you like venerable Medals valuable for their
Antiquity and Rust; tho' an old Lover look'd
lately more like an old Gown, than old Gold,
or an old Family, and fitter for my Maid than
my self; or at least some decay'd Beauty, that
had not Stock of Charms enough to purchase a
young one. But you have convinc'd me of that
Error too. Alas! I fear that deluding Tongue
of your's will quite remove my Objection too of
your Treachery to <HI>Vander Albert.</HI> Since you
go on a National Principle, and ev'n bribe my
Judgment with the Complement of sacrificing
your Faith or Religion (which if it be your In∣terest,
is very considerable in a <HI>Dutch-man</HI> to
the Love of me. So that I defer Proposals of
Articles, till our <HI>Plenipo's</HI> meet, and proceed re∣gularly
on these Preliminaries, at the Place of
Conference, which is agreed on all hands, to be

<LETTER>
<P>You may imagine, this Letter brought my
<HI>Hogen Mogen</HI> Lover, with no little haste, to my
Apartment, whither we'll now adjourn; for
<PB N="27" REF="19"/>
'twou'd be impertinent to trouble you with any
more of these foolish Letters, one or two may
divert, as a Minute or two of a Coxcomb's
Company, which on a longer Visit grows nau∣seous:
But to give you all, 'twou'd make you
pay too dear for so trifling a Pleasure. The
other part of his Courtship consisting in odd
Grimaces, ridiculous Postures, and antick Mo∣tions,
cannot be so well describ'd to you, as to
give you a true Image of 'em; so far at least, as
to render 'em as diverting to you as they were
for a while to me. But imagine to your self,
an old, over-grown, unwieldy <HI>Dutch</HI>-man,
playing awkerdly over all that he suppos'd
wou'd make him look more agreeable in my
Eyes. Age he found I did not admire, he there∣fore
endeavour'd to conceal it by Dress, Pe∣ruque,
and clumsey Gayety; Respect he was
inform'd I expected from a Lover, which he
wou'd express with such comical Cringes, such
odd sort of ogling, and fantastick Address,
that I cou'd never force a serious Face on what∣ever
he said, for let the Subject be never so
grave, his Person and Delivery turn'd it into a
Farce. There was no piece of Gallantry he
observ'd, perform'd by the young Gentlemen
of the City, but he attempted in Imitation of
them, ev'n to Poetry; but that indeed in his
own Language, and so might be extraordinary
for ought I know.</P>
<P>Thus I diverted my self with him in <HI>Albert</HI>'s
Absence, till he began to assume and grow
troublesome, on my bare Permission of his Ad∣dress,
for a very little Incouragement serves
that Nation, full of their own dear selves; so
<PB N="28" REF="20"/>
that to rid my self of him, I found no more
ready way, than to let <HI>Albert</HI> know all his
Treachery to him, and the many considerable
Proffers he had made me to win me to his De∣sires.
But <HI>Albert,</HI> with an unusual Resentment
of these Affairs, threaten'd his Death, which
was going farther than I desir'd; for tho' I had
no Kindness for either of them, yet I had so
much for my self, as not to be the Occasion of
any Murder, or become the talk of the City on
so ridiculous an Occasion; so I pacified <HI>Albert,</HI>
and made him see how foolish such an Attempt
on an old Man wou'd look, and perswaded him
only the next Visit he made me, to upbraid him
with his Treachery, and forbid him the House,
and if need were, to threaten him a little. But
this produced a very ridiculous Scene, and wor∣thy
of more Spectators: For my <HI>Nestorean</HI> Lo∣ver
wou'd not give ground to <HI>Albert,</HI> but was
as high, as he; challeng'd him to <HI>Snick</HI> or <HI>Snee</HI>
for me, and a thousand things as comical; in
short, nothing but my positive Command cou'd
satisfie him, and on that, he promis'd no
more to trouble me; sure, as he thought, of
me, and was Thunder-struck when he heard
me not only forbid him the House, but ridicule
all his Addresses to his Rival <HI>Albert;</HI> and with
a Countenance full of Despair, went away, not
only from my Lodgings, but the next Day from
<HI>Antwerp,</HI> leaving his Law-suit to the Care of
his Friends, unable to stay in the Place where
he had met with so dreadful a Defeat.</P>
<P>Thus you see the Prowess of my Person; how
unsuccessful soever my Mind has been in our
Statesmens Opinions, you will, in a little time,
<PB N="29" REF="20"/>
find who is in the right of it. I'm sorry I
can't at this time furnish you with any more re∣fin'd
Int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igues. Those of a Prince that have
happen'd here, are too long; and I have met
with none that have touch'd me so far, as to
concern my Heart, which is not the most insen∣sible
of all my Sex, I assure you: And I'm so
far from finding one fit to make a Lover of,
that I can't meet with one that raises me to
Warmth of a Friend; but here my Letter puts
me in mind, that I have exercis'd your Patience
enough for once, and I shall therefore conclude
my self</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your faithful Friend,
Astrea.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>But now 'tis time to proceed to her Affairs,
with <HI>Vander Albert,</HI> her other <HI>Dutch</HI> Lover,
which was pleasant enough, and in which
she contriv'd to preserve her Honour, with∣out
injuring her Gratitude; for she cou'd not
deny but he had done such Services that did
justly challenge a Return for so much Love as
produc'd 'em.</P>
<P>There was a Woman of some Remains of
Beauty in <HI>Antwerp,</HI> that had often given <HI>Astrea</HI>
warning of the Infidelity of <HI>Albert,</HI> assuring her
he was of so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ickle a Nature, that he never lov'd
past Enjoyment, and sometimes made his
Change, before he had ev'n that pretence, of
which Number her self was, for whom he had
profess'd so much Love as to marry her, and
yet deserted her that very Night in the height
<PB N="30" REF="21"/>
of her Expectations: This Woman came now
into <HI>Astrea</HI>'s Mind at the same time, to gratifie
her Admirer with a Belief of his Happiness,
and do Justice to an injur'd Woman. She gives
her Notice of her Design, and orders the Ap∣pointment
so, that <HI>Albert</HI> met <HI>Catalina,</HI> (for
that was her Name) for <HI>Astrea,</HI> and possess'd
her with all the Satisfaction of a longing Lo∣ver:
But <HI>Catalina,</HI> infinitely pleas'd with the
Adventure, appoints the next Night, and the
following; and finding his Transports still
fresh and high, began to confide in her own
Charms; and keeping him longer than usual,
made the Day discover a double Disappoint∣ment
of her in her future Pleasures, and him
in the past, for he cou'd not forgive her ev'n
the Joys she had imparted by the false Bait of
another's Charms, but flung from her with the
highest Resentment and Indignation, and re∣turn'd
to <HI>Astrea</HI> to upbraid her with her unge∣nerous
Dealing; who, for her Plea, urg'd his
Duty to his Wife, and how unreasonable it
was in him, to desire the sacrificing of the Re∣putation
of the Woman he profess'd to love.</P>
<P>Tho' <HI>Albert</HI> was forc'd to acquiesce in what
she said, he cou'd not lose his Desire, now in∣creas'd
by the Pleasure of Revenge, which he
promis'd himself in the Enjoyment of her, ev'n
against her Will, and almost without her Know∣ledge.
Mrs. <HI>Behn</HI> had an old Woman of near
Threescore, which, out of Charity, she kept
as her Companion, having been an old decay'd
Gentlewoman; but she, guilty of the common
Vice of Age, Avarice, still covetous of what
they cannot enjoy, was corrupted by <HI>Albert</HI>'s
<PB N="31" REF="21"/>
Gold, to put him dress'd in her Night-cloaths
to Bed in her Place (for she made her her Bed∣fellow)
when <HI>Astrea</HI> was out at a Merchant's of
<HI>Antwerp,</HI> passing the Ev'ning in Play, and Mirth
as her Age, and Gayety requir'd: The Son of
which Merchant was a brisk, lively, frolick∣some
young Fellow, and with his two Sisters,
and some Servants, waited on <HI>Astrea</HI> home;
and as a Conclusion of that Night's Mirth, pro∣pos'd
to go to bed to the old Woman and sur∣prize
her, whilst they shou'd all come in with
the Candles, and compleat the merry Scene:
As it was agreed, so they did, but the young
Spark was more surpriz'd when, in the En∣counter,
he found himself met with an unex∣pected
Ardour, and a Man's Voice, saying,
<HI>Have I now caught thee, thou malicious Charmer;
now I'll not let thee go till thou hast done me Justice
for all the Wrongs thou hast offer'd my doating
Love.</HI></P>
<P>By this time the rest of the Company were
come in, all extreamly surpriz'd to find <HI>Albert</HI>
in <HI>Astrea</HI>'s Bed, instead of the old Woman; who
being thus discover'd, and <HI>Albert</HI> appeas'd with
a Promise to marry him at her Arrival in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
was discarded to provide for her self ac∣cording
to her Deserts: But <HI>Albert</HI> taking his
leave of her with a heavy Heart, and return∣ing
into <HI>Holland</HI> to make all things ready for his
Voyage to <HI>England,</HI> and Matrimony, dy'd at
<HI>Amsterdam</HI> of a Fever. Whilst <HI>Astrea</HI> pro∣ceeded
in her Journey to <HI>Ostend,</HI> and <HI>Dunkirk,</HI>
where, with Sir <HI>Bernard Gascoign,</HI> and others,
she took Shipping for <HI>England;</HI> in which short
Voyage she met with a strange Appearance,
<PB N="32" REF="22"/>
that was visible to all the Passengers and Ship's-Crew.
Sir <HI>Bernand Gascoign</HI> had brought with
him from <HI>Italy</HI> several admirable Telescopes
and Prospective-Glasses, and looking through
one of them, when the Day was very calm and
clear, espy'd a strange Apparition floating on
the Water, which was also seen by all in their
turns that look'd through it, which made 'em
conclude that they were painted Glasses that
were put at the ends on purpose to surprize
and amuse those that look'd through 'em; till
after having taken 'em out, rubb'd, and put
'em in again, they found the same thing float∣ing
toward the Ship and which was now come
so near as to be within View without the Glass;
I've often heard her assert, that the whole Com∣pany
saw it: The Figure was this: A foursquare
Floor of various colour'd Marble, from which
ascended rows of fluted and twisted Pillars,
emboss'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound with climbing Vines and Flow∣ers,
and waving Streamers, that receiv'd an
easie Motion from the Air; upon the Pillars a
hundred little <HI>Cupids</HI> clamber'd with flutt'ring
Wings. This strange Pageant came almost
near enough for one to step out of the Ship into
it before it vanish'd; after which, and a short
Calm, followed so violent a Storm, that ha∣ving
driv'n the Ship upon the Coasts, she split
in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght of Land, but the People, by the help
of the Inhabitants, and Boats from shoar, were
all sav'd; and our <HI>Astrea</HI> arriv'd safe, tho'
tir'd, to <HI>London,</HI> from a Voyage that gain'd her
more Reputation than Profit.</P>
<P>The Rest of her Life was entirely dedicated
to Pleasure and Poetry; the Success in which
<PB N="33" REF="22"/>
gain'd her the Acquaintance and Friendship of
the most sensible Men of the Age; and the Love
of not a few of different Characters; for tho' a
Sot have no Portion of Wit of his own, he
yet like Old Age, covets what he cannot enjoy.
I can't allow a Fool to be touch'd with the
Charms of Wit, but the Reputation that is
gain'd by Wit; which being a thing beyond his
Reach, he is fond of it because it pleases others,
not himself: Our <HI>Astrea</HI> had many of these, who
profess'd not a little Love for her, and whom she
us'd as Fools shou'd be us'd, for her Sport, and
the Diversion of her better Acquaintance. I
went to visit her one Day, and found with her
a young brisk pert Fop very gayly dress'd,
and who after an Abundance of Impertinence,
left us. His Figure was so extraordinary, that
I cou'd not but enquire into his Name, and
more particular Character, which <HI>Astrea</HI> gave
me in the following manner.</P>
<P>This is a young vain Coxcomb, but newly
come from the University, and full of the im∣pudent
self-Opinion, and Pride of that Place,
takes the common Privilege of being very im∣pertinent
in all Company, especially among
Women, and Men that understand not the
Jargon of the Schools. He's of a good Family,
and was left a pretty good paternal Estate,
which he endeavour'd to encrease by marrying
a rich Aunt he had in the Country, who had
Occasion for just such a Fop; for tho' he has
not been two Years from <HI>Oxford,</HI> he has met
with several uncommon Adventures, and among
the rest, his Addresses to me shall not be the
least considerable for all our Diversions.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="23"/>
Going down to take Possession of his Pater∣nal
Estate, and full of no very good Thoughts
of wronging his Brothers, he lay at this Aunts's;
who, tho' none of the youngest, was not old
enough yet to have given off all Thoughts of
Love, or to be exempted from the Effects of En∣joyment;
for after a long Intrigue with the
Steward of her Estate, she was, or imagin'd at
least, that she was with Child; and tho' she
lik'd him well enough for a Gallant, she cou'd
by no means think him fit for a Husband, ei∣ther
because her Pride wou'd not permit her to
think of her Servant for her Master, or that she
fear'd to give him a Power over her Conduct,
who had been a Witness how weak a Guard of
Virtue she had to secure the conjugal Duty, he
might expect from her as her Husband: But
whatever was the Motive, the Arrival of her
Nephew gave her other Thoughts, finding
him a fit Coxcomb for her ends; for you find,
that a little Conversation will let you into his
Character, at least, so far as to discover
him to be a very self-conceited Fool, and one
on whom by Consequence, Flattery wou'd have
no small Effect. His Aunt having made this
Discovery, took Care to detain him some Days
longer than he intended, and by all the cunning
Arts of a designing Woman, gave him Cause to
believe that his Suit wou'd not be very unsuccess∣ful,
if he shou'd make his Addresses to her. He
naturally thought well of himself, and fir'd
with so many Advances that his Aunt made
to him, he resolv'd to trie if he cou'd gain
her.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="23"/>
She was a Woman that had yet a Rest of
Beauty, improv'd too by the help of Art,
that she might pretend, without vanity, to a
conquest, where no brighter or more youthful
Faces interpos'd; to this she had an engaging
Air, and a sprightly Conversation: but that
which compleated the Victory over our young
Spark, was her Estate; that was exceeding
beautiful, because very great, and, join'd with
her other Charms, was not to be resisted by a
Man who was possess'd with the contrary Vices
of Avarice and Prodigality. For he had still
a thirst of Wealth, which he perpetually squan∣der'd;
for he was incapable of doing a gene∣rous
Action, though he wou'd do many foolish
ones, which seem'd to him worthy that Name,
as particularly that which I'm just going to re∣late
after his Marriage with his Aunt, for there
ended this Amour.</P>
<P>Some small time after the consummation of
the Nuptials, finding her fears of being with
Child vain, and quite tired of the Fool her
Husband, she perpetually was contriving how
to get handsomly rid of him; for though he
seem'd to love her well enough for a Wife, yet
he was too watchful of her motions to give her
opportunity of those Pleasures she had so long
taken with liberty. This made her very ill
humour'd and cross; which he endeavour'd,
by pleasing her all the ways he cou'd think of,
to remove: But all in vain, unless he cou'd
remove himself, and his legal Right to her
Estate, all his Caresses and Complaisance sig∣nified
nothing. In short, after she had acted
this part some time, and made him very earnest
<PB N="36" REF="24"/>
in the enquiry into the cause of her Chagrin,
she inform'd him, that she was very sensible
the chief motive that engag'd him to make love
to her was her Estate, and that all his profes∣sions
of Love were only false baits to delude her
too credulous Heart, and catch her Estate;
that she cou'd never forgive herself, being over∣reach'd
by so unexperienc'd a Youth, or ever
have patience to support the affliction this
gave her.</P>
<P>He us'd all the Arguments he could think of
to convince her of her Error, and that he lov'd
her with a sincere and tender Passion, without
any regard to her Estate, of which she was as
entirely Mistress as before. In vain was all he
said, she turn'd it to a contrary end to what he
meant it; told him 'twas easie professing his
Love sincere, when he was in possession of the
fruits of his past Dissimulation, and that she
cou'd never believe her Fortune had no share
in his Affections, as long as he was Master of it
whether she wou'd or not; that she must de∣spair,
being so much older than him, of long
being able so much as of a cold Civility, when
it was out of her power to give him any more.
He, out of a foolish fansie of Generosity, or ex∣cessive
good Opinion of his own Charms and
Power over her, tells her he has now thought
of a way to satisfie her Doubts, and, by a con∣vincing
proof of his Love, remove all those
Anxieties that gave her so much Pain, and
robb'd him of his Rest and Satisfaction; for to
shew her that it was her Person, and that alone
which he esteem'd, he would immediately put
her Fortune into her own possession again, and
<PB N="37" REF="24"/>
keep no other Right he had to any thing of
hers but her Person, which was the Treasure he
only coveted a quiet enjoyment of.</P>
<P>This was the point she had all this while been
lab'ring to gain, and you may imagine she lost not
the lucky Minute of the Fools ridiculous Fondness.
The Writings were made, and she put in absolute
possession of all her Fortune, and had therefore
no farther need of a longer Dissimulation; nay,
the curb that had been set on her unruly Will
for the short time of their Marriage, provok'd
her to observe no measures with him, whom
she could not forgive the many Pleasures he had
disappointed her of. He was first tormented
with fresh Proofs, ev'ry day, of his being a no∣torious
Cuckold, to which were added the Af∣fronts
of the Servants, and the Contempt of the
Mistress; and when none of these wou'd rid her
hands of him whose sight she loath'd, having
taken particular care to have him well beaten,
she thrust him out of doors, to provide for him∣self.
His late treatment made him unwilling
to return, for fear of a worse reception; and
since he had found all means ineffectual to re∣claim
her, he concluded to pass on to his own
Estate, and from thence to <HI>London,</HI> out of the
hearing himself the perpetual Discourse of the
Countrey.</P>
<P>He had not been long in Town, when one
day, walking in the <HI>Park,</HI> in a very mean Con∣dition,
(his own Estate being then seiz'd by his
Brothers, for the repayment of what he had
wrong'd 'em of,) he sees his Wife alone, and
though masqu'd, knows her; his Necessities
prompted him at least to try if the making him∣self
<PB N="38" REF="25"/>
Master of her Person, and playing the Ty∣rant
in his turn, would not furnish him with a
present Supply, if not recover him the Possession
of her Estate, by cancelling the Deed that put
it in her power to abuse him. She was very
well dress'd, and he something shabby; he
seizes her, uses all the Arguments he could to
persuade her Reformation, and Re-union to a
Man that yet had a value for her; but all in
vain. He told her plainly he would keep her
Person, though he had nothing to do with her
Estate; 'twas in vain for her to struggle, so she
went with him to the <HI>Horse-Guards,</HI> contriving
all the way how to get rid of him; and being
come there, on some occasion there happen'd to
be a great concourse of People: This gave her a
lucky hint, and starting from him, she sought the
Protection of the <HI>Mobb,</HI> assuring them he was
a paultry Scoundrel, that would needs pretend
to seduce her to his Ends, but on denial, had,
on his threats, prevail'd with her to go quietly
to that place, where she hop'd her Rescue.
He assur'd them he was her Husband, and that
he only meant to reclaim her from her evil
courses, and carry her home. She, with all
the assurance imaginable, laughing at his Asser∣tion,
desir'd 'em to consider if that Man look'd
like her Husband. Her Dress and Mien had
engag'd a Gentleman of the Guards to espouse
her Quarrel, and preventing the Decision of
the <HI>Mobb,</HI> declar'd his Opinion in the Lady's
favour, and propos'd the giving him the civi∣lity
of the Horse-pond: which hitting the bru∣tal
pleasure of the <HI>Mobb,</HI> prevail'd, and so the
poor Knight was carry'd to the Enchanted
<PB N="39" REF="25"/>
Castle, and the Lady set free, for more agree∣able
Encounters; for she was not ungrateful to
her Deliverer.</P>
<P>This unlucky Adventure was no small check
to his Hopes, and unopinion of his own Con∣duct
and Judgment; yet about half a year
after, being now more gay, by the recovery
of his Estate, and walking in the <HI>Park</HI> again,
he meets his treacherous Spouse, and full of the
Injury he had last received from her, and out
of fear of the like Misfortune, his Dress being
now answerable to her's, he upbraids her with
what was past, and assures her nothing shall
now deliver her from him; and so endeavour∣ing
to force her out again at the <HI>Horse-Guards,</HI>
where she enter'd, and near which he met her,
she, by her cunning, and seeming sorrow for
what had past, prevail'd with him to go out at
<HI>St. James's;</HI> and being got out of the Gate,
she makes to the first Coach very peaceably
with him, where he found three Gentlemen
who waited ready for her, and on her approach
came out, deliver'd her from her Husband,
and without much difficulty carry'd her off.</P>
<P>Being thus again out-witted by her, and see∣ing
no help for his desperate Condition, he
gave over all thought of her, and set his mind
on some fresh Amour, to wear off the uneasie
remembrance of his past Adventures. Among
the rest that were doom'd to suffer his Addresses,
it has been my fate, of late, to share the ill
luck, tho' I have the advantage of a great deal
of good Company to atone for the impertinent
Moments he taxes me with, his Conversation
diverting sometimes some of my best Friends, and
<PB N="40" REF="26"/>
his Letters my self; they are so affectedly ridi∣culous,
that I will shew you one of them ex∣traordinary
in its kind.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the incomparable fine hands of the
Seraphick Astrea.</HEAD>
<P>SHou'd I make a Palinode for the Aggressions
of my Passion, I should disappoint the
Justice of your Expectations; for without any
periodical flourishes, you know your Wit has
irresistable Charms; and that we can no more
resist the desire of imparting our Pain when the
Paroxism approaches, than a sick Man in a
Fever the desire of Water. The Horoscope of
my Love for the bright <HI>Astrea</HI> rose under a
very noxious Influence, if its Stars ordain it
abortive. You, Madam, that are Mistress of

have the Corruscations of the Night in your

<P>This, indeed, is the Soul of a meer Aca∣demic,
that is, of one whom Learning, ill un∣derstood,
has fitted for a publick Coxcomb,
and of whom there is scarce any one so ignorant,
as to have a good Opinion. You have, indeed,
reply'd I, a most extraordinary Lover of him,
but whose folly is too gross to be so long enter∣taining
as he shall think fit to be impertinent;
for, like common Beggars, they are not to be
denied; and are so far Courtiers, to think per∣petual
Importunities merit; so that if you have
no way of ridding your hands of him but laugh∣ing
at him, 'twill never do; for a Fool follows
you the more for laughing at him, as a Spaniel
does for beating of him.</P>
<P>Why truly (reply'd <HI>Astrea</HI>) he is grown so
troublesome now, that I shall be forced to use
him as bad as his Wife has done, in my own de∣fence;
and that I intend to put in execution the
more speedily, since I find my <HI>Lysander</HI> grows
uneasie at his Addresses, which can never move
any thing but laughter; however I shall easily
sacrifice so trifling a Sport to the Quiet of the
Man I love, in which you must assist me; for
<HI>Lysander</HI> shall have no hand in it, both to secure
him from a Quarrel, and my self the pleasure of
revenging him on a Fop that could hope, where
he had possession.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="27"/>
I promis'd to give her all the Assistance I
was capable of, to gratifie so reasonable a Re∣venge;
for if one Man affronts another by his
Rudeness, the Person affronted must be look'd
upon as a Coward, if he take not Satisfaction:
I can imagine no reason in the world, why a
Woman of Wit, that is affronted with the saucy
impertinent Love of a Fool that will not be
denied, shou'd not punish his In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olence accor∣ding
to her power: <HI>Wit</HI> is the Weapon she had
to fight with, and that she was to make use of
in her Satisfaction; to which, as a Second, I
was very willing to contribute; though the
Part she afterwards engag'd me to play was not
so agreeable to me as I at first imagin'd; for to
give a conceited Coxcomb any reason to believe
he has an Ascendant over a Woman, and then
allow him the least Opportunity, is to put her
self in a manifest hazard of her Honour and
Satisfaction. But this I did not much consider,
being willing to free my Friend from the Im∣portunities
of one she cou'd no more suffer, than
know how to be handsomly rid of.</P>
<P>And upon her Persuasion, I took the oppor∣tunity
of his next Visit, to give him all the rea∣son
imaginable to make him think me extremely
taken with his Person: Which Interview <HI>Astrea</HI>
took care to improve on my departure, and to
let him know that I was a Person of no less For∣tune
than Quality, which wou'd repair the loss
of an unfaithful Wife. Flattery, as it has some
power on the most Sensible, so it is of such force
with a Fool, that no Consideration can with∣stand
it. He soon thought the pursuit of me
more eligible, where he imagin'd his Perfections
<PB N="43" REF="27"/>
had made such an impression, that I cou'd no
more resist the Charm, than the barren Passion
he had hitherto entertain'd for <HI>Astrea.</HI> In short,
she came to a perfect understanding, and the
Assignation was made, and some Friends provided
to be in readiness to disappoint him, when he
most thought me his own. But the Gentlemen
retir'd to the Balcony, to see some sudden
Hubbub in the Street, and my Lover, full of
himself, and the opinion of my being wholly
at his devotion, press'd so hard for the victory,
that when nothing else wou'd secure me; I was
forc'd to cry out: On which the Gentlemen ap∣proach'd,
and he believing one of 'em my
Husband, was in a most dreadful fright, and
soon discover'd the baseness of his Spirit; for
in hopes to get clear off himself, accus'd me to
him he suppos'd my Husband. But this not
availing, he was handsomly toss'd in a Blanket,
wash'd, and turn'd out of doors. All which
Misfortunes he dissembl'd to <HI>Astrea,</HI> and re∣new'd
his Suit to her; till by appointment, I
and the two Gentlemen enter'd the Room, and
expos'd the truth of the Story: which he cou'd
not deny; and, confounded with the Reproaches
of <HI>Astrea,</HI> and the whole Company's laughing at
him, he never after troubl'd her with a Visit.</P>
<P>This was the end of this ridiculous Amour.
But that which touch'd her Heart, cou'd not be
so easily dispos'd of. I have already mention'd
<HI>Lysander,</HI> as a Lover she valu'd; and he having
contributed her Letters to him, to the last Im∣pression,
I shall say no more of it than what those
discover, which I have now inserted in their
order.</P>

<P>YOU bid me write, and I wish it were
only the Effects of Complaisance that
makes me obey you: I shou'd be very
angry with my self and you, if I thought it were
any other Motive: I hope it is not, and will
not have you believe otherwise. I cannot help,
however, wishing you no Mirth, nor any content
in your Dancing Design; and this unwonted
Malice in me I do not like, and wou'd have
conceal'd it if I cou'd, lest you shou'd take it for
something which I am not, nor will believe my
self guilty of. May your Women be all Ugly,
Ill-natur'd, Ill-dress'd, Ill-fashion'd, and Un∣conversable;
and, for your greater Disap∣pointment,

may every Moment of your Time
there be taken up with Thoughts of Me, (a suf∣ficient
Curse,) and yet you will be better enter∣tain'd
than Me, who possibly am, and shall be,
uneasie with Thoughts not so good. Perhaps
you had eas'd me of some Trouble, if you had
let me seen you, or known you had been well:
but these are Favours for better Friends; and
I'll endeavour not to resent the loss, or rather
the miss of 'em. It may be, since I have so
easily granted this Desire of yours, in wri∣ting
to you, you will fear you have pull'd a
Trouble on—But do not: I do, by this,
send for you—You know what you gave
your Hand upon; the Date of Banishment is
already out, and I cou'd have wish'd you had
been so Good-natur'd as to have disobey'd me.
Pray take notice therefore I am better Natur'd

<P>YOU may tell me a Thousand Years, my

but after so unkind a Departure as that
last Night, give me leave (when serious) to
doubt it; nay, 'tis past doubt: I know you
<PB N="46" REF="29"/>
rather hate me: What else could hurry you
from me, when you saw me surrounded with
all the necessary Impossibilities of speaking to
you? I made as broad Signs as one could do,
who durst not speak, both for your sake and
my own: I acted even imprudently, to make
my Soul be understood, that was then (if I
may say so) in real Agonies for your Depar∣ture.
'Tis a wonder a Woman so violent in all
her Passions as I, did not (forgetting all Pru∣dence,
all Considerations) fly out into abso∣lute
Commands, or at least Entreaties, that you
would give me a Moment's time longer. I
burst to speak with you, to know a thousand
things; but particularly, how you came to
be so barbarous, as to carry away all that cou'd
make my Satisfaction. You carry'd away my
Letter, and you carry'd away <HI>Lycidas;</HI> I will
not call him mine, because he has so unkindly
taken himself back. 'Twas with that Design
you came; for I saw all night with what re∣luctancy
you spoke, how coldly you entertain'd
me, and with what pain and uneasiness you
gave me the only Conversation I value in the
World. I am asham'd to tell you this: I know
your peevish Vertue will mis-interpret me: But
take it how you will, think of it as you please;
I am undone, and will be free; I will tell you,
you did not use me well: I am ruin'd, and
will rail at you.—Come then, I conjure
you, this Evening, that after it I may shut
those Eyes that have been too long waking. I
have committed a thousand Madnesses in this;
but you must pardon the Faults you have crea∣ted.
Come and do so; for I must see you to

<P>WHEN shall we understand one ano∣ther?
For I thought, dear <HI>Lycidas,</HI> you
had been a Man of your Parole: I will as soon
believe you will forget me, as that you have
not remember'd the Promise you made me.
Confess you are the teazingest Creature in the
World, rather than suffer me to think you neg∣lect
me, or wou'd put a slight upon me, that
have chosen you from all the whole Creation,
to give my entire Esteem to. This I had as∣sur'd
you Yesterday, but that I dreaded the Ef∣fects
of your Censure to Day; and though I
scorn to guard my Tongue, as hoping 'twill
never offend willingly; yet I can, with much
adoe, hold it, when I have a great mind to say
a thousand things I know will be taken in an
ill sence. Possibly you will wonder what com∣pells
me to write, what moves me to send where
I find so little Welcome; nay, where I meet
with such Returns, it may be I wonder too.

You say I am chang'd: I had rather almost ju∣stifie
an Ill, than Repent, maintain false Argu∣ments,
than yield I am i'th' Wrong. In fine,
Charming Friend <HI>Lycidas,</HI> whatever I was since
you knew me, believe I am still the same in
Soul and Thought; but that is, what shall ne∣ver
hurt you, what shall never be but to serve

sit near me? Was that, my Friend, was that
the Esteem you profess? Who grows cold
first? Who is chang'd? and Who the Aggressor?
'Tis I was first in Friendship, and shall be last in
Constancy: You, by Inclination, and not for
want of Friends, have I plac'd highest in my
Esteem; and for that Reason your Conversa∣tion
is the most acceptable and agreeable of any
in the World—and for this Reason you
shun mine: Take your course; be a Friend

<P>I Had rather, dear <HI>Lycidas,</HI> set my self to write

make an ill Judgment of what I say: Yet you
bid me not dissemble; and you need not have

caution'd me, who so naturally hate those

that may well enough bear a Censure
from People so scrupulous as <HI>Lycidas.</HI> Nor dare
I follow all my Inclinations neither, nor tell all
the little Secrets of my Soul: Why I write them,
I can give no account; 'tis but fooling my self,
perhaps, into an Undoing. I do but (by this
soft Entertainment) rook in my Heart, like a
young Gamester, to make it venture its last
Stake: This, I say, may be the Danger; I may
come off unhurt, but cannot be a <HI>Winner:</HI> Why
then shou'd I throw an uncertain Cast, where I
hazard all, and you nothing? Your stanch
Prudence is Proof against Love, and all the
Bank's on my side: You are so unreasonable,
you wou'd have me pay, where I have con∣tracted
no Debt; you wou'd have me give, and
you, like a Miser, wou'd distribute nothing.

You wou'd not be in Love, for all the

make you Bless'd? Say, <HI>Lycidas,</HI> Will it? I
have heard, when two Souls kindly meet, 'tis
a vast Pleasure, as vast as the Curse must be, when
Kindness is not equal; and why shou'd you be∣lieve
that necessary for me, that will be so very
incommode for you? Will you, Dear <HI>Lycidas,</HI>
allow then, that you have less Good-nature
than I? Pray be Just, till you can give such

or give me a Reason for your Ill-nature. So

of seeing no Man till I saw your Face again;
and when you remember that, you will possi∣bly

much in favour of me as you can; for when

<P>SInce you, my dearest <HI>Lycidas,</HI> have pre∣scrib'd

one of these is not Lying or Dissembling; and
that I had to Night promis'd you shou'd never
have a tedious Letter from me more, I will be∣gin

Hand. I promis'd tho' to write; and tho' I
have no great Matter to say more, than the As∣surance
of my Eternal Love to you, yet to obey
you, and not only so, but to oblige my own
impatient Heart, I must, late as 'tis, say some∣thing
to thee.</P>
<P>I stay'd after thee to Night, till I had read a
whole Act of my new Play too; and then he
led me over all the way, saying, Gad you were
the Man: And beginning some rallying Love-Discourse
after Supper, which he fancy'd was
not so well receiv'd as it ought, he said you
were not handsome, and call'd <HI>Philly</HI> to own
it; but he did not, but was of my side, and
said you were handsome: So he went on a
while, and all ended that concern'd you. And
this, upon my Word, is all.</P>
<P>Your Articles I have read over, and do
not like 'em; you have broke one, even be∣fore
you have sworn or seal'd 'em; that is, they
are writ with Reserves. I must have a better
Account of your Heart to Morrow, when you
come. I grow desperate fond of you, and
wou'd fain be us'd well; if not, I will march

<P>For God's sake make no more Niceties and
Scruples than need, in your way of living with
me; that is, do not make me believe this Di∣stance
is to ease you, when indeed 'tis meant to
ease us both of Love; and, for God's sake, do
not misinterpret my Excess of Fondness; and
if I forget my self, let the Check you give be
sufficient to make me desist. Believe me, dear
Creature, 'tis more out of Humour and Jest,
than any Inclination on my side; for I could sit
eternally with you, without that part of Distur∣bance:
Fear me not, for you are (from that)
as safe as in Heaven it self. Believe me, dear

Farewel; and come, for God's sake, betimes to
Morrow, and put off your foolish Fear and Nice∣ties,
and do not shame me with your perpetual

<P>I Wou'd have gag'd my Life you cou'd not
have left me so coldly, so unconcerned as
you did; but you are resolv'd to give me Proofs
of your No Love: Your Counsel, which was
given you to Night, has wrought the Ef∣fects
which it usually do's in Hearts like yours.
Tell me no more you love me; for 'twill be hard
to make me think it, tho' it be the only Bles∣sing
I ask on Earth: But if Love can merit a
Heart, I know who ought to claim yours. My
Soul is ready to burst with Pride and Indigna∣tion;
and at the same time, Love, with all his
Softness assails me, and will make me write: so
that, between one and the other, I can express
neither as I ought. What shall I do to make
you know I do not use to condescend to so much
Submission, nor to tell my Heart so freely?
Though you think it Use, methinks, I find
my Heart swell with Disdain at this Minute, for
my being ready to make Asseverations of the
contrary, and to assure you I do not, nor ne∣ver
did love, or talk at the rate I do to you,
since I was born: I say, I wou'd swear this,
but something rouls up my Bosom, and checks
my very Thought as it rises. You ought, Oh
Faithless, and infinitely Adorable <HI>Lycidas!</HI> to
know and guess my Tenderness; you ought to
see it grow, and daily increase upon your
Hands: If it be troublesome, 'tis because I
fancy you lessen, whilst I encrease, in Passion;
<PB N="55" REF="33"/>
or rather, that by your ill Judgment of mine,
you never had any in your Soul for me. Oh
unlucky, oh vexatious Thought! Either let me
never see that Charming Face, or ease my Soul
of so tormenting an Agony, as the cruel
Thought of not being belov'd. Why, my
Lovely Dear, should I flatter you? or, why
make more Words of my Tenderness, than a∣nother
Woman, that loves as well, wou'd do,
as once you said? No, you ought rather to be∣lieve
that I say more, because I have more than
any Woman can be capable of: My Soul is
form'd of no other Material than Love; and
all that Soul of Love was form'd for my dear,
faithless <HI>Lycidas</HI>—Methinks I have a Fan∣cy,
that something will prevent my going to
Morrow Morning: However, I conjure thee,
if possible, to come to Morrow about Seven or
Eight at Night, that I may tell you in what a
deplorable Condition you left me to Night. I
cannot describe it; but I feel it, and wish you
the same Pain, for going so inhumanely: But,
oh! you went to Joys, and left me to Tor∣ments!
You went to Love alone, and left me
Love and Rage, Fevers and Calentures, even
Madness it self! Indeed, indeed, my Soul! I
know not to what degree I love you; let it
suffice I do most passionately, and can have no
Thoughts of any other Man, whilst I have
Life. No! Reproach me, Defame me, Lam∣poon
me, Curse me, and Kill me, when I do,
and let Heaven do so too.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>WHy, my dearest Charmer, do you disturb
that Repose I had resolved to pursue, by
taking it unkindly that I did not write? I cannot
disobey you, because indeed I wou'd not, tho'
'twere better much for both I had been for ever
silent: I prophesie so, but at the same time cannot
help my Fate, and know not what Force or Cre∣dit
there is in the Vertue we both profess; but I
am sure 'tis not good to tempt it: I think I am
sure, and I think my <HI>Lycidas</HI> just; But, oh! to
what purpose is all this fooling? You have of∣ten
wisely considered it; but I never stay'd to
think till 'twas too late; and whatever Resolu∣tions
I make in the absence of my lovely Friend,
one single sight turns me all Woman, and all
his. Take notice then, my <HI>Lycidas,</HI> I will hence∣forth
never be wise more; never make any
Vows against my Inclinations, or the little wing'd
Deity. I do not only see 'tis all in vain, but I
really believe they serve only to augment my
Passion. I own I have neither the Coldness of
<HI>Lycidas,</HI> nor the Prudence; I cannot either not
Love, or have a Thousand Arts of hiding it; I
have no Body to fear, and therefore may have
some Body to Love: But if you are destin'd to
be he, the Lord have mercy on me; for I am
<PB N="57" REF="34"/>
sure you'll have none. I expect a Reprimand
for this plain Confession; but I must justifie it,
and I will, because I cannot help it: I was
born to Ill Luck, and this Loss of my Heart is,
possibly, not the least part on't. Do not let me
see you disapprove it, I may one Day grow a∣sham'd
on't, and reclaim, but never, whilst
you blow the Flame, tho' perhaps against your
Will. I expect now a very wise Answer; and,
I believe, with abundance of Discretion, you
will caution me to avoid this Danger that threa∣tens.
Do so, if you have a mind to make me
launch farther into the main Sea of Love: Ra∣ther
deal with me as with a right Woman; make
me believe my self infinitely belov'd. I may chance
from the natural Inconstancy of my Sex, to be
as false as you wou'd wish, and leave you in quiet:
For as I am satisfi'd I love in vain, and without re∣turn,
I'm satisfi'd that nothing, but the thing that
hates me, cou'd treat me as <HI>Lycidas</HI> do's; and 'tis
only the vanity of being belov'd by me can make
you countenance a softness so displeasing to you.
How cou'd any thing, but the Man that hates me,
entertain me so unkindly? witness your excellent
Opinion of me, of loving others; witness your
passing by the end of the Street where I live, and
squandring away your time at any Coffee-House,
rather than allow me what you know in your Soul
is the greatest Blessing of my Life, your dear <HI>dull</HI>
melancholy Company; I call it dull, because you
can never be gay or merry where <HI>Astrea</HI> is. How
cou'd this Indifference possess you, when your
malicious Soul knew I was languishing for you? I
dy'd, I fainted, and pin'd for an Hour of what you
lavish'd out, regardless of me, and without so
<PB N="58" REF="35"/>
much as thinking on me! What can you say, that
Judgment may not pass? that you may not be
condemn'd for the worst-natur'd, incorrigible
Thing in the World? Yield, and at least say, My
honest Friend <HI>Astrea,</HI> I neither do love thee, nor
can, nor ever will; at least let me say, you
were generous, and told me plain blunt Truth: I
know it; nay worse, you impudently (but truly)
told me your Business wou'd permit you to come
every Night, but your Inclinations wou'd not: At
least this was honest, but very unkind and not o∣ver
civil. Do not you, my Amiable <HI>Lycidas,</HI> know
I wou'd purchase your sight at any Rate; Why
this Neglect then? Why keeping distance? <HI>But
as much as to say,</HI> Astrea, <HI>truly you will make me
love you, you will make me fond of you, you will
please and delight me with your Conversation, and
I am a Fellow that do not desire to be pleas'd, there∣fore

</LETTER>
<P>Here I must draw to an End; for tho' consi∣derable
Trusts were repos'd in her, yet they
were of that Import, that I must not presume
here to insert 'em: But shall conclude with her
Death, occasion'd by an unskilful Physician a∣bout
<HI>March</HI> or <HI>April,</HI> 1686. and was buried in
the Cloysters of <HI>Westminster-Abby,</HI> cover'd only
with a plain Marble-stone, with two wretched
Verses on it, made, as I'm inform'd, by a very
ingenious Gentleman, tho' no Poet, the very
Person whom the Envious of our Sex, and the
Malicious of the other, wou'd needs have the
Author of most of hers; which, to my Know∣ledge,
were her own Product, without the
Assistance of any thing but Nature, which shews
it self indeed without the Embarrassments of
Art in e'ry thing she has writ.</P>
<P>She was of a generous and open Temper,
something passionate, very serviceable to her
Friends in all that was in her Power; and cou'd
<PB N="60" REF="36"/>
sooner forgive an Injury, than do one. She
had Wit, Honour, Good-humour, and Judg∣ment.
She was Mistress of all the pleasing Arts
of Conversation, but us'd 'em not to any but
those who lov'd Plain-dealing. She was a Wo∣man
of Sense, and by Consequence a Lover of
Pleasure, as indeed all, both Men and Women,
are; but only some wou'd be thought to be a∣bove
the Conditions of Humanity, and place
their chief Pleasure in a proud, vain Hypocri∣sie:
For my part, I knew her intimately, and
never saw ought unbecoming the just Modesty
of our Sex, tho' more gay and free than the
Folly of the precise will allow. She was, I'm
satisfy'd, a greater Honour to our Sex than all
the canting Tribe of Dissemblers, that die with
the false Reputation of Saints. This I may ven∣ture
to say, because I'm unknown, and the re∣vengeful
Censures of my Sex will not reach me,
since they will never be able to draw the Veil,
and discover the Speaker of these bold Truths.
If I have done my dead Friend any manner of
Justice, I am satisfy'd, having obtain'd my End:
If not, the Reader must remember that there
are few <HI>Astrea's</HI> arise in our Age; and till such
a one does appear, all our Endeavours in En∣comiums
on the last, must be vain and impotent.</P>

<HEAD>THE
HISTORY
OF THE
Royal Slave.</HEAD>
<P>I Do not pretend, in giving you the History
of this <HI>Royal Slave,</HI> to entertain my Reader
with the Adventures of a feign'd <HI>Hero,</HI>
whose Life and Fortunes Fancy may ma∣mage
at the Poet's Pleasure; nor in rela∣ting
the Truth, design to adorn it with any
Accidents, but such as arriv'd in earnest to him:
And it shall come simply into the World, recom∣mended
by its own proper Merits, and natural
Intrigues; there being enough of Reality to
support it, and to render it diverting, without
the addition of Invention.</P>
<P>I was my self an Eye-witness to a great
part of what you will find here set down;
and what I cou'd not be Witness of, I receiv'd
from the Mouth of the chief Actor in this Hi∣story,
the <HI>Hero</HI> himself, who gave us the whole
Transactions of his Youth: And though I shall
omit, for brevity's sake, a thousand little Ac∣cidents
<PB N="2" REF="37"/>
of his Life, which, however pleasant to
us, where History was scarce, and Adventures
very rare; yet might prove tedious and heavy
to my Reader, in a World where he finds Di∣versions
for every Minute, new and strange:
But we who were perfectly charm'd with the
Character of this Great Man, were curious to
gather every Circumstance of his Life.</P>
<P>The Scene of the last part of his Adventures
lies in a Colony in <HI>America,</HI> called <HI>Surinam,</HI> in
the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>But before I give you the Story of this <HI>Gal∣lant
Slave,</HI> 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I tell you the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of
bringing them to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se new,<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> for those
they make use of there, are not <HI>Natives</HI> of
the place; for those we live with in perfect
Amity, without daring to command 'em; but,
on the contrary, caress 'em with all the bro∣therly
and friendly Affection in the worl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;
trading with them for their Fish, Venison, Buf∣filo's
Skins, and little Rarities; as <HI>Marmosets,</HI>
a sort of Monkey, as big as a Rat or Weesel, but
of a marvellous and delicate shape, and has
Face and Hands like an Humane Creature:
and <HI>Cousheries,</HI> a little Beast in the form and
fashion of a Lion, as big as a Kitten; but so
exactly made in all Parts like that noble Beast,
that it is it in <HI>Miniature.</HI> Then for little <HI>Para∣keetoes,</HI>
great <HI>Parrots, Muckaws▪</HI> and a thou∣sand
other Birds and Beasts of wonderful and
surprising Forms, Shapes and Colours. For
Skins of prodigious Snakes, of which there are
some threescore Yards in length; as is the Skin
of one that may be seen at His Majesty's <HI>An∣tiquaries:</HI>
where are also some rare Flies, of
<PB N="3" REF="37"/>
amazing Forms and Colours, presented to 'em
by my self; some as big as my Fist, some less;
and all of various Excellencies, such as Art
cannot imitate. Then we trade for Feathers,
which they order into all shapes, make them∣selves
little short Habits of 'em, and glorious
Wreaths for their Heads, Necks, Arms and
Legs, whose Tinctures are unconceivable. I
had a Sett of these presented to me, and I gave
'em to the King's Theatre, and it was the Dress
of the <HI>Indian Queen,</HI> infinitely admir'd by Per∣sons
of Quality; and were unimitable. Be∣sides
these, a thousand little Knacks, and Ra∣rities
in Nature; and some of Art, as their
Baskets, Weapons, Aprons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We dealt with
'em with Beads of all Colours, Knives, Axes,
Pins and Needles; which they us'd only as
Tools to drill Holes with in their Ears, Noses
and Lips, where they hang a great many little
things; as long Beads, bits of Tin, Brass or
Silver, beat thin; and any shining Trinket.
The Beads they weave into Aprons about a
Quarter of an Ell long, and of the same breadth;
working them very prettily in Flowers of seve∣ral
Colours of Beads; which Apron they wear
just before 'em, as <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> did the Fig-leaves;
the Men wearing a long stripe of Linen,
which they deal with us for. They thread
these Beads also on long Cotton threads, and
make Girdles to tie their Aprons to, which
come twenty times, or more, about the Waste,
and then cross, like a Shoulder-belt, both ways,
and round their Necks, Arms and Legs. This
Adornment, with their long black Hair, and
the Face painted in little Specks or Flowers
<PB N="4" REF="38"/>
here and there, makes 'em a wonderful Figure
to behold. Some of the Beauties which indeed
are finely shap'd, as almost all are, and who
have pretty Features, are very charming and
novel; for they have all that is called Beauty,
except the Colour, which is a reddish Yellow;
or after a new Oiling, which they often use
to themselves, they are of the colour of a new
Brick, but smooth, soft and sleek. They are
extreme modest and bashful, very shy, and nice
of being touch'd. And though they are all thus
naked, if one lives for ever among 'em, there
is not to be seen an indecent Action, or Glance;
and being continually us'd to see one another
so unadorn'd, so like our first Parents before
the Fall, it seems as if they had no Wishes;
there being nothing to heighten Curiosity; but
all you can see, you see at once, and every
moment see; and where there is no Novelty,
there can be no Curiosity. Not but I have
seen a handsom young <HI>Indian,</HI> dying for Love
of a very beautiful young <HI>Indian</HI> Maid; but all
his Courtship was, to fold his Arms, pursue
her with his Eyes, and Sighs were all his Lan∣guage:
While she, as if no such Lover were
present, or rather, as if she desired none such,
carefully guarded her Eyes from beholding him;
and never approach'd him, but she look'd down
with all the blushing modesty I have seen in
the most severe and cautious of our World.
And these People represented to me an abso∣lute
<HI>Idea</HI> of the first State of Innocence, before
Man knew how to sin: And 'tis most evident
and plain, that simple Nature is the most harm∣less,
inoffensive and vertuous Mistress. 'Tis she
<PB N="5" REF="38"/>
alone, if she were permitted, that better in∣structs
the World, than all the Inventions of
Man: Religion wou'd here but destroy that
Tranquillity they possess by Ignorance; and
Laws wou'd but teach 'em to know Offence,
of which now they have no Notion. They
once made Mourning and Fasting for the Death
of the <HI>English</HI> Governor, who had given his
Hand to come on such a day to 'em, and nei∣ther
came nor sent; believing, when once a
Man's Word was past, nothing but Death cou'd
or shou'd prevent his keeping it: And when
they saw he was not dead, they ask'd him
what Name they had for a Man who promis'd
a thing he did not do? The Governor told
them, Such a Man was a <HI>Lyar,</HI> which was a
Word of Infamy to a Gentleman. Then one
of 'em reply'd, <HI>Governor, you are a Lyar, and
guilty of that Infamy.</HI> They have a native
Justice, which knows no Fraud; and they un∣derstand
no Vice, or Cunning, but when they
are taught by the <HI>White</HI> Men. They have Plu∣rality
of Wives; which, when they grow old,
they serve those that succeed 'em, who are
young, but with a Servitude easie and respected;
and unless they take Slaves in War, they have
no other Attendants.</P>
<P>Those on that <HI>Continent</HI> where I was, had no
King; but the oldest War-Captain was obey'd
with great Resignation.</P>
<P>A War-Captain is a Man who has led them
on to Battle with Conduct and Success; of
whom I shall have occasion to speak more here∣after,
and of some other of their Custom and
Manners, as they fall in my way.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="39"/>
With these People, as I said, we live in per∣fect
Tranquillity, and good Understanding, as
it behoves us to do; they knowing all the
places where to seek the best Food of the Coun∣trey,
and the means of getting it; and for very
small and unvaluable Trifles, supply us with
what 'tis impossible for us to get; for they do
not only in the Wood, and over the <HI>Sevana's,</HI>
in Hunting, supply the parts of Hounds, by
swiftly scouring through those almost impas∣sable
places, and by the meer Activity of their
Feet, run down the nimblest Deer, and other
eatable Beasts: But in the Water, one wou'd
think they were Gods of the Rivers, or Fellow-Citizens
of the Deep; so rare an Art they
have in Swimming, Diving, and almost Living
in Water; by which they command the less
swift Inhabitants of the Floods. And then for
Shooting; what they cannot take, or reach
with their Hands, they do with Arrows; and
have so admirable an Aim, that they will split
almost an Hair; and at any distance that an
Arrow can reach, they will shoot down Oran∣ges,
and other Fruit, and only touch the Stalk
with the Dart's Point, that they may not hurt
the Fruit. So that they being, on all occasions,
very useful to us, we find it absolutely ne∣cessary
to caress 'em as Friends, and not to treat
'em as Slaves; nor dare we do other, their
Numbers so far surpassing ours in that <HI>Con∣tinent.</HI></P>
<P>Those then whom we make use of to work
in our Plantations of Sugar, are <HI>Negro's, Black</HI>-Slaves
altogether; which are transported thi∣ther
in this manner:</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="39"/>
Those who want Slaves, make a Bargain
with a Master, or a Captain of a Ship, and con∣tract
to pay him so much a-piece, a matter of
Twenty Pound a Head for as many as he agrees
for, and to pay for 'em when they shall be de∣liver'd
on such a Plantation: So that when
there arrives a Ship laden with Slaves, they
who have so contracted, go a-board, and re∣ceive
their number by Lot; and perhaps in
one Lot that may be for ten, there may happen
to be three or four Men; the rest Women
and Children: or be there more or less of
either Sex, you are oblig'd to be contented with
your Lot.</P>
<P><HI>Coramantien,</HI> a Countrey of <HI>Blacks</HI> so called,
was one of those places in which they found
the most advantageous Trading for these Slaves,
and thither most of our great Traders in that
Merchandise traffick'd; for that Nation is
very war-like and brave; and having a conti∣nual
Campaign, being always in Hostility with
one neighbouring Prince or other, they had
the fortune to take a great many Captives; for
all they took in Battle were sold as Slaves; at
least, those common Men who cou'd not ran∣som
themselves. Of these Slaves so taken, the
General only has all the Profit; and of these
Generals, our Captains and Masters of Ships buy
all their Freights.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Coramantien</HI> was himself a Man
of an Hundred and odd Years old, and had
no Son, though he had many beautiful <HI>Black</HI>-Wives;
for most certainly, there are Beauties
that can charm of that Colour. In his younger
years he had had many gallant Men to his
<PB N="8" REF="40"/>
Sons, thirteen of which died in Battle, con∣quering
when they fell; and he had only left
him for his Successor, one Grand-Child, Son
to one of these dead Victors; who, as soon as
he could bear a Bow in his Hand, and a Quiver
at his back, was sent into the Field, to be
train'd up, by one of the oldest Generals, to
War; where, from his natural Inclination to
Arms, and the Occasions given him, with the
good Conduct of the old General, he became,
at the age of Seventeen, one of the most ex∣pert
Captains, and bravest Soldiers, that ever
saw the Field of <HI>Mars:</HI> So that he was ador'd
as the Wonder of all that World, and the Dar∣ling
of the Soldiers. Besides, he was adorn'd
with a native Beauty so transcending all those
of his gloomy Race, that he struck an Awe and
Reverence, even into those that knew not his
Quality; as he did into me, who beheld him
with Surprize and Wonder, when afterwards
he arriv'd in our World.</P>
<P>He had scarce arriv'd at his Seventeenth
Year, when, fighting by his side, the General
was kill'd with an Arrow in his Eye, which the
Prince <HI>Oroonoko</HI> (for so was this gallant <HI>Moor</HI>
call'd) very narrowly avoided; nor had he, if
the General, who saw the Arrow shot, and per∣ceiving
it aim'd at the Prince, had not bow'd
his Head between, on purpose to receive it in
his own Body, rather than it shou'd touch that
of the Prince, and so saved him.</P>
<P>'Twas then, afflicted as <HI>Oroonoko</HI> was, that
he was proclaim'd General in the Old Man's
place; and then it was, at the finishing of that
War, which had continued for two Years, that
<PB N="9" REF="40"/>
the Prince came to Court; where he had hard∣ly
been a Month together, from the time of
his Fifth Year, to that of Seventeen; and 'twas
amazing to imagine where it was he learn'd so
much Humanity; or, to give his Accomplish∣ments
a juster Name, where 'twas he got that
real Greatness of Soul, those refin'd Notions
of true Honour, that absolute Generosity, and
that Softness that was capable of the highest
Passions of Love and Gallantry, whose Objects
were almost continually fighting Men, or those
mangl'd, or dead; who heard no Sounds, but
those of War and Groans. Some part of it we
may attribute to the care of a <HI>French-man</HI> of
Wit and Learning; who finding it turn to
very good account to be a sort of Royal Tutor
to this young <HI>Black,</HI> and perceiving him very
ready, apt, and quick of Apprehension, took
a great pleasure to teach him Morals, Language
and Science; and was for it extremely belov'd
and valu'd by him. Another reason was; he
lov'd, when he came from War, to see all the
<HI>English</HI> Gentlemen that traded thither; and
did not only learn their Language, but that of
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> also, with whom he traded after∣wards
for Slaves.</P>
<P>I have often seen and convers'd with this
Great Man, and been a Witness to many of
his mighty Actions; and do assure my Reader,
the most illustrious Courts cou'd not have
produc'd a braver Man, both for greatness of
Courage and Mind, a Judgment more solid,
a Wit more quick, and a Conversation more
sweet and diverting. He knew almost as much
as if he had read much: He had heard of,
<PB N="10" REF="41"/>
and admir'd the <HI>Romans;</HI> he had heard of the
late Civil Wars in <HI>England,</HI> and the deplorable
Death of our great Monarch; and wou'd dis∣course
of it with all the Sense and Abhorrence
of the Injustice imaginable. He had an extreme
good and graceful Mien, and all the Civility of
a well-bread Great Man. He had nothing of
Barbarity in his Nature, but in all Points ad∣dress'd
himself as if his Education had been in
some <HI>Europaean</HI> Court.</P>
<P>This great and just Character of <HI>Oroonoko</HI>
gave me an extreme Curiosity to see him, espe∣cially
when I knew he spoke <HI>French</HI> and <HI>En∣glish,</HI>
and that I could talk with him. But
though I had heard so much of him, I was as
greatly surpriz'd when I saw him, as if I had
heard nothing of him; so beyond all Report
I found him. He came into the Room, and
address'd himself to me, and some other Wo∣men,
with the best Grace in the World. He
was pretty tall, but of a shape the most exact
that can be fansy'd: The most famous Sta∣tuary
cou'd not form the figure of a Man more
admirably turn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d from Head to Foot. His Face
was not of that brown, rusty Black which most
of that Nation are, but a perfect Ebony, or
polish'd Jett. His Eyes were the most awful
that cou'd be seen, and very piercing, the
White of 'em being like Snow, as were his
Teeth. His Nose was rising and <HI>Roman,</HI> in∣stead
of <HI>African</HI> and flat. His Mouth, the fi∣nest
shap'd that cou'd be seen; far from those
great turn'd Lips, which are so natural to the
rest of the <HI>Negroes.</HI> The whole Proportion and
Air of his Face was so noble, and exactly
<PB N="11" REF="41"/>
form'd, that, bating his Colour, there cou'd
be nothing in Nature more beautiful, agreea∣ble
and handsome. There was no one Grace
wanting, that bears the Standard of true Beauty.
His Hair came down to his Shoulders, by the
aids of Art; which was, by pulling it out
with a Quill, and keeping it comb'd; of which
he took particular care. Nor did the Perfe∣ctions
of his Mind come short of those of his
Person; for his Discourse was admirable upon
almost any Subject; and who-ever had heard
him speak, wou'd have been convinc'd of their
Errors, that all fine Wit is confin'd to the <HI>White</HI>
men, especially to those of <HI>Christendom;</HI> and
wou'd have confess'd, that <HI>Oroonoko</HI> was as ca∣pable
even of reigning well, and of governing
as wisely, had as great a Soul, as politick
Maxims, and was as sensible of Power, as any
Prince civiliz'd in the most refined Schools of
Humanity and Learning, or the most illustrious
Courts.</P>
<P>This Prince, such as I have describ'd him,
whose Soul and Body were so admirably a∣dorn'd,
was (while yet he was in the Court of
his Grand-father,) as I said, as capable of Love,
as 'twas possible for a brave and gallant Man to
be: and in saying that, I have nam'd the highest
Degree of Love; for sure, great Souls are most
capable of that Passion.</P>
<P>I have already said, the old General was
kill'd by the shot of an Arrow, by the side of
this Prince in Battle; and that <HI>Oroonoko</HI> was
made General. This old dead <HI>Hero</HI> had one
only Daughter left of his Race; a Beauty, that
to describe her truly, one need say only, she
<PB N="12" REF="42"/>
was Female to the noble Male; the beautiful
<HI>Black Venus,</HI> to our young <HI>Mars;</HI> as charming
in her Person as he, and of delicate Vertues. I
have seen an hundred <HI>White</HI> Men sighing after
her, and making a thousand Vows at her Feet,
all vain, and unsuccessful: And she was, indeed,
too great for any, but a Prince of her own Na∣tion
to adore.</P>
<P><HI>Oroonoko</HI> coming from the Wars, (which
were now ended) after he had made his Court
to his Grand-father, he thought in honour he
ought to make a Visit to <HI>Imoinda,</HI> the Daughter
of his Foster-father the dead General; and to
make some Excuses to her, because his Preser∣vation
was the occasion of her Father's Death;
and to present her with those Slaves that had
been taken in this last Battle, as the Trophies
of her Father's Victories. When he came, at∣tended
by all the young Soldiers of any Merit,
he was infinitely surpriz'd at the Beauty of this
fair Queen of Night, whose Face and Person
was to exceeding all he had ever beheld, that
lovely Modesty with which she receiv'd him,
that Softness in her Look, and Sighs, upon the
melancholy Occasion of this Honour that was
done by so great a Man as <HI>Oroonoko,</HI> and a
Prince of whom she had heard such admirable
things; the Awfulness wherewith she receiv'd
him, and the Sweetness of her Words and Be∣haviour
while he stay'd gain'd a perfect Con∣quest
over his fierce Heart, and made him
feel, the Victor cou'd be subdu'd. So that ha∣ving
made his first Complements, and presen∣ted
her an Hundred and fifty Slaves in Fetters,
he told her with his Eyes, that he was not in∣sensible
<PB N="13" REF="42"/>
of her Charms; while <HI>Imoinda,</HI> who
wish'd for nothing more than so glorious a
Conquest, was pleas'd to believe, she under∣stood
that silent Language of new-born Love;
and, from that moment, put on all her addi∣tions
to Beauty.</P>
<P>The Prince return'd to Court with quite
another Humour than before; and though he
did not speak much of the fair <HI>Imoinda,</HI> he had
the pleasure to hear all his Followers speak of
nothing but the Charms of that Maid, inso∣much
that, even in the presence of the old King,
they were extolling her, and heightning, if pos∣sible,
the Beauties they had found in her: so
that nothing else was talk'd of, no other sound
was heard in every corner where there were
Whisperers, but <HI>Imoinda! Imoinda!</HI></P>
<P>'Twill be imagin'd <HI>Oroonoko</HI> stay'd not long
before he made his second Visit; nor, consi∣dering
his Quality, not much longer before he
told her, he ador'd her. I have often heard
him say, that he admir'd by what strange In∣spiration
he came to talk things so soft, and so
passionate, who never knew Love, nor was us'd
to the Conversation of Women; but (to use
his own words) he said; Most happily, some
new, and, till then, unknown Power instructed
his Heart and Tongue in the Language of Love,
and at the same time, in favour of him, inspir'd
<HI>Imoinda</HI> with a sense of his Passion. She was
touch'd with what he said, and return'd it all
in such Answers as went to his very Heart,
with a Pleasure unknown before. Nor did he
use those Obligations ill, that Love had done
him, but turn'd all his happy moments to the
<PB N="14" REF="43"/>
best advantage; and as he knew no Vice, his
Flame aim'd at nothing but Honour, if such a
distinction may be made in Love; and espe∣cially
in that Country, where Men take to them∣selves
a many as they can maintain; and where
the only Crime and Sin with Woman, is, to turn
her off, to abandon her to Want, Shame and
Misery: such ill Morals are only practis'd in
<HI>Christian</HI> Countries, where they preferr the bare
Name of Religion; and, without Vertue or
Morality, think that sufficient. But <HI>Oroonoko</HI> was
none of those Professors; but as he had right
Notions of Honour, so he made her such Propo∣sitions
as were not only and barely such; but,
contrary to the custom of his Countrey, he
made her Vows, she shou'd be the only Woman
he wou'd possess while he liv'd; that no Age or
Wrinkles shou'd encline him to change; for her
Soul wou'd be always fine, and always young;
and he should have an eternal <HI>Idea</HI> in his Mind
of the Charms she now bore; and shou'd look
into his Heart for that <HI>Idea,</HI> when he cou'd find
it no longer in her Face.</P>
<P>After a thousand Assurances of his lasting
Flame, and her eternal Empire over him, she
condescended to receive him for her Husband;
or rather, receiv'd him, as the greatest Honour
the Gods cou'd do her.</P>
<P>There is a certain Ceremony in these cases to
be observ'd, which I forgot to ask him how per∣form'd;
but 'twas concluded on both sides, that
in obedience to him, the Grand-father was to
be first made acquainted with the Design: For
they pay a most absolute Resignation to the
Monarch, especially when he is a Parent also.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="43"/>
On the other side, the old King, who had
many Wives, and many Concubines, wanted
not Court-Flatterers to in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inuate into his Heart
a thousand tender Thoughts for this young
Beauty; and who represented her to his Fancy,
as the most charming he had ever possess'd in
all the long race of his numerous Years. At
this Character, his old Heart, like an extin∣guisht
Brand, most apt to take Fire, felt new
Sparks of Love, and began to kindle; and now
grown to his second Childhood, long'd with
impatience to behold this gay thing▪ with
whom, alas! he could but innocently play.
But how he shou'd be confirm'd she was this
<HI>Wonder,</HI> before he us'd his Power to call her to
Court, (where Maidens never came, unless for
the King's private Use) he was next to con∣sider;
and while he was so doing, he had In∣telligence
brought him, that <HI>Imoinda</HI> was most
certainly Mistress to the Prince <HI>Oroonoko.</HI> This
gave him some <HI>Shagrien;</HI> however, it gave him
also an opportunity, one day, when the Prince
was a-hunting, to wait on a Man of Quality,
as his Slave and Attendant, who shou'd go and
make a Present to <HI>Imoinda,</HI> as from the Prince;
he shou'd then, unknown, see this fair Maid,
and have an opportunity to hear what Mes∣sage
she wou'd return the Prince for his Pre∣sent;
and from thence gather the state of her
Heart, and degree of her Inclination. This
was put in execution, and the old Monarch
saw, and burnt: He found her all he had
heard, and wou'd not delay his Happiness, but
found he shou'd have some Obstacle to over∣come
her Heart; for she express'd her sense of
<PB N="16" REF="44"/>
the Present the Prince had sent her, in terms
so sweet, so soft and pretty, with an Air of
Love and Joy that cou'd not be dissembl'd, inso∣much
that 'twas past doubt whether she lov'd
<HI>Oroonoko</HI> entirely. This gave the old King some
affliction; but he salv'd it with this, that the
Obedience the People pay their King, was not
at all inferior to what they paid their Gods;
and what Love wou'd not oblige <HI>Imoinda</HI> to do,
Duty wou'd compell her to.</P>
<P>He was therefore no sooner got to his Apart∣ment,
but he sent the Royal Veil to <HI>Imoinda;</HI>
that is, the Ceremony of Invitation: He sends
the Lady he has a mind to honour with his
Bed, a Veil, with which she is cover'd, and
secur'd for the King's Use; and 'tis Death to
disobey; besides, held a most impious Disobe∣dience.</P>
<P>'Tis not to be imagin'd the Surprize and
Grief that seiz'd this lovely Maid at this News
and Sight. However, as Delays in these cases
are dangerous, and Pleading worse than Trea∣son;
trembling, and almost fainting, she was
oblig'd to suffer her self to be cover'd, and led
away.</P>
<P>They brought her thus to Court; and the
King, who had caus'd a very rich Bath to be
prepar'd, was led into it, where he sate under
a Canopy, in State, to receive this long'd-for
Virgin; whom he having commanded shou'd
be brought to him, they (after dis-robing her)
led her to the Bath, and making fast the Doors,
left her to descend. The King, without more
Courtship, bad her throw off her Mantle, and
come to his Arms. But <HI>Imoinda,</HI> all in Tears,
<PB N="17" REF="44"/>
threw her self on the Marble, on the brink of
the Bath, and besought him to hear her. She
told him, as she was a Maid, how proud of
the Divine Glory she should have been, of
having it in her power to oblige her King:
but as by the Laws, he cou'd not; and
from his Royal Goodness, wou'd not take
from any Man his wedded Wife: so she be∣liev'd
she shou'd be the Occasion of making
him commit a great Sin, if she did not reveal
her State and Condition; and tell him, she
was another's, and cou'd not be so happy to
be his.</P>
<P>The King, enrag'd at this Delay, ha∣stily
demanded the Name of the bold Man,
that had marry'd a Woman of her Degree,
without his Consent. <HI>Imoinda,</HI> seeing his Eyes
fierce, and his Hands tremble, (whether with
Age or Anger, I know not, but she fansy'd the
last,) almost repented she had said so much,
for now she fear'd the storm wou'd fall on the
Prince; she therefore said a thousand things
to appease the raging of his Flame, and to pre∣pare
him to hear who it was with calmness;
but before she spoke, he imagin'd who she
meant, but wou'd not seem to do so, but com∣manded
her to lay aside her Mantle, and suffer
her self to receive his Caresses, or, by his Gods
he swore, that happy Man whom she was go∣ing
to name shou'd die, though it were even
<HI>Oroonoko</HI> himself: <HI>Therefore</HI> (said he) <HI>deny this
Marriage, and swear thy self a Maid. That</HI> (re∣ply'd
<HI>Imoinda) by all our Powers I do; for I am
not yet known to my Husband. 'Tis enough</HI> (said
the King;) <HI>'tis enough both to satisfie my Con∣science,
<PB N="18" REF="45"/>
and my Heart.</HI> And rising from his
Seat, he went and led her into the Bath; it
being in vain for her to resist.</P>
<P>In this time, the Prince, who was return'd
from Hunting, went to visit his <HI>Imoinda,</HI> but
found her gone; and not only so, but heard
she had receiv'd the Royal Veil. This rais'd
him to a storm; and in his madness, they had
much ado to save him from laying violent
Hands on himself. Force first prevail'd, and
then Reason: They urg'd all to him, that
might oppose his Rage; but nothing weigh'd
so greatly with him as the King's Old Age un∣capable
of injuring him with <HI>Imoinda.</HI> He
wou'd give way to that Hope, because it pleas'd
him most, and flatter'd best his Heart. Yet this
serv'd not altogether to make him cease his dif∣ferent
Passions, which sometimes rag'd within
him, and sometimes softned into Showers.
'Twas not enough to appease him, to tell him,
his Grand-father was old▪ and cou'd not that
way injure him, while he retain'd that awful
Duty which the Young Men are us'd there to
pay to their grave Relations. He cou'd not be
convinc'd he had no cause to sigh and mourn
for the loss of a Mistress, he cou'd not with
all his strength and courage retrieve. And
he wou'd often cry, <HI>Oh, my Friends! were she
in wall'd Cities, or confin'd from me in Fortifica∣tions
of the greatest strength; did Inchantments or
Monsters detain her from me; I wou'd venture
through any Hazard to free her: But here, in the
Arms of a feeble Old Man, my Youth, my violent
Love, my Trade in Arms, and all my vast Desire
of Glory, avail me nothing:</HI> Imoinda <HI>is as irre∣coverably
<PB N="19" REF="45"/>
lost to me, as if she were snatcht by the
cold Arms of Death: Oh! she is never to be re∣triev'd.
If I wou'd wait tedious Years, till Fate
shou'd bow the old King to his Grave; even that
wou'd not leave me</HI> Imoinda <HI>free; but still that
Custom that makes it so vile a Crime for a Son to
marry his Father's Wives or Mistresses, wou'd hin∣der
my Happiness; unless I wou'd either ignobly set
an ill President to my Successors, or abandon my
Countrey, and fly with her to some unknown World
who never heard our Story.</HI></P>
<P>But it was objected to him, That his case was
not the same; for <HI>Imoinda</HI> being his lawful
Wife by solemn Contract, 'twas he was the
injur'd Man, and might, if he so pleas'd, take
<HI>Imoinda</HI> back, the breach of the Law being on
his Grand-Father's side; and that if he cou'd
circumvent him, and redeem her from the <HI>Otan,</HI>
which is the Palace of the King's Women, a
sort of <HI>Seraglio,</HI> it was both just and lawful for
him so to do.</P>
<P>This Reasoning had some force upon him,
and he shou'd have been entirely comforted,
but for the thought that she was possess'd by
his Grand-father. However, he lov'd so well,
that he was resolv'd to believe what most fa∣vour'd
his Hope; and to endeavour to learn
from <HI>Imoinda's</HI> own Mouth, what only she
cou'd satisfie him in; whether she was robb'd
of that Blessing which was only due to his
Faith and Love. But as it was very hard to
get a sight of the Women, (for no Men ever
enter'd into the <HI>Otan,</HI> but when the King went
to entertain himself with some one of his Wives
or Mistresses; and 'twas Death, at any other
<PB N="20" REF="46"/>
time for any other to go in;) so he knew not
how to contrive to get a sight of her.</P>
<P>While <HI>Oroonoko</HI> felt all the Agonies of Love,
and suffer'd under a Torment the most painful
in the world, the old King was not exempted
from his share of Affliction. He was troubled,
for having been forc'd, by an irresistible Passion,
to rob his Son of a Treasure, he knew, cou'd
not but be extremely dear to him, since she
was the most beautiful that ever had been seen;
and had besides, all the Sweetness and Inno∣cence
of Youth and Modesty, with a Charm
of Wit surpassing all. He found that, however,
she was forc'd to expose her lovely Person to
his wither'd Arms, she cou'd only sigh and
weep there, and think of <HI>Oroonoko;</HI> and often∣times
cou'd not for bear speaking of him, though
her Life were, by Custom, forfeited by own∣ing
her Passion. But she spoke not of a Lover
only, but of a Prince dear to him, to whom
she spoke; and of the Praises of a Man, who,
till now, fill'd the old Man's Soul with Joy at
every recital of his Bravery, or even his Name.
And 'twas this Dotage on our young Hero, that
gave <HI>Imoinda</HI> a thousand Privileges to speak of
him, without offending; and this Condescention
in the old King, that made her take the Satis∣faction
of speaking of him so very often.</P>
<P>Besides, he many times enquir'd how the
Prince bore himself: And those of whom he
ask'd, being entirely Slaves to the Merits and
Vertues of the Prince, still answer'd what they
thought conduc'd best to his Service; which was,
to make the old King fansie that the Prince had
no more Interest in <HI>Imoinda,</HI> and had resign'd
<PB N="21" REF="46"/>
her willingly to the Pleasure of the King;
that he diverted himself with his Mathema∣ticians,
his Fortifications, his Officers, and his
Hunting.</P>
<P>This pleas'd the old Lover, who fail'd not to
report these things again to <HI>Imoinda,</HI> that she
might, by the Example of her young Lover,
withdraw her Heart, and rest better contented
in his Arms. But however, she was forc'd to
receive this unwelcome News, in all appearance,
with Unconcern and Content; her Heart was
bursting within, and she was only happy when
she cou'd get alone, to vent her Griefs and Moans
with Sighs and Tears.</P>
<P>What Reports of the Prince's Conduct were
made to the King, he thought good to justifie
as far as possibly he cou'd by his Actions; and
when he appear'd in the Presence of the King,
he shew'd a Face not at all betraying his Heart:
so that in a little time, the old Man, being en∣tirely
convinc'd that he was no longer a Lover
of <HI>Imoindae,</HI> he carry'd him with him, in his
Train, to the <HI>Otan,</HI> often to banquet with his
Mistress. But as soon as he enter'd, one day,
into the Apartment of <HI>Imoinda,</HI> with the King,
at the first Glance from her Eyes, notwith∣standing
all his determined Resolution, he was
ready to sink in the place where he stood; and
had certainly done so, but for the support of
<HI>Aboan,</HI> a young Man who was next to him;
which, with his Change of Countenance, had
betray'd him, had the King chanc'd to look
that way. And I have observ'd, 'tis a very
great error in those who laugh when one
says, <HI>A</HI> Negro <HI>can change Colour:</HI> for I have
<PB N="22" REF="47"/>
seen 'em as frequently blush, and look pale,
and that as visibly as ever I saw in the most
beautiful <HI>White.</HI> And 'tis certain, that both these
Changes were evident, this day, in both these
Lovers. And <HI>Imoinda,</HI> who saw with some
Joy the Change in the Prince's Face, and found
it in her own, strove to divert the King from
beholding either, by a forc'd Caress, with which
she met him; which was a new Wound in the
Heart of the poor dying Prince. But as soon
as the King was busy'd in looking on some fine
thing of <HI>Imoinda</HI>'s making, she had time to tell
the Prince, with her angry but Love-darting
Eyes, that she resented his Coldness, and be∣moan'd
her own miserable Captivity. Nor
were his Eyes silent, but answer'd hers again,
as much as Eyes cou'd do, instructed by the
most tender and most passionate Heart that
ever lov'd: And they spoke so well, and so
effectually, as <HI>Imoinda</HI> no longer doubted but
she was the only Delight and Darling of that
Soul she found pleading in 'em its Right of
Love, which none was more willing to resign
than she. And 'twas this powerful Language
alone that in an instant convey'd all the
Thoughts of their Souls to each other; that
they both found there wanted but Opportu∣nity
to make them both entirely happy. But
when he saw another Door open'd by <HI>Onah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI>
(a former old Wife of the Kings, who now had
Charge of <HI>Imoinda,</HI>) and saw the Prospect of
a Bed of State made ready, with Sweets and
Flowers for the Dalliance of the King, who
immediately led the trembling Victim from his
sight, into that prepar'd Repose; what Rage!
<PB N="23" REF="47"/>
what wild Frenzies seiz'd his Heart! which
forcing to keep within bounds, and to suffer
without noise, it became the more insuppor∣table,
and rent his Soul with ten thousand pains.
He was forc'd to retire, to vent his Groans,
where he fell down on a Carpet, and lay strug∣gling
a long time, and only breathing now and
then,—Oh, <HI>Imoinda!</HI> When <HI>Onahal</HI> had finisht
her necessary Affair within, shutting the Door,
she came forth, to wait till the King call'd; and
hearing some one sighing in the other Room,
she past on, and found the Prince in that de∣plorable
Condition, which she thought needed
her Aid. She gave him Cordials, but all in
vain; till finding the nature of his Disease, by
his Sighs, and naming <HI>Imoinda;</HI> she told him,
he had not so much cause as he imagin'd to afflict
himself; for if he knew the King so well as
she did, he wou'd not lose a moment in Jea∣lousie,
and that she was confident that <HI>Imoinda</HI>
bore, at this minute, part in his Affliction.
<HI>Aboan</HI> was of the same opinion; and both to∣gether
persuaded him to re-assume his Cou∣rage;
and all sitting down on the Carpet, the
Prince said so many obliging things to <HI>Onahal,</HI>
that he half-persuaded her to be of his Party.
And she promis'd him, she wou'd thus far com∣ply
with his just Desires, that she wou'd let
<HI>Imoinda</HI> know how faithful he was, what he
suffer'd, and what he said.</P>
<P>This Discourse lasted till the King call'd;
which gave <HI>Oroonoko</HI> a certain Satisfaction; and
with the Hope <HI>Onahal</HI> had made him conceive,
he assum'd a Look as gay as 'twas possible a
Man in his circumstances cou'd do; and pre∣sently
<PB N="24" REF="48"/>
after, he was call'd in with the rest who
waited without. The King commanded Mu∣sick
to be brought, and several of his young
Wives and Mistresses came all together by his
Command, to dance before him: where <HI>Imoinda</HI>
perform'd her part with an Air and Grace so
passing all the rest, as her Beauty was above
'em; and receiv'd the Present ordain'd as a
Prize. The Prince was every moment more
charm'd with the new Beauties and Graces he
beheld in this <HI>Fair One:</HI> And while he gaz'd,
and she danc'd, <HI>Onahal</HI> was retir'd to a Window
with <HI>Aboan.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Onahal,</HI> as I said, was one of the Cast-Mistresses
of the old King; and 'twas these
(now past their Beauty) that were made Guar∣dians
or Governantee's to the new and the
young ones; and whose Business it was, to
teach them all those wanton Arts of Love, with
which they prevail'd and charm'd heretofore
in their Turn; and who now treated the tri∣umphing
happy Ones with all the Severity, as
to Liberty and Freedom, that was possible, in
revenge of their Honours they rob them of;
envying them those Satisfactions, those Gal∣lantries
and Presents, that were once made
to themselves, while Youth and Beauty lasted,
and which they now saw pass, as it were, regard∣less
by, and paid only to the Bloomings. And
certainly, nothing is more afflicting to a de∣cay'd
Beauty, than to behold in it self de∣clining
Charms, that were once ador'd; and
to find those Caresses paid to new Beauties, to
which once she laid a claim; to hear 'em
whisper, as she passes by, <HI>That once was a deli∣cate
<PB N="25" REF="48"/>
Woman.</HI> These abandon'd Ladies there∣fore
endeavour to revenge all the Despights,
and Decays of Time, on these flourishing
happy Ones. And 'twas this Severity, that
gave <HI>Oroonoko</HI> a thousand fears he should never
prevail with <HI>Onahal</HI> to see <HI>Imoinda.</HI> But, as
I said, she was now retir'd to a Window with
<HI>Aboan.</HI></P>
<P>This Young Man was not only one of the
best Quality, but a Man extremely well made,
and beautiful; and coming often to attend the
King to the <HI>Otan,</HI> he had subdu'd the Heart
of the antiquated <HI>Onahal,</HI> which had not for∣got
how pleasant it was to be in Love: And
though she had some Decays in her Face, she
had none in her Sence and Wit; she was there
agreeable still, even to <HI>Aboan</HI>'s Youth: so that
he took pleasure in entertaining her with Dis∣courses
of Love. He knew also, that to make
his Court to these She-Favourites, was the
way to be great; these being the Persons that
do all Affairs and Business at Court. He had
also observ'd that she had given him Glances
more tender and inviting than she had done
to others of his Quality. And now, when he
saw that her Favour cou'd so absolutely oblige
the Prince, he fail'd not to sigh in her Ear, and
to look with Eyes all soft upon her, and give
her Hope that she had made some Impressions
on his Heart. He found her pleas'd at this,
and making a thousand advances to him: but
the Ceremony ending, and the King departing,
broke up the Company for that Day, and his
Conversation.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="49"/>
<HI>Aboan</HI> fail'd not that night to tell the Prince
of his Success, and how advantageous the Ser∣vice
of <HI>Onahal</HI> might be to his Amour with
<HI>Imoinda.</HI> The Prince was over-joy'd with this
good News, and besought him, if it were pos∣sible,
to caress her so, as to engage her entirely;
which he cou'd not fail to do, if he comply'd
with her Desires: <HI>For then</HI> (said the Prince)
<HI>her Life lying at your Mercy, she must grant you
the Request you make in my behalf. Aboan</HI> under∣stood
him, and assur'd him he would make love
so effectually, that he would defie the most ex∣pert
Mistress of the Art, to find out whether he
dissembl'd it, or had it really. And 'twas with
impatience they waited the next Opportunity of
going to the <HI>Otan.</HI></P>
<P>The Wars came on; the Time of taking the
Field approach'd, and 'twas impossible for the
Prince to delay his going at the Head of his
Army, to encounter the Enemy: so that every
Day seem'd a tedious Year, till he saw his <HI>Imoinda;</HI>
for he believ'd he cou'd not live, if he were forc'd
away without being so happy. 'Twas with im∣patience
therefore that he expected the next Visit
the King wou'd make; and, according to his
wish, it was not long.</P>
<P>The Parley of the Eyes of these two Lovers
had not pass'd so secretly, but an old jealous
Lover could spy it; or rather, he wanted not
Flatterers, who told him, they observ'd it:
so that the Prince was hasten'd to the Camp,
and this was the last Visit he found he shou'd
make to the <HI>Otan;</HI> he therefore urg'd <HI>Aboan</HI>
to make the best of this last Effort, and to ex∣plain
himself so to <HI>Onahal,</HI> that she, deferring
<PB N="27" REF="49"/>
her Enjoyment of her young Lover no longer,
might make way for the Prince to speak to
<HI>Imoinda.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The whole Affair being agreed on between
the Prince and</HI> Aboan, <HI>they attended the King,
as the custom was, to the</HI> Otan; <HI>where, while
the whole Company was taken up in beholding
the Dancing, and Antick Postures the Women-Royal
made, to divert the King,</HI> Onahal <HI>singl'd
out</HI> Aboan <HI>whom she found most plyable to her
wish. When she had him where she believ'd
she cou'd not be heard, she sigh'd to him, and
softly cry'd;</HI> Ah, <HI>Aboan!</HI> when will you be
sensible of my Passion? I confess it with my Mouth,
because I wou'd not give my Eyes the Lye; and you
have too much already perceiv'd they have con∣fess'd
my Flame: Nor wou'd I have you believe,
that because I am the abandon'd Mistress of a King,
I esteem my self altogether divested of Charms:
No, <HI>Aboan;</HI> I have still a Rest of Beauty enough
engaging, and have learn'd to please too well, not
to be desirable: I can have Lovers still, but will
have none but <HI>Aboan.</HI> Madam, (<HI>reply'd the
half-feigning Youth</HI>) you have already, by my
Eyes, found you can still conquer; and I believe
'tis in pity of me, you condescend to this kind Con∣fession:
But, Madam, Words are us'd to be so
small a part of our Country-Courtship, that 'tis
rare one can get so happy an Opportunity as to tell
one's Heart; and those few Minutes we have, are
forc'd to be snatcht for more certain Proofs of
Love than Speaking and Sighing; and such I lan∣guish
for.</P>
<P>He spoke this with such a Tone, that she
hop'd it true, and cou'd not forbear believing
<PB N="28" REF="50"/>
it; and being wholly transported with Joy,
for having subdu'd the finest of all the King's
Subjects to her Desires, she took from her Ears
two large Pearls, and commanded him to wear
'em in his. He wou'd have refus'd em, crying,
<HI>Madam, these are not the Proofs of your Love
that I expect; 'tis Opportunity, 'tis a Lone-hour
only, that can make me happy:</HI> But forcing the
Pearls into his Hand, she whisper'd softly to
him; <HI>Oh! Do not fear a Woman's Invention, when
Love sets her a-thinking.</HI> And pressing his Hand,
she cry'd, <HI>This Night you shall be happy: Come to
the Gate of the Orange-Grove, behind the</HI> Otan,
<HI>and I will be ready, about Mid-night, to receive
you.</HI> 'Twas thus agreed, and she left him,
that no notice might be taken of their speaking
together.</P>
<P>The Ladies were still dancing; and the King
laid on a Carpet, with a great deal of pleasure
was beholding them, especially <HI>Imoinda,</HI> who
that day appear'd more lovely than ever, be∣ing
enliven'd with the good Tidings <HI>Onahal</HI>
had brought her, of the constant Passion the
Prince had for her. The Prince was laid on
another Carpet, at the other end of the Room,
with his Eyes fix'd on the Object of his Soul;
and as she turn'd or mov'd, so did they; and
she alone gave his Eyes and Soul their Motions.
Nor did <HI>Imoinda</HI> employ her Eyes to any other
use, than in beholding, with infinite Plea∣sure,
the Joy she produc'd in those of the Prince.
But while she was more regarding Him, than
the Steps she took, she chanced to fall; and so
near him, as that leaping with extreme force
from the Carpet, he caught her in his Arms
<PB N="29" REF="50"/>
as she fell: And 'twas visible to the whole Pre∣sence,
the Joy wherewith he receiv'd her; he
clasp'd her close to his Bosom, and quite for∣got
that Reverence that was due to the Mi∣stress
of a King, and that Punishment that is
the Reward of a Boldness of this nature; and
had not the Presence of Mind of <HI>Imoinda</HI> (fon∣der
of his safety, than her own) befriended
him, in making her spring from his Arms, and
fall into her Dance again, he had, at that in∣stant,
met his Death; for the old King, jealous
to the last degree, rose up in Rage, broke all
the Diversion, and led <HI>Imoinda</HI> to her Apart∣ment,
and sent out word to the Prince, to go
immediately to the Camp; and that if he were
found another Night in Court, he shou'd suf∣fer
the Death ordain'd for disobedient Of∣fenders.</P>
<P>You may imagine how welcome this News
was to <HI>Oroonoko,</HI> whose unseasonable Transport
and Caress of <HI>Imoinda</HI> was blam'd by all Men
that lov'd him; and now he perceiv'd his fault,
yet cry'd, <HI>That for such another Moment, he wou'd
be content to die.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Otan</HI> was in disorder about this Ac∣cident;
and <HI>Onahal</HI> was particularly concern'd,
because on the Prince's Stay depended her
Happiness; for she cou'd no longer expect
that of <HI>Aboan.</HI> So that, e're they departed,
they contriv'd it so, that the Prince and he
shou'd come both that Night to the Grove of
the <HI>Otan,</HI> which was all of Oranges and Ci∣trons,
and that there they wou'd wait her
Orders.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="51"/>
They parted thus, with Grief enough, till
Night, leaving the King in possession of the
lovely Maid. But nothing could appease the
Jealousie of the old Lover; he wou'd not be
impos'd on, but wou'd have it, that <HI>Imoinda</HI>
made a false Step, on purpose to fall into <HI>Oroo∣noko</HI>'s
Bosom, and that all things look'd like a
Design on both sides, and 'twas in vain she pro∣tested
her Innocence; he was old and obstinate,
and left her more than half assur'd that his Fear
was true.</P>
<P>The King going to his Apartment, sent to
know where the Prince was, and if he intended
to obey his Command. The Messenger re∣turn'd,
and told him, he found the Prince pen∣sive,
and altogether unprepared for the Cam∣paign;
that he lay negligently on the ground,
and answer'd very little. This confirm'd the
Jealousie of the King, and he commanded that
they shou'd very narrowly and privately watch
his Motions; and that he shou'd not stir from
his Apartment, but one Spy or other shou'd be
employ'd to watch him. So that the hour ap∣proaching,
wherein he was to go to the Citron-Grove;
and taking only <HI>Aboan</HI> along with him,
he leaves his Apartment, and was watch'd to
the very Gate of the <HI>Otan;</HI> where he was seen
to enter, and where they left him, to carry
back the Tidings to the King.</P>
<P><HI>Oroonoko</HI> and <HI>Aboan</HI> were no sooner enter'd,
but <HI>Onahal</HI> led the Prince to the Apartment of
<HI>Imoinda;</HI> who, not knowing any thing of her
Happiness, was laid in Bed. But <HI>Onahal</HI> only
left him in her Chamber, to make the best of
his Opportunity, and took her dear <HI>Aboan</HI> to
<PB N="31" REF="51"/>
her own; where he shew'd the height of Com∣plaisance
for his Prince, when, to give him an
Opportunity, he suffer'd himself to be caress'd
in Bed by <HI>Onahal.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince softly waken'd <HI>Imoinda,</HI> who was
not a little surpriz'd with Joy to find him there;
and yet she trembl'd with a thousand Fears.
I believe he omitted saying nothing to this
young Maid, that might persuade her to suffer
him to seize his own, and take the Rights of
Love; and I believe she was not long resisting
those Arms where she so long'd to be; and ha∣ving
Opportunity, Night and Silence, Youth, Love
and Desire, he soon prevail'd, and ravisht in a
Moment, what his old Grand-father had been
endeavouring for so many Months.</P>
<P>'Tis not to be imagin'd the Satisfaction of
these two young Lovers; nor the Vows she
made him, that she remain'd a spotless Maid,
till that Night; and that what she did with his
Grand-father, had robb'd him of no part of
her Virgin-Honour, the Gods, in Mercy and
Justice, having reserv'd that for her plighted
Lord, to whom of Right it belong'd. And 'tis
impossible to express the Transports he suffer'd,
while he listen'd to a Discourse so charming
from her lov'd Lips; and clasp'd that Body in
his Arms, for whom he had so long languisht;
and nothing now afflicted him, but his sudden
Departure from her; for he told her the Ne∣cessity,
and his Commands; but should depart
satisfy'd in this, That since the old King had
hitherto not been able to deprive him of those
Enloyments which only belong'd to him, he
believ'd, for the future, he would be less able to
<PB N="32" REF="52"/>
injure him; so that, abating the Scandal of the
Veil, which was no otherwise so, than that she
was Wife to another: He believ'd her safe, even
in the Arms of the King, and innocent; yet
wou'd he have ventur'd at the Conquest of the
World, and have given it all, to have had her
avoided that Honour of receiving the <HI>Royal Veil.</HI>
'Twas thus, between a thousand Caresses, that
both bemoan'd the hard fate of Youth and
Beauty, so liable to that cruel Promotion:
'Twas a Glory that cou'd well have been spar'd
here, though desir'd and aim'd at by all the
young Females of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>But while they were thus fondly employ'd,
forgetting how Time ran on, and that the
Dawn must conduct him far away from his
only Happiness, they heard a great Noise in the
<HI>Otan,</HI> and unusual Voices of Men; at which
the Prince, starting from the Arms of the
frighted <HI>Imoinda,</HI> ran to a little Battle-Axe he
us'd to wear by his Side; and having not so
much leisure as to put on his Habit, he op∣pos'd
himself against some who were already
opening the Door; which they did with so
much Violence, that <HI>Oroonoko</HI> was not able to
defend it; but was forc'd to cry out with a
commanding Voice, <HI>Whoever ye are that have
the Boldness to attempt to approach this Apartment
thus rudely; know▪ that I, the Prince</HI> Oroonoko,
<HI>will revenge it with the certain Death of him that
first enters: Therefore, stand back, and know, this
Place is sacred to Love and Me this Night; to Mor∣row
'tis the King's.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This he spoke with a Voice so resolv'd and
assur'd, that they soon retir'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the Door;
<PB N="33" REF="52"/>
but cry'd;</HI> 'Tis by the King's Command we are
come: and being satisfy'd by thy Voice, O Prince,
as much as if we had enter'd, we can report to the
King the Truth of all his Fears, and leave thee to
provide for thy own Safety, as thou art advis'd by
thy Friends.</P>
<P>At these words they departed, and left the
Prince to take a short and sad leave of his
<HI>Imoinda;</HI> who trusting in the strength of her
Charms, believ'd she shou'd appease the Fury
of a jealous King, by saying, She was surpriz'd,
and that it was by force of Arms he got into
her Apartment. All her Concern now was
for his Life, and therefore she hasten'd him to
the Camp, and with much a-doe prevail'd on
him to go. Nor was it she alone that prevail'd;
<HI>Aboan</HI> and <HI>Onahal</HI> both pleaded, and both as∣sur'd
him of a Lye that shou'd be well enough
contriv'd to secure <HI>Imoinda.</HI> So that at last,
with a Heart sad as Death, dying Eyes, and
sighing Soul, <HI>Oroonoko</HI> departed, and took his
way to the Camp.</P>
<P>It was not long after the King, in Person, came
to the <HI>Otan;</HI> where beholding <HI>Imoinda,</HI> with
Rage in his Eyes, he upbraided her Wicked∣ness
and Perfidy; and threatning her Royal
Lover, she fell on her Face at his Feet, be∣dewing
the Floor with her Tears, and implo∣ring
his Pardon for a Fault which she had not
with her Will committed; as <HI>Onahal,</HI> who
was also prostrate with her, cou'd testifie:
That, unknown to her, he had broke into
her Apartment, and ravish'd her. She spoke
this much against her Conscience; but to
save her own Life, 'twas absolutely necessary
<PB N="34" REF="53"/>
she shou'd feign this Falsity. She knew it
cou'd not injure the Prince, he being fled to
an Army that wou'd stand by him, against
any Injuries that shou'd assault him. How∣ever,
this last Thought of <HI>Imoinda</HI>'s being Ra∣vish'd,
chang'd the measures of his Revenge;
and whereas before he design'd to be himself
her Executioner, he now resolv'd she shou'd
not die. But as it is the greatest Crime in na∣ture
amongst 'em, to touch a Woman after
having been possess'd by a Son, a Father, or a
Brother; so now he look'd on <HI>Imoinda</HI> as a
polluted thing, wholly unfit for his Embrace:
nor wou'd he resign her to his Grand-son, be∣cause
she had receiv'd the <HI>Royal Veil.</HI> He there∣fore
removes her from the <HI>Otan,</HI> with <HI>Onahal;</HI>
whom he put into safe Hands, with order they
shou'd be both sold off, as Slaves, to another
Country, either <HI>Christian</HI> or <HI>Heathen,</HI> 'twas no
matter where.</P>
<P>This cruel Sentence, worse than Death, they
implor'd might be revers'd; but their Prayers
were vain, and it was put in execution accor∣dingly,
and that with so much Secrecy, that
none either without or within the <HI>Otan</HI>
knew any thing of their Absence, or their
Destiny.</P>
<P>The old King, nevertheless, executed this
with a great deal of Reluctancy; but he be∣liev'd
he had made a very great Conquest over
himself, when he had once resolv'd, and had
perform'd what he resolv'd. He believ'd now,
that his Love had been unjust; and that he
cou'd not expect the Gods, or <HI>Captain of the
Clouds</HI> (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey call the unknown Power)
<PB N="35" REF="53"/>
wou'd suffer a better Consequence from so ill a
Cause. He now begins to hold <HI>Oroonoko</HI> ex∣cus'd;
and to say, he had Reason for what he
did: And now every Body cou'd assure the
King how passionately <HI>Imoinda</HI> was belov'd
by the Prince; even those confess'd it now,
who said the contrary before his Flame was
abated. So that the King being old, and not
able to defend himself in War, and having no
Sons of all his Race remaining alive, but only
this, to maintain him on his Throne; and
looking on this as a Man disoblig'd, first by
the Rape of his Mistress, or rather Wife, and
now by depriving of him wholly of her, he
fear'd, might make him desperate, and do some
cruel thing, either to himself or his old Grand-father
the Offender; he began to repent him
extremely of the Contempt he had, in his
Rage, put on <HI>Imoinda.</HI> Besides, he consider'd,
he ought in Honour to have kill'd her, for this
Offence, if it had been one: He ought to have
had so much Value and Consideration for a
Maid of her Quality, as to have nobly put her
to Death; and not to have sold her like a
common Slave, the greatest Revenge, and the
most disgraceful of any; and to which they a
thousand times preferr Death, and implore it;
as <HI>Imoinda</HI> did, but cou'd not obtain that Ho∣nour.
Seeing therefore it was certain, that
<HI>Oroonoko</HI> wou'd highly resent this Affront, he
thought good to make some Excuse for his
Rashness to him; and to that end, he sent a
Messenger to the Camp, with Orders to treat
with him about the Matter, to gain his Par∣don,
and to endeavour to mitigate his Grief;
<PB N="36" REF="54"/>
but that by no means he shou'd tell him she
was sold, but secretly put to death; for he
knew he shou'd never obtain his Pardon for
the other.</P>
<P>When the Messenger came, he found the
Prince upon the point of Engaging with the
Enemy; but as soon as he heard of the arri∣val
of the Messenger, he commanded him to
his Tent, where he embrac'd him, and receiv'd
him with Joy; which was soon abated, by the
Down-cast Looks of the Messenger, who was
instantly demanded the cause by <HI>Oroonoko,</HI>
who, impatient of Delay, ask'd a thousand
Questions in a breath; and all concerning <HI>Imo∣inda.</HI>
But there needed little Return; for he
cou'd almost answer himself of all he deman∣ded
from his Sighs and Eyes. At last, the Mes∣senger
casting himself at the Prince's Feet, and
kissing them, with all the Submission of a Man
that had something to implore which he dreaded
to utter, he besought him to hear with Calm∣ness
what he had to deliver to him, and to call
up all his Noble and Heroick Courage, to en∣counter
with his Words, and defend himself
against the ungrateful things he must relate.
<HI>Oroonoko</HI> reply'd, with a deep Sigh, and a lan∣guishing
Voice,—<HI>I am arm'd against their worst
Efforts—; for I know they will tell me,</HI> Imo∣inda
<HI>is no more—; and after that, you may spare
the rest.</HI> Then, commanding him to rise, he
laid himself on a Carpet, under a rich Pa∣villion,
and remain'd a good while silent, and
was hardly heard to sigh. When he was come
a little to himself, the Messenger ask'd him leave
to deliver that part of his Embassy which the
<PB N="37" REF="54"/>
Prince had not yet devin'd: And the Prince
cry'd, <HI>I permit thee.</HI>—Then he told him the
Affliction the old King was in, for the Rashness
he had committed, in his Cruelty to <HI>Imoinda;</HI>
and how he daign'd to ask Pardon for his Of∣fence,
and to implore the Prince wou'd not
suffer that Loss to touch his Heart too sen∣sibly,
which now all the Gods cou'd not restore
him, but might recompense him in Glory,
which he begg'd he wou'd pursue; and that
Death, that common Revenger of all Injuries,
wou'd soon even the Account between him and
a feeble old Man.</P>
<P><HI>Oroonoko</HI> bad him return his Duty to his
Lord and Master; and to assure him, there
was no Account of Revenge to be adjusted be∣tween
them; if there were, 'twas he was the
Aggressor, and that Death would be just, and,
maugre his Age, wou'd fee him righted; and
he was contented to leave his Share of Glory
to Youths more fortunate, and worthy of that
Favour from the Gods. That henceforth he
wou'd never lift a Weapon, or draw a Bow,
but abandon the small remains of his Life to
Sighs and Tears, and the continual Thoughts of
what his Lord and Grand-father had thought
good to send out of the World, with all that
Youth, that Innocence and Beauty.</P>
<P>After having spoken this, what-ever his
greatest Officers and Men of the best Rank
cou'd do, they cou'd not raise him from the
Carpet, or persuade him to Action, and Re∣solutions
of Life; but commanding all to re∣tire,
he shut himself into his Pavillion all that
day, while the Enemy was ready to engage▪
<PB N="38" REF="55"/>
and wondring at the Delay, the whole Body
of the chief of the Army then address'd them∣selves
to him, and to whom they had much
a-doe to get Admittance. They fell on their
Faces at the Foot of his Carpet; where they
lay, and besought him with earnest Prayers
and Tears, to lead'em forth to Battle, and not
let the Enemy take Advantages of them; and
implor'd him to have regard to his Glory, and
to the World, that depended on his Courage
and Conduct. But he made no other Reply to
all their Supplications, but this; That he had
now no more business for Glory; and for the
World, it was a Trifle not worth his Care:
<HI>Go</HI> (continu'd he, sighing) <HI>and divide it amongst
you, and reap with Joy what you so vainly prize,
and leave me to my more welcome Destiny.</HI></P>
<P>They then demanded what they shou'd do,
and whom he wou'd constitute in his room,
that the Confusion of ambitious Youth and
Power might not ruine their Order, and make
them a Prey to the Enemy. He reply'd; He
wou'd not give himself the Trouble—; but
wish'd 'em to chuse the bravest Man amongst
'em, let his Quality or Birth be what it wou'd:
<HI>For, O my Friends!</HI> (said he) <HI>it is not Titles
make Men Brave or Good; or Birth, that bestows
Courage and Generosity, or makes the Owner Happy:
Believe this, when you behold</HI> Oroonoko, <HI>the most
wretched, and abandon'd by Fortune, of all the
Creation of the Gods.</HI> So turning himself about,
he wou'd make no more Reply to all they cou'd
urge or implore.</P>
<P>The Army beholding their Officers return
unsuccessful, with sad Faces, and ominous
<PB N="39" REF="55"/>
Looks, that presage'd no good Luck, suffer'd
a thousand Fears to take possession of their
Hearts, and the Enemy to come ev'n upon
'em, before they wou'd provide for their
Safety, by any Defence; and though they were
assur'd by some, who had a mind to animate
'em, that they shou'd be immediately Headed
by the Prince, and that in the mean time <HI>Aboan</HI>
had Orders to Command as General; yet
they were so dismay'd for want of that great
Example of Bravery, that they cou'd make but
a very feeble Resistance; and at last, down∣right,
fled before the Enemy, who pursu'd 'em
to the very Tents, killing 'em: Nor cou'd all
<HI>Aboan</HI>'s Courage, which that day gain'd him
immortal Glory, shame 'em into a Manly De∣fence
of themselves. The Guards that were
left behind about the Prince's Tent, seeing
the Soldiers flee before the Enemy, and seat∣ter
themselves all over the Plain, in great Dis∣order,
made such Out-cries as rouz'd the Prince
from his amorous Slumber, in which he had
remain'd bury'd for two Days, without per∣mitting
any Sustenance to approach him. But,
in spite of all his Resolutions, he had not the
constancy of Grief to that degree, as to make
him insensible of the Danger of his Army; and
in that instant he leap'd from his Couch, and
cry'd,—<HI>Come, if we must die, let us meet Death
the noblest way; and 'twill be more like</HI> Oroonoko
<HI>to encounter him at an Army's Head, opposing
the Torrent of a conquering Foe, than lazily, on
a Couch, to wait his lingering Pleasure, and die
every moment by a thousand racking Thoughts;
or be tamely taken by an Enemy, and led a whining▪
<PB N="40" REF="56"/>
Love-sick Slave, to adorn the Triumphs of</HI> Jamoan,
<HI>that young Victor, who already is enter'd beyond the
Limits I had prescrib'd him.</HI></P>
<P>While he was speaking, he suffer'd his Peo∣ple
to dress him for the Field; and sallying
out of his Pavillion, with more Life and Vi∣gour
in his Countenance than ever he shew'd,
he appear'd like some Divine Power descended
to save his Countrey from Destruction; and his
People had purposely put him on all things
that might make him shine with most Splendor,
to strike a reverend Awe into the Beholders.
He flew into the thickest of those that were
pursuing his Men; and being animated with
Despair, he fought as if he came on purpose
to die, and did such things as will not be be∣liev'd
that Humane Strength cou'd perform;
and such as soon inspir'd all the rest with new
Courage, and new Order: And now it was,
that they began to fight indeed; and so, as if
they wou'd not be out-done ev'n by their a∣dor'd
Hero; who turning the Tide of the Vi∣ctory,
changing absolutely the Fate of the Day,
gain'd an entire Conquest; and <HI>Oroonoko</HI> having
the good fortune to single out <HI>Jamoan,</HI> he took
him Prisoner with his own Hand, having woun∣ded
him almost to death.</P>
<P>This <HI>Jamoan</HI> afterwards became very dear
to him, being a Man very gallant, and of ex∣cellent
Graces, and fine Parts; so that he ne∣ver
put him amongst the Rank of Captives, as
they us'd to do, without distinction, for the
common Sale, or Market; but kept him in his
own Court, where he retain'd nothing of the
Prisoner but the Name, and return'd no more
<PB N="41" REF="56"/>
into his own Countrey, so great an Affection he
took for <HI>Oroonoko;</HI> and by a thousand Tales
and Adventures of Love and Gallantry, flat∣ter'd
his Disease of Melancholy and Languish∣ment;
which I have often heard him say, had
certainly kill'd him, but for the Conversation
of this Prince and <HI>Aboan,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Governor
he had from his Childhood, of whom I have
spoken before, and who was a Man of admi∣rable
Wit, great Ingenuity and Learning; all
which he had infus'd into his young Pupil.
This <HI>French-man</HI> was banisht out of his own
Countrey, for some Heretical Notions he held;
and though he was a Man of very little Re∣ligion,
he had admirable Morals, and a brave
Soul.</P>
<P>After the total Defeat of <HI>Jamoan</HI>'s Army,
which all fled, or were left dead upon the
Place, they spent some time in the Camp;
<HI>Oroonoko</HI> chusing rather to remain a while there
in his Tents, than to enter into a Palace, or live
in a Court where he had so lately suffer'd so
great a Loss. The Officers therefore, who saw
and knew his cause of Discontent, invented
all sorts of Diversions and Sports, to entertain
their Prince: So that what with those Amuze∣ments
abroad, and others at home, that is,
within their Tents, with the Persuasions, Ar∣guments
and Care of his Friends and Servants
that he more peculiarly priz'd, he wore off, in
time, a great part of that <HI>Shagrien,</HI> and Torture
of Despair, which the first Efforts of <HI>Imoinda</HI>'s
Death had given him: insomuch as having re∣ceiv'd
a thousand kind Embassies from the King,
and Invitations to return to Court, he obey'd,
<PB N="42" REF="57"/>
though with no little reluctancy; and when
he did so, there was a visible change in him,
and for a long time he was much more melan∣choly
than before. But Time lessens all Ex∣tremes,
and reduces 'em to <HI>Medium's,</HI> and Un∣concern;
but no Motives or Beauties, though
all endeavour'd it, cou'd engage him in any sort
of Amour, though he had all the Invitations to
it, both from his own Youth, and others Ambi∣tions
and Designs.</P>
<P><HI>Oroonoko</HI> was no sooner return'd from this
last Conquest, and receiv'd at Court with all
the Joy and Magnificence that cou'd be ex∣press'd
to a young Victor, who was not only
return'd triumphant, but belov'd like a Deity,
when there arriv'd in the Port an <HI>English</HI>
Ship.</P>
<P>This Person had often before been in these
Countries, and was very well known to <HI>Oroo∣noko,</HI>
with whom he had traffick'd for Slaves,
and had us'd to do the same with his Prede∣cessors.</P>
<P>This Commander was a Man of a finer sort
of Address, and Conversation, better bred, and
more engaging, than most of that sort of Men
are; so that he seem'd rather never to have
been bred out of a Court, than almost all his
life at Sea. This Captain therefore was al∣ways
better receiv'd at Court, than most of the
Traders to those Countries were; and espe∣cially
by <HI>Oroonoko,</HI> who was more civiliz'd, ac∣cording
to the <HI>Europaean</HI> Mode, than any other
had been, and took more delight in the <HI>White</HI>
Nations; and, above all, Men of Parts and
Wit. To this Captain he sold abundance of
<PB N="43" REF="57"/>
his Slaves; and for the Favour and Esteem he
had for him, made him many Presents, and
oblig'd him to stay at Court as long as possibly
he cou'd. Which the Captain seem'd to take
as a very great Honour done him, entertain∣ing
the Prince every day with Globes and
Maps, and Mathematical Discourses and Instru∣ments;
eating, drinking, hunting and living
with him with so much familiarity, that it
was not to be doubted but he had gain'd very
greatly upon the Heart of this gallant young
Man. And the Captain, in Return of all these
mighty Favours, besought the Prince to ho∣nour
his Vessel with his Presence, some day or
other, to Dinner, before he shou'd set sail:
which he condescended to accept, and ap∣pointed
his day. The Captain, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on his part,
fail'd not to have all things in a readiness, in
the most magnificent order he cou'd possibly:
And the day being come, the Captain, in his
Boat, richly adorn'd with Carpets and Velvet-Cushions,
row'd to the shore, to receive the
Prince; with another Long-Boat, where was
plac'd all his Musick and Trumpets, with which
<HI>Oroonoko</HI> was extremely delighted; who met
him on the shore, attended by his <HI>French</HI> Go∣vernor,
<HI>Jamoan, Aboan,</HI> and about an hundred
of the noblest of the Youths of the Court: And
after they had first carry'd the Prince on board,
the Boats fetch'd the rest off: where they
found a very splendid Treat, with all sorts of
fine Wines; and were as well entertain'd, as
'twas possible in such a place to be.</P>
<P>The Prince having drank hard of Punch,
and several sorts of Wine, as did all the rest,
<PB N="44" REF="58"/>
(for great care was taken, they shou'd want
nothing of that part of the Entertainment) was
very merry, and in great admiration of the
Ship, for he had never been in one before; so
that he was curious of beholding every place
where he decently might descend. The rest,
no less curious, who were not quite overcome
with Drinking, rambl'd at their pleasure <HI>Fore</HI>
and <HI>Aft,</HI> as their Fancies guided 'em: So that
the Captain, who had well laid his Design be∣fore,
gave the Word, and seiz'd on all his Guests;
they clapping great Irons suddenly on the Prince,
when he was leap'd down into the Hold, to
view that part of the Vessel; and locking him
fast down, secur'd him. The same Treachery
was us'd to all the rest; and all in one instant,
in several places of the Ship, were lash'd fast in
Irons, and betray'd to Slavery. That great
Design over, they set all Hands to work to
hoise Sail; and with as treacherous and fair a
Wind they made from the Shore with this inno∣cent
and glorious Prize, who thought of nothing
less than such an Entertainment.</P>
<P>Some have commended this Act, as brave
in the Captain; but I will spare my sense of it,
and leave it to my Reader to judge as he
pleases. It may be easily guess'd, in what man∣ner
the Prince resented this Indignity, who
may be best resembl'd to a Lion taken in a Toil;
so he rag'd, so he struggl'd for Liberty, but all
in vain; and they had so wisely manag'd his
Fetters, that he cou'd not use a Hand in his
defence, to quit himself of a Life that wou'd
by no means endure Slavery; nor cou'd he
move from the place where he was ty'd, to
<PB N="45" REF="58"/>
any solid part of the Ship against which he
might have beat his Head, and have finish'd his
Disgrace that way: So that being deprived of
all other means, he resolv'd to perish for want
of Food; and pleas'd at last with that Thought,
and toil'd and tir'd by Rage and Indignation,
he laid himself down, and sullenly resolv'd
upon dying, and refused all things that were
brought him.</P>
<P>This did not a little vex the Captain, and
the more so, because he found almost all of
'em of the same Humour: so that the loss of
so many brave Slaves, so tall and goodly to
behold, wou'd have been very considerable:
He therefore order'd one to go from him (for
he wou'd not be seen himself) to <HI>Oroonoko,</HI> and
to assure him, he was afflicted for having rashly
done so unhospitable a Deed, and which cou'd
not be now remedy'd, since they were far from
shore; but since he resented it in so high a na∣ture,
he assur'd him he wou'd revoke his Reso∣lution,
and set both him and his Friends a-shore
on the next Land they shou'd touch at; and of
this the Messenger gave him his Oath, pro∣vided
he would resolve to live: And <HI>Oroonoko,</HI>
whose Honour was such as he never had viola∣ted
a Word in his Life himself, much less a so∣lemn
Asseveration, believ'd in an instant what
this Man said; but reply'd, He expected, for
a confirmation of this, to have his shameful
Fetters dismiss'd. This Demand was carried
to the Captain; who return'd him answer, That
the Offence had been so great which he had put
upon the Prince, that he durst not trust him
with Liberty while he remain'd in the Ship,
<PB N="46" REF="59"/>
for fear lest by a Valour natural to him, and a
Revenge that wou'd animate that Valour, he
might commit some Outrage fatal to himself,
and the <HI>King</HI> his Master, to whom his Vessel did
belong. To this <HI>Oroonoko</HI> reply'd; He would
engage his Honour to behave himself in all
friendly Order and Manner, and obey the Com∣mand
of the <HI>Captain,</HI> as he was Lord of the
<HI>King</HI>'s Vessel, and General of those Men under
his Command.</P>
<P>This was deliver'd to the still doubting <HI>Cap∣tain,</HI>
who could not resolve to trust a <HI>Heathen,</HI>
he said, upon his Parole, a Man that had no
Sense or Notion of the God that he worshipp'd.
<HI>Oroonoko</HI> then reply'd; He was very sorry to
hear that the <HI>Captain</HI> pretended to the Know∣ledge
and Worship of any <HI>Gods,</HI> who had
taught him no better Principles, than not to
Credit as he would be Credited. But they told
him, the Difference of their Faith occasion'd
that Distrust: For the <HI>Captain</HI> had protested to
him upon the Word of a <HI>Christian,</HI> and sworn in
the Name of a Great <HI>GOD;</HI> which if he
shou'd violate, he would expect eternal Tor∣ment
in the World to come. <HI>Is that all the Ob∣ligation
he has to be Just to his Oath?</HI> (replied <HI>O∣roonoko.)
Let him know, I swear by my Honour;
which to violate, would not only render me con∣temptible
and despised by all brave and honest Men,
and so give my self perpetual pain, but it wou'd
be eternally offending and displeasing all Mankind;
harming, betraying, circumventing and outraging
all Men: but Punishments hereafter are suffer'd
by one's self; and the World takes no cognizances
whether this</HI> God <HI>have reveng'd 'em, or not, 'tis
<PB N="47" REF="59"/>
done so secretly, and deferr'd so long: While the
Man of no Honour suffers every moment the scorn
and contempt of the honester World, and dies every
day ignominiously in his Fame, which is more valuable
than Life: I speak not this to move Belief, but to
shew you how you mistake, when you imagine, That
he who will violate his Honour, will keep his Word
with his</HI> Gods. So, turning from him with a
disdainful smile, he refused to answer him,
when he urg'd him to know what Answer he
shou'd carry back to his Captain; so that he de∣parted
without saying any more.</P>
<P>The Captain pondering and consulting what
to do, it was concluded that nothing but <HI>Oroo∣noko</HI>'s
Liberty wou'd encourage any of the rest
to eat, except the <HI>French-man,</HI> whom the Cap∣tain
cou'd not pretend to keep Prisoner, but
only told him, he was secured, because he might
act something in favour of the Prince, but that
he shou'd be freed as soon as they came to Land.
So that they concluded it wholly necessary to
free the Prince from his Irons, that he might
shew himself to the rest; that they might have
an eye upon him, and that they cou'd not fear a
single Man.</P>
<P>This being resolv'd; to make the Obligation
the greater, the Captain himself went to <HI>Oroo∣noko;</HI>
where, after many Complements, and
Assurances of what he had already promis'd,
he receiving from the Prince his Parole, and
his Hand, for his good Behaviour, dismiss'd his
Irons, and brought him to his own Cabin;
where, after having treated and repos'd him a
while, (for he had neither eat nor slept in four
days before) he besought him to visit those
<PB N="48" REF="60"/>
obstinate People in Chains, who refus'd all
manner of Sustenance; and entreated him to
oblige 'em to eat, and assure 'em of their Liberty
the first Opportunity.</P>
<P><HI>Oroonoko,</HI> who was too generous, not to give
credit to his Words, shew'd himself to his Peo∣ple,
who were transported with Excess of Joy
at the sight of their Darling Prince; falling at
his Feet, and kissing and embracing 'em; be∣lieving,
as some Divine Oracle, all he assur'd
'em. But he besought 'em to bear their Chains
with that Bravery that became those whom he
had seen act so nobly in Arms; and that they
cou'd not give him greater Proofs of their Love
and Friendship, since 'twas all the Security the
Captain (his Friend) cou'd have, against the
Revenge, he said, they might possibly justly
take, for the Injuries sustain'd by him. And
they all, with one accord, assur'd him, they
cou'd not suffer enough, when it was for his
Repose and Safety.</P>
<P>After this, they no longer refus'd to eat, but
took what was brought 'em, and were pleas'd
with their Captivity, since by it they hop'd to
redeem the Prince, who, all the rest of the
Voyage, was treated with all the respect due to
his Birth, tho' nothing cou'd divert his Melan∣choly;
and he wou'd often sigh for <HI>Imoinda,</HI>
and think this a Punishment due to his Misfor∣tune,
in having left that Noble Maid behind
him, that fatal Night, in the <HI>Otan,</HI> when he
fled to the Camp.</P>
<P>Possess'd with a thousand Thoughts of past
Joys with this fair young Person, and a thou∣sand
Griefs for her eternal Loss, he endur'd a
<PB N="49" REF="60"/>
tedious Voyage, and at last arriv'd at the Mouth
of the River of <HI>Surinam,</HI> a Colony belonging
to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and where they were
to deliver some part of their Slaves. There
the Merchants and Gentlemen of the Coun∣try
going on Board, to demand those Lots
of Slaves they had already agreed on, and,
amongst those, the Over-seers of those Planta∣tions
where I then chanc'd to be; the Captain,
who had given the Word, order'd his Men to
bring up those<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> noble Slaves in Fetters, whom
I have spoken of; and having put 'em, some
in one, and some in other Lots, with Women
and Children (which they call <HI>Pickaninies,</HI>)
they sold 'em off, as Slaves, to several Mer∣chants
and Gentlemen; not putting any two
in one Lot, because they wou'd separate 'em
far from each other; not daring to trust 'em
together, lest Rage and Courage shou'd put
'em upon contriving some great Action, to the
Ruine of the Colony.</P>
<P><HI>Oroonoko</HI> was first seiz'd on, and sold to our
Over-seer, who had the first Lot, with seven∣teen
more of all sorts and sizes, but not one of
Quality with him. When he saw this, he found
what they meant; for, as I said, he under∣stood
<HI>English</HI> pretty well; and being wholly
unarm'd and defenceless, so as it was in vain to
make any Resistance, he only beheld the Cap∣tain
with a Look all fierce and disdainful, up∣braiding
him with Eyes that forc'd Blushes on
his guilty Cheeks, he only cry'd, in passing
over the side of the Ship; <HI>Farewell, Sir: 'Tis
worth my Suffering, to gain so true a Knowledge
both of you, and of your Gods by whom you swear▪</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="61"/>
And desiring those that held him to forbear
their pains, and telling 'em he wou'd make no
Resistance, he cry'd, <HI>Come, my Fellow-Slaves;
let us descend, and see if we can meet with more
Honour and Honesty in the next World we shall
touch upon.</HI> So he nimbly leapt into the Boat,
and shewing no more Concern, suffer'd himself
to be row'd up the River, with his Seventeen
Companions.</P>
<P>The Gentleman that bought him, was a
young <HI>Conish</HI> Gentleman, whose Name was
<HI>Trefry;</HI> a Man of great Wit, and fine Learn∣ing,
and was carry'd into those Parts by the
Lord—Governor, to manage all his Af∣fairs.
He reflecting on the last World of <HI>Oroo∣noko</HI>
to the Captain, and beholding the Rich∣ness
of his Vest, no sooner came into the Boat,
but he fix'd his Eyes on him; and finding
something so extraordinary in his Face, his
Shape and Mien, a Greatness of Look, and
Haughtiness in his Air, and finding he spoke
<HI>English,</HI> had a great Mind to be enquiring into
his Quality and Fortune; which, though <HI>Oroo∣noko</HI>
endeavour'd to hide, by only confessing
he was above the Rank of common Slaves,
<HI>Trefry</HI> soon found he was yet something greater
than he confess'd; and from that Moment be∣gan
to conceive so vast an Esteem for him, that
he ever after lov'd him as his dearest Brother,
and shew'd him all the Civilities due to so great
a Man.</P>
<P><HI>Trefry</HI> was a very good Mathematician, and
a Linguist; cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d speak <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish;</HI>
and in the three Days they remain'd in the
Boat (for so long were they going from the
<PB N="51" REF="61"/>
Ship, to the Plantation) he entertain'd <HI>Oroo∣noko</HI>
so agreeably with his Art and Discourse,
that he was no less pleas'd with <HI>Trefry,</HI> than
he was with the Prince; and he thought him∣self,
at least, fortunate in this, that since he
was a Slave, as long as he won'd suffer himself
to remain so, he had a Man of so excellent Wit
and Parts for a Master: So that before they
had finish'd their Voyage up the River, he
made no scruple of declaring to <HI>Trefry</HI> all his
Fortunes, and most part of what I have here
related, and put himself wholly into the Hands
of his new Friend, whom he found resenting
all the Injuries were done him, and was charm'd
with all the Greatnesses of his Actions; which
were recited with that Modesty, and delicate
Sence, as wholly vanquish'd him, and subdu'd
him to his Interest. And he promis'd him on
his Word and Honour, he wou'd find the
Means to re-conduct him to his own Coun∣try
again: assuring him, he had a perfect Ab∣horrence
of so dishonourable an Action; and
that he wou'd sooner have dy'd, than have
been the Author of such a Perfidy. He found
the Prince was very much concern'd to know
what became of his Friends, and how they
took their Slavery; and <HI>Trefry</HI> promis'd to
take care about the enquiring after their Con∣dition,
and that he shou'd have an Account
of 'em.</P>
<P>Though, as <HI>Oroonoko</HI> afterwards said, he had
little Reason to credit the Words of a <HI>Backea∣rary,</HI>
yet he knew not why; but he saw a
king of Sincerity, and awful Truth in the Face
of <HI>Trefry;</HI> he saw an Honesty in his Eyes, and
<PB N="52" REF="62"/>
he found him wise and witty enough to under∣stand
Honour: for it was one of his Maxims,
<HI>A Man of Wit cou'd not be a Knave or Villain.</HI></P>
<P>In their passage up the River, they put in
at several Houses for Refreshment; and ever
when they landed, numbers of People wou'd
flock to behold this Man; not but their Eyes
were daily entertain'd with the sight of Slaves,
but the Fame of <HI>Oroonoko</HI> was gone before him,
and all People were in admiration of his Beauty.
Besides, he had a rich Habit on, in which he
was taken, so different from the rest, and
which the Captain cou'd not strip him of, be∣cause
he was forc'd to surprize his Person in
the minute he sold him. When he found his
Habit made him liable, as he thought, to be
gaz'd at the more, he begg'd <HI>Trefry</HI> to give him
something more befitting a Slave; which he
did, and took off his Robes. Nevertheless, he
shone through all, and his <HI>Osenbrigs</HI> (a sort of
brown <HI>Holland</HI> Suit he had on) cou'd not con∣ceal
the Graces of his Looks and Mien; and he
had no less Admirers, than when he had his
dazling Habit on; the Royal Youth appear'd
in spite of the Slave, and People cou'd not help
treating him after a different manner, without
designing it: As soon as they approach'd him,
they venerated and esteem'd him; his Eyes in∣sensibly
commanded Respect, and his Behaviour
insinuated it into every Soul. So that there was
nothing talk'd of but this young and gallant
Slave, even by those who yet knew not that he
was a Prince.</P>
<P>I ought to tell you, that the <HI>Christians</HI> never
but any Slaves but they give 'em some Name
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>
of their own, their native ones being likely
very barbarous, and hard to pronounce; so
that Mr. <HI>Trefry</HI> gave <HI>Oroonoko</HI> that of <HI>Caesar:</HI>
which Name will live in that Countrey as long
as that (scarce more) glorious one of the great
<HI>Roman;</HI> for 'tis most evident, he wanted no
part of the Personal Courage of that <HI>Caesar,</HI>
and acted things as memorable, had they been
done in some part of the World replenish'd
with People, and Historians, that might have
given him his due. But his Misfortune was,
to fall in an obscure World, that afforded only
a Female Pen to celebrate his Fame; though
I doubt not but it had liv'd from others Endea∣vours,
if the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who, immediately after
his time, took that Countrey, had not kill'd,
banish'd and dispers'd all those that were ca∣pable
of giving the World this great Man's
Life, much better than I have done. And
Mr. <HI>Trefry,</HI> who design'd it, dy'd before he
began it, and bemoan'd himself for not having
undertook it in time.</P>
<P>For the future therefore, I must call <HI>Oroo∣noko,
Caesar;</HI> Since by that Name only he was
known in our Western World, and by that
Name he was receiv'd on Shore at <HI>Parham-House,</HI>
where he was destin'd a Slave. But if
the King himself (God bless him) had come
a-shore, there cou'd not have been greater
Expectations by all the whole Plantation, and
those neighbouring ones, than was on ours at
that time; and he was receiv'd more like a
Governor, than a Slave. Notwithstanding, as
the Custom was, they assign'd him his portion
of Land, his House, and his Business, up in the
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
Plantation. But as it was more for Form, than
any Design, to put him to his Task, he endur'd
no more of the Slave but the Name, and re∣main'd
some Days in the House, receiving all
Visits that were made him, without stirring
towards that part of the Plantation where the
<HI>Negroes</HI> were.</P>
<P>At last, he wou'd needs go view his Land,
his House, and the Business assign'd him. But
he no sooner came to the Houses of the Slaves,
which are like a little Town by it self, the <HI>Ne∣groes</HI>
all having left Work, but they all came
forth to behold him, and found he was that
Prince who had, at several times, sold most of
'em to these Parts; and, from a Veneration they
pay to great Men, especially if they know 'em,
and from the Surprize and Awe they had at the
sight of him, they all cast themselves at his Feet,
crying out, in their Language, <HI>Live, O King!
Long live, O King!</HI> And kissing his Feet, paid
him even Divine Homage.</P>
<P>Several <HI>English</HI> Gentlemen were with him;
and what Mr. <HI>Trefry</HI> had told 'em, was here
confirm'd; of which he himself before had no
other Witness than <HI>Caesar</HI> himself: But he was
infinitely glad to find his Grandure confirm'd
by the Adoration of all the Slaves.</P>
<P><HI>Caesar</HI> troubl'd with their Over-Joy, and
Over-Ceremony, besought 'em to rise, and to
receive him as their Fellow-Slave; assuring
them, he was no better. At which they set
up with one Accord a most terrible and hidi∣ous
Mourning and Condoling, which he and
the <HI>English</HI> had much a-do to appease; but at
last they prevail'd with 'em, and they prepar'd
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>
all their barbarous Musick, and every one kill'd
and dress'd something of his own Stock (for
every Family has their Land a-part, on which,
at their leisure-times, they breed all eatable
things; and clubbing it together, made a most
magnificent Supper, inviting their <HI>Grandee Cap∣tain,</HI>
their <HI>Prince,</HI> to honour it with his Presence;
which he did, and several <HI>English</HI> with him;
where they all waited on him, some playing,
others dancing before him all the time, accor∣ding
to the Manners of their several Nations;
and with unwearied Industry, endeavouring to
please and delight him.</P>
<P>While they sat at Meat, Mr. <HI>Trefry</HI> told <HI>Cae∣sar,</HI>
that most of these young <HI>Salves</HI> were un∣done
in Love, with a fine She-<HI>Slave,</HI> whom
they had had about Six Months on their Land;
the <HI>Prince,</HI> who never heard the Name of <HI>Love</HI>
without a Sigh, nor any mention of it without
the Curiosity of examining further into that
tale, which of all Discourses was most agree∣able
to him, asked, how they came to be so
Unhappy, as to be all Undone for one fair
<HI>Slave? Trefry,</HI> who was naturally Amorous,
and lov'd to talk of Love as well as any body,
proceeded to tell him, they had the most charm∣ing
<HI>Black</HI> that ever was beheld on their <HI>Planta∣tion,</HI>
about fifteen or sixteen Years old, as he
guess'd that, for his part, he had done nothing
but Sigh for her ever since she came; and that
all the <HI>White</HI> Beauties he had seen, never
charm'd him so absolutely as this fine Creature
had done; and that no Man, of any Nation,
ever beheld her, that did not fall in Love with
her; and that she had all the <HI>Slaves</HI> perpetu∣ally
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
at her Feet; and the whole Countrey re∣sounded
with the Fame of <HI>Clemene,</HI> for so (said
he) we have Christen'd her: But she denies us
all with such a noble Disdain, that 'tis a Mi∣racle
to see, that she, who can give such eter∣nal
Desires, shou'd her self be all Ice and all
Unconcern. She is adorn'd with the most grace∣ful
Modesty that ever beautify'd Youth; the
softest Sigher;—that, if she were capable
of Love, one wou'd swear she languish'd for
some absent happy Man; and so retir'd, as if
she fear'd a Rape even from the God of Day,
or that the Breezes wou'd steal Kisses from her
delicate Mouth: Her Task of Work, some sigh∣ing
Lover every Day makes it his Petition to
perform for her; which she accepts, blushing,
and with reluctancy, for fear he will ask her
a Look for a Recompence, which he dares not
presume to hope; so great an Awe she strikes
into the Hearts of her Admirers. <HI>I do not won∣der</HI>
(reply'd the Prince) <HI>that</HI> Clemene <HI>shou'd re∣fuse
Slaves, being, as you say, so Beautiful; but
wonder how she escapes those who can entertain her
as you can do: or why, being your Slave, you do
not oblige her to yield. I confess</HI> (said <HI>Trefry) when
I have, against her Will, entertain'd her with Love
so long, as to be transported with my Passion
even above Decency, I have been ready to make
use of those advantages of Strength and Force
Nature has given me: But, oh! she disarms me,
with that Modesty and Weeping, so tender and so
moving, that I retire, and thank my Stars she over∣came
me.</HI> The Company laugh'd at his Civi∣lity
to a <HI>Slave,</HI> and <HI>Caesar</HI> only applauded the
Nobleness of his Passion and Nature; since that
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
Slave might be Noble, or, what was better,
have true Notions of Honour and Vertue in her.
Thus pass'd they this Night, after having re∣ceiv'd
from the <HI>Slaves</HI> all imaginable Respect and
Obedience.</P>
<P>The next day, <HI>Trefry</HI> ask'd <HI>Caesar</HI> to walk
when the Heat was allay'd, and designedly
carry'd him by the Cottage of the <HI>fair Slave;</HI>
and told him, she whom he spoke of last night
liv'd there retir'd: <HI>But</HI> (says he) <HI>I wou'd not
wish you to approach; for I am sure, you will be
in Love as soon as you behold her. Caesar</HI> assur'd
him, he was Proof against all the Charms of
that Sex; and that if he imagin'd his Heart
cou'd be so perfidious to Love again, after
<HI>Imoinda,</HI> he believ'd he shou'd tear it from his
Bosom. They had no sooner spoke, but a lit∣tle
Shock-Dog, that <HI>Clemene</HI> had presented her,
which she took great delight in, ran out; and
she, not knowing any body was there, ran to
get it in again, and bolted out on those who
were just speaking of her: When, seeing them,
she wou'd have run in again; but <HI>Trefry</HI> caught
her by the Hand, and cry'd; Clemene, <HI>how∣ever
you flie a Lover, you ought to pay some Respect
to this Stranger,</HI> (pointing to <HI>Caesar.</HI>) But she,
as if she had resolv'd never to raise her Eyes to
the Face of a Man again, bent 'em the more to
the Earth, when he spoke, and gave the <HI>Prince</HI>
the leisure to look the more at her. There
needed no long Gazing, or Consideration, to
examine who this <HI>fair Creature</HI> was; he soon
saw <HI>Imoinda</HI> all over her; in a minute he saw
her Face, her Shape, her Air, her Modesty,
and all that call'd forth his Soul with Joy at
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
his Eyes, and left his Body destitute of almost
Life; it stood without Motion, and, for a Mi∣nute,
knew not that it had a Being: and, I be∣lieve,
he had never come to himself, so oppress'd
he was with Over-joy, if he had not met with
this Allay, that he perceiv'd <HI>Imoinda</HI> fall dead
in the Hands of <HI>Trefry:</HI> This awaken'd him,
and he ran to her Aid, and caught her in his
Arms, where, by degrees, she came to her self;
and 'tis needless to tell with what Transports,
what Extasies of Joy, they both a while beheld
each other, without Speaking; then Snatch'd
each other to their Arms; then Gaze again, as
if they still doubted whether they possess'd
the Blessing: They Grasp'd; but when they
recover'd their Speech, 'tis not to be imagin'd,
what tender Things they express'd to each o∣ther;
wondering what strange Fate had brought
'em again together. They soon inform'd each
other of their Fortunes, and equally bewail'd
their Fate; but, at the same time, they mutually
protested, that even Fetters and Slavery were
Soft and Easie; and wou'd be supported with
Joy and Pleasure, while they cou'd be so happy
to possess each other, and to be able to make
good their Vows. <HI>Caesar</HI> swore he disdain'd the
Empire of the World, while he cou'd behold his
<HI>Imoinda;</HI> and she despis'd Grandure and Pomp,
those Vanities of her Sex, when she cou'd Gaze
on <HI>Oroonoko.</HI> He ador'd the very Cottage where
she resided, and said, That little Inch of the
World wou'd give him more Happiness than all
the Universe cou'd do; and she vow'd, It was
a Palace, while adorn'd with the Presence of
<HI>Oroonoko.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="65"/>
<HI>Trefry</HI> was infinitely pleas'd with this Novel,
and found this <HI>Clemene</HI> was the Fair Mistress of
whom <HI>Caesar</HI> had before spoke; and was not a
little satisfied, that Heaven was so kind to the
<HI>Prince,</HI> as to sweeten his Misfortunes by so lucky
an Accident; and leaving the Lovers to them∣selves,
was impatient to come down to <HI>Par∣ham-House,</HI>
(which was on the same <HI>Plantation</HI>)
to give me an Account of what had hapned. I
was as impatient to make these Lovers a Visit,
having already made a Friendship with <HI>Caesar;</HI>
and from his own Mouth learn'd what I have
related, which was confirmed by his French∣man,
who was set on Shoar to seek his For∣tunes;
and of whom they cou'd not make a
Slave, because a Christian; and he came daily
to <HI>Parham-Hill</HI> to see and pay his Respects to
his Puple <HI>Prince:</HI> So that concerning and in∣tresting
my self, in all that related to <HI>Caesar,</HI>
whom I had assur'd of Liberty, as soon as the
Governor arriv'd, I hasted presently to the
Place where the Lovers were, and was infi∣nitely
glad to find this Beautiful young <HI>Slave</HI>
(who had already gain'd all our Esteems, for
her Modesty and her extraordinary Prettiness)
to be the same I had heard <HI>Caesar</HI> speak so much
of. One may imagine then we paid her a treble
Respect; and though from her being carv'd in
fine Flowers and Birds all over her Body, we
took her to be of Quality before, yet, when we
knew <HI>Clemene</HI> was <HI>Imoinda,</HI> we cou'd not enough
admire her.</P>
<P>I had forgot to tell you, that those who are
Nobly born of that Country, are so delicately
Cut and Rac'd all over the fore-part of the
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
Trunk of their Bodies, that it looks as if it were
Japan'd, the Works being raised like high
Poynt round the edges of the Flowers. Some
are only carv'd with a little Flower, or Bird,
at the sides of the Temples, as was <HI>Caesar;</HI> and
those who are so carv'd over the Body, re∣semble
our Ancient <HI>Picts</HI> that are figur'd in
the Chronicles, but these Carvings are more
delicate.</P>
<P>From that happy Day <HI>Caesar</HI> took <HI>Clemene</HI>
for his Wife, to the general Joy of all People;
and there was as much Magnificence as the
Countrey wou'd afford at the Celebration of
this Wedding: and in a very short time after
she conceiv'd with Child; which made <HI>Caesar</HI>
even adore her, knowing he was the last of his
Great Race. This new Accident made him
more impatient of Liberty, and he was every
day treating with <HI>Trefry</HI> for his and <HI>Clemene</HI>'s
Liberty, and offer'd either Gold, or a vast
quantity of Slaves, which shou'd be paid before
they let him go, provided he cou'd have any
Security that he shou'd go when his Ransom
was paid. They fed him from Day to Day
with Promises, and delay'd him till the Lord-Governor
shou'd come; so that he began to
suspect them of falshood, and that they wou'd
delay him till the time of his Wife's Delivery,
and make a Slave of that too; for all the Breed
is theirs to whom the Parents belong: This
Thought made him very uneasie, and his Sul∣lenness
gave them some Jealousies of him; so
that I was oblig'd, by some Persons who fear'd
a Mutiny (which is very fatal sometimes in
those Colonies, that abound so with Slaves,
<PB N="61" REF="66"/>
that they exceed the <HI>Whites</HI> in vast Numbers)
to discourse with <HI>Caesar,</HI> and to give him all
the Satisfaction I prossibly could; they knew he
and <HI>Clemene</HI> were scarce an Hour in a Day from
my Lodgings; that they eat with me, and that
I oblig'd 'em in all things I was capable of: I
entertain'd 'em with the Lives of the <HI>Romans,</HI>
and Great Men; which charm'd him to my
Company; and her, with teaching her all the
pretty Works that I was Mistress of, and tel∣ling
her Stories of Nuns, and endeavouring to
bring her to the Knowledge of the True God.
But of all Discourses, <HI>Caesar</HI> lik'd that the worst,
and wou'd never be reconcil'd to our Notions
of the Trinity, of which he ever made a Jest:
it was a Riddle, he said, wou'd turn his Brain
to conceive, and one cou'd not make him un∣derstand
what Faith was. However, these
Conversations fail'd not altogether so well to
divert him, that he lik'd the Company of us
Women much above the Men: for he cou'd
not drink; and he is but an ill Companion in
that Countrey that cannot: So that obliging
him to love us very well, we had all the liberty
of Speech with him, especially my self, whom
he calld his <HI>Great Mistress;</HI> and, indeed, my
Word wou'd go a great way with him. For
these Reasons, I had opportunity to take no∣tice
to him, that he was not well pleas'd of
late, as he us'd to be; was more retir'd and
thoughtful; and told him, I took it ill he
shou'd Suspect we wou'd break our Words with
him, and not permit both him and <HI>Clemene</HI> to
return to his own Kingdom, which was not so
long a way, but, when he was once on his Voy∣age,
<PB N="62" REF="67"/>
he wou'd quickly arrive there. He made
me some Answers that shew'd a doubt in him,
which made me ask what advantage it wou'd
be to doubt? it would but give us a Fear of
him, and possibly compel us to treat him so as I
shou'd be very loath to behold: that is, it might
occasion his Confinement. Perhaps this was
not so luckily spoke of me, for I perceiv'd he
resented that Word, which I strove to soften
again in vain: However, he assur'd me, that
whatsoever Resolutions he shou'd take, he wou'd
Act nothing upon the White-People; and as for
my self, and those upon that <HI>Plantation</HI> where
he was, he wou'd sooner forfeit his eternal Li∣berty,
and Life it self, than lift his Hand against
his greatest Enemy on that Place: He besought
me to suffer no Fears upon his Account, for he
cou'd do nothing that Honour shou'd not di∣ctate;
but he accus'd himself for having suf∣fer'd
Slavery so long; yet he charg'd that
weakness on Love alone, who was capable of
making him neglect even Glory it self; and,
for which, now he reproaches himself every
moment of the Day. Much more to this effect
he spoke, with an Air impatient enough to
make me know he wou'd not be long in Bon∣dage;
and though he suffer'd only the Name
of a Slave, and had nothing of the Toil and
Labour of one, yet that was sufficient to ren∣der
him Uneasie; and he had been too long
Idle, who us'd to be always in Action, and in
Arms: He had a Spirit all Rough and Fierce,
and that cou'd not be tam'd to lazy Rest;
and though all endeavours were us'd to exer∣cise
himself in such Actions and Sports as this
<PB N="63" REF="67"/>
World afforded, as Running, Wrestling, Pitch∣ing
the Bar; Hunting and Fishing, Chasing and
Killing <HI>Tigers</HI> of a monstrous Size, which this
Continent affords in abundance; and wonder∣ful
<HI>Snakes,</HI> such as <HI>Alexander</HI> is reported to have
incounter'd at the River of <HI>Amazons,</HI> and which
<HI>Caesar</HI> took great Delight to overcome; yet
these were not Actions great enough for his
large Soul, which was still panting after more
renown'd Action.</P>
<P>Before I parted that Day with him, I got, with
much ado, a Promise from him to rest yet a lit∣tle
longer with Patience, and wait the coming of
the Lord Governor, who was every Day expe∣cted
on our Shore; he assur'd me he wou'd, and
this Promise he desired me to know was given
perfectly in Complaisance to me, in whom he
had an intire Confidence.</P>
<P>After this, I neither thought it convenient
to trust him much out of our View, nor did
the Country who fear'd him; but with one
accord it was advis'd to treat him fairly, and
oblige him to remain within such a compass, and
that he shou'd be permitted, as seldom as cou'd
be, to go up to the Plantations of the Negroes;
or, if he did, to be accompany'd by some that
shou'd be rather in appearance Attendants than
Spys. This Care was for some time taken, and
<HI>Caesar</HI> look'd upon it as a Mark of extraordinary
Respect, and was glad his discontent had ob∣lig'd
'em to be more observant to him; he re∣ceived
new assurance from the Overseer, which
was confirmed to him by the Opinion of all the
Gentlemen of the Country, who made their
court to him: During this time that we had
<PB N="64" REF="68"/>
his Company more frequently than hitherto we
had had, it may not be unpleasant to relate to
you the Diversions we entertaind'd him with,
or rather he us.</P>
<P>My stay was to be short in that Countrey;
because my Father dy'd at Sea, and never ar∣riv'd
to possess the Honour was design'd him,
(which was Lieutenant-General of Six and
thirty Islands, besides the Continent of <HI>Suri∣nam,</HI>)
nor the Advantages he hop'd to reap by
them: so that though we were oblig'd to con∣tinue
on our Voyage, we did not intend to stay
upon the Place. Though, in a word, I must
say thus much of it; That certainly, had his late
Majesty, of sacred Memory, but seen and known
what a vast and charming World he had been
Master of in that Continent, he wou'd never
have parted so easily with it to the <HI>Dutch.</HI> 'Tis
a Continent whose vast Extent was never yet
known, and may contain more Noble Earth than
all the Universe beside; for, they say, it reaches
from East to West one way as far as <HI>China,</HI> and
another to <HI>Peru:</HI> It affords all things both for
Beauty and Use; 'tis there Eternal Spring, al∣ways
the very Months of <HI>April, May</HI> and <HI>June;</HI>
the Shades are perpetual, the Trees bearing at
once all degrees of Leaves and Fruit, from
blooming Buds to ripe Autumn: Groves of
Oranges, Limons, Citrons, Figs, Nutmegs, and
noble Aromaticks, continually bearing their
Fragrancies. The Trees appearing all like Nose∣gays
adorn'd with Flowers of different kinds;
some are all White, some Purple, some Scarlet,
some Blue, some Yellow; bearing, at the same
time, Ripe Fruit and Blooming Young, or pro∣ducing
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
every day new. The very Wood of
all these Trees have an intrinsick Value above
common Timber; for they are, when cut, of
different Colours, glorious to behold; and bear
a price considerable, to Inlay withal. Besides
this, they yield rich Balm, and Gums; so that
we make our Candles of such an Aromatick Sub∣stance,
as does not only give a sufficient Light,
but, as they burn, they cast their Perfumes all
about. Cedar is the common Firing, and all
the Houses are built with it. The very Meat
we eat, when set on the Table, if it be Native,
I mean, of the Countrey, perfumes the whole
Room; especially a little Beast call'd an <HI>Arma∣dilly,</HI>
a thing which I can liken to nothing so
well as a <HI>Rhinoceros;</HI> 'tis all in white Armour, so
jointed, that it moves as well in it, as if it had
nothing on; this Beast is about the bigness of
a Pig of six Weeks old. But it were endless to
give an Account of all the divers Wonderful
and Strange things that Countrey affords, and
which we took a very great delight to go in
search of; though those Adventures are often∣times
Fatal, and at least Dangerous: But while
we had <HI>Caesar</HI> in our Company on these Designs,
we fear'd no harm, nor suffer'd any.</P>
<P>As soon as I came into the Countrey, the best
House in it was presented me, call'd <HI>St. John's
Hill:</HI> It stood on a vast Rock of white Marble,
at the foot of which the River ran a vast depth
down, and not to be descended on that side;
the little Waves still dashing and washing the
foot of this Rock, made the softest Murmurs
and Purlings in the World; and the opposite
Bank was adorn'd with such vast quantities of
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
different Flowers eternally Blowing, and every
Day and Hour new, fenc'd behind 'em with
lofty Trees of a thousand rare Forms and Co∣lours,
that the Prospect was the most ravishing
that Sands can create. On the edge of this
white Rock, towards the River, was a Walk
or Grove of Orange and Limon-Trees, about
half the length of the <HI>Mall</HI> here, whose Flowery
and Fruit-bearing Branches met at the top, and
hinder'd the Sun, whose Rays are very fierce
there, from entering a Beam into the Grove;
and the cool Air that came from the River,
made it not only fit to entertain People in, at
all the hottest hours of the day, but refresh'd
the sweet Blossoms, and made it always Sweet
and Charming; and sure, the whole Globe of
the World cannot shew so delightful a Place as
this Grove was: Not all the Gardens of boasted
<HI>Italy</HI> can produce a Shade to out-vie this, which
Nature had join'd with Art to render so ex∣ceeding
fine; and 'tis a marvel to see how such
vast Trees, as big as <HI>English</HI> Oaks, cou'd take
footing on so solid a Rock, and in so little Earth
as cover'd that Rock: But all things by Nature
there are Rare, Delightful and Wonderful.
But to our Sports.</P>
<P>Sometimes we wou'd go surprising, and in
search of young <HI>Tigers</HI> in their Dens, watching
when the old ones went forth to forage for
Prey; and oftentimes we have been in great
danger, and have fled a-pace for our Lives,
when surpriz'd by the Dams. But once, above
all other times, we went on this Design, and
<HI>Caesar</HI> was with us; who had no sooner stoln
a young <HI>Tiger</HI> from her Nest, but going off,
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
we encounter'd the Dam, bearing a Buttock
of a Cow, which he had torn off with his
mighty Paw, and going with it towards his
Den; we had only four Women, <HI>Caesar,</HI> and
an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman, Brother to <HI>Harry Mar∣tin</HI>
the great <HI>Oliverian;</HI> we found there was
no escaping this enraged and ravenous Beast.
However, we Women fled as fast as we cou'd
from it; but our Heels had not saved our Lives,
if <HI>Caesar</HI> had not laid down his <HI>Cub,</HI> when he
found the <HI>Tiger</HI> quit her Prey to make the
more speed towards him; and taking Mr. <HI>Mar∣tin</HI>'s
Sword, desir'd him to stand aside, or fol∣low
the Ladies. He obey'd him; and <HI>Caesar</HI>
met this monstrous Beast of might, size, and
vast Limbs, who came with open Jaws upon
him; and fixing his awful stern Eyes full upon
those of the Beast, and putting himself into a
very steddy and good aiming posture of De∣fence,
ran his Sword quite through his Breast
down to his very Heart, home to the Hilt of
the Sword: the dying Beast stretch'd forth her
Paw, and going to grasp his Thigh, surpriz'd
with death in that very moment, did him no
other harm than fixing her long Nails in his
Flesh very deep, feebly wounded him, but
cou'd not grasp the Flesh to tear off any.
When he had done this, he hollow'd to us
to return: which, after some assurance of his
Victory, we did, and found him lugging out
the Sword from the Bosom of the <HI>Tiger,</HI> who
was laid in her blood on the ground; he took
up the <HI>Cub,</HI> and with an Unconcern that had
nothing of the Joy or Gladness of a Victory,
he came and laid the Whelp at my Feet. We
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
all extremely wonder'd at his Daring, and at
the Bigness of the Beast, which was about the
heighth of an Heifer, but of mighty great and
strong Limbs.</P>
<P>Another time, being in the Woods, he kill'd
a <HI>Tiger</HI> which had long infested that Part, and
borne away abundance of Sheep and Oxen, and
other things that were for the support of those
to whom they belong'd: abundance of People
assail'd this Beast, some affirming they had shot
her with several Bullets quite through the
Body, at several times; and some swearing they
shot her through the very Heart, and they
believ'd she was a Devil, rather than a mortal
thing. <HI>Caesar</HI> had often said, he had a mind
to encounter this Monster, and spoke with seve∣ral
Gentlemen who had attempted her; one
crying, I shot her with so many poyson'd Ar∣rows,
another with his Gun in this part of
her, and another in that; so that he remark∣ing
all these places where she was shot, fancy'd
still he shou'd overcome her, by giving her ano∣ther
sort of a Wound than any had yet done,
and one day said (at the Table,) <HI>What Trophies
and Garlands, Ladies, will you make me, if I bring
you home the Heart of this Ravenous Beast, that
eats up all your Lambs and Pigs?</HI> We all pro∣mis'd
he shou'd be rewarded at all our hands.
So taking a Bow, which he chose out of a
great many, he went up into the Wood, with
two Gentlemen, where he imagin'd this De∣vourer
to be; they had not past very far in
it, but they heard her Voice, growling and
grumbling, as if she were pleas'd with some∣thing
she was doing. When they came in
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
view, they found her muzzling in the Belly
of a new ravish'd Sheep, which she had torn
open; and seeing her self approach'd, she took
fast hold of her Prey with her fore Paws, and
set a very fierce raging Look on <HI>Caesar,</HI> with∣out
offering to approach him, for fear at the
same time of losing what she had in posses∣sion.
So that <HI>Caesar</HI> remain'd a good while,
only taking aim, and getting an opportunity to
shoot her where he design'd: 'twas some time
before he cou'd accomplish it; and to wound
her, and not kill her, wou'd but have enrag'd
her the more, and endanger'd him: He had a
Quiver of Arrows at his Side, so that if one fail'd,
he could be supply'd; at last, retiring a little,
he gave her opportunity to eat; for he found
she was ravenous, and fell too as soon as she
saw him retire, being more eager of her Prey,
than of doing new Mischiefs: when he going
softly to one side of her, and hiding his Person
behind certain Herbage that grew high and
thick, he took so good aim, that, as he inten∣ded,
he shot her just into the Eye, and the Ar∣row
was sent with so good a will, and so sure
a hand, that it stuck in her Brain, and made
her caper, and become mad for a moment or
two; but being seconded by another Arrow,
she fell dead upon the Prey. <HI>Caesar</HI> cut her
open with a Knife, to see where those Wounds
were that had been reported to him, and why
she did not die of 'em. But I shall now relate
a thing that, possibly, will find no credit among
Men; because 'tis a Notion commonly receiv'd
with us, That nothing can receive a Wound
in the Heart and live: But when the Heart of
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
this courageous Animal was taken out, there
were seven Bullets of Lead in it, and the
Wounds seam'd up with great Scars, and she
liv'd with the Bullets a great while, for it was
long since they were shot: This Heart the
Conqueror brought up to us, and 'twas a very
great Curiosity, which all the Countrey came
to see; and which gave <HI>Caesar</HI> occasion of many
fine Discourses; of Accidents in War, and
strange Escapes.</P>
<P>At other times he wou'd go a Fishing; and
discoursing on that Diversion, he found we had
in that Countrey a very strange Fish, call'd a
<HI>Numb Eel</HI> (an <HI>Eel</HI> of which I have eaten) that
while it is aliye, it has a quality so Cold, that
those who are Angling, though with a Line of
never so great a length, with a Rod at the end
of it, it shall, in the same minute the Bait is
touched by this <HI>Eel,</HI> seize him or▪ her that holds
the Rod with benumb'dness, that shall deprive
'em of Sense, for a while; and some have faln
into the Water, and others drop'd, as dead, on
the Banks of the Rivers where they stood, as
soon as this Fish touches the Bait. <HI>Caesar</HI> us'd
to laugh at this, and believ'd it impossible a
Man cou'd lose his Force at the touch of a
Fish; and cou'd not understand that Philoso∣phy,
that a Cold Quality should be of that na∣ture;
however, he had a great Curiosity to
try whether it wou'd have the same effect on
him it had on others, and often try'd, but in
vain: at last, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought-for Fish came to the
Bait, as he stood Angling on the Bank; and
instead of throwing away the Rod, or giving
it a sudden twitch out of the Water, whereby
<PB N="71" REF="71"/>
he might have caught both the <HI>Eel,</HI> and have
dismiss'd the Rod, before it cou'd have too
much power over him; for Experiment-sake,
he grasp'd it but the harder, and fainting fell
into the River; and being still possess'd of the
Rod, the Tide carry'd him, senseless as he was,
a great way, till an <HI>Indian</HI> Boat took him up;
and perceiv'd, when they touch'd him, a Numb∣ness
seize them, and by that knew the Rod was
in his Hand; which, with a Paddle, (that is,
a short Oar) they struck away, and snacht
it into the Boat, <HI>Eel</HI> and all. If <HI>Caesar</HI> was
almost dead, with the effect of this Fish, he
was more so with that of the Water, where he
had remain'd the space of going a League, and
they found they had much a-doe to bring him
back to life; but at last they did, and brought
him home, where he was in a few hours well
recover'd and refresh'd, and not a little asham'd
to find he shou'd be overcome by an <HI>Eel,</HI> and
that all the People, who heard his Defiance,
wou'd laugh at him. But we chear'd him up;
and he, being convinc'd, we had the <HI>Eel</HI> at
Supper, which was a Quarter of an Ell about,
and most delicate Meat; and was of the more
value, since it cost so dear as almost the Life of
so gallant a Man.</P>
<P>About this time we were in many mortal
Fears, about some Disputes the <HI>English</HI> had
with the <HI>Indians;</HI> so that we cou'd scarce trust
our selves, without great Numbers, to go to
any <HI>Indian</HI> Towns or Place where they a∣bode,
for fear they shou'd fall upon us, as they
did immediately after my coming away; and
that it was in the possession of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who
<PB N="72" REF="72"/>
us'd 'em not so civilly as the <HI>English;</HI> so that
they cut in pieces all they cou'd take, getting
into Houses, and hanging up the Mother, and
all her Children about her; and cut a Foot∣man,
I left behind me, all in Joints, and nail'd
him to Trees.</P>
<P>This Feud began while I was there; so that
I lost half the Satisfaction I propos'd, in not
seeing and visiting the <HI>Indian</HI> Towns. But one
day, bemoaning of our Misfortunes upon this
account, <HI>Caesar</HI> told us, we need not fear; for
if we had a mind to go, he wou'd undertake
to be our Guard. Some wou'd, but most wou'd
not venture: about Eighteen of us resolv'd, and
took Barge; and after eight days, arriv'd near
an <HI>Indian</HI> Town: But approaching it, the
Hearts of some of our Company fail'd, and
they wou'd not venture on Shore; so we Poll'd
who wou'd, and who wou'd not. For my
part, I said, If <HI>Caesar</HI> wou'd, I wou'd go. He
resolv'd; so did my Brother, and my Woman,
a Maid of good Courage. Now, none of us
speaking the Language of the People, and ima∣gining
we shou'd have a half Diversion in Ga∣zing
only; and not knowing what they said,
we took a Fisherman that liv'd at the mouth of
the River, who had been a long Inhabitant there,
and oblig'd him to go with us: But because he
was known to the <HI>Indians,</HI> as trading among 'em,
and being, by long living there, become a perfect
in <HI>Indian</HI> Colour, we, who resolv'd to surprize
'em, by making them see something they never
had seen, (that is, <HI>White</HI> People) resolv'd only my
self, my Brother and Woman shou'd go; so <HI>Cae∣sar,</HI>
the Fisherman, and the rest, hiding behind
<PB N="73" REF="72"/>
some thick Reeds and Flowers that grew on
the Banks, let us pass on towards the Town,
which was on the Bank of the River all along.
A little distant from the Houses, or Huts, we
saw some Dancing, others busy'd in fetching
and carrying of Water from the River: They
had no sooner spy'd us, but they set up a loud
Cry, that frighted us at first; we thought it had
been for those that shou'd kill us, but it seems
it was of Wonder and Amazement. They were
all Naked; and we were Dress'd, so as is most
commode for the hot Countries, very Glittering
and Rich; so that we appear'd extremely fine;
my own Hair was cut short, and I had a Taf∣faty
Cap, with Black Feathers, on my Head;
my Brother was in a Stuff Sute, with Silver
Loops and Buttons, and abundance of Green
Ribbon: This was all infinitely surprising to
them; and because we saw them stand still till
we approach'd 'em, we took heart and ad∣vanc'd,
came up to 'em, and offer'd 'em our
Hands; which they took, and look'd on us round
about, calling still for more Company; who
came swarming out, all wondering, and cry∣ing
out <HI>Tepeeme;</HI> taking their Hair up in their
Hands, and spreading it wide to those they
call'd out to; as if they wou'd say (as indeed
it signify'd) <HI>Numberless Wonders,</HI> or not to be
recounted, no more than to number the Hair
of their Heads. By degrees they grew more
bold, and from gazing upon us round, they
touch'd us, laying their Hands upon all the
Features of our Faces, feeling our Breasts and
Arms, taking up one Petticoat, then wonder∣ing
to see another; admiring our Shooes and
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>
Stockings, but more our Garters, which we
gave 'em, and they ty'd about their Legs, be∣ing
lac'd with Silver Lace at the ends; for they
much esteem any shining things: In fine, we
suffer'd 'em to survey us as they pleas'd, and
we thought they wou'd never have done ad∣miring
us. When <HI>Caesar,</HI> and the rest, saw we
were receiv'd with such wonder, they came
up to us; and finding the <HI>Indian</HI> Trader whom
they knew, (for 'tis by these Fishermen, call'd
<HI>Indian</HI> Traders, we hold a Commerce with 'em;
for they love not to go far from home, and we
never go to them;) when they saw him there∣fore,
they set up a new Joy, and cry'd, in their
language, <HI>Oh! here's our</HI> Tiguamy, <HI>and we shall
now know whether those things can speak:</HI> So advan∣cing
to him, some of 'em gave 'em their Hands,
and cry'd, <HI>Amora Tiguamy;</HI> which is as much as,
<HI>How do you;</HI> or, <HI>Welcome, Friend:</HI> and all, with
one din, began to gabble to him, and ask'd, if we
had Sense and Wit? if we could talk of Affairs
of Life and War, as they cou'd do? if we cou'd
Hunt, Swim, and do a thousand things they use?
He answer'd 'em, We cou'd. Then they invited
us into their Houses, and dress'd Venison and
<HI>Buffelo</HI> for us; and, going out, gather'd a Leaf
of a Tree, call'd a <HI>Sarumbo</HI> Leaf, of six Yards
long, and spread it on the Ground for a Table-Cloth;
and cutting another in pieces, instead of
Plates, setting us on little bow <HI>Indian</HI> Stools,
which they cut out of one entire piece of Wood,
and paint in a sort of Japan-work: They
serve every one their Mess on these pieces of
Leaves; and it was very good, but too high
season'd with Pepper. When we had eat, my
<PB N="75" REF="73"/>
Brother and I took out our Flutes, and play'd
to 'em, which gave 'em new Wonder; and I
soon perceiv'd, by an Admiration that is na∣tural
to these People, and by the extreme Ig∣norance
and Simplicity of 'em, it were not dif∣ficult
to establish any unknown or extravagaut
Religion among them, and to impose any No∣tions
or Fictions upon 'em. For seeing a Kins∣man
of mine set some Paper a fire with a Burn∣ing-glass,
a Trick they had never before seen,
they were like to have ador'd him for a God,
and begg'd he wou'd give 'em the Characters
or Figures of his Name, that they might op∣pose
it against Winds and Storms: which he
did, and they held it up in those Seasons, and
fancy'd it had a Charm to conquer them, and
kept it like a holy Relique. They are very
Superstitious, and call'd him the Great <HI>Peeie,</HI>
that is, <HI>Prophet.</HI> They shew'd us their <HI>Indian
Peeie,</HI> a Youth of about Sixteen Years old, as
handsom as Nature cou'd make a Man. They
consecrate a beautiful Youth from his Infancy,
and all Arts are used to compleat him in the fi∣nest
manner, both in Beauty and Shape: He
is bred to all the little Arts and Cunning they
are capable of; to all the Legerdemain Tricks,
and Slight of Hand, whereby he imposes upon
the Rabble; and is both a Doctor in Physick
and Divinity: And by these Tricks makes the
Sick believe he sometimes eases their Pains, by
drawing from the afflicted part little Serpents,
or odd Flies, or Worms, or any strange thing;
and though they have besides undoubted good
Remedies for almost all their Diseases, they
cure the Patient more by Fancy than by Me∣dicines;
<PB N="76" REF="74"/>
and make themselves Fear'd, Lov'd,
and Reverenc'd. This young <HI>Peeie</HI> had a
very young Wife, who seeing my Brother kiss
her, came running and kiss'd me: after this
they kiss'd one another, and made it a very
great Jest, it being so novel; and new<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Admi∣ration
and Laughing went round the Mul∣titude,
that they never will forget that Cere∣mony,
never before us'd or known. <HI>Caesar</HI> had
a mind to see and talk with their War-<HI>Cap∣tains,</HI>
and we were conducted to one of their
Houses; where we beheld several of the great
<HI>Captains,</HI> who had been at Council: But so
frightful a Vision it was to see 'em no Fancy
can create; no sad Dreams can represent so
dreadful a Spectacle. For my part, I took 'em
for Hobgoblins, or Fiends, rather than Men:
but however their Shapes appear'd, their Souls
were very Humane and Noble; but some wan∣ted
their Noses, some their Lips, some both
Noses and Lips, some their Ears, and others
cut through each Cheek, with long Slashes,
through which their Teeth appear'd: they had
other several formidable Wounds and Scars,
or rather Dismembrings: they had <HI>Comitia's,</HI>
or little Aprons before 'em; and Girdles of
Cotton, with their Knives naked stuck in it;
a Bow at their Backs, and a Quiver of Arrows
on their Thighs; and most had Feathers on
their Heads of divers Colours. They cry'd
<HI>Amora Tigame</HI> to us, at our entrance, and were
pleas'd we said as much to them: They seated
us, and gave us Drink of the best sort, and won∣der'd,
as much as the others had done before,
to see us. <HI>Caesar</HI> was marvelling as much at
<PB N="77" REF="74"/>
their Faces, wondring how they shou'd all
be so wounded in War; he was impatient to
know how they all came by those frightful
Marks of Rage or Malice, rather than Wounds
got in noble Battle: They told us, by our In∣terpreter,
That when any War was waging,
two Men, chosen out by some old <HI>Captain</HI> whose
Fighting was past, and who cou'd only teach
the Theory of War, these two Men were to
stand in competition for the Generalship, or
Great War-Captain; and being brought before
the old Judges, now past Labour, they are ask'd,
What they dare do, to shew they are worthy to
lead an Army? When he who is first ask'd,
making no Reply, cuts off his Nose, and throws
it contemptibly on the Ground; and the other
does something to himself that he thinks sur∣passes
him, and perhaps deprives himself of
Lips and an Eye; so they Slash on till one gives
out, and many have dy'd in this Debate. And
it's by a passive Valour they shew and prove their
Activity; a sort of Courage too Brutal to be
applauded by our <HI>Black</HI> Hero; nevertheless, he
express'd his Esteem of 'em.</P>
<P>In this Voyage <HI>Caesar</HI> begot so good an un∣derstanding
between the <HI>Indians</HI> and the <HI>English,</HI>
that there were no more Fears or Heart-burnings
during our stay, but we had a per∣fect,
open, and free Trade with 'em. Many
things remarkable, and worthy reciting, we
met with in this short Voyage; because <HI>Caesar</HI>
made it his business to search out and provide
for our Entertainment, especially to please his
dearly ador'd <HI>Imoinda,</HI> who was a Sharer in
all our Adventures; we being resolv'd to make
<PB N="78" REF="75"/>
her Chains as easie as we cou'd, and to Com∣plement
the Prince in that manner that most
oblig'd him.</P>
<P>As we were coming up again, we met with
some <HI>Indians</HI> of strange Aspects; that is, of a
larger Size, and other sort of Features, than
those of our Countrey: Our <HI>Indian Slaves,</HI> that
row'd us, ask'd 'em some Questions; but they
cou'd not understand us, but shew'd us a long
Cotton String, with several Knots on it, and
told us, they had been coming from the Moun∣tains
so many Moons as there were Knots; they
were habited in Skins of a strange Beast, and
brought along with 'em Bags of Gold Dust;
which, as well as they cou'd give us to under∣stand,
came streaming in little small Chanels
down the high Mountains, when the Rains fell;
and offer'd to be the Convoy to any Body, or
Persons, that wou'd go to the Mountains. We
carry'd these Men up to <HI>Parham,</HI> where they were
kept till the Lord-Governor came: And be∣cause
all the Country was mad to be going on
this Golden Adventure, the Governor, by his
Letters, commanded (for they sent some of the
Gold to him) that a Guard shou'd be set at the
mouth of the River of <HI>Amazons</HI> (a River so call'd,
almost as broad as the River of <HI>Thames</HI>) and
prohibited all People from going up that River,
it conducting to those Mountains of Gold. But
we going off for <HI>England</HI> before the Project was
further prosecuted, and the Governor being
drown'd in a Hurricane, either the Design dy'd,
or the <HI>Dutch</HI> have the Advantage of it: And 'tis
to be bemoan'd what His Majesty lost, by losing
that part of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="75"/>
Though this Digression is a little from my
Story; however, since it contains some Proofs
of the Curiosity and Daring of this Great Man,
I was content to omit nothing of his Character.</P>
<P>It was thus for some time we diverted him;
but now <HI>Imoinda</HI> began to shew she was with
Child, and did nothing but sigh and weep for
the Captivity of her Lord, her self, and the In∣fant
yet unborn; and believ'd, if it were so
hard to gain the Liberty of Two, 'twou'd be
more difficult to get that for Three. Her Griefs
were so many Darts in the great Heart of <HI>Caesar;</HI>
and taking his Opportunity, one <HI>Sunday,</HI> when
all the <HI>Whites</HI> were overtaken in Drink, as there
were abundance of several Trades, and <HI>Slaves</HI>
for Four Years, that inhabited among the <HI>Negro</HI>
Houses; and <HI>Sunday</HI> was their Day of Debauch,
(otherwise they were a sort of Spies upon <HI>Caesar,</HI>)
he went, pretending out of goodness to 'em, to
Feast among 'em, and sent all his Musick, and
order'd a great Treat for the whole Gang, about
Three hundred <HI>Negroes,</HI> and about an Hundred
and fifty were able to bear Arms, such as they
had, which were sufficient to do execution with
Spirits accordingly: For the <HI>English</HI> had none
but rusty Swords, that no strength cou'd draw
from a Scabbard; except the People of particu∣lar
Quality, who took care to oil 'em, and keep
'em in good order: The Guns also, unless here
and there one, or those newly carry'd from
<HI>England,</HI> wou'd do no good or harm; for 'tis
the Nature of that Countrey to rust and eat up
Iron, or any Metals but Gold and Silver. And
they are very unexpert at the Bow, which the
<HI>Negroes</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> are perfect Masters of.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="76"/>
<HI>Caesar,</HI> having singl'd out these Men from
the Women and Children, made an Harangue
to 'em, of the Miseries and Ignominies of Sla∣very;
counting up all their Toils and Suffer∣ings,
under such Loads, Burdens and Drudge∣ries,
as were fitter for Beasts than Men; Sense∣less
Brutes, than Humane Souls. He told 'em,
it was not for Days, Months or Years, but
for Eternity; there was no end to be of their
Misfortunes: They suffer'd not like Men who
might find a Glory and Fortitude in Oppres∣sion;
but like Dogs that lov'd the Whip and
Bell, and fawn'd the more they were beaten:
That they had lost the Divine Quality of Men,
and were become insensible Asses, fit only to
bear: nay, worse; an Ass, or Dog, or Horse,
having done his Duty, cou'd lie down in re∣treat,
and rise to work again, and while he
did his Duty, indur'd no Stripes; but Men,
Villainous, Senseless Men, such as they, Toil'd
on all the tedious Week till <HI>Black Friday;</HI> and
then, whether they work'd or not, whether
they were faulty or meriting, they, promis∣cuously,
the Innocent with the Guilty, suf∣fer'd
the infamous Whip, the sordid Stripes,
from their fellow <HI>Slaves,</HI> till their Blood
trickl'd from all Parts of their Body; Blood,
whose every drop ought to be reveng'd with
a Life of some of those Tyrants that impose it:
<HI>And why</HI> (said he) <HI>my dear Friends and Fellow-sufferers,
shou'd we be Slaves to an unknown
People! Have they Vanquish'd us Nobly in Fight?
Have they Won us in Honourable Battle? And
are we, by the chance of War, become their Slaves?
This wou'd not anger a Noble Heart; this wou'd
<PB N="81" REF="76"/>
not animate a Soldier's Soul; no, but we are Bought
and Sold like Apes, or Monkeys, to be the Sport of
Women, Fools and Cowards; and the Support of
Rogues, Runagades, that have abandon'd their own
Countries for Rapine, Murders, Theft and Villanies:
Do you not hear, every day, how they upbraid each other
with Infamy of Life, below the Wildest Salvages?
and shall we render Obedience to such a degenerate
Race, who have no one Humane Vertue left, to distin∣guish
'em from the vilest Creatures? Will you, I say,
suffer the Lash from such Hands?</HI> They all re∣ply'd,
with one accord, <HI>No, No, No;</HI> Caesar <HI>has
spoke like a Great Captain; like a Great King.</HI></P>
<P><HI>After this, he wou'd have proceeded, but was
interrupted by a tall</HI> Negro <HI>of some more Qua∣lity
than the rest, his Name was</HI> Tuscan; <HI>who
bowing at the Feet of</HI> Caesar, <HI>cry'd,</HI> My Lord,
we have listen'd with Joy and Attention to what you
have said; and, were we only Men, wou'd follow so
great a Leader through the World: But oh! consider
we are Husbands, and Parents too, and have things
more dear to us than Life, our Wives and Children,
unfit for Travel in these unpassable Woods, Mountains
and Bogs; we have not only difficult Lands to over∣come,
but Rivers to wade, and Mountains to en∣counter;
Ravenous Beasts of Prey—<HI>To
this,</HI> Caesar <HI>reply'd,</HI> That Honour was the First
Principle in Nature, that was to be Obey'd: but as
no Man wou'd pretend to that, without all the Acts
of Vertue, Compassion, Charity, Love, Justice and
Reason; he found it not inconsistent with that, to
take an equal care of their Wives and Children, as
they wou'd of themselves; and that he did not design,
when he led them to Freedom, and Glorious Li∣berty,
that they shou'd leave that better part of them∣selves
<PB N="82" REF="77"/>
to perish by the Hand of the Tyrant's Whip:
But if there were a Woman among them so degene∣rate
from Love and Vertue, to chuse Slavery before
the pursuit of her Husband, and with the hazard of
her Life, to share with him in his Fortunes; that
such an one ought to be abandon'd, and left as a
Prey to the Common Enemy.</P>
<P>To which they all Agreed,—and Bowed.
After this, he spoke of the impassable Woods
and Rivers; and convinc'd 'em, the more Dan∣ger,
the more Glory. He told them, that he had
heard of one <HI>Hannibal</HI> a great Captain, had cut
his way through Mountains of solid Rocks;
and shou'd a few Shrubs oppose them, which
they cou'd fire before 'em? No, 'twas a trifling
Excuse to Men resolv'd to die, or overcome.
As for Bogs, they are with a little Labour fill'd
and harden'd; and the Rivers cou'd be no Ob∣stacle,
since they swam by Nature, at least, by
Custom, from the first hour of their birth:
That when the Children were weary, they must
carry them by turns, and the Woods and their
own Industry wou'd afford them Food. To
this they all assented with Joy.</P>
<P><HI>Tuscan</HI> then demanded, what he wou'd do?
He said they wou'd Travel towards the Sea,
Plant a New Colony, and Defend it by their
Valour; and when they cou'd find a Ship, either
driven by stress of Weather, or guided by Pro∣vidence
that way, they wou'd seize it, and
make it a Prize, till it had transported them to
their own Countries; at least, they shou'd be
made Free in his Kingdom, and be esteem'd as
his Fellow-sufferers, and Men that had the Cou∣rage
and the Bravery to attempt, at least, for
<PB N="83" REF="77"/>
Liberty; and if they dy'd in the attempt, it
wou'd be more brave, than to live in perpetual
Slavery.</P>
<P>They bow'd and kiss'd his Feet at this Reso∣lution,
and with one accord Vow'd to follow
him to Death. And that Night was appointed
to begin their March, they made it known to
their Wives, and directed them to tie their
Hamaca about their Shoulders, and under their
Arm, like a Scarf; and to lead their Children
that cou'd go, and carry those that cou'd not.
The Wives, who pay an entire Obedience to
their Husbands, obey'd, and stay'd for 'em where
they were appointed: The Men stay'd but to
furnish themselves with what defensive Arms
they cou'd get; and All met at the Rendezvous,
where <HI>Caesar</HI> made a new encouraging Speech to
'em, and led 'em out.</P>
<P>But as they cou'd not march far that Night,
on <HI>Monday</HI> early, when the Overseers went to
call 'em all together, to go to work, they
were extremely surpriz'd, to find not one up∣on
the Place, but all fled with what Baggage
they had. You may imagine this News was
not only suddenly spread all over the <HI>Planta∣tion,</HI>
but soon reach'd the neighbouring ones;
and we had by Noon about Six hundred Men
they call the Militia of the Country, that came
to assist us in the pursuit of the Fugitives:
But never did one see so comical an Ar∣my
march forth to War. The Men of any
Fashion wou'd not concern themselves, though
it were almost the Common Cause; for such
Revoltings are very ill Examples, and have
very fatal Consequences, often-times, in many
<PB N="84" REF="78"/>
Colonies: But they had a Respect for <HI>Caesar,</HI>
and all hands were against the <HI>Parhamites</HI> (as
they call'd those of <HI>Parham Plantation;</HI>) because
they did not, in the first place, love the Lord-Governor;
and, secondly, they wou'd have
it, that <HI>Caesar</HI> was ill us'd, and Baffl'd with;
and 'tis not impossible but some of the best in
the Countrey was of his Council in this Flight,
and depriving us of all the <HI>Slaves:</HI> so that
they of the better sort wou'd not meddle in
the matter. The Deputy-Governor, of whom
I have had no great occasion to speak, and
who was the most fawning fair-Tongu'd Fel∣low
in the World, and one that pretended the
most Friendship to <HI>Caesar,</HI> was now the only
violent Man against him; and though he had
nothing, and so need fear nothing, yet talk'd
and look'd bigger than any Man: He was a
Fellow, whose Character is not fit to be men∣tion'd
with the worst of the <HI>Slaves.</HI> This Fel∣low
wou'd lead his Army forth to meet <HI>Caesar,</HI>
or rather to pursue him: most of their Arms
were of those sort of cruel Whips they call
<HI>Cat-with Nine-Tails;</HI> some had rusty useless
Guns for shew; others old Basket-hilts, whose
Blades had never seen the Light in this Age; and
others had long Staffs and Clubs. Mr. <HI>Trefry</HI>
went along▪ rather to be a Mediator than a Con∣queror,
in such a Battle; for he foresaw, and
knew, if by fighting they put the <HI>Negroes</HI> into
despair, they were a sort of sullen Fellows, that
wou'd drown or kill themselves, before they
wou'd yield; and he advis'd, that fair means was
best: But <HI>Byam</HI> was one that abounded in his
own Wit, and wou'd take his own Measures.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="78"/>
It was not hard to find these Fugitives; for
as they fled, they were forc'd to fire and cut
the Woods before 'em; so that Night or Day
they pursu'd 'em by the Light they made, and
by the Path they had clear'd. But as soon as
<HI>Caesar</HI> found he was pursu'd, he put himself in
a posture of Defence, placing all the Women
and Children in the Rear; and himself, with
<HI>Tuscan</HI> by his side, or next to him, all pro∣mising
to Die or Conquer. Encourag'd thus,
they never stood to Parley, but fell on Pell∣mell
upon the <HI>English,</HI> and kill'd some, and
wounded a good many; they having recourse
to their Whips, as the best of their Weapons.
And as they observ'd no Order, they perplex'd
the Enemy so sorely, with lashing 'em in the
Eyes; and the Women and Children seeing
their Husbands so treated, being of fearful
cowardly Dispositions, and hearing the <HI>English</HI>
cry out, <HI>Yield, and Live! Yield, and be Pardon'd!</HI>
they all run in amongst their Husbands and Fa∣thers,
and hung about 'em, crying out, <HI>Yield,
Yield, and leave</HI> Caesar <HI>to their Revenge;</HI> that by
degrees the <HI>Slaves</HI> abandon'd <HI>Caesar,</HI> and left
him only <HI>Tuscan,</HI> and his Heroick <HI>Imoinda;</HI>
who, grown big as she was, did neverthelefs
press near her Lord, having a Bow, and a
Quiver full of poison'd Arrows, which she
manag'd with such dexterity, that she woun∣ded
several, and shot the Governor into the
Shoulder; of which Wound he had like to
have died, but that an <HI>Indian</HI> Woman, his
Mistress, suck'd the Wound, and cleans'd it
from the Venom: But however, he stirr'd not
from the Place till he had Parly'd with <HI>Caesar,</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="79"/>
who he found was resolv'd to die fighting, and
wou'd not be taken; no more wou'd <HI>Tuscan,</HI>
or <HI>Imoinda.</HI> But he, more thirsting after Re∣venge
of another sort, than that of depriving
him of Life, now made use of all his Art of
Talking and Dissembling, and besought <HI>Caesar</HI>
to yield himself upon Terms which he himself
should propose; and should be sacredly assen∣ted
to, and kept by him: He told him, It was
not that he any longer fear'd him, or cou'd be∣lieve
the force of two Men, and a young He∣roine,
cou'd overcome all them, with all the
Slaves now on their side also; but it was the
vast Esteem he had for his Person, the Desire
he had to serve so Gallant a Man, and to hin∣der
himself from the Reproach hereafter, of
having been the occasion of the Death of a
<HI>Prince,</HI> whose Valour and Magnanimity de∣serv'd
the Empire of the World. He pro∣tested
to him, he look'd upon this Action as
Gallant and Brave, however tending to the
Prejudice of his Lord and Master, who wou'd
by it have lost so considerable a number of
<HI>Slaves;</HI> that this Flight of his, shou'd be look'd
on as a heat of Youth, and a rashness of a too
forward Courage, and an unconsider'd Impa∣tience
of Liberty, and no more; and that he
labour'd in vain to accomplish that which they
wou'd effectually perform, as soon as any
Ship arriv'd that wou'd touch on his Coast:
<HI>So that if you will be pleas'd</HI> (continu'd he) <HI>to
surrender your self, all imaginable Respect shall be
paid you; and your Self, your Wife, and Child,
if it be born here, shall depart free out of our Land.</HI>
But <HI>Caesar</HI> wou'd here of no Composition;
<PB N="87" REF="79"/>
though <HI>Byam</HI> urg'd, If he pursu'd and went
on in his Design, he wou'd inevitably perish,
either by great Snakes, wild Beasts, or Hun∣ger;
and he ought to have regard to his Wife,
whose Condition required Ease, and not the
Fatigues of tedious Travel, where she cou'd
not be secur'd from being devour'd. But <HI>Cae∣ser</HI>
told him, there was no Faith in the White
Men, or the Gods they ador'd; who in∣structed
'em in Principles so false, that honest
Men cou'd not live amongst 'em; though no
People profess'd so much, none perform'd so
little; that he knew what he had to do, when
he dealt with Men of Honour; but with them
a Man ought to be eternally on his Guard, and
never to Eat and Drink with <HI>Christians,</HI> without
his Weapon of Defence in his Hand; and, for
his own Security, never to credit one Word
they spoke. As for the Rashness and Inconside∣rateness
of his Action, he wou'd confess the
Governor is in the right; and that he was
asham'd of what he had done, in endeavouring
to make those Free, who were by Nature
<HI>Slaves,</HI> poor wretched Rogues, fit to be us'd
as <HI>Christian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Tools; Dogs, Treacherous and
Cowardly, fit for such Masters; and they wanted
only but to be whipp'd into the Knowledge of
the <HI>Christian Gods,</HI> to be the vilest of all creep∣ing
things; to learn to worship such Deities
as had not Power to make 'em Just, Brave,
or Honest. In fine, after a thousand things of
this nature, not fit here to be recited, he told
<HI>Byam,</HI> He had rather Die, than Live upon the
same Earth with such Dogs. But <HI>Trefry</HI> and
<HI>Byam</HI> pleaded and protested together so much,
<PB N="88" REF="80"/>
that <HI>Trefry</HI> believing the Governor to mean
what he said; and speaking very cordially
himself, generously put himself into <HI>Caesar</HI>'s
Hands, and took him aside, and persuaded
him, even with Tears, to Live, by Surren∣dring
himself, and to name his Conditions.
<HI>Caesar</HI> was overcome by his Wit and Reasons,
and in consideration of <HI>Imoinda;</HI> and deman∣ding
what he desir'd, and that it shou'd be ra∣tify'd
by their Hands in Writing, because he
had perceiv'd that was the common way of
Contract between Man and Man, amongst
the <HI>Whites.</HI> All this was perform'd, and <HI>Tus∣can</HI>'s
Pardon was put in, and they Surrender
to the Governor, who walked peaceably down
into the <HI>Plantation</HI> with 'em, after giving Or∣der
to bury their Dead. <HI>Caesar</HI> was very much
toil'd with the Bustle of the Day, for he had
fought like a Fury; and what Mischief was
done, He and <HI>Tuscan</HI> perform'd alone; and
gave their Enemies a fatal Proof, that they
durst do any thing, and fear'd no mortal
Force.</P>
<P>But they were no sooner arriv'd at the
Place where all the Slaves receive their Pu∣nishments
of Whipping, but they laid Hands
on <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Tuscan,</HI> faint with Heat and
Toil; and surprizing them, bound them to
two several Stakes, and whipp'd them in a
most deplorable and inhumane manner, ren∣ding
the very Flesh from their Bones; espe∣cially
<HI>Caesar,</HI> who was not perceiv'd to make
any Moan, or to alter his Face, only to roul
his Eyes on the Faithless Governor, and those
he believ'd Guilty, with Fierceness and In∣dignation;
<PB N="89" REF="80"/>
and, to compleat his Rage, he saw
every one of those <HI>Slaves,</HI> who, but a few Days
before, ador'd him as something more than Mor∣tal,
now had a Whip to give him some Lashes,
while he strove not to break his Fetters; tho'
if he had, it were impossible: but he pro∣nounc'd
a Woe and Revenge from his Eyes, that
dar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Fire, that 'twas at once both Awful and
Terrible to behold.</P>
<P>When they thought they were sufficiently
Reveng'd on him, they unty'd him, almost
fainting with loss of Blood, from a thousand
Wounds all over his Body; from which they
had rent his Cloaths, and led him Bleeding
and Naked as he was, and loaded him all over
with Irons, and then rubb'd his Wounds, to
compleat their Cruelty, with <HI>Indian</HI> Pepper;
which had like to have made him raving Mad;
and, in this Condition, made him so fast to
the Ground, that he cou'd not stir, if his
Pains and Wounds wou'd have given him leave.
They spar'd <HI>Imoinda,</HI> and did not let her see
this Barbarity committed towards her Lord,
but carry'd her down to <HI>Parham,</HI> and shut her
up; which was not in kindness to her, but for
fear she shou'd die with the Sight, or Miscarry,
and then they shou'd lose a young <HI>Slave,</HI> and
perhaps the Mother.</P>
<P>You must know, that when the News was
brought, on <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, that <HI>Caesar</HI> had
betaken himself to the Woods, and carry'd
with him all the <HI>Negroes,</HI> we were possess'd
with extreme Fear, which no Persuasions
cou'd dissipate, that he wou'd secure himself
till Night; and then, that he wou'd come
<PB N="90" REF="81"/>
down and cut all our Throats. This Appre∣hension
made all the Females of us fly down
the River, to be secur'd; and while we were
away, they acted this Cruelty: For I suppose,
I had Authority and Interest enough there,
had I suspected any such thing, to have pre∣vented
it; but we had not gone many Leagues,
but the News overtook us, that <HI>Caesar</HI> was ta∣ken,
and whipp'd like a common <HI>Slave.</HI> We
met, on the River, with Colonel <HI>Martin,</HI> a Man
of great Gallantry, Wit and Goodness, and
whom I have celebrated in a Character of my
New <HI>Comedy,</HI> by his own Name, in Memory
of so Brave a Man: He was Wise and Elo∣quent,
and, from the fineness of his Parts,
bore a great Sway over the Hearts of all the
<HI>Colony:</HI> He was a Friend to <HI>Caesar,</HI> and resen∣ted
this false Dealing with him very much.
We carry'd him back to <HI>Parham,</HI> thinking to
have made an Accommodation. When he
came, the first News we heard, was, That the
<HI>Governor</HI> was dead of a Wound <HI>Imoinda</HI> had gi∣ven
him; but it was not so well: But it seems,
he wou'd have the Pleasure of beholding the
Revenge he took on <HI>Caesar;</HI> and before the cruel
Ceremony was finish'd, he dropt down; and
then they perceiv'd the Wound he had on his
Shoulder was by a venom'd Arrow; which, as
I said, his <HI>Indian</HI> Mistress heal'd, by sucking the
Wound.</P>
<P>We were no sooner arriv'd, but we went
up to the <HI>Plantation</HI> to see <HI>Caesar;</HI> whom we
found in a very miserable and unexpressible
Condition; and I have a thousand times
admir'd how he liv'd in so much tormenting
<PB N="91" REF="81"/>
Pain. We said all things to him, that Trouble,
Pity and Good Nature cou'd suggest; Pro∣testing
our Innocency of the Fact, and our
Abhorrence of such Cruelties; making a thou∣sand
Professions of Services to him, and beg∣ging
as many Pardons for the Offenders, till
we said so much, that he believ'd we had
no hand in his ill Treatment; but told us,
He cou'd never pardon <HI>Byam;</HI> as for <HI>Trefry,</HI>
he confess'd he saw his Grief and Sorrow for
his Suffering, which he cou'd not hinder, but
was like to have been beaten down by the ve∣ry
<HI>Slaves,</HI> for speaking in his Defence: But
for <HI>Byam,</HI> who was their Leader, their
Head,—and shou'd, by his Justice and
Honour, have been an Example to 'em,—for
him he wish'd to live, to take a dire Re∣venge
of him; and said, <HI>It had been well for
him, if he had Sacrific'd me, instead of giving
me the contemptible Whip.</HI> He refus'd to talk
much; but begging us to give him our Hands,
he took 'em, and protested never to lift up his,
to do us any harm. He had a great Respect
for Colonel <HI>Martin,</HI> and always took his
Counsel like that of a Parent; and assur'd
him, He wou'd obey him in any thing, but
his Revenge on <HI>Byam: Therefore</HI> (said he) <HI>for
his own safety, let him speedily dispatch me; for if
I cou'd dispatch my self, I wou'd not, till that Ju∣stice
were done to my injur'd Person, and the con∣tempt
of a Soldier: No, I wou'd not kill my self,
even after a Whipping, but will be content to live
with that Infamy, and be pointed at by every grin∣ning
Slave, till I have compleated my Revenge;
and then you shall see, that</HI> Oroonoko <HI>scorns to live
<PB N="92" REF="82"/>
with the Indignity that was put on</HI> Caesar. All
we cou'd do, cou'd get no more Words from
him; and we took care to have him put imme∣diately
into a healing Bath, to rid him of his
Pepper, and order'd a Chirurgeon to anoint
him with healing Balm; which he suffer'd, and
in some time he began to be able to Walk and
Eat. We fail'd not to visit him every Day,
and to that end had him brought to an Apart∣ment
at <HI>Parham.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor was no sooner recover'd, and
ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heard of the Menaces of <HI>Caesar,</HI> but he
call'd his Council; who (not to disgrace them,
or Burlesque the Government there) consisted
of such notorious Villains as <HI>Newgate</HI> never
Transported; and, possibly, originally were
such who understood neither the Laws of
<HI>God or Man;</HI> and had no sort of Principles
to make 'em worthy the Name of Men; but,
at the very Council-Table, wou'd Contradict
and Fight with one another; and Swear so
bloodily, that 'twas terrible to hear and see
'em. (Some of 'em were afterwards Hang'd,
when the <HI>Dutch</HI> took possession of the Place,
others sent off in Chains.) But calling these
special Rulers of the Nation together, and re∣quiring
their Counsel in this weighty Affair,
they all concluded, that (Damn 'em) it might
be their own Cases; and that <HI>Caesar</HI> ought to
be made an Example to all the <HI>Negroes,</HI> to
fright 'em from daring to threaten their Betters,
their Lords and Masters; and, at this rate, no
Man was safe from his own <HI>Slaves;</HI> and con∣cluded,
<HI>nemine contradicente,</HI> that <HI>Caesar</HI> shou'd
be Hang'd.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="82"/>
<HI>Trefry</HI> then thought it time to use his Autho∣rity;
and told <HI>Byam,</HI> his Command did not ex∣tend
to his Lord's <HI>Plantation;</HI> and that <HI>Parham</HI>
was as much exempt from the Law as <HI>White∣hall;</HI>
and that they ought no more to touch
the Servants of the Lord—(who there re∣presented
the King's Person) than they cou'd
those about the King himself; and that <HI>Par∣ham</HI>
was a Sanctuary; and though his Lord
were absent in Person, his Power was still in
Being there; which he had entrusted with
him, as far as the Dominions of his particular
<HI>Plantations</HI> reach'd, and all that belong'd to it;
the rest of the Country, as <HI>Byam</HI> was Lieute∣nant
to his Lord, he might exercise his Ty∣ranny
upon. <HI>Trefry</HI> had others as powerful, or
more, that int'rested themselves in <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Life,
and absolutely said, He shou'd be Defended.
So turning the Governor, and his wise Council,
out of Doors, (for they sat at <HI>Parham-house</HI>)
we set a Guard upon our Landing-place, and
wou'd admit none but those we call'd Friends to
us and <HI>Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Governor</HI> having remain'd wounded at
<HI>Parham,</HI> till his Recovery was compleated,
<HI>Caesar</HI> did not know but he was still there, and
indeed, for the most part, his time was spent
there; for he was one that lov'd to live at other
Peoples Expence, and if he were a Day ab∣sent,
he was Ten present there; and us'd to
Play, and Walk, and Hunt and Fish with
<HI>Caesar.</HI> So that <HI>Caesar</HI> did not at all doubt, if
he once recover'd Strength, but he shou'd find
an opportunity of being reveng'd on him:
Though, after such a Revenge, he cou'd not
<PB N="94" REF="83"/>
hope to live; for if he escap'd the Fury of the
<HI>English</HI> Mobile, who perhaps wou'd have been
glad of the occasion to have kill'd him, he was
resolv'd not to survive his Whipping; yet he
had some tender Hours, a repenting Softness,
which he call'd his Fits of Cowardice; wherein
he struggl'd with Love for the Victory of his
Heart, which took part with his charming <HI>Imo∣inda</HI>
there: but, for the most part, his time
was past in melancholy Thought, and black
Designs; he consider'd, if he shou'd do this
Deed, and die either in the Attempt, or af∣ter
it, he left his lovely <HI>Imoinda</HI> a Prey, or at
best a <HI>Slave,</HI> to the enrag'd Multitude: His
great Heart cou'd not endure that Thought:
<HI>Perhaps</HI> (said he) <HI>she may be first Ravish'd by
every Brute; exposed first to their nasty Lusts, and
then a shameful Death:</HI> No, he cou'd not live
a moment under that Apprehension, too in∣supportable
to be borne. These were his
Thoughts, and his silent Arguments with his
Heart, as he told us afterwards: so that now
resolving not only to kill <HI>Byam,</HI> but all those
he thought had enrag'd him; pleasing his great
Heart with the fancy'd Slaughter he shou'd
make over the whole face of the <HI>Plantation;</HI>
he first resolv'd on a Deed, that (however
Horrid it first appear'd to us all) when we had
heard his Reasons, we thought it Brave and
Just. Being able to walk, and, as he believ'd,
fit for the execution of his great Design, he
begg'd <HI>Trefry</HI> to trust him into the Air, believing
a Walk wou'd do him good. Which was
granted him; and taking <HI>Imoinda</HI> with him, as
he us'd to do in his more happy and calmer
<PB N="95" REF="83"/>
Days, he led her up into a Wood, where,
after (with a thousand Sighs, and long gazing
silently on her Face, while Tears gusht, in
spite of him, from his Eyes) he told her his
Design, first of killing her, and then his Ene∣mies,
and next himself, and the impossibility
of escaping, and therefore he told her the Ne∣cessity
of Dying. He found the Heroick Wife
faster pleading for Death than he was to pro∣pose
it, when she found his fix'd Resolution;
and, on her Knees, besought him not to leave
her a Prey to his Enemies. He (griev'd to
Death) yet pleas'd at her noble Resolution,
took her up, and embracing her with all the
Passion and Languishment of a dying Lover,
drew his Knife to kill this Treasure of his Soul,
this Pleasure of his Eyes; while Tears trickl'd
down his Cheeks, hers were smiling with Joy
she shou'd die by so noble a Hand, and be
sent into her own Countrey, (for that's their No∣tion
of the next World) by him she so ten∣derly
Lov'd, and so truly Ador'd in this. For
Wives have a Respect for their Husbands equal
to what any other People pay a Deity: And
when a Man finds any occasion to quit his
Wife, if he love her, she dies by his Hand;
if not, he sells her, or suffers some other to kill
her. It being thus, you may believe the Deed
was soon resolv'd on; and 'tis not to be doub∣ted,
but the Parting, the eternal Leave taking
of Two such Lovers, so greatly Born, so Sen∣sible,
so Beautiful, so Young, and so Fond,
must be very Moving, as the Relation of it
was to me afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="84"/>
All that Love cou'd say in such cases, being
ended, and all the intermitting Irresolutions
being adjusted, the Lovely, Young and A∣dor'd
Victim lays her self down before the
Sacrificer; while he, with a Hand resolv'd, and
a Heart-breaking within, gave the fatal Stroke;
first cutting her Throat, and then severing her
yet smiling Face from that delicate Body, preg∣nant
as it was with the Fruits of tend'rest Love.
As soon as he had done, he laid the Body de∣cently
on Leaves and Flowers, of which he
made a Bed, and conceal'd it under the same
Cover-lid of Nature, only her Face he left
yet bare to look on: But when he found she
was Dead, and past all Retrieve, never more
to bless him with her Eyes, and soft Language;
his Grief swell'd up to Rage; he Tore, he
Rav'd, he Roar'd like some Monster of the
Wood, calling on the lov'd Name of <HI>Imoinda:</HI>
A thousand times he turn'd the fatal Knife that
did the Deed toward his own Heart, with a
Resolution to go immediately after her; but
dire Revenge, which was now a thousand
times more fierce in his Soul than before, pre∣vents
him, and he wou'd cry out; <HI>No, since I
have sacrific'd</HI> Imoinda <HI>to my Revenge, shall I lose
that Glory which I have purchas'd so dear, as at the
Price of the Fairest, Dearest, Softest Creature that
ever Nature made? No, no!</HI> Then, at her
Name, Grief wou'd get the ascendant of
Rage, and he wou'd lie down by her Side,
and water her Face with showers of Tears,
which never were wont to fall from those
Eyes; and however bent he was on his inten∣ded
Slaughter, he had not power to stir fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="97" REF="84"/>
the Sight of this dear Object, now more Be∣lov'd,
and more Ador'd than ever.</P>
<P>He remain'd in this deplorable Condition
for two Days, and never rose from the Ground
where he had made his sad Sacrifice; at last,
rouzing from her side, and accusing himself
with living too long, now <HI>Imoinda</HI> was dead,
and that the Deaths of those barbarous Ene∣mies
were deferr'd too long, he resolv'd now
to finish the Great Work; but offering to rise,
he found his Strength so decay'd, that he reel'd
to and fro, like Boughs assail'd by contrary
Winds; so that he was forced to lie down
again, and try to summon all his Courage to
his Aid; he found his Brains turn'd round, and
his Eyes were dizzy, and Objects appear'd not
the same to him they were wont to do; his
Breath was short, and all his Limbs surprized
with a Faintness he had never felt before: He
had not eat in two Days, which was one occa∣sion
of this Feebleness, but excess of Grief
was the greatest; yet still he hop'd he shou'd
recover Vigour to act his Design, and lay expe∣cting
it yet six days longer; still mourning over
the dead Idol of his Heart, and striving every
day to rise, but cou'd not.</P>
<P>In all this time you may believe we were in
no little affliction for <HI>Caesar</HI> and his Wife;
some were of opinion he was escap'd, never
to return; others thought some Accident had
hap'ned to him: But however, we fail'd not
to send out an hundred People several ways, to
search for him: A Party of about forty went
that way he took, among whom was <HI>Tuscan,</HI>
who was perfectly reconcil'd to <HI>Byam:</HI> They
<PB N="98" REF="85"/>
had not gone very far into the Wood, but
they smelt an unusual Smell, as of a dead Bo∣dy;
for Stinks must be very noisom, that can
be distinguish'd among such a quantity of na∣tural
Sweets, as every Inch of that Land pro∣duces.
So that they concluded they shou'd
find him dead, or some body that was so;
they pass'd on towards it, as loathsom as it was,
and made such a rusling among the Leaves,
that lie thick on the Ground, by continual
falling, that <HI>Caesar</HI> heard he was approach'd;
and though he had, during the space of these
eight Days, endeavour'd to rise, but found he
wanted Strength; yet looking up, and seeing
his Pursuers, he rose, and reel'd to a neigh∣bouring
Tree, against which he fix'd his Back;
and being within a dozen Yards of those that
advanc'd and saw him, he call'd out to them,
and bid them approach no nearer, if they
wou'd be safe. So that they stood still, and
hardly believing their Eyes, that wou'd per∣suade
them that it was <HI>Caesar</HI> that spoke to
'em, so much was he alter'd, they ask'd him,
what he had done with his Wife, for they
smelt a Stink that almost struck them dead?
He, pointing to the dead Body, sighing, cry'd,
<HI>Behold her there.</HI> They put off the Flowers
that cover'd her, with their Sticks, and found
she was kill'd, and cry'd out, <HI>Oh, Monster!
that hast murther'd thy Wife.</HI> Then asking
him, why he did so cruel a Deed? He re∣plied,
He had no leisure to answer imperti∣nent
Questions: <HI>You may go back</HI> (continu'd
he) <HI>and tell the faithless Governor, he may thank
Fortune that I am breathing my last; and that my
<PB N="99" REF="85"/>
Arm is too feeble to obey my Heart, in what it
had design'd him:</HI> But his Tongue faultering,
and trembling, he cou'd scarce end what he
was saying. The <HI>English</HI> taking Advantage
by his Weakness, cry'd, <HI>Let us take him alive by
all means.</HI> He heard 'em; and, as if he had
reviv'd from a Fainting; or a Dream, he cry'd
out, <HI>No, Gentlemen, you are deceiv'd; you will
find no more</HI> Caesars <HI>to be Whipt; no more find a
Faith in me: Feeble as you think me, I have
Strength yet left to secure me from a second In∣dignity.</HI>
They swore all a-new; and he only
shook his Head, and beheld them with Scorn.
Then they cry'd out, <HI>Who will venture on this
single Man? Will no body?</HI> They stood all si∣lent
while <HI>Caesar</HI> replied, <HI>Fatal will be the At∣tempt
to the first Adventurer, let him assure him∣self,</HI>
(and, at that word, held up his Knife in
a menacing posture,) <HI>Look ye, ye faithless Crew,</HI>
said he, <HI>'tis not Life I seek, nor am I afraid of
Dying,</HI> (and at that word, cut a piece of
Flesh from his own Throat, and threw it at
'em,) <HI>yet still I wou'd Live if I cou'd, till I had
perfected my Revenge: But, oh! it cannot be; I
feel Life gliding from my Eyes and Heart; and
if I make not haste, I shall yet fall a Victim to
the shameful Whip.</HI> At that, he rip'd up his own
Belly, and took his Bowels and pull'd 'em out,
with what Strength he cou'd; while some,
on their Knees imploring, besought him to
hold his Hand. But when they saw him tot∣tering,
they cry'd out, <HI>Will none venture on him?</HI>
A bold <HI>English</HI> cry'd, <HI>Yes, if he were the Devil,</HI>
(taking Courage when he saw him almost
Dead) and swearing a horrid Oath for his
<PB N="100" REF="86"/>
Farewell to the World, he rush'd on him. <HI>Caesar</HI>
with his Arm'd Hand met him so fairly, as
stuck him to the Heart, and he fell dead at his
Feet. <HI>Tuscan</HI> seeing that, cry'd out, <HI>I love thee,
O</HI> Caesar! <HI>and therefore will not let thee die, if
possible;</HI> and running to him, took him in his
Arms: but, at the same time, warding a Blow
that <HI>Caesar</HI> made at his Bosom, he receiv'd it
quite through his Arm; and <HI>Caesar</HI> having not
the strength to pluck the Knife forth, tho' he
attempted it, <HI>Tuscan</HI> neither pull'd it out him∣self,
nor suffer'd it to be pull'd out, but came
down with it sticking in his Arm; and the rea∣son
he gave for it, was, because the Air shou'd
not get into the Wound. They put their
Hands a-cross, and carry'd <HI>Caesar</HI> between six
of 'em, fainting as he was, and they thought
dead, or just dying; and they brought him
to <HI>Parham,</HI> and laid him on a Couch, and had
the Chirurgeon immediately to him, who drest
his Wounds, and sow'd up his Belly, and us'd
means to bring him to life, which they ef∣fected.
We ran all to see him; and, if before
we thought him so beautiful a Sight, he was
now so alter'd, that his Face was like a Death's
Head black'd over; nothing but Teeth and
Eye-holes: For some Days we suffer'd no bo∣dy
to speak to him, but caused Cordials to be
poured down his Throat; which sustained his
Life, and in six or seven days he recover'd
his Senses: For, you must know, that Wounds
are almost to a Miracle cur'd in the <HI>Indies;</HI>
unless Wounds in the Legs, which rarely
ever cure.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="86"/>
When he was well enough to speak, we
talk'd to him, and ask'd him some Questions
about his Wife, and the Reasons why he kill'd
her; and he then told us what I have related
of that Resolution and of his Parting, and he
besought us we wou'd let him die, and was
extremely afflicted to think it was possible he
might live; he assur'd us, if we did not dis∣patch
him, he wou'd prove very fatal to a
great many. We said all we cou'd to make
him live, and gave him new Assurances; but he
begg'd we wou'd not think so poorly of him,
or of his Love to <HI>Imoinda,</HI> to imagine we cou'd
flatter him to Life again: but the Chirurgeon
assur'd him he cou'd not live, and therefore
he need not fear. We were all (but <HI>Caesar</HI>)
afflicted at this News, and the Sight was gast∣ly:
His Discourse was sad; and the earthly
Smell about him so strong, that I was per∣suaded
to leave the place for some time, (being
my self but sickly, and very apt to fall into
Fits of dangerous Illness upon any extraordi∣nary
Melancholy.) The Servants, and <HI>Trefry,</HI>
and the Chirurgeons, promis'd all to take what
possible care they cou'd of the Life of <HI>Caesar;</HI>
and I, taking Boat, went with other Company
to Colonel <HI>Martin</HI>'s, about three Days Journey
down the River: but I was no sooner gone,
but the Governor taking <HI>Trefry</HI> about some
pretended earnest Business, a Day's Journey
up the River, having communicated his De∣sign
to one <HI>Banister,</HI> a Wild <HI>Irish</HI> Man, and
one of the Council, a Fellow of absolute
Barbarity, and fit to execute any Villany, but
was Rich: He came up to <HI>Parham,</HI> and for∣cibly
<PB N="102" REF="87"/>
took <HI>Caesar,</HI> and had him carried to the
same Post where he was whip'd; and causing
him to be ty'd to it, and a great Fire made before
him, he told him, he shou'd die like a Dog,
as he was. <HI>Caesar</HI> replied, this was the first
piece of Bravery that ever <HI>Banister</HI> did, and he
never spoke Sence till he pronounc'd that Word;
and, if he wou'd keep it, he wou'd declare,
in the other World, that he was the only
Man, of all the <HI>Whites,</HI> that ever he heard
speak Truth. And turning to the Men that
bound him, he said, <HI>My Friends, am I to Die, or
to be Whipt?</HI> And they cry'd; <HI>Whipt! No, you
shall not escape so well.</HI> And then he reply'd,
smiling, <HI>A Blessing on thee;</HI> and assur'd them,
they need not tie him, for he wou'd stand fix'd
like a Rock, and endure Death so as shou'd en∣courage
them to Die: <HI>But if you Whip me</HI> (said
he) <HI>be sure you tie me fast.</HI></P>
<P>He had learn'd to take Tobacco; and when
he was assur'd he shou'd Die, he desir'd they
wou'd give him a Pipe in his Mouth, ready
lighted; which they did: and the Execu∣tioner
came, and first out off his Members,
and threw them into the Fire; after that, with
an ill-favour'd Knife, they cut off his Ears and
his Nose, and burn'd them; he still Smoak'd
on, as if nothing had touch'd him; then they
hack'd off one of his Arms, and still he bore
up, and held his Pipe; but at the cutting off
the other Arm, his Head sunk, and his Pipe
dropt, and he gave up the Ghost, without a
Groan, or a Reproach. My Mother and Sister
were by him all the while, but not suffer'd
to save him; so rude and wild were the Rabble,
<PB N="103" REF="87"/>
and so inhumane were the Justices who stood
by to see the Execution, who after paid dear∣ly
enough for their Insolence. They cut <HI>Caesar</HI>
in Quarters, and sent them to several of the
chief <HI>Plantations:</HI> One Quarter was sent to
Colonel <HI>Martin;</HI> who refus'd it, and swore, he
had rather see the Quarters of <HI>Banister,</HI> and the
<HI>Governor</HI> himself, than those of <HI>Caesar,</HI> on his
<HI>Plantations;</HI> and that he cou'd govern his <HI>Ne∣groes,</HI>
without Terrifying and Grieving them
with frightful Spectacles of a mangl'd King.</P>
<P>Thus Died this Great Man; worthy of a
better Fate, and a more sublime Wit than mine
to write his Praise: yet, I hope, the Reputa∣tion
of my Pen is considerable enough to make
his Glorious Name to survive to all Ages, with
that of the Brave, the Beautiful and the Con∣stant
<HI>Imoinda.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Fair JILT:
OR, THE
AMOURS
OF
Prince Tarquin and Miranda.</HEAD>
<P>AS Love is the most Noble and Divine
Passion of the Soul, so it is that to
which we may justly attribute all the
real Satisfactions of Life; and with∣out
it, Man is unfinish'd, and unhappy.</P>
<P>There are a thousand things to be said of
the Advantages this generous Passion brings to
those, whose Hearts are capable of receiving
its soft Impressions; for 'tis not every one that
can be sensible of its tender Touches. How
many Examples, from History and Observati∣on,
cou'd I give of its wondrous Power; nay,
even to a degree of Transmigration? How ma∣ny
Ideots has it made wise? How many Fools
eloquent? How many Home-bred 'Squires ac∣complish'd?
How many C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wards brave? And
there is no sort or species of Mankind on whom
it cannot work some Change and Miracle, if it
<PB N="2" REF="90"/>
be a noble well-grounded Passion, except on the
Fop in Fashion, the harden'd incorrigible Fop;
so often wounded, but never reclaim'd: For
still, by a dire Mistake, conducted by vast O∣pinionatreism,
and a greater Portion of Self-love,
than the rest of the Race of Man, he be∣lieves
that Affectation in his Mien and Dress,
that Mathematical-movement, that Formality
in every Action, that Face manag'd with Care,
and soften'd into Ridicule, the languishing Turn,
the Toss, and the Back-shake of the Perriwig,
is the direct Way to the Heart of the fine Per∣son
he Adores; and instead of curing Love in
his Soul, serves only to advance his Folly; and
the more he is enamour'd, the more industri∣ously
he assumes (every Hour) the Coxcomb.
These are Love's Play-things, a sort of Ani∣mals
with whom he sports; and whom he ne∣ver
wounds, but when he is in good humour,
and always shoots laughing. 'Tis the Diversi∣on
of the Little God, to see what a fluttering
and bustle one of these Sparks, new-wounded,
makes; to what fantastick Fooleries he has re∣course:
The Glass is every moment call'd to
counsel, the Valet consulted and plagu'd for
new Invention of Dress, the Foot-man and
Scrutore perpetually employ'd; <HI>Billet-doux</HI> and
<HI>Madrigals</HI> take up all his Mornings, till Play∣time
in Dressing, till Night in Gazing; still,
like a Sun-flower, turn'd towards the Beams
of the fair Eyes of his <HI>Caelia,</HI> adjusting himself
in the most Amarous Posture he can assume,
his Hat under his Arm, while the other Hand
is put carelesly into his Bosom, as if laid upon
<PB N="3" REF="90"/>
his panting Heart; his Head a little bent to
one side, supported with a world of Crevat-string,
which he takes mighty care not to put
into disorder; as one may guess by a never-failing,
and horrid Stiffness in his Neck; and
if he have an occasion to look aside, his whole
Body turns at the same time, for fear the Mo∣tion
of the Head alone should incommode the
Crevat or Perriwig: And sometimes the Glove
is well manag'd, and the white Hand display'd.
Thus, with a thousand other little Motions and
Formalities, all in the common Place or Road
of Foppery, he takes infinite pains to shew
himself to the Pit and Boxes, a most accom∣plish'd
Ass. This is he, of all Humane Kind,
on whom Love can do no Miracle; and who
can no where, and upon no occasion, quit one
Grain of his refin'd Foppery, unless in a Duel,
or a Battle, if ever his Stars shou'd be so severe
and ill-manner'd, to reduce him to the Neces∣sity
of either: Fear then wou'd ruffle that fine
Form he had so long preserved in nicest Or∣der,
with grief considering, that an unlucky
Chance-wound in his Face, if such a dire Mis∣fortune
shou'd befal him, wou'd spoil the Sale
of it for ever.</P>
<P>Perhaps it will be urg'd, that since no Meta∣morphosis
can be made in a Fop by Love, you
must consider him one of those that only talks
of Love, and thinks himself that happy thing,
a Lover; and wanting fine Sence enough for
the real Passion, believes what he feels to be it.
There are in the Quiver of the God a great
many different Darts; some that wound for a
<PB N="4" REF="91"/>
Day, and others for a Year; they are all fine,
painted, glittering Darts, and shew as well
as those made of the noblest Metal; but the
Wounds they make, reach the Desire only,
and are cur'd by possessing, while the short-liv'd
Passion betrays the Cheats: But 'tis that
refin'd and illustrious Passion of the Soul, whose
Aim is Vertue, and whose End is Honour, that
has the Power of changing Nature, and is ca∣pable
of performing all those Heroick Things,
of which History is full.</P>
<P>How far distant Passions may be from one
another, I shall be able to make appear in these
following Rules. I'll prove to you the strong
Effects of Love in some unguarded and ungo∣vern'd
Hearts; where it rages beyond the In∣spirations
of <HI>a God all soft and gentle,</HI> and reigns
more like <HI>a Fury from Hell.</HI></P>
<P>I do not pretend here to entertain you with
a feign'd Story, or any thing piec'd together
with Romantick Accidents; but every Circum∣stance,
to a Tittle, is Truth. To a great part
of the Main, I myself was an Eye-witness;
and what I did not see, I was confirm'd of by
Actors in the Intrigue, holy Men, of the Or∣der
of St. <HI>Francis:</HI> But for the sake of some of
her Relations, I shall give my <HI>Fair Jilt</HI> a feign'd
Name, that of <HI>Miranda;</HI> but my Hero must
retain his own, it being too Illustrious to be
conceal'd.</P>
<P>You are to understand, that in all the Ca∣tholick
Countries, where Holy Orders are esta∣blish'd,
there are abundance of differing kinds
of Religious, both of Men and Women: A∣mongst
<PB N="5" REF="91"/>
the Women, there are those we call
<HI>Nuns,</HI> that make solemn Vows of perpetual
Chastity: There are others who make but a
simple Vow, as, for five or ten Years, or more
or less; and that time expir'd, they may con∣tract
anew for longer time, or marry, or dis∣pose
of themselves as they shall see good; and
these are ordinarily call'd <HI>Gallopping Nuns:</HI> Of
these there are several Orders; as, <HI>Chanonesses,
Begines, Quest's, Swart-Sisters,</HI> and <HI>Jesuitisses,</HI>
with several others I have forgot: Of those of
the <HI>Begines</HI> was our <HI>Fair Votress.</HI></P>
<P>These Orders are taken up by the best Per∣sons
of the Town, young Maids of Fortune,
who live together, not inclos'd, but in Palaces
that will hold about Fiften hundred or Two
thousand of these <HI>Fille Devotes,</HI> where they
have a regulated Government, under a sort of
<HI>Abbess,</HI> or <HI>Prioress;</HI> or rather, a <HI>Governante.</HI>
They are oblig'd to a Method of Devotion,
and are under a sort of Obedience. They wear
an Habit much like our Widows of Quality in
<HI>England,</HI> only without a <HI>Bando;</HI> and their
Veil is of a thicker Crape than what we have
here, through which one cannot see the Face;
for when they go abroad, they cover them∣selves
all over with it, but they put 'em up in
the Churches, and lay 'em by in the Houses.
Every one of these have a Confessor, who is to
'em a sort of Steward: For, you must know,
they that go into these places, have the Ma∣nagement
of their own Fortunes, and what
their Parents design 'em. Without the Advice
of this Confessor, they act nothing, nor admit
<PB N="6" REF="92"/>
of a Lover that he shall not approve of; at
least, this Method ought to be taken, and is
by almost all of 'em; though <HI>Miranda</HI> thought
her Wit above it, as her Spirit was.</P>
<P>But as these Women are, as I said, of the
best Quality, and live with the Reputation of
being retir'd from the World a little more than
ordinary, and because there is a sort of diffi∣culty
to approach 'em, they are the People the
most courted, and liable to the greatest Tem∣ptations;
for as difficult as it seems to be, they
receive Visits from all the Men of the best
Quality, especially Strangers. All the Men of
Wit and Conversation meet at the Apartments
of these fair <HI>Fille Devotes,</HI> where all manner of
Gallantries are perform'd, while all the Study
of these Maids is to accomplish themselves for
these noble Conversations. They receive Pre∣sents,
Balls, Serenades and Billets: All the
News, Wit, Verses, Songs, Novels, Musick,
Gaming, and all fine Diversion, is in their A∣partments,
they themselves being of the best
Quality and Fortune. So that to manage these
Gallantries, there is no sort of Female Arts
they are not practis'd in, no Intrigues they are
ignorant of, and no Management of which they
are not capable.</P>
<P>Of this happy Number was the Fair <HI>Miran∣da,</HI>
whose Parents being dead, and a vast E∣state
divided between herself, and a young
Sister (who liv'd with an unmarry'd old Un∣cle,
whose Estate afterwards was all divided
between 'em) put herself into this uninclos'd
Religious House; but her Beauty, which had
<PB N="7" REF="92"/>
all the Charms that ever Nature gave, became
the Envy of the whole <HI>Sisterhood.</HI> She was tall,
and admirably shap'd; she had a bright Hair,
and Hazle-Eyes, all full of Love and Sweet∣ness:
No Art cou'd make a Face so fair as hers
by a Nature, which every Feature adorn'd with
a Grace that Imagination cannot reach: Every
Look, every Motion charm'd, and her black
Dress shew'd the Lustre of her Face and Neck.
She had an Air, though gay as so much Youth
cou'd inspire, yet so modest, so nobly reserv'd,
without Formality, or Stiffness, that one who
look'd on her would have imagin'd her Soul
the Twin-Angel of her Body; and both toge∣ther,
made her appear something Divine. To
this she had a great deal of Wit, read much,
and retain'd all that serv'd her purpose. She
sung delicately, and danc'd well, and play'd
on the Lute to a Miracle. She spoke several
Languages naturally; for being Co-heiress to
so great a Fortune, she was bred with the nicest
Care, in all the finest Manners of Educati∣on;
and was now arriv'd to her Eighteenth
Year.</P>
<P>'Twere needless to tell you how great a
Noise the Fame of this young Beauty, with so
considerable a Fortune, made in the World;
I may say, the World, rather than consine
her Fame to the scanty Limits of a Town;
it reach'd to many others: And there was not
a Man of any Quality that came to <HI>Antwerp,</HI>
or pass'd through the City, but made it his Bu∣siness
to see the lovely <HI>Miranda,</HI> who was uni∣versally
ador'd: Her Youth and Beauty, her
<PB N="8" REF="93"/>
Shape and Majesty of Mien, and Air of
Greatness, charm'd all her Beholders; and
thousands of People were dying by her Eyes,
while she was vain enough to glory in her Con∣quest,
and make it her Business to wound.
She lov'd nothing so much as to behold sighing
Slaves at her Feet, of the greatest Quality;
and treated 'em all with an Affability that gave
'em Hope. Continual Musick as soon as it
was dark, and Songs of dying Lovers, were
sung under her Windows; and she might well
have made herself a great Fortune (if she had
not been so already) by the rich Presents that
were hourly made her; and every Body daily
expected when she wou'd make some one hap∣py,
by suffering herself to be conquer'd by
Love and Honour, by the Assiduities and Vows
of some one of her Adorers: But <HI>Miranda</HI> ac∣cepted
their Presents, heard their Vows with
pleasure, and willingly admitted all their soft
Addresses; but wou'd not yield her Heart, or
give away that lovely Person to the Possession
of one, who cou'd please itself with so many.
She was naturally Amorous, but extreamly In∣constant:
She lov'd one for his Wit, another
for his Face, a third for his Mein; but above
all, she admir'd Quality: Quality alone had the
Power to attack her entirely; yet not to one
Man, but that Vertue was still admir'd by her
in all; where-ever she found that, she lov'd,
or at least acted the Lover with such Art, that
(deceiving well) she fail'd not to compleat her
Conquest; and yet she never durst trust her
fickle Humour with Marriage; She knew the
<PB N="9" REF="93"/>
Strength of her own Heart, and that it cou'd
not suffer itself to be confin'd to one Man,
and wisely avoided those Inquietudes, and
that Uneasiness of Life she was sure to find in
that married Life, which wou'd, against her
Nature, oblige her to the Embraces of one,
whose Humour was, to love all the Young
and the Gay. But Love, who had hitherto
but play'd with her Heart, and given it naught
but pleasing wanton Wounds, such as afforded
only soft Joys, and not Pains, resolv'd, either
out of Revenge to those Numbers she had a∣bandon'd,
and who had sigh'd so long in vain;
or to try what Power he had upon so fickle a
Heart, sent an Arrow dipp'd in the most tor∣menting
Flames that rage in Hearts most sen∣sible.
He struck it home and deep, with all
the Malice of an angry God.</P>
<P>There was a Church belonging to the <HI>Cor∣deliers,</HI>
whither <HI>Miranda</HI> often repair'd to her
Devotion; and being there one Day, accom∣pany'd
with a young Sister of the Order, af∣ter
the Mass was ended, as 'tis the Custom,
some one of the Fathers goes about the Church
with a Box, for Contribution, or Charity-Money;
it happen'd that Day, that a young
Father, newly initiated, carried the Box a∣bout,
which, in his turn, he brought to <HI>Mi∣randa.</HI>
She had no sooner cast her Eyes on
this young Friar, but her Face was overspread
with Blushes of Surprize: She beheld him sted∣fastly,
and saw in his Face all the Charms of
Youth, Wit and Beauty; he wanted no one
Grace that cou'd form him for Love, he ap∣pear'd
<PB N="10" REF="94"/>
all that is adorable to the Fair Sex, nor
cou'd the mishapen Habit hide from her the
lovely Shape it endeavour'd to cover, nor those
delicate Hands that approach'd her too near
with the Box. Besides the Beauty of his Face
and Shape, he had an Air altogether great; in
spite of his profess'd Poverty, it betray'd the
Man of Quality; and that Thought weigh'd
greatly with <HI>Miranda.</HI> But Love, who did
not design she shou'd now feel any sort of those
easie Flames, with which she had heretofore
burnt, made her soon lay all those Considera∣tions
aside, which us'd to invite her to Love,
and now lov'd she knew not why.</P>
<P>She gaz'd upon him, while he bow'd before
her, and waited for her Charity, 'till she per∣ceiv'd
the lovely Friar to blush, and cast his
Eyes to the Ground. This awaken'd her Shame,
and she put her Hand into her Pocket, and was
a good while in searching for her Purse, as if
she thought of nothing less, than what she was
about; at last she drew it out, and gave him a
Pistole; but that with so much Deliberation
and Leisure, as easily betray'd the Satisfaction
she took in looking on him; while the good
Man, having receiv'd her Bounty, after a very
low Obeisance, proceeded to the rest; and
<HI>Miranda</HI> casting after him a Look all languish∣ing,
as long as he remain'd in the Church,
departed with a Sigh as soon as she saw him go
out, and return'd to her Apartment, without
speaking one Word all the Way to the young
<HI>Fille Devote,</HI> who attended her; so absolutely
was her Soul employ'd with this young holy
<PB N="11" REF="94"/>
Man. <HI>Cornelia</HI> (so was this Maid call'd who
was with her) perceiving she was so silent,
who us'd to be all Wit and good Humour, and
observing her little Disorder at the Sight of
the young Father, tho' she was far from imagi∣ning
it to be Love, took an Occasion, when she
was come home, to speak of him. <HI>Madam,</HI>
said she, <HI>did you not observe that fine young</HI> Corde∣delier,
<HI>who brought the Box?</HI> At a Qustion that
nam'd that Object of her Thoughts, <HI>Miranda</HI>
blush'd; and the finding she did so, redoubl'd
her Confusion, and she had scarce Courage
enough to say,—<HI>Yes, I did observe him:</HI>
And then, forcing herself to smile a little, con∣tinu'd;
<HI>And I wonder'd to see so jolly a young Friar
of an Order so severe, and mortify'd. Madam,</HI>
(reply'd <HI>Cornelia) when you know his Story, you
will not wonder. Miranda,</HI> who was impatient
to know all that concern'd her new Conqueror,
oblig'd her to tell his Story; and <HI>Cornelia</HI>
obey'd, and proceeded.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Story of Prince HENRICK.</HEAD>
<P><Q>YOU must know, Madam, that this
young holy Man is a Prince of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI>
of the House of—, whose Fate it
was, to fall most passionately in Love with a
fair young Lady, who lov'd him with an Ar∣dour
equal to what he vow'd her. Sure of her
Heart, and wanting only the Approbation
of her Parents, and his own, which her Qua∣lity
did not suffer him to despair of, he boast∣ed
<PB N="12" REF="95"/>
of his Happiness to a young Prince, his
elder Brother, a Youth amorous and fierce,
impatient of Joys, and sensible of Beauty,
taking Fire with all fair Eyes: He was his
Father's Darling, and Delight of his fond
Mother; and by an Ascendant over both
their Hearts, rul'd their Wills.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This young Prince no sooner saw, but
lov'd the fair Mistress of his Brother, and
with an Authority of a Sovereign, rather
than the Advice of a Friend, warn'd his
Brother <HI>Henrick</HI> (this now young Friar) to
approach no more this Lady, whom he had
seen; and seeing, lov'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In vain the poor surpriz'd Prince pleads
his Right of Love, his Exchange of Vows,
and Assurance of an Heart that cou'd never
be but for himself. In vain he urges his
Nearness of Blood, his Friendship, his Pas∣sion,
or his Life, which so entirely depended
on the Possession of the charming Maid. All
his Pleading serv'd but to blow his Brother's
Flame; and the more he implores, the more
the other burns; and while <HI>Henrick</HI> follows
him on his Knees, with humble Submissions,
the other flies from him in Rages of transpor∣ted
Love; nor cou'd his Tears, that pursu'd
his Brother's Steps, move him to Pity: Hot-headed,
vain-conceited of his Beauty, and
greater Quality, as elder Brother, he doubts
not his Success, and resolv'd to sacrifice all to
the Violence of his new-born Passion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In short, he speaks of his Design to his
Mother, who promis'd him her Assistance;
<PB N="13" REF="95"/>
and accordingly, proposing it first to the
Prince, her Husband, urging the Languish∣ment
of her Son, she soon wrought so on
him, that a Match being concluded between
the Parents of this young Beauty, and <HI>Hen∣rick</HI>'s
Brother, the Hour was appointed be∣fore
she knew of the Sacrifice she was to be
made. And while this was in Agitation,
<HI>Henrick</HI> was sent on some great Affairs, up
into <HI>Germany,</HI> far out of the way; not but
his boding Heart, with perpetual Sighs and
Throbs, eternally foretold him his Fate.</Q></P>
<P><Q>All the Letters he writ were intercepted,
as well as those she writ to him. She finds
herself every Day perplex'd with the Ad∣dresses
of the Prince she hated; he was
ever sighing at her Feet. In vain were all
her Reproaches, and all her Coldness, he was
on the surer side; for what he found Love
wou'd not do, Force of Parents wou'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>She complains, in her Heart, on young
<HI>Henrick,</HI> from whom she cou'd never receive
one Letter; and at last, cou'd not forbear
bursting into Tears, in spite of all her Force,
and feign'd Courage; when, on a Day, the
Prince told her, that <HI>Henrick</HI> was withdrawn,
to give him time to Court her; to whom, he
said, He confess'd he had made some Vows;
but did repent of 'em, knowing himself too
young to make 'em good: That it was for
that Reason he brought him first to see her;
and for that Reason, that after that, he never
saw her more, nor so much as took Leave of
her; (when, indeed, his Death lay upon the
<PB N="14" REF="96"/>
next Visit, his Brother having sworn to mur∣ther
him; and to that End, put a Guard up∣on
him, 'till he was sent into <HI>Germany.</HI>)</Q></P>
<P><Q>All this he utter'd with so many passionate
Asseverations, Vows, and seeming Pity for
her being so inhumanely abandon'd, that
she almost gave Credit to all he had said,
and had much adoe to keep herself within
the Bounds of Moderation, and silent Grief.
Her Heart was breaking, her Eyes languish'd,
and her Cheeks grew pale, and she had like
to have fallen dead into the treacherous Arms
of him that had reduc'd her to this Discove∣ry;
but she did what she cou'd to assume her
Courage, and to shew as little Resentment as
possible for a Heart, like hers, oppress'd with
Love, and now abandon'd by the dear Sub∣ject
of its Joys and Pains.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But, Madam, not to tire you with this
Adventure, the Day arriv'd wherein our still
weeping fair Unfortunate was to be sacrific'd
to the Capriciousness of Love; and she was
carry'd to Court by her Parents, without
knowing to what End, where she was almost
compell'd to marry the Prince.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Henrick,</HI> who, all this while, knew no more
of his Unhappiness, than what his Fears sug∣gested,
returns, and passes even to the Pre∣sence
of his Father, before he knew any
thing of his Fortune; where he beheld his
Mistress and his Brother, with his Father, in
such a Familiarity, as he no longer doubted
his Destiny. 'Tis hard to judge, whether the
Lady, or himself, was most surpriz'd; she
<PB N="15" REF="96"/>
was all pale and unmovable in her Chair, and
<HI>Henrick</HI> fix'd like a Statue; at last Grief and
Rage took place of Amazement, and he could
not forbear crying out, <HI>Ah, Traytor! Is it
thus you have treated a Friend and Brother? And
you, O perjur'd Charmer! Is it thus you have re∣warded
all my Vows?</HI> He cou'd say no more;
but reeling against the Door, had fall'n in a
Swoon upon the Floor, had not his Page
caught him in his Arms, who was entring
with him. The good old Prince, the Father,
who knew not what all this meant, was soon
inform'd by the young, weeping Princess;
who, in relating the Story of her Amour
with <HI>Henrick,</HI> told her Tale in so moving a
manner, as brought Tears to the Old Man's
Eyes, and Rage to those of her Husband;
he immediately grew jealous to the last De∣gree:
He finds himself in Possession ('tis
true) of the Beauty he ador'd; but the Beau∣ty
adoring another; a Prince, young, and
charming as the Light; soft, witty, and ra∣ging
with an equal Passion. He finds this
dreaded Rival in the same House with him,
with an Authority equal to his own; and
fancies, where two Hearts are so entirely a∣greed,
and have so good an Understanding,
it would not be impossible to find Opportu∣nities
to satisfie and ease that mutual Flame,
that burnt so equally in both; he therefore
resolv'd to send him out of the World, and
to establish his own Repose by a Deed, wic∣ked,
cruel, and unnatural, to have him assas∣sinated
the first Opportunity he cou'd find.
<PB N="16" REF="97"/>
This Resolution set him a little at ease, and
he strove to dissemble Kindness to <HI>Henrick,</HI>
with all the Art he was capable of, suffering
him to come often to the Apartment of the
Princess, and to entertain her oftentimes
with Discourse, when he was not near enough
to hear what he spoke; but still watching their
Eyes, he found those of <HI>Henrick</HI> full of Tears,
ready to flow, but restrain'd, looking all dy∣ing,
and yet reproaching, while those of the
Princess were ever bent to the Earth, and
she, as much as possible, shunning his Con∣versation.
Yet this did not satisfie the jea∣lous
Husband; 'twas not her Complaisance
that cou'd appease him; he found her Heart
was panting within, when ever <HI>Henrick</HI> ap∣proach'd
her, and every Visit more and more
confirm'd his Death▪</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Father often found the Disorders of
the Sons; the Softness and Address of the
one gave him as much Fear, as the angry
Blushings, the fierce Looks, and broken Re∣plies
of the other, when ever he beheld <HI>Hen∣rick</HI>
approach his Wife: So that the Father
fearing some ill Consequence of this, be∣sought
<HI>Henrick</HI> to withdraw to some other
Country, or travel into <HI>Italy,</HI> he being now
of an Age that requir'd a View of the World.
He told his Father, That he wou'd obey his
Commands, though he was certain, that Mo∣ment
he was to be separated from the sight
of the fair Princess, his Sister, wou'd be the
last of his Life; and, in fine, made so pitiful
a Story of his suffering Love, as almost mov'd
<PB N="17" REF="97"/>
the old Prince to compassionate him so far, as
to permit him to stay; but he saw inevitable
Danger in that, and therefore bid him pre∣pare
for his Journey.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That which pass'd between the Father and
<HI>Henrick,</HI> being a Secret, none talk'd of his
departing from Court; so that the Design the
Brother had, went on; and making an Hun∣ting-match
one Day, where most young
People of Quality were, he order'd some
whom he had hir'd to follow his Brother, so
as if he chanc'd to go out of the way, to
dispatch him; and accordingly, Fortune
gave 'em an Opportunity; for he lagg'd be∣hind
the Company, and turn'd aside into a
pleasant Thicket of Hazles; where alighting
he walk'd on Foot in the most pleasant part
of it, full of Thought, how to divide his
Soul between Love and Obedience. He was
sensible that he ought not to stay, that he
was but an Affliction to the young Princess,
whose Honour cou'd never permit her to
ease any part of his Flame; nor was he so
vicious, to entertain a Thought that shou'd
stain her Vertue. He beheld her now as his
Brother's Wife, and that secur'd his Flame
from all loose Desires, if her native Modesty
had not been sufficient of itself to have done
it, and that profound Respect he paid her:
And he consider'd, in obeying his Father,
he left her at Ease, and his Brother freed of
a thousand Fears; he went to seek a Cure,
which if he cou'd not find, at last he cou'd
but die; and so he must, even at her Feet:
<PB N="18" REF="98"/>
However, that 'twas more noble to seek a
Remedy for his Disease, than expect a cer∣tain
Death by staying. After a thousand Re∣flections
on his hard Fate, and bemoaning
himself, and blaming his cruel Stars, that
had doom'd him to die so young; after an
infinity of Sighs and Tears, Resolvings and
Unresolvings, he, on the sudden, was inter∣rupted
by the trampling of some Horses he
heard, and their rushing through the Boughs,
and saw four Men make towards him: He
had not time to mount, being walk'd some
Paces from his Horse. One of the Men ad∣vanc'd,
and cry'd, <HI>Prince you must die.—I
do believe thee</HI> (reply'd <HI>Henrick) but not by a
Hand so base as thine:</HI> And at the same time,
drawing his Sword, run him into the Groin.
When the Fellow found himself so wounded,
he wheel'd off, and cry'd, <HI>Thou art a Pro∣phet,
and hast rewarded my Treachery with
Death.</HI> The rest came up, and one shot at
the Prince, and shot him in the Shoulder;
the other two hastily laying hold (but too
late) on the Hand of the Murtherer, cry'd,
<HI>Hold, Traytor; we relent, and he shall not die.</HI>
He reply'd, <HI>'Tis too late, he is shot; and see, he
lies dead: Let us provide for our selves, and tell
the Prince, we have done the Work; for you are
as guilty as I am.</HI> At that, they all fled, and
left the Prince lying under a Tree, weltering
in his Blood.</Q></P>
<P><Q>About the Evening, the Forester going
his Walks, saw the Horse richly caparison'd,
without a Rider, at the Entrance of the
<PB N="19" REF="98"/>
Wood; and going farther, to see if he cou'd
find its Owner, found there the Prince al∣most
dead: He immediately mounts him on
the Horse, and himself behind, bore him
up, and carry'd him to the Lodge; where
he had only one old Man, his Father, well
skill'd in Surgery, and a Boy. They put him
to Bed, and the old Forester, with what
Art he had, dress'd his Wound, and in the
Morning sent for an abler Surgeon, to whom
the Prince enjoyn'd Secrecy, because he knew
him. The Man was faithful, and the Prince,
in time, was recover'd of his Wound; and
ae soon as he was well, he came for <HI>Flanders,</HI>
in the Habit of a Pilgrim, and after some
time, took the Order of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> none
knowing what became of him, 'till he was
profefs'd; and then he writ his own Story
to the Prince his Father, to his Mistress, and
his ungrateful Brother. The young Princess
did not long survive his Loss, she languish'd
from the Moment of his Departure; and he
had this to confirm his devout Life, to know
she dy'd for him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My Brother, Madam, was an Officer un∣der
the Prince, his Father, and knew his
Story perfectly well; from whose Mouth I
had it.</Q></P>
<P><HI>What!</HI> (reply'd <HI>Miranda</HI> then) <HI>is Father</HI>
Henrick <HI>a Man of Quality? Yes, Madam,</HI> (said
<HI>Cornelia,) and has chang'd his Name to</HI> Francisco.
But <HI>Miranda,</HI> fearing to betray the Sentiments
of her Heart, by asking any more Questions
<PB N="20" REF="99"/>
about him, turn'd the Discourse; and some
Persons of Quality came in to visit her (for
her Apartment was, about Six a-clock, like
the Presence-Chamber of a Queen, always
fill'd with the greatest People.) There meet
all the <HI>Beaux Espreets,</HI> and all the Beauties. But
it was visible <HI>Miranda</HI> was not so gay as she
us'd to be; but pensive, and answering <HI>Mal
a propo,</HI> to all that was said to her. She was a
thousand times going to speak, against her Will,
something of the charming Friar, who was ne∣ver
from her Thoughts; and she imagin'd, if
he could inspire Love in a course, grey, ill-made
Habit, a shorn Crown, a Hair-Cord a∣bout
his Waste, bare-leg'd, in Sandals instead
of Shooes, what must he do, when looking
back on Time, she beholds him in a Prospect
of Glory, with all that Youth, and Illustrious
Beauty, set off by the Advantage of Dress and
Equipage. She frames an Idea of him all gay,
and splendid, and looks on his present Habit as
some Disguise proper for the Stealths of Love;
some feign'd put-on Shape, with the more Se∣curity
to approach a Mistress, and make him∣self
happy; and that, the Robe laid by, she
has the Lover in his proper Beauty, the same
he wou'd have been, if any other Habit (tho'
never so rich) were put off: In the Bed, the
silent, gloomy Night, and the soft Embraces
of her Arms, he loses all the Friar, and assumes
all the Prince; and that awful Reverence, due
alone to his holy Habit, he exchanges for a
thousand Dalliances, for which his Youth was
made; for Love, for tender Embraces, and
<PB N="21" REF="99"/>
all the Happiness of Life. Some Moments she
fancies him a Lover, and that the fair Object
that takes up all his Heart, has left no room for
her there; but that was a Thought that did
not long perplex her, and which, almost as soon
as born, she turn'd to her Advantage: She be∣holds
him a Lover, and therefore finds he has
a Heart sensible and tender; he had Youth to
be fir'd, as well as to inspire; he was far from
the lov'd Object, and totally without Hope:
and she reasonably consider'd, that Flame
wou'd of itself soon die, that had only De∣spair
to feed on. She beheld her own Charms;
and Experience, as well as her Glass, told her,
they never fail'd of Conquest; especially
where they design'd it: And she believ'd <HI>Hen∣rick</HI>
would be glad, at least, to quench that
Flame in himself, by an Amour with her,
which was kindl'd by the young Princess of—his
Sister.</P>
<P>These, and a thousand other Self-flatteries,
all vain and indiscreet, took up her waking
Nights, and now more retir'd Days; while Love,
to make her truly wretched, suffer'd her to sooth
herself with fond Imaginations; not so much as
permitting her Reason to plead one Moment to
save her from Undoing: She wou'd not suffer
it to tell her, he had taken holy Orders, made
sacred and solemn Vows of everlasting Chastity,
that 'twas impossible he cou'd marry her, or lay
before her any Argument that might prevent
her Ruine; but Love, mad, malicious Love was
always call'd to Counsel, and, like easie Mo∣narchs,
she had no Ears, but for Flatterers.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="100"/>
Well then, she is resolv'd to love, without
considering to what End, and what must be
the Consequence of such an Amour. She now
miss'd no Day of being at that little Church,
where she had the Happiness, or rather, the
Misfortune (so Love ordain'd) to see this Ra∣visher
of her Heart and Soul; and every Day
she took new Fire from his lovely Eyes: Una∣wares,
unknown and unwillingly he gave her
Wounds, and the Difficulty of her Cure made
her Rage the more: She burnt, she languish'd,
and dy'd for the young Innocent, who knew
not he was the Author of so much Mischief.</P>
<P>Now she resolves a thousand Ways in her
tortur'd Mind, to let him know her Anguish, and
at last pitch'd upon that of writing to him soft
Billets, which she had learnt the Art of doing;
or if she had not, she had now Fire enough to
inspire her with all that cou'd charm and move.
These she deliver'd to a young Wench, who
waited on her, and whom she had entirely sub∣du'd
to her Interest, to give to a certain Lay-Brother
of the Order, who was a very simple,
harmless Wretch, and who serv'd in the Kitch∣en,
in the nature of a Cook in the Monastery of
<HI>Cordeliers:</HI> She gave him Gold to secure his
Faith and Service; and not knowing from
whence they came (with so good Credenti∣als)
he undertook to deliver the Letters to Fa∣ther
<HI>Francisco;</HI> which Letters were all after∣wards,
as you shall hear, produc'd in open
Court. These Letters fail'd not to come eve∣ry
Day; and the Sence of the first was, to tell
him that a very beautiful young Lady, of a

great Fortune, was in love with him, without
naming her; but it came as from a third Person,
to let him know the Secret, that she desir'd he
wou'd let her know whether she might hope
any Return from him; assuring him, he need∣ed
but only see the fair Languisher, to confess
himself her Slave.</P>
<P>This Letter being deliver'd him, he read
by himself, and was surpriz'd to receive
Words of this nature, being so great a Stran∣ger
in that place; and cou'd not imagine, or
wou'd not give himself the trouble of guessing
who this should be, because he never design'd
to make Returns.</P>
<P>The next Day <HI>Miranda,</HI> finding no Advan∣tage
from her Messenger of Love, in the Even∣ing
sends another (impatient of Delay) con∣fessing
that she who suffer'd the Shame of Wri∣ting
and Imploring, was the Person herself
who ador'd him. 'Twas there her raging Love
made her say all things that discover'd the na∣ture
of its Flame, and propose to flee with him
to any part of the World, if he wou'd quit
the Convent; that she had a Fortune conside∣rable
enough to make him happy, and that his
Youth and Quality were not given him to so
unprofitable an End as to lose themselves in a
Convent, where Poverty and Ease was all
their Business. In fine, she leaves nothing un∣urg'd
that might debauch and invite him; not
forgetting to send him her own Character of
Beauty, and left him to judge of her Wit and
Spirit by her Writing, and her Love by the
Extremity of Passion she profess'd. To all
<PB N="24" REF="101"/>
which, the lovely Friar made no Return, as
believing a gentle Capitulation or Exhortation
to her wou'd but inflame her the more, and
give new Occasions for her continuing to
write. All her Reasonings, false and vicious,
he despis'd, pities the Error of her Love, and
was Proof against all she could plead. Yet
notwithstanding his Silence, which left her in
doubt, and more tormented her, she ceas'd
not to pursue him with her Letters, varying
her Style; sometimes all wanton, loose and
raving; sometimes feigning a Virgin-modesty
all over, accusing herself, blaming her Con∣duct,
and siging her Destiny, as one com∣pell'd
to the shameful Discovery by the Auste∣rity
of his Vow and Habit, asking his Pity and
Forgiveness; urging him in Charity to use his
Fatherly Care to perswade and reason with her
wild Desires, and by his Councel drive the
God from her Heart, whose Tyranny was
worse than that of a Fiend; and he did not
know what his pious Advice might do. But
still she writes in vain, in vain she varies her
Style, by a Cunning, peculiar to a Maid pos∣sess'd
with such a sort of Passion.</P>
<P>This cold Neglect was still Oil to the burn∣ing
Lamp, and she tries yet more Arts, which
for want of right Thinking, were as fruitless.
She has recourse to Presents; her Letters came
loaded with Rings of great price, and Jewels,
which Fops of Quality had given her. Many
of this sort he receiv'd, before he knew where
to return 'em, or how; and on this Occasion
alone he sent her a Letter, and restor'd her
<PB N="25" REF="101"/>
Trifles, as he call'd 'em: But his Habit having
not made him forget his Quality and Educati∣on,
he writ to her with all the profound Re∣spect
imaginable; believing by her Presents,
and the Liberality with which we parted with
'em, that she was of Quality. But the whole
Letter, as he told me afterwards, was to per∣swade
her from the Honour she did him, by
loving him; urging a thousand Reasons, solid
and pious, and assuring her, he had wholly
devoted the rest of his Days to Heaven, and
had no need of those gay Trifles she had sent
him, which were only fit to adorn Ladies so
fair as herself, and who had business with this
glittering World, which he disdain'd, and had
for ever abandon'd. He sent her a thousand
Blessings, and told her, she shou'd be ever in
his Prayers, though not in his Heart, as she
desired: And abundance of Goodness more he
express'd, and Councel he gave her, which had
the same Effect with his Silence; it made her
Love but the more, and the more impatient
she grew: She now had a new Occasion to
write, she now is charm'd with his Wit; this
was the new Subject. She rallies his Resolution,
and endeavours to re-call him to the World,
by all the Arguments that Humane Invention
is capable of.</P>
<P>But when she had above four Months lan∣guish'd
thus in vain, not missing one Day,
wherein she went not to see him, without dis∣covering
herself to him; she resolv'd, as her
last Effort, to shew her Person, and see what
that, assisted by her Tears, and soft Words
<PB N="26" REF="102"/>
from her Mouth, cou'd do, to prevail upon
him.</P>
<P>It happen'd to be on the Eve of that Day
when she was to receive the Sacrament, that
she, covering herself with her Veil, came to
<HI>Vespers,</HI> purposing to make choice of the con∣quering
Friar for her Confessor.</P>
<P><HI>She approach'd him; and as she did so, she
trembl'd with Love: At last she cry'd,</HI> Father,
my Confessor is gone for some time from the Town,
and I am oblig'd to morrow to receive, and beg you
will be pleas'd to take my Confession.</P>
<P>He cou'd not refuse her; and let her into
the <HI>Sacriste,</HI> where there is a Confession-Chair,
in which he seated himself; and on one side of
him she kneel'd down, over against a little Al∣tar,
where the Priests Robes lie, on which was
plac'd some lighted Wax-Candles, that made
the little place very light and splendid, which
shone full upon <HI>Miranda.</HI></P>
<P>After the little Preparation usual in Confes∣sion,
she turn'd up her Veil, and discover'd to
his View the most wond'rous Object of Beau∣ty
he had ever seen, dress'd in all the Glory of
a young Bride; her Hair and Stomacher full of
Diamonds, that gave a Lustre all dazling to
her brighter Face and Eyes. He was surpriz'd
at her amazing Beauty, and question'd whe∣ther
he saw a Woman or an Angel at his Feet.
Her Hands, which were elevated, as if in Pray∣er,
seem'd to be form'd of polish'd Alabaster;
and he confess'd, he had never seen any thing
in Nature so perfect, and so admirable.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="102"/>
He had some pain to compose himself to
hear her Confession, and was oblig'd to turn
away his Eyes, that his Mind might not be
perplex'd with an Object so diverting; when
<HI>Miranda,</HI> opening the finest Mouth in the
World, and discovering new Charms, began
her Confession.</P>
<P>Holy Father (<HI>said she;</HI>) amongst the Number of
my vile Offences, that which afflicts me to the great∣est
Degree, is, that I am in Love: Not (<HI>conti∣nu'd
she</HI>) that I believe simple, and vertuous Love
a Sin, when 'tis plac'd on an Object proper and sui∣table;
but, my dear Father, (<HI>said she, and wept,</HI>)
I love with a Violence which cannot be contain'd
within the Bounds of Reason, Moderation, or Ver∣tue.
I love a Man whom I cannot possess without
a Crime, and a Man who cannot make me happy
without become perjur'd. Is he marry'd? (<HI>re∣ply'd
the Father.</HI>) No; (<HI>answer'd</HI> Miranda.
Are you so? (<HI>continu'd he.</HI>) Neither; (<HI>said she</HI>)
Is he too near ally'd to you? (<HI>said</HI> Francisco:) a
Brother, or Relation? Neither of these, (<HI>said she:</HI>)
He is unenjoy'd, unpromis'd; and so am I: Nothing
opposes our Happiness, or makes my Love a Vice,
but You:—'Tis you deny me Life: 'Tis you
that forbids my Flame: 'Tis you will have me die,
and seek my Remedy in my Grave, when I com∣plain
of Tortures, Wounds and Flames. O cruel
Charmer, 'tis for you I languish; and here, at your
Feet, implore that Pity which all my Addresses have
fail'd of procuring me.—</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="103"/>
With that, perceiving he was about to rise
from his Seat, she held him by his Habit, and
vow'd she wou'd in that posture follow him,
where-ever he flew from her. She elevated
her Voice so loud, he was afraid she might be
heard, and therefore suffer'd her to force him
into his Chair again; where being seated, he
began, in the most passionate Terms imagina∣ble,
to dissuade her; but finding she but the
more persisted in Eagerness of Passion, he us'd
all the tender Assurance that he cou'd force
from himself, that he wou'd have for her all
the Respect, Esteem and Friendship that he
was capable of paying; that he had a real
Compassion for her; and at last, she prevail'd
so far with him by her Sighs and Tears, as
to own he had a Tenderness for her, and that
he cou'd not behold so many Charms, with∣out
being sensibly touch'd by them, and find∣ing
all those Effects that a Maid so young and
fair causes in the Souls of Men of Youth
and Sense: But that, as he was assured, he
cou'd never be so happy to marry her, and as
certain he cou'd not grant any thing but ho∣nourable
Passion, he humbly besought her not
to expect more from him than such; and then
began to tell her how short Life was, and
transitory its Joys; how soon she wou'd grow
weary of Vice, and how often change to
find real Repose in it, but never arrive to it.
He made an End by new Assurance of his e∣ternal
Friendship, but utterly forbad her to
hope.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="103"/>
Behold her now deny'd, refus'd and defeat∣ed,
with all her pleading Youth, Beauty,
Tears, and Knees, imploring, as she lay, hold∣ing
fast his <HI>Scapular,</HI> and embracing his Feet.
What shall she do? She swells with Pride,
Love, Indignation and Desire, her burning
Heart is bursting with Despair, her Eyes grow
fierce, and from Grief, she rises to a Storm;
and in her Agony of Passion, which looks all
disdainful, haughty, and full of Rage, she be∣gan
to revile him, as the poorest of Animals:
Tells him, his Soul was dwindled to the Mean∣ness
of his Habit, and his Vows of Poverty
were suited to his degenerate Mind. <HI>And</HI>
(said she) <HI>since all my nobler Ways have fail'd
me; and that, for a little hypocritical Devotion,
you resolve to lose the greatest Blessings of Life, and
to sacrifice me to your Religious Pride and Vanity, I
will either force you to abandon that dull Dissimu∣lation;
or you shall die, to prove your Sanctity
real. Therefore answer me immediately, answer
my Flame, my raging Fire, which your Eyes have
kindled; or here, in this very Moment, I will ruine
thee; and make no Scruple of revenging the Pains
I suffer, by that which shall take away your Life
and Honour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The trembling young Man, who, all this
while, with extream Anguish of Mind, and
Fear of the dire Result, had listen'd to her
Ravings, full of Dread, demanded what she
wou'd have him do. When she reply'd,—</HI>
Do that which thy Youth and Beauty were ordain'd
to do:—This place is private, a Sacred Si∣lence
reigns here, and no one dares to pry into the
<PB N="30" REF="104"/>
Secrets of this holy Place: We are as secure from
Fears of Interruption▪ as in Desarts uninhabited, or
Caves forsaken by wild Beasts. The Tapers too shall
veil their Lights, and only that glimmering Lamp
shall be witness of our dear Stealths of Love—Come
to my Arms, my trembling, longing Arms;
and curse the Folly of thy Bigottry, that has made
thee so long lose a Blessing, for which so many Prin∣ces
sigh in vain.</P>
<P><HI>At these Words she rose from his Feet, and
snatching him in her Arms, he cou'd not de∣fend
himself from receiving a thousand Kisses
from the lovely Mouth of the charming Wan∣ton;
after which, she ran herself, and in an
instant put out the Candles. But he cry'd to
her,</HI> In vain, O too indiscreet Fair Onè; in vain
you put out the Light; for Heaven still has Eyes,
and will look down upon my broken Vows. I own
your Power, I own I have all the Sense in the World
of your charming Touches; I am frail Flesh and
Blood, but yet—yet—yet I can resist;
and I prefer my Vows to all your powerful Tempta∣tions.
—I will be deaf and blind, and guard
my Heart with Walls of Ice, and make you know,
that when the Flames of true Devotion are kindled
in a Heart, it puts out all other Fires; which are
as ineffectual, as Candles lighted in the Face of the
Sun.—Go, vain Wanton, and repent, and
mortifie that Blood which has so shamefully betray'd
thee, and which will one Day ruine both thy Soul
and Body.—</P>
<P>At these Words <HI>Miranda,</HI> more enrag'd, the
nearer she imagin'd herself to Happiness,
made no Reply; but throwing herself, in that
<PB N="31" REF="104"/>
instant, into the Confessing-Chair, and vio∣lently
pulling the young Friar into her Lap,
she elevated her Voice to such a degree, in cry∣ing
out, <HI>Help, help: A Rape: Help, help,</HI> that
she was heard all over the Church, which was
full of People at the Evening's Devotion;
who flock'd about the Door of the <HI>Sacristi;</HI>
which was shut with a Spring-lock on the in∣side,
but they durst not open the Door.</P>
<P>'Tis easily to be imagin'd, in what Conditi∣on
our young Friar was, at this last devilish
Stratagem of his wicked Mistress. He strove
to break from those Arms that held him so
fast; and his bustling to get away, and hers
to retain him, disorder'd her Hair and Habit
to such a degree, as gave the more Credit to
her false Accusation.</P>
<P><HI>The Fathers had a Door on the other side,
by which they usually enter'd, to dress in this
little Room; and at the Report that was in an
instant made 'em, they hasted thither, and
found</HI> Miranda <HI>and the good Father very in∣decently
strugling; which they mis-interpre∣ted,
as</HI> Miranda <HI>desir'd; who, all in Tears,
immediately threw herself at the Feet of the
Provincial, who was one of those that en∣ter'd;
and cry'd,</HI> O holy Father, revenge an in∣nocent
Maid, undone and lost to Fame and Honour,
by that vile Monster, born of Goats, nurs'd by Ty∣gers,
and bred up on savage Mountains, where
Humanity and Religion are Strangers. For, O
holy Father, cou'd it have enter'd into the Heart of
Man, to have done so barbarous and horrid a Deed,
as to attempt the Virgin-Honour of an unspotted
<PB N="32" REF="105"/>
Maid, and one of my Degree, even in the Moment
of my Confession, in that holy time, when I was
prostrate before him and Heaven, confessing thos
Sins that press'd my tender Conscience; even then
to load my Soul with the blackest of Infamies, to
add to my Number a Weight that must sink me to
Hell? Alas! under the Security of his innocent
Looks, his holy Habit, and his awful Function, I
was lead into this Room, to make my Confession;
where, he locking the Door, I had no sooner began,
but he gazing on me, took Fire at my fatal Beauty;
and starting up, put out the Candles, and caught
me in his Arms; and raising me from the Pave∣ment,
set me in the Confession-Chair; and then—Oh,
spare me the rest.</P>
<P>With that a Shower of Tears burst from
her fair dissembling Eyes, and Sobs so natural∣ly
acted, and so well manag'd, as left no
Doubt upon the good Men, but all she had
spoken was Truth.</P>
<P>—At first, (<HI>proceeded she,</HI>) I was un∣willing
to bring so great a Scandal on his Order,
as to cry out; but struggl'd as long as I had Breath,
pleaded the Heinousness of the Crime; urging my
Quality, and the Danger of the Attempt. But he,
deaf as the Winds, and ruffling as a Storm, pursu'd
his wild Design with so much Force and Insolence,
as I at last, unable to resist, was wholly vanquish'd,
robb'd of my native Purity: With what Life and
Breath I had, I call'd for Assistance, both from
Men and Heaven; but oh, alas! your Succours
come too late:—You find me here a wretched,
undone and ravish'd Maid. Revenge me, Fathers;
<PB N="33" REF="105"/>
revenge me on the perfidious Hypocrite, or else give
me a Dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h that may secure your Cruelty and Inju∣stice
from ever being proclaim'd o'er the World;
or my Tongue will be eternally reproaching you, and
cursing the wicked Author of my Infamy.</P>
<P>She ended as she began, with a thousand
Sighs and Tears; and receiv'd from the Pro∣vinciall
all Assurances of Revenge.</P>
<P>The innocent betray'd Victim, all this while
she was speaking, heard her with an Astonish∣ment
that may easily be imagin'd; yet shew'd
no extravagant Signs of it, as those wou'd do,
who feign it to be thought innocent, but be∣ing
really so, he bore, with an humble, modest,
and blushing Countenance, all her Accusati∣ons:
Which silent Shame they mistook for evi∣dent
Signs of his Guilt.</P>
<P><HI>When the Provincial demanded, with an
unwonted Severity in his Eyes and Voice, what
he cou'd answer for himself; calling him Pro∣phaner
of his sacred Vows, and Infamy to the
holy Order; the Injur'd, but the innocently
Accus'd, only reply'd,</HI> May Heaven forgive that
bad Woman, and bring her to Repentance: For his
part, he was not so much in love with Life, as to
use many Arguments to justifie his Innocence; unless
it were to free that <HI>Order</HI> from a Scandal, of
which he had the Honour to be profess'd: But as for
himself, Life or Death were things indifferent to him,
who heartily despis'd the World.</P>
<P>He said no more, and suffer'd himself to be
led before the Magistrate; who committed
him to Prison, upon the Accusation of this im∣placable
<PB N="34" REF="106"/>
Beauty; who, with so much feign'd
Sorrow, prosecuted the Matter, even to his
Tryal and Condemnation; where he refus'd
to make any great Defence for himself. But
being daily visited by all the Religious, both of
his own, and other Orders, they oblig'd him
(some of 'em knowing the Austerity of his
Life, others his Cause of Griefs that first
brought him into Orders, and others pretend∣ing
a nearer Knowledge, even of his Soul it
self) to stand upon his Justification, and dis∣cover
what he knew of that wicked Woman;
whose Life had not been so exemplary for
Vertue, not to have given the World a thou∣sand
Suspicions of her Lewdness and Prosti∣tutions.</P>
<P>The daily Importunities of these Fathers
made him produce her Letters: But as he had
all the Gown-Men on his side, she had all the
Hats and Feathers on hers; all the Men of
Quality taking her part, and all the Church-men
his. They heard his daily Protestations and
Vows, but not a Word of what passed at Con∣fession
was yet discover'd: He held that as a
Secret sacred on his part; and what was said
in nature of a Confession, was not to be re∣veal'd,
though his Life depended on the Dis∣covery.
But as to the Letters, they were
forc'd from him, and exposs'd; however,
Matters were carry'd with so high a Hand a∣gainst
him, that they serv'd for no Proof at
all of his Innocence, and he was at last con∣demn'd
to be burn'd at the Market-place.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="106"/>
After his Sentence was pass'd, the whole Bo∣dy
of Priests made their Addresses to Marquess
<HI>Casteil Roderigo,</HI> the then Governour of <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI>
for a Reprieve; which, after much a-do,
was granted him for some Weeks, but with an
absolute Denial of Pardon; so prevailing were
the young Cavaliers of his Court, who were
all Adorers of this Fair <HI>Jilt.</HI></P>
<P>About this time, while the poor, innocent,
young <HI>Henrick</HI> was thus languishing in Prison,
in a dark and dismal Dungeon, and <HI>Miranda,</HI>
cured of her Love, was triumphing in her Re∣venge,
expecting, and daily giving new Con∣quests;
and who, by this time, had re-assum'd
all her wonted Gaiety, there was great Noise
about the Town, that a Prince of mighty
Name, and fam'd for all the Excellencies of
his Sex, was arrived; a Prince young, and glo∣riously
attended, call'd Prince <HI>Tarquin.</HI></P>
<P>We had often heard of this Great Man, and
that he was making his Travels in <HI>France</HI> and
<HI>Germany:</HI> And we had also heard, that some
Years before, he being about Eighteen Years
of Age, in the time when our King <HI>Charles</HI> of
Blessed Memory was in <HI>Bruxels,</HI> in the last
Year of his Banishment, that all on a sudden,
this young Man rose up upon 'em like the Sun,
all glorious and dazling, demanding Place of
all the Princes in that Court. And when his
Pretence was demanded, he own'd himself
Prince <HI>Tarquin,</HI> of the Race of the last Kings
of <HI>Rome,</HI> made good his Title, and took his
Place accordingly. After that, he travell'd
for about six Years up and down the World,
<PB N="36" REF="107"/>
and then arriv'd at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> about the time of
my being sent thither by His late Majesty.</P>
<P>Perhaps there could be nothing seen so
magnificent as this Prince: He was, as I said,
extreamly handsome, from Head to Foot ex∣actly
form'd, and he wanted nothing that
might adorn that native Beauty to the best Ad∣vantage.
His Parts were suitable to the rest:
He had an Accomplishment fit for a Prince,
an Air haughty, but a Carriage affable, easie
in Conversation, and very Entertaining, Li∣beral
and Good-natur'd, Brave and Inoffen∣sive.
I have seen him pass the Streets with
twelve Foot-men, and four Pages; the Pages
all in green Velvet Coats, lac'd with Gold,
and white Velvet Trunks; the Men in Cloth,
richly lac'd with Gold; his Coaches, and all
other Officers, suitable to a Great Man.</P>
<P>He was all the Discourse of the Town;
some laughing at his Title, others reverencing
it: Some cry'd, that he was an Impostor;
others, that he had made his Title as plain, as
if <HI>Tarquin</HI> had reign'd but a Year ago. Some
made Friendships with him, others wou'd
have nothing to say to him; but all wonder'd
where this Revenue was, that supported this
Grandeur; and believ'd, though he cou'd
make his Descent from the <HI>Roman</HI> Kings very
well out, that he cou'd not lay so good a Claim
to the <HI>Roman</HI> Land. Thus every Body med∣led
with what they had nothing to do; and,
as in other places, thought themselves on the
surer side, if, in these doubtful Cases, they
imagin'd the worst.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="107"/>
But the Men might be of what Opinion
they pleas'd concerning him; the Ladies were
all agreed that he was a Prince, and a young,
handsome Prince, and a Prince not to be re∣sisted:
He had all their Wishes, all their Eyes,
and all their Hearts: They now dress'd only
for him; and what Church he grac'd, was
sure, that Day, to have the Beauties, and all
that thought themselves so.</P>
<P>You may believe, our amorous <HI>Miranda</HI>
was not the last Conquest he made. She no
sooner heard of him, which was as soon as he
arriv'd, but she fell in love with his very Name.
<HI>Jesu!</HI>—A young King of <HI>Rome!</HI> Oh, 'twas so
novel, that she doated on the Title; and had
not car'd whether the rest had been Man or
Monkey almost: She was resolv'd to be the
<HI>Lucretia,</HI> that this young <HI>Tarquin</HI> shou'd ravish.</P>
<P>To this End, she was no sooner up the
next Day, but she sent him a <HI>Billet Deaux,</HI>
assuring him how much she admir'd his Fame;
and that being a Stranger in the Town, she
begg'd the Honour of introducing him to all
the <HI>Belle</HI>-Conversations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which he took
for the Invitation of some <HI>Coquet,</HI> who had
Interest in fair Ladies; and civilly return'd
her an Answer, that he wou'd wait on her.
She had him that Day watch'd to Church;
and impatient to see what she heard so many
People flock to see, she went also to the same
Church; those sanctified Abodes being too
often prophan'd by such <HI>Devotees,</HI> whose Busi∣ness
is to ogle and ensnare.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="108"/>
But what a Noise and Humming was heard
all over the Church, when <HI>Tarquin</HI> enter'd?
His Grace, his Mien, his Fashion, his Beauty,
his Dress, and his Equipage surpriz'd all
that were present: And by the good Ma∣nagement
and Care of <HI>Miranda,</HI> she got to
kneel at the side of the Altar, just over against
the Prince; so that, if he wou'd, he cou'd not
avoid looking full upon her. She had turn'd
up her Veil, and all her Face and Shape ap∣pear'd
such, and so inchanting, as I have de∣scrib'd:
And her Beauty heighten'd with
Blushes, and her Eyes full of Spirit and Fire,
with Joy, to find the young <HI>Roman</HI> Monarch so
charming, she appear'd like something more
than mortal, and compell'd his Eyes to a fix'd
Gazing on her Face: She never glanc'd that
way, but she met 'em; and then would feign
so modest a Shame, and Cast her Eyes down∣ward
with such inviting Art, that he was wholly
ravish'd and charm'd, and she over-joy'd to
find he was so.</P>
<P>The Ceremony being ended, he sent a
Page to follow that Lady home, himself pur∣suing
her to the Door of the Church; where he
took some Holy Water, and threw upon her, and
made her a profound Reverence. She forc'd
an innocent Look, and a modest Gratitude in
her Face, and bow'd, and pass'd forward, half
assur'd of her Conquest; leaving him to go
home to his Lodging, and impatiently wait
the Return of his Page. And all the Ladies
who saw this first Beginning between the
Prince and <HI>Miranda,</HI> began to curse and envy
<PB N="39" REF="108"/>
her Charms, who had depriv'd 'em of half their
Hopes.</P>
<P>After this, I need not tell you, he made
<HI>Miranda</HI> a Visit; and from that Day, never
left her Apartment, but when he went home at
Nights, or unless he had Business; so en∣tirely
was he conquer'd by this Fair One. But
the Bishop, and several Men of Quality, in
Orders, that profess'd Friendship to him, ad∣vis'd
him from her Company; and spoke se∣veral
things to him, that might (if Love had
not made him blind) have reclaim'd him from
the Pursuit of his Ruin. But whatever they
trusted him with, she had the Art to wind
herself about his Heart, and make him un∣ravel
all his Secrets; and then knew as well,
by feign'd Sighs and Tears, to make him dis∣believe
all. So that he had no Faith, but for
her; and was wholly inchanted and bewitched
by her. At last, in spight of all that wou'd
have oppos'd it, he marry'd this famous Wo∣man,
possess'd by so many Great Men and
Strangers before, while all the World was pi∣tying
his Shame and Misfortunes.</P>
<P>Being marry'd, they took a great House;
and as she was indeed a great Fortune, and
now a great Princess, there was nothing want∣ing
that was agreeable to their Quality; all
was splendid and magnificent. But all this
would not acquire 'em the World's Esteem;
they had an Abhorrence for her former Life,
despis'd her; and for his espousing a Woman
so infamous, they despis'd him. So that tho'
they admir'd, and gaz'd upon their Equipage,
<PB N="40" REF="109"/>
and glorious Dress, they foresaw the Ruin that
attended it; and paid her Quality little Re∣spect.</P>
<P>She was no sooner marri'd, but her Uncle
dy'd; and dividing his Fortune between <HI>Mi∣randa,</HI>
and her Sister, and leaves the young Hei∣ress,
and all her Fortune, entirely in the Hands
of the Princess.</P>
<P>We will call this Sister <HI>Alcidiana;</HI> she was
about Fourteen Years of Age, and now had
chosen her Brother, the Prince, for her Guar∣dian.
If <HI>Alcidiana</HI> were not altogether so
great a Beauty as her Sister, she had Charms
sufficient to procure her a great many Lovers,
though her Fortune had not been so conside∣rable
as it was; but with that Addition, you
may believe, she wanted no Courtships from
those of the best Quality; though every Body
deplor'd her being under the Tutorage of a
Lady so expert in all the Vices of her Sex, and
so cunning a Manager of Sin as was the Princess;
who, on her part, fail'd not, by all the Caresses,
and obliging Endearments, to engage the Mind
of this young Maid, and to subdue her wholly
to her Government. All her Senses were eter∣nally
regal'd with the most bewitching Plea∣sures
they were capable of: She saw nothing
but Glory and Magnificence, heard nothing but
Musick of the sweetest Sounds; the richest Per∣fumes
employ'd her Smelling, and all she eat
and touch'd was delicate and inviting; and be∣ing
too young to consider, how this State and
Grandeur was to be continu'd, little imagin'd
her vast Fortune was every Day diminishing, to∣wards
its needless Support.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="109"/>
When the Princess went to Church, she
had her Gentleman bare before her, carrying
a great Velvet Cushion, with great Golden
Tassels, for her to kneel on, and her Train
born up a most prodigious length; led by a
Gentleman-Usher, bare; follow'd by innu∣merable
Footmen, Pages, and Women. And
in this State she wou'd walk in the Streets, as
in those Countries 'tis the Fashion for the great
Ladies to do, who are well; and in her Train
two or three Coaches, and perhaps a rich Vel∣vet
Chair embroider'd, wou'd follow in State.</P>
<P>'Twas thus for some time they liv'd, and the
Princess was daily press'd by young sighing Lo∣vers,
for her Consent to marry <HI>Alcidiana;</HI> but
she had still one Art or other to put 'em off,
and so continually broke all the great Matches
that were propos'd to her, notwithstanding
their Kindred, and other Friends, had indu∣striously
endeavour'd to make several great
Matches for her; but the Princess was still po∣sitive
in her Denial, and one way or other
broke all. At last it happen'd, there was one
propos'd yet more advantageous; a young
Count, with whom the young Maid grew
passionately in Love, and besought her Sister to
consent that she might have him, and got the
Prince to speak in her behalf; but he had no
sooner heard the secret Reasons <HI>Miranda</HI> gave
him, but (entirely her Slave) he chang'd his
Mind, and suited it to hers, and she, as before,
broke off that Amour; which so extreamly
incens'd <HI>Alcidiana,</HI> that she, taking an Oppor∣tunity,
got from her Guard, and ran away,
<PB N="42" REF="110"/>
putting herself into the Hands of a wealthy
Merchant, her Kinsman, and one who bore the
greatest Authority in the City; him she chuses
for her Guardian, resolving to be no longer a
Slave to the Tyranny of her Sister. And so
well she ordered Matters, that she writ to this
young Cavalier, her last Lover, and retrieved
him; who came back to <HI>Antwerp</HI> again, to re∣new
his Courtship.</P>
<P>Both Parties being agreed, it was no hard
Matter to perswade all but the Princess. But
though she opposed it, it was resolved on, and
the Day appointed for Marriage, and the
Portion demanded; demanded only, but ne∣ver
to be payed, the best part of it being
spent. However, she put 'em off from Day
to Day, by a thousand frivolous Delays: And
when she saw they would have recourse to
Force, and that all her Magnificence would be
at an End, if the Law should prevail against
her; and that, without this Sister's Fortune,
she could not long support her Grandeur, she
bethought herself of a Means to make it all
her own, by getting her Sister made away;
but she being out of her Tuition, she was
not able to accomplish so great a Deed of
Darkness: But since 'twas resolv'd it must
be done, she revolves on a Thousand Strata∣gems;
and, at last, pitches upon an effectual
one.</P>
<P>She had a Page, called <HI>Van Brune;</HI> a Youth
of great Address and Wit, and one she had
long manag'd for her purpose. This Youth
was about Seventeen Years of Age, and ex∣treamly
<PB N="43" REF="110"/>
beautiful; and in the time when <HI>Alci∣diana</HI>
lived with the Princess, she was a little
in Love with this handsome Boy; but 'twas
check'd in its Infancy, and never grew up to a
Flame: Nevertheless, <HI>Alcidiana</HI> retain'd still a
sort of Tenderness for him, while he burned in
good Earnest with Love for the Princess.</P>
<P>The Princess one Day ordering this Page to
wait on her in her Closet, she shut the Door;
and after a Thousand Questions of what he
would undertake to serve her, the amorous
Boy finding himself alone, and caress'd by
the fair Person he ador'd, with joyful Blushes
that beautify'd his Face, told her, <HI>There was
nothing upon Earth, he wou'd not do, to obey her
least Commands.</HI> She grew more familiar with
him, to oblige him; and seeing Love dance
in his Eyes, of which she was so good a Judge,
she treated him more like a Lover, than a
Servant; till at last the ravish'd Youth, wholly
transported out of himself, fell at her Feet,
and impatiently implor'd to receive her Com∣mands
quickly, that he might fly to execute
'em; for he was not able to bear her charm∣ing
Words, Looks, and Touches, and retain
his Duty. At this she smil'd, and told him,
the Work was of such a Nature, as wou'd mor∣tifie
all Flames about him; and he would
have more need of Rage, Envy, and Malice,
than the Aids of a Passion so soft as what she
now found him capable of. He assur'd her,
he would stick at nothing, though even a∣gainst
his Nature, to recompence for the
Boldness he now, through his Indiscretion
<PB N="44" REF="111"/>
had discovered. She smiling, told him, he
had committed no Fault; and that possibly,
the Pay he shou'd receive for the Service she
required at his Hands, should be—what he
most wish'd for in the World. To this he
bowed to the Earth; and kissing her Feet,
bad her Command. And then she boldly told
him, <HI>'Twas to kill her Sister</HI> Alcidiana. The
Youth, without so much as starting, or pau∣sing
upon the Matter, told her, <HI>It should be done;</HI>
and bowing low, immediately went out of the
Closet. She called him back, and would have
given him some Instruction; but he refus'd it,
and said, <HI>The Action, and the Contrivance should
be all his own.</HI> And offering to go again, she
—again recalled him; putting into his
Hand a Purse of a Hundred Pistoles, which
he took; and with a low Bow, departed.</P>
<P>He no sooner left her Presence, but he goes
directly and buys a Dose of Poyson, and
went immediately to the House where <HI>Al∣cidiana</HI>
lived; where desiring to be brought to
her Presence, he fell a weeping; and told her,
his Lady had fallen out with him, and dis∣missed
him her Service; and since, from a
Child, he had been brought up in the Family,
he humbly besought <HI>Alcidiana</HI> to receive him
into hers, she being in a few Days to be mar∣ried.
There needed not much intreaty to a
thing that pleased her so well, and she im∣mediately
received him to Pension. And he
waited some Days on her, before he could
get an Opportunity to administer his Devi∣lish
Potion: But one Night, when she drunk
<PB N="45" REF="111"/>
Wine with roasted Apples, which was usual
with her; instead of Sugar, or with the Su∣gar,
the baneful Drug was mixed, and she drank
it down.</P>
<P>About this time, there was a great Talk of
this Page's coming from one Sister, to go to
the other. And Prince <HI>Tarquin,</HI> who was
ignorant of the Design, from the Beginning
to the End, hearing some Men of Quality at
his Table speaking of <HI>Van Brune</HI>'s Change
of Place (the Princess then keeping her Cham∣ber
upon some trifling Indisposition) he an∣swered,
<HI>That surely they were mistaken, that he was
not dismissed from the Princess's Service.</HI> And
calling some of his Servants, he asked for <HI>Van
Brune;</HI> and whether any thing had happened
between Her Highness and him, that had oc∣casioned
his being turned off. They also seem∣ed
ignorant of this Matter; and those who
had spoken of it, began to fancy there was some
Juggle in the Case, which Time would bring
to Light.</P>
<P>The ensuing Day 'twas all about the Town,
that <HI>Alcidiana</HI> was Poysoned; and though not
dead, yet very near it; and that the Doctors
said, she had taken Mercury. So that there
was never so formidable a Sight as this Fair
young Creature; her Head and Body swol∣len,
her Eyes starting out, her Face black, and
all deformed: So that diligent Search was
made, who it should be that did this; who
gave her Drink and Meat. The Cook and
Butler were examined, the Footmen called to
an Account; but all concluded, she received
<PB N="46" REF="112"/>
nothing, but from the Hand of her new Page,
since he came into her Service. He was exa∣mined,
and shewed a thousand guilty Looks:
And the Apothecary, then attending among
the Doctors, proved he had bought Mercury
of him three or four Days before; which he
could not deny; and making many Excuses for
his buying it, betrayed him the more; so ill
he chanced to dissemble. He was immediate∣ly
sent to be examined by the Margrave or Ju∣stice,
who made his <HI>Mittimus,</HI> and sent him to
Prison.</P>
<P>'Tis easie to imagine, in what Fears and Con∣fusion
the Princess was at this News: She took
her Chamber upon it, more to hide her guilty
Face, than for any Indisposition. And the Do∣ctors
applied such Remedies to <HI>Alcidiana,</HI> such
Antidotes against the Poison, that in a short
time she recovered; but lost the finest Hair in
the World, and the Complexion of her Face
ever after.</P>
<P>It was not long before the Trials for Cri∣minals
came on; and the Day being arrived,
<HI>Van Brune</HI> was tried the first of all; every
Body having already read his Destiny, accord∣ing
as they wish'd it; and none would believe,
but just indeed as it was: So that for the Re∣venge
they hoped to see fall upon the Princess,
every one wished he might find no Mercy, that
she might share of his Shame and Misery.</P>
<P>The Sessions-House was filled that Day with
all the Ladies, and Chief of the Town, to hear
the Result of his Trial; and the sad Youth
was brought loaden with Chains, and pale as
<PB N="47" REF="112"/>
Death; where every Circumstance being suffi∣ciently
proved against him, and he making but
a weak Defence for himself, he was Convicted,
and sent back to Prison, to receive his Sentence
of Death on the Morrow; where he owned all,
and who set him on to do it. He own'd 'twas
not Reward of Gain he did it for, but Hope he
should command at his Pleasure, the Possession
of his Mistress, the Princess; who should de∣ny
him nothing, after having intrusted him
with so great a Secret; and that besides, she
had elevated him with the Promise of that glo∣rious
Reward, and had dazl'd his young Heart
with so charming a Prospect, that blind and
mad with Joy, he rushed forward, to gain the
desired Prize, and thought on nothing but his
coming Happiness: That he saw too late the
Follies of his presumptuous Flame, and cursed
the deluding Flatteries of the fair Hypocrite,
who had soothed him to his Undoing: That he
was a miserable Victim to her Wickedness;
and hoped, he should warn all young Men, by
his Fall, to avoid the Dissimulation of the de∣ceiving
Fair: That he hoped, they would have
Pity on his Youth, and attribute his Crime to
the subtile Persuasions alone of his Mistress, the
Princess: And that since <HI>Alcidiana</HI> was not
dead, they would grant him Mercy, and permit
him to live to repent of his grievous Crime, in
some Part of the World, whither they might
banish him.</P>
<P>He ended with Tears, that fell in abundance
from his Eyes; and immediately the Princess
was apprehended, and brought to Prison, to
<PB N="48" REF="113"/>
the same Prison, where yet the poor young Fa∣ther
<HI>Francisco</HI> was languishing, he having been
from Week to Week reprieved, by the Inter∣cession
of the Fathers; and possibly she there
had time to make some Reflections.</P>
<P>You may imagine <HI>Tarquin</HI> left no means un∣essaied,
to prevent the Imprisonment of the
Princess, and the Publick Shame and Infamy
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e was likely to undergo in this Affair: But
the whole City being over-joyed that she should
be punish'd, as an Author of all this Mischief,
were so generally bent against her, both Priests,
Magistrates, and People; the whole Force of
the Stream running that way, she found no
more Favour than the meanest Criminal. The
Prince therefore, when he saw 'twas impossible
to rescue her from the Hands of Justice, suf∣fered
with Grief unspeakable, what he could
not prevent; and led her himself to the Prison,
followed by all his People, in as much State,
as if he had been going to his Marriage;
where, when she came, she was as well attend∣ed
and served as before, he never stirring one
Moment from her.</P>
<P>The next Day she was tried in open and
common Court; where she appeared in Glory,
led by <HI>Tarquin,</HI> and attended according to her
Quality: And she could not deny all the Page
had alledged against her, who was brought
thither also in Chains; and after a great many
Circumstances, she was found Guilty, and both
received Sentence; the Page to be hanged 'till
he was dead, on a Gibbet, in the Market-place;
and the Princess to stand under the Gibbet,
<PB N="49" REF="113"/>
with a Rope about her Neck, the other end of
which was to be fastned to the Gibbet where
the Page was hanging; and to have an In∣scription,
in large Characters, upon her Back
and Breast, of the Cause why: Where she
was to stand from Ten in the Morning, to
Twelve.</P>
<P>This Sentence, the People, with one accord,
believed too favourable for so ill a Woman,
whose Crimes deserved Death, equal to that
of <HI>Van Brune:</HI> Nevertheless, there were some
who said, it was infinitely more severe than
Death itself.</P>
<P>The following <HI>Friday</HI> was the Day of Exe∣cution,
and one need not tell of the abundance
of People, who were flocked together in the
Market-place: And all the Windows were ta∣ken
down, and filled with Spectators, and the
Tops of Houses; when at the Hour appoint∣ed,
the fatal Beauty appeared. She was dress'd
in a black Velvet Gown, with a rich Row of
Diamonds all down the fore-part of her Breast,
and a great Knot of Diamonds at the Peak be∣hind;
and a Petticoat of flowered Gold, very
rich, and laced; with all Things else suitable:
A Gentleman carried her great Velvet Cushion
before her, on which her Prayer-Book, em∣broidered,
was laid; her Train was born up
by a Page, and the Prince led her, bare; fol∣lowed
by his Foot-men, Pages, and other Of∣ficers
of his House.</P>
<P>When they arrived to the Place of Executi∣on,
the Cushion was laid on the Ground, upon
a <HI>Portugal</HI>-Mat, spread there for that purpose;
<PB N="50" REF="114"/>
and the Princess stood on the Cushion, with
her Prayer-Book in her Hand, and a Priest by
her side; and was accordingly tied up to the
Gibbet.</P>
<P>She had not stood there ten Minutes, but she
had the Mortification, (at least, one would
think it so to her) to see her sad Page, <HI>Van
Brune,</HI> approach; fair as an Angel, but lan∣guishing
and pale. That Sight moved all the
Beholders with as much Pity, as that of the
Princess did Disdain and Pleasure.</P>
<P>He was dressed all in Mourning, and very fine
Linnen; bare-headed, with his own Hair, the
fairest that could be seen, hanging all in Curls
on his Back and Shoulders, very long. He
had a Prayer-Book of black Velvet in his Hand,
and behaved himself with much Penitence and
Devotion.</P>
<P>When he came under the Gibbet, he seeing
his Mistress in that Condition, shewed an infi∣nite
Concern, and his fair Face was covered
over with Blushes; and falling at her Feet, he
humbly ask'd her Pardon, for having been the
Occasion of so great an Infamy to her, by a
weak Confession, which the Fears of Youth,
and Hopes of Life, had obliged him to make,
so greatly to her Dishonour; for indeed, he
had wanted that Manly Strength, to bear the
Efforts of dying as he ought, in Silence, rather
than of committing so great a Crime against
his Duty, and Honour itself; and that he could
not die in Peace, unless she would forgive him.
The Princess only nodded her Head, and cried,
<HI>I do.</HI>—</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="114"/>
And after having spoken a little to his Fa∣ther
Confessor, who was with him, he chear∣fully
mounted the Ladder; and in the sight of
the Princess, he was turned off, while a loud
Cry was heard through all the Market-place,
especially from the fair Sex; he hanging there
'till the time the Princess was to depart: And
then she was put into a rich embroidered Chair,
and carried away; <HI>Tarquin</HI> going into his; for
he had all that time stood supporting the Prin∣cess
under the Gallows, and was very weary.
She was sent back, 'till her Releasement came;
which was that Night, about Seven of the
Clock; and then she was conducted to her own
House in great State, with a Dozen White
Wax-flambeaus about her Chair.</P>
<P>If the Affairs of <HI>Alcidiana,</HI> and her Friends,
before were impatient of having the Portion
out of the Hands of these Extravagants, 'tis
not to be imagined, but they were now much
more so; and the next Day they sent an Officer,
according to Law, to demand it; or to sum∣mon
the Prince to give Reasons, why he would
not. And the Officer received for Answer,
That the Money should be called in, and paid
in such a time; setting a certain Time, which
I have not been so curious as to retain, or put
in my Journal Observations; but I am sure it
was not long, as may be easily imagin'd; for
they every Moment, suspected the Prince wou'd
pack up, and be gone some time, or other, on
the sudden; and for that Reason they would
not trust him without Bail, or two Officers to
remain in his House, to watch that nothing
<PB N="52" REF="115"/>
should be removed, or touched. As for Bail,
or Security, he could give none; every one
slunk their Heads out of the Collar, when it
came to that: So that he was obliged, at his
own Expence, to maintain Officers in his
House.</P>
<P>The Princess finding herself reduced to the
last Extremity, and that she must either pro∣duce
the Value of a Hundred thousand Crowns,
or see the Prince, her Husband, lodged for
ever in a Prison, and all their Glory vanish;
and that it was impossible to fly, since guard∣ed;
she had recourse to an Extremity, worse
than the Affair of <HI>Van Brune.</HI> And in order to
this, she first puts on a World of Sorrow and
Concern, for what she feared might arrive to
the Prince: And indeed, if ever she shed Tears
which she did not dissemble, it was upon this
Occasion. But here she almost over-acted:
She stirred not from her Bed, and refused to
Eat, or Sleep, or see the Light; so that the
Day being shut out of her Chamber, she lived
by Wax-Lights, and refused all Comfort and
Consolation.</P>
<P>The Prince, all raving with Love, tender
Compassion, and Grief, never stirred from her
Bed-side, nor ceased to implore, that she would
suffer herself to live. But she, who was not
now so passionately in Love with <HI>Tarquin,</HI> as
she was with the Prince; not so fond of the
Man, as his Titles, and of Glory, foresaw the
total Ruin of the last, if not prevented, by a∣voiding
the Payment of this great Sum; which
could no otherwise be, than by the Death of
<PB N="53" REF="115"/>
<HI>Alcidiana:</HI> And therefore, without ceasing, she
wept, and cried out, <HI>She could not live, unless</HI>
Alcidiana <HI>dy'd. This</HI> Alcidiana, (continued
she) <HI>who has been the Author of my Shame; who
has exposed me under a Gibbet, in the publick
Market-place—Oh!—I am deaf to all
Reason, blind to Natural Affection. I renounce her,
I hate her as my Mortal Foe, my Stop to Glory, and
the Finisher of my Days, e'er half my Race of Life
be run.</HI></P>
<P>Then throwing her false, but showy, charm∣ing
Arms, about the Neck of her Heart-breaking
Lord, and Lover, who lay sighing,
and listening by her Side, he was charmed
and bewitched into saying all Things that ap∣peased
her: And lastly, told her, Alcidiana
<HI>should be no longer an Obstacle to her Repose; but
that, if she would look up, and cast her Eyes of
Sweetness and Love upon him, as heretofore; for∣get
her Sorrow, and redeem her lost Health, he
would take what Measures she should propose, to
dispatch this fatal Stop to her Happiness, out of the
way.</HI></P>
<P>These Words fail'd not to make her caress
him in the most endearing Manner, that Love
and Flattery could invent; and she kissed him
to an Oath, a solemn Oath, to perform what
he had promised; and he vowed liberally. And
she assumed in an instant, her Good Humour,
and suffered a Supper to be prepared, and did
eat; which, in many Days before she had not
done; so obstinate and powerful was she in
Dissembling well.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="116"/>
The next Thing to be considered was, which
Way this Deed was to be done; for they doubt∣ed
not, but when 'twas done, all the World
would lay it upon the Princess, as done by her
Command: But she urged, Suspicion was no
Proof; and that they never put to Death any
one, but when they had great and certain Evi∣dences,
who were the Offenders. She was
sure of her own Constancy, that Racks and
Tortures should never get the Secret from her
Breast; and if he were as confident on his
part, there was no Danger. Yet this Prepa∣ration
she made, towards the laying the Fact
on others, that she caused several Letters to be
written from <HI>Germany,</HI> as from the Relations
of <HI>Van Brune,</HI> who threatned <HI>Alcidiana</HI> with
Death, for depriving their Kinsman (who was
a Gentleman) of his Life, tho' he had not ta∣ken
away hers. And it was the Report of the
Town, how this young Maid was threatned.
And indeed, the Death of the Page had so
afflicted a great many, that <HI>Alcidiana</HI> had pro∣cured
herself abundance of Enemies upon that
Account, because she might have saved him if
she had pleased; but on the contrary, she was
a Spectator, and in full Health and Vigour, at
his Execution: And People were not so much
concerned for her at this Report, as they would
have been.</P>
<P>The Prince, who now had, by reasoning the
Matter soberly with <HI>Miranda,</HI> found it abso∣lutely
necessary to dispatch <HI>Alcidiana;</HI> he resol∣ved
himself, and with his own Hand, to exe∣cute
it; not daring to trust to any of his most
<PB N="55" REF="116"/>
Favourite Servants, tho' he had many, who,
possibly, would have obeyed him; for they
loved him as he deserved; and so would all the
World, had he not been so purely deluded by
this fair Enchantress. He therefore, as I said,
resolved to keep this great Secret to himself;
and taking a Pistol, charged well with two
Bullets, he watched an Opportunity to shoot
her as she should go out, or into her House, or
Coach, some Evening.</P>
<P>To this End he waited several Nights, near
her Lodgings; but still, either she went not
out; or when she returned, she was so guard∣ed
with Friends, or her Lover, and Flambeaus,
that he could not aim at her, without endan∣gering
the Life of some other. But one Night
above the rest, upon a Sunday, when he knew
she would be at the Theater; for she never
missed that Day, seeing the Play: He waited
at the Corner of the Stadt-House, near the
Theater, with his Cloak cast over his Face,
and a black Perriwig, all alone, with his Pistol
ready cock'd; and remain'd not very long, but
he saw her Kinsman's Coach come along; 'twas
almost dark; Day was just shutting up her
Beauties, and left such a Light to govern the
World, as served only just to distinguish one
Object from another, an a convenient Help to
Mischief. He saw a Light out of the Coach,
only one young Lady, the Lover, and then the
destin'd Victim; which he (drawing near)
knew rather by her Tongue, than Shape. The
Lady ran into the Play-House, and left <HI>Alci∣diana</HI>
to be conducted by her Lover into it;
<PB N="56" REF="117"/>
who led her to the Door, and went to give
some Order to the Coach-man; so that the
Lover was about twenty Yards from <HI>Alcidiana;</HI>
when she stood the fairest Mark in the World,
on the Threshold of the Entrance of the Thea∣tre;
there being many Coaches about the
Door, so that hers could not come so near.
<HI>Tarquin</HI> was resolved not to lose so fair an Op∣portunity,
and advanc'd, but went behind
the Coaches; and when he came over-against
the Door, through a great Booted, Velvet
Coach, that stood between him and her, he
shot; and she having her Train of her Gown
and Petticoat on her Arm, in great quantity,
he missed her Body, and shot through her
Cloaths, between her Arm and her Body.
She, frightned to find something hit her, and
to see the Smoak, and hear the Report of
the Pistol; running in, cried, <HI>I am shot; I am
dead.</HI></P>
<P>This Noise quickly alarm'd her Lover; and
all the Coach-men, and Foot-men immediately
ran, some one Way, and some another. One
of 'em seeing a Man haste away in a Clock,
he being a lusty, bold <HI>German,</HI> stopped him;
and drawing upon him, bad him stand, and
deliver his Pistol, or he would run him
through.</P>
<P><HI>Tarquin</HI> being surprized at the Boldness
of this Fellow, to demand his Pistol, as if
he positively knew him to be the Murtherer,
(for so he thought himself, since he believed
<HI>Alcidiana</HI> dead) had so much Presence of
Mind, as to consider, if he suffered himself
<PB N="57" REF="117"/>
to be taken, he should poorly die a publick
Death; and therefore resolved upon one
Mischief more, to secure himself from the
first: And in the Moment that the <HI>German</HI>
bad him deliver his Pistol, he cried, <HI>Though
I have no Pistol to deliver, I have a Sword to
chastise thy Insolence.</HI> And throwing off his
Cloak, and flinging his Pistol from him, he
drew, and wounded, and disarmed the Fel∣low.</P>
<P>This Noise of Swords brought every Body
to the Place; and immediately the Bruit ran,
<HI>The Murtherer was taken, the Murtherer was taken:</HI>
Though none knew which was he, nor the
Cause of the Quarrel between the two fight∣ing
Men, which none yet knew; for it now
was darker than before. But at the Noise of
the Murderer being taken, the Lover of <HI>Alci∣diana,</HI>
who by this time found his Lady un∣hurt,
all but the Trains of her Gown, and
Petticoat, came running to the place, just
as <HI>Tarquin</HI> had disarmed the <HI>German,</HI> and was
ready to have kill'd him; when laying hold of
his Arm, they arrested the Stroak, and re∣deemed
the Footman.</P>
<P>They then demanded who this Stranger was,
at whose Mercy the Fellow lay; but the Prince,
who now found himself venturing for his last
Stake, made no Reply; but with two Swords
in his Hands, went to fight his Way through
the Rabble: And tho' there were above a hun∣dred
Persons, some Swords, others with long
Whips (as Coach-men) so invincible was the
Courage of this poor unfortunate Gentleman at
<PB N="58" REF="118"/>
that time, that all these were not able to seize
him; but he made his Way through the Ring
that encompassed him, and ran away; but
was, however, so closely pursu'd, the Com∣pany
still gathering as they ran, that toiled
with fighting, oppressed with Guilt, and
Fear of being taken, he grew fainter and
fainter, and suffered himself, at last, to yield
to his Pursuers, who soon found him to
be Prince <HI>Tarquin</HI> in Disguise: And they car∣ried
him directly to Prison, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> to
wait the coming Day, to go before a Magi∣strate.</P>
<P>In an Hours time the whole fatal Adven∣ture
was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rried all over the City, and every
one knew that Prince <HI>Tarquin</HI> was the intended
Murtherer of <HI>Alcidiana;</HI> and not one but had
a real Sorrow and Compassion for him. They
heard how bravely he had defended himself,
how many he had wounded before he could
be taken, and what Numbers he had fought
through: And even those that saw his Valour
and Bravery, and who had assisted at his be∣ing
seized, now repented from the bottom of
their Hearts, their having any Hand in the
Ruine of so gallant a Man; especially, since
they knew the Lady was not hurt. A thou∣sand
Addresses were made to her, not to pro∣secute
him; but her Lover, a hot-headed Fel∣low,
more fierce than brave, would by no
means be pacified; but vowed to pursue him
to the Scaffold.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="118"/>
The <HI>Monday</HI> came, and the Prince being
examined, confessed the Matter of Fact,
since there was no harm done; believing a
generous Confession the best of his Game;
but he was sent back to closer Imprisonment,
loaded with Irons, to expect the next Sessions.
All his Houshold-Goods were seized, and all
they could find, for the Use of <HI>Alcidiana.</HI>
And the Princess, all in Rage, tearing her
Hair, was carried to the same Prison, to
behold the cruel Effects of her hellish De∣signs.</P>
<P>One need not tell here how sad and hor∣rid
this Metting appeared between her Lord
and she, let it suffice it was the most melancholy
and mortifying Object that ever Eyes beheld.
On <HI>Miranda</HI>'s part, 'twas sometimes all Rage
and Fire, and sometimes all Tears and Groans;
but still 'twas sad Love, and mournful Tender∣ness
on his: Nor cou'd all his Sufferings, and
the Prospect of Death itself, drive from his
Soul one Spark of that Fire the obstinate God
had fatally kindl'd there: And in the midst of
all his Sighs, he would recal himself, and cry,
—<HI>I have</HI> Miranda <HI>still.</HI></P>
<P>He was eternally visited by his Friends and
Acquaintance; and this last Action of Bravery
had got him more, than all his former Con∣duct
had lost. The Fathers were perpetually
with him; and all joyn'd with one com∣mon
Voice in this, That he ought to aban∣don
a Woman so wicked as the Princess;
and that however Fate dealt with him, he
could not shew himself a true Penitent,
<PB N="60" REF="119"/>
while he laid the Author of so much Evil in
his Bosom: That Heaven would never bless
him, till he had renounced her: And on such
Conditions, he would find those that would
employ their utmost Interest to save his Life;
who else would not stir in his Affair. But he
was so deaf to all, that he could not so much
as dissemble a Repentance for having married
her.</P>
<P>He lay a long time in Prison, and all that
time the poor Father <HI>Francisco</HI> remained there
also; and the good Fathers, who daily visited
these two amorous Prisoners, the Prince and
Princess; and who found, by the Management
of Matters, it would go very hard with <HI>Tar∣quin,</HI>
entertained 'em often with holy Matters
relating to the Life to come; from which,
before his Tryal, he gathered what his Stars
had appointed, and that he was destin'd to
die.</P>
<P>This gave an unspeakable Torment to the
now repenting Beauty, who had reduced him
to it; and she began to appear with a more
solid Grief, which being perceived by the good
Fathers, they resolved to attack her on the
yielding Side; and after some Discourse upon
the Judgment for Sin, they came to reflect on
the Business of Father <HI>Francisco;</HI> and told her,
she had never thriv'd since her Accusing of that
Father, and laid it very home to her Consci∣ence;
assuring her, that they would do their
utmost in her Service, if she would confess
that secret Sin to all the World; so that she
might atone for the Crime, by the saving that
<PB N="61" REF="119"/>
good Man. At first she seem'd inclin'd to yield;
but shame of being her own Detector in so
vile a Matter, recall'd her Goodness, and she
faintly persisted in it.</P>
<P>At the end of six Months, Prince <HI>Tarquin</HI>
was call'd to his Tryal; where I will pass o∣ver
the Circumstances, which are only what is
usual in such Criminal Cases, and tell you,
that he, being found guilty of the Intent of
killing <HI>Alcidiana,</HI> was condemn'd to lose his
Head in the Market-place, and the Princess
to be banish'd her Country.</P>
<P>After Sentence pronounc'd, to the real
Grief of all the Spectators, he was carried back
to Prison. And now the Fathers attack her
a-new: And she, whose Griefs daily increas'd,
with a Languishment that brought her very
near her Grave, at last confess'd all her Life,
all the Lewdness of her Practices with several
Princes and Great Men, besides her Lusts with
People that serv'd her, and others in mean
Capacity: And lastly, the whole Truth of
the young Friar; and how she had drawn the
Page, and the Prince, her Husband, to this
design'd Murther of her Sister. This she sign'd
with her Hand, in the Presence of the Prince,
her Husband, and several holy Men who were
present. Which being signified to the Magi∣strates,
the Friar was immediately deliver'd
from his Irons (where he had languish'd more
than two whole Years) in great Triumph, with
much Honour, and lives a most exemplary
pious Life, as he did before; for he is now li∣ving
in <HI>Antwerp.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="120"/>
After the Condemnation of these two unfor∣tunate
Persons, who begot such different Sen∣timents
in the Minds of the People, (the
Prince, all the Compassion and Pity imagina∣ble;
and the Princess all the Contempt and
Despight;) they languish'd almost six Months
longer in Prison; so great an Interest there
was made, in order to the saving his Life, by
all the Men of the Robe. On the other side,
the Princes, and Great Men of all Nations,
who were at the Court of <HI>Bruxels,</HI> who bore
a secret Revenge in their Hearts against a
Man who had, as they pretended, set up a
false Title, only to take place of them; who
indeed, was but a Merchant's Son of <HI>Holland,</HI>
as they said, so incens'd them against him, that
they were too hard at Court for the Church∣men.
However, this Dispute gave the Prince
his Life some Months longer than was ex∣pected;
which gave him also some hope, that
a Reprieve for Ninety Years would have been
granted, as was desir'd. Nay, Father <HI>Fran∣cisco</HI>
so interested himself in this Concern, that
he writ to his Father, and several Princes of
<HI>Germany,</HI> with whom Marquess <HI>Castiel de Ro∣derigo</HI>
was well acquainted, to intercede with
him for the saving of <HI>Tarquin;</HI> since 'twas
more by his Perswasions, than those of all who
attack'd her, that made <HI>Miranda</HI> confess the
Truth of her Affair with him. But at the end
of six Months, when all Application were
found fruitless and vain, the Prince receiv'd
News, that in two days he was to die, as his
Sentence had been before pronounc'd; and for
<PB N="63" REF="120"/>
which he prepar'd himself with all Chearful∣ness.</P>
<P>On the following <HI>Friday,</HI> as soon as it was
light, all People of any Condition came to
take their Leaves of him; and none departed
with dry Eyes, or Hearts unconcern'd to the
last Degree: For <HI>Tarquin,</HI> when he found his
Fate inevitable, bore it with a Fortitude that
shew'd no signs of Regret; but address'd him∣self
to all about him with the same chearful,
modest and great Air, he was wont to do in
his modest flourishing Fortune. His <HI>Vallet</HI> was
dressing him all the Morning, so many Inter∣ruptions
they had by Visiters; and he was all
in Mourning, and so were all his Followers;
for even to the last he kept up his Grandeur,
to the Amazement of all People: And in∣deed,
he was so passionately belov'd by them,
that those he had dismiss'd, serv'd him volun∣tarily,
and would not be perswaded to aban∣don
him while he liv'd.</P>
<P>The Princess was also dress'd in Mourning,
and her two Women; and notwithstanding the
unheard of Leudness and Villanies she had con∣fess'd
of herself, the Prince still ador'd her;
for she had still those Charms that made him
first do so: Nor, to his last Moment, could
be brought to wish, that he had never seen her;
but on the contrary, as a Man yet vainly proud
of his Fetters, he said, <HI>All the Satisfaction this
short Moment of Life could afford him, was, that
he died in endeavouring to serve</HI> Miranda, <HI>his ado∣rable
Princess.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="121"/>
After he had taken Leave of all who thought
it necessary to leave him to himself for some
time, he retir'd with his Confessor; where
they were about an Hour in Prayer, all the
Ceremonies of Devotions that were fit to be
done, being already past. At last the Bell
toll'd, and he was to take leave of the Prin∣cess,
as his last Work of Life, and the most
hard he had to accomplish. He threw him∣self
at her Feet, and gazing on her, as she
sat more dead than alive, o'erwhelm'd with
silent Grief, they both remain'd some Mo∣ments
speechless; and then, as if one rising
Tide of Tears had supply'd both their Eyes,
it burst out in Streams at the same instant;
and when his Sighs gave way, he utter'd a thou∣sand
Farewels, so soft, so passionate and mo∣ving,
that all who were by, were extreamly
touch'd with it, and said, <HI>That nothing could be
seen more deplorable and melancholy.</HI> A thousand
times they bad Farewel, and still some tender
Look, or Word, would prevent his going:
Then embrace, and bid Farewel again. A
thousand times she ask'd his Pardon for being
the Occasion of that fatal Separation; a thou∣sand
times assuring him, She would follow him,
for she could not live without him. And Hea∣ven
knows, when their soft and sad Caresses
would have an end, had not the Officers, as∣sur'd
him, 'twas time to mount the Scaffold.
At which Words the Princess fell fainting in
the Arms of her Women, and they led <HI>Tarquin</HI>
out of Prison.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="121"/>
When he came to the Market-place, whither
he walked on Foot, follow'd by his own Dome∣sticks,
and some bearing a black Velvet Coffin
with Silver Hinges; the Heads-man before
him, with his fatal Scimiter drawn, his Con∣fessor
by his side, and many Gentlemen, and
Church-men, with Father <HI>Francisco</HI> attending
him, the People showering Millions of Bles∣sings
on him, and beholding, with weeping
Eyes, he mounted the Scaffold; which was
strew'd with some Saw-dust, about the place
where he was to kneel, to receive the Blood:
For they Behead People kneeling, and with
the Back-stroak of a Scimiter, and not lying
on a Block, and with an Ax, as we in <HI>England.</HI>
The Scaffold had a low Rail about it, that eve∣ry
Body might more conveniently see: This
was hung with Black, and all that State that
such a Death could have, was here in most de∣cent
Order.</P>
<P>He did not say much upon the Scaffold:
The Sum of what he said to his Friends, was,
To be kind, and take Care of the poor Peni∣tent,
his Wife: To others, recommending
his honest and generous Servants, whose Fide∣lity
was so well known and commended, that
they were soon promis'd Preferment. He was
some time in Prayer, and a very short time
speaking to his Confessor; then he turn'd to
the Heads-man, and desired him to do his Of∣fice
well, and gave him twenty <HI>Louis d' Ors;</HI>
and undressing himself with the help of his Val∣let,
and Page, he pull'd off his Coat, and had
underneath a white Satten Waste-coat: He
<PB N="66" REF="122"/>
took off his Perriwig, and put on a white Sat∣ten
Cap, with a Holland one done with Poynt
under it, which he pull'd over his Eyes, then
took a chearful Leave of all, and kneel'd down,
and said, <HI>When he lifted up his Hands the Third
time, the Heads-man should do his Office.</HI> Which
accordingly was done, and the Heads-man gave
him his last Stroak, and the Prince fell on the
Scaffold. The People, with one common Voice,
as if it had been but one entire one, pray'd for
his Soul; and Murmurs of Sighs were heard
from the whole Multitude, who scrambl'd for
some of the bloody Saw-dust, to keep for his
Memory.</P>
<P>The Heads-man going to take up the Head,
as the manner is, to shew to the People, he
found he had not struck it off, and that the
Body stirr'd; with that he stepp'd to an En∣gine,
which they always carry with 'em, to
force those who may be refractory; thinking,
as he said, to have twisted the Head from the
Shoulders, conceiving it to hang but by a small
matter of Flesh. Tho' twas an odd Shift of
the Fellows, yet 'twas done, and the best
Shift he could suddenly propose. The Mar∣grave,
and another Officer, old Men, were on
the Scaffold, with some of the Prince's Friends,
and Servants; who seeing the Heads-man put
the Engine about the Neck of the Prince, be∣gan
to call out, and the People made a great
Noise. The Prince, who found himself yet
alive; or rather, who was past thinking, but
had some Sense of feeling left, when the
Heads-man took him up, and set his Back
<PB N="67" REF="122"/>
against the Rail, and clapp'd the Engine about
his Neck, got his two Thumbs between the
Rope and his Neck, feeling himself press'd
there; and struggling between Life and Death,
and bending himself over the Rail backward,
while the Heads-man pull'd forward, he threw
himself quite over the Rail, by Chance, and not
Design, and fell upon the Heads and Shoulders
of the People, who were crying out with a∣mazing
Shouts of Joy. The Heads-man leap'd
after him, but the Rabble had like to have
pull'd him to pieces: All the City was in an
Uproar, but none knew what the Matter
was, but those who bore the Body of the
Prince, whom they found yet living; but
how, or by what strange Miracle preserv'd,
they knew not, nor did examine; but with
one Accord, as if the whole Crowd had been
one Body, and had had but one Motion, they
bore the Prince on their Heads, about a hun∣dred
Yards from the Scaffold, where there is
a Monastery of Jesuites; and there they se∣cur'd
him. All this was done, his Beheading,
his Falling, and his being secur'd, almost in a
Moments time; the People rejoycing, as at
some extraordinary Victory won. One of the
Officers being, as I said, an old, timerous Man,
was so frighten'd at the Accident, the Bustle,
the Noise, and the Confusion, of which he was
wholly ignorant, that he dy'd with Amaze∣ment
and Fear; and the other was fain to be
let Blood.</P>
<P>The Officers of Justice went to demand the
Prisoner; but they demanded in vain; they
<PB N="68" REF="123"/>
had now a Right to protect him, and wou'd
do so. All his over-joy'd Friends went to see
in what Condition he was, and all of Quality
found Admittance: They saw him in Bed,
going to be dress'd by the most skilful Surgeons
who yet could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assure him of Life. They
desired no Body should speak to him, or ask
him any Questions. They found that the
Heads-man had struck him too low, and had
cut him into the Shoulder-bone. A very great
Wound, you may be sure; for the Sword, in
such Executions, carries an extream force:
However, so great Care was taken on all sides,
and so greatly the Fathers were concern'd for
him, that they found an Amendment, and
Hopes of a good Effect of their incomparable
Charity and Goodness.</P>
<P>At last, when he was permitted to speak, the
first News he ask'd was after the Princess. And
his Friends were very much afflicted to find,
that all his Loss of Blood had not quench'd
that Flame, nor let out that which made him
still love that bad Woman. He was solicited
daily to think no more of her: And all her
Crimes were laid so open to him, and so
shamefully represented; and on the other side,
his Vertues so admir'd; and which, they said,
would have been eternally celebrated, but for
his Folly with this infamous Creature; that at
last, by assuring him of all their Assistance, if
he abandon'd her; and to renounce him, and
deliver him up, if he did not; they wrought
so far upon him, as to promise, he would suf∣fer
her to go alone into Banishment, and would
<PB N="69" REF="123"/>
not follow her, or live with her any more. But
alas! this was but his Gratitude that compell'd
this Complaisance, for in his Heart he resolv'd
never to abandon her; nor was he able to live,
and think of doing it: However, his Reason
assured him, he could not do a Deed more ju∣stifiable,
and one that would regain his Fame
sooner.</P>
<P>His Friends ask'd him some Questions con∣cerning
his Escape; and that since he was not
beheaded, but only wounded, why he did not
immediately rise up? But he replied, He was
so absolutely prepossessed, that at the third lift∣ing
up his Hands, he should receive the Stroak
of Death, that at the same instant the Sword
touch'd him, he had no Sense; nay, not even
of Pain, so absolutely dead he was with Ima∣gination;
and knew not that he stirr'd, as the
Heads-man found he did; nor did he remem∣ber
any thing, from the lifting up of his Hands,
to his Fall; and then awakened, as out of a
Dream, or rather a Moment's Sleep, without
Dream, he found he liv'd, and wonder'd what
was arriv'd to him, or how he came to live; ha∣ving
not, as yet, any Sense of his Wound, tho'
so terrible an one.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>Alcidiana,</HI> who was extreamly
afflicted for having been the Prosecutor of this
Great Man; who, bating this last Design a∣gainst
her, which we knew was the Instigation
of her Sister, had oblig'd her with all the Ci∣vility
imaginable; now sought all Means pos∣sible
of getting his Pardon, and that of her Si∣ster;
tho' of an Hundred thousand Crowns,
<PB N="70" REF="124"/>
which she should have paid her, she could get
but Ten thousand; which was from the Sale of
her rich Beds, and some other Furniture: So
that the young Count, who before should have
marry'd her, now went off for want of For∣tune;
and a young Merchant (perhaps the best
of the two) was the Man to whom she was de∣stin'd.</P>
<P>At last, by great Intercession, both their
Pardons were obtain'd; and the Prince, who
would be no more seen in a place that had
prov'd every way so fatal to him, left <HI>Flanders,</HI>
promising never to live with the fair Hypocrite
more; but e'er he departed, he writ her a Let∣ter,
wherein he order'd her, in a little time, to
follow him into <HI>Holland;</HI> and left a Bill of Ex∣change
with one of his trusty Servants, whom
he had left to wait upon her, for Money for
her Accommodations: So that she was now
reduced to one Woman, one Page, and this
Gentleman. The Prince, in this time of his
Imprisonment, had several Bills of great Sums
from his Father, who was exceeding rich, and
this all the Children he had in the World, and
whom he tenderly loved.</P>
<P>As soon as <HI>Miranda</HI> was come into <HI>Holland,</HI>
she was welcom'd with all imaginable Respect
and Endearment by the old Father; who im∣pos'd
upon so, as that he knew not she was the
fatal Occasion of all these Disasters to his Son;
but rather look'd on her as a Woman, who had
brought him an Hundred and fifty thousand
Crowns, which his Misfortunes had consum'd.
But, above all, she was receiv'd by <HI>Tarquin</HI> with
<PB N="71" REF="124"/>
a Joy unspeakable; who, after some time, to
redeem his Credit, and gain himself a new
Fame, put himself into the <HI>French</HI> Army, where
he did Wonders; and after three Campaigns,
his Father dying, he return'd home, and re∣tir'd
to a Country-House; where, with his
Princess, he lives as a private Gentleman, in
all the Tranquility of a Man of a good For∣tune.
They say <HI>Miranda</HI> has been very peni∣tent
for her Life past, and gives Heaven the
Glory for having given her these Afflictions,
that have reclaim'd her, and brought her to as
perfect a State of Happiness as this troublesome
World can afford.</P>
<P>Since I began this Relation, I heard that
Prince <HI>Tarquin</HI> dy'd about Three Quarters of a
Year ago.</P>

<HEAD>THE
HISTORY
OF
AGNES de CASTRO.</HEAD>
<P>THough LOVE, all soft and flattering,
promises nothing but Pleasures; yet
its Consequences are often sad and
fatal: It is not enough to be in
Love, to be happy, since Fortune, who is Ca∣pricious,
and takes delight to trouble the Re∣pose
of the most Elevated and Virtuous, has
very little respect for passionate and tender
Hearts, when she designs to produce strange
Adventures.</P>
<P>Many Examples of past Ages render this
Maxim certain, but the Reign of <HI>Dom Alphonso</HI>
the Fourth, King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> furnishes us with
one, the most extraordinary that History can
produce.</P>
<P>He was the Son of that <HI>Dom Denice,</HI> who was
so successful in all his Undertakings, that it
was said of him, that he was capable of per∣forming
whatever he design'd: And of <HI>Isa∣bella,</HI>
a Princess of eminent Vertue, who when
<PB N="2" REF="127"/>
he came to inherit a flourishing and tranquil
State, he endeavour'd to establish Peace and
Plenty in abundance, in his Kingdom.</P>
<P>And to advance this his Design, he agreed
on a Marriage between his Son <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> (then
about eight Years of Age) and <HI>Bianca</HI> Daugh∣ter
of <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> King of <HI>Castile;</HI> and whom
the young Prince married when he arrived
to his sixteenth Year.</P>
<P><HI>Bianca</HI> brought nothing to <HI>Coimbra</HI> but In∣firmities,
and very few Charms. <HI>Don Pedro,</HI>
who was full of Sweetness and Generosity, liv'd
nevertheless very well with her; but those Di∣stempers
of the Princess degenerating into the
Palsie, she made it her Request to retire, and
at her Intercession, the Pope broke the Marri∣age,
and the melancholy Princess concealed
her Languishment in a solitary Retreat: And
<HI>Don Pedro,</HI> for whom they had provided ano∣ther
Match, married <HI>Constantia Manuel,</HI> Daugh∣ter
of <HI>Dom John Manuel,</HI> a Prince of the Blood
of <HI>Castile,</HI> and famous for the Enmity he had
to his King.</P>
<P><HI>Constantia</HI> was promised to the King of <HI>Ca∣stile,</HI>
but that King not keeping his Word, they
made no difficulty of bestowing her on a young
Prince, who was one day to Reign over a Num∣ber
of fine Provinces. He was but five and
twenty Years of Age, and the Man of all <HI>Spain</HI>
that had the best Fashion and Grace: And
with the most advantagious Qualities of the
Body, he possest those of the Soul, and shew'd
himself worthy in all things of the Crown that
was destin'd for him.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="127"/>
The Princess <HI>Constantia</HI> had Beauty, Wit,
and Generosity, in as a great Measure as 'twas
possible for a Woman to be possest with; her
Merit alone ought to have attach'd <HI>Don Pedro</HI>
eternally to her; and certainly he had for her
an Esteem, mixt with so great a Respect, as
might very well pass for Love with those that
were not of a nice and curious Observation;
but alas! his real Care was reserv'd for ano∣ther
Beauty.</P>
<P><HI>Constantia</HI> brought into the World, the first
Year after her Marriage, a Son, who was call'd
<HI>Don Louis;</HI> but it scarce saw the Light, and
dy'd almost as soon as born. The Loss of this
little Prince sensibly touch'd her, but the Cold∣ness
she observ'd in the Prince her Husband,
went yet more near her Heart; for she had gi∣ven
herself absolutely up to her Duty, and had
made her Tenderness for him her only Con∣cern:
But puissant Glory which ty'd her so
entirely to the Interest of the Prince of <HI>Portu∣gal,</HI>
open'd her Eyes upon his Actions, where
she observ'd nothing in his Caresses and Ci∣vilities
that was natural, or could satisfie her
delicate Heart.</P>
<P>At first, she fancy'd herself deceiv'd, but
time having confirm'd her in what she fear∣ed,
she sighed in secret; yet had that Consi∣deration
for the Prince, as not to let him see
her Disorder; and which nevertheless, she
could not conceal from <HI>Agnes de Castro,</HI> who
liv'd with her, rather as a Companion, than a
Maid of Honour, and whom her Friendship
made her infinitely distinguish from the rest.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="128"/>
This maid, so dear to the Princess, very
well merited the Preference her Mistress gave
her; she was beautiful to excess, wise, discreet,
witty, and had more Tenderness for <HI>Constan∣tia</HI>
than she had for herself, having quitted her
Family, which was illustrious, to give herself
wholly to the Service of the Princess, and to
follow her into <HI>Portugal.</HI> It was into the Bo∣som
of this Maid, that the Princess unladed
her first Moans, and the charming <HI>Agnes</HI> for∣got
nothing that might give ease to her affli∣cted
Heart.</P>
<P>Nor was <HI>Constantia</HI> the only Person who
complain'd on <HI>Don Pedro;</HI> before his Divorce
from <HI>Bianca,</HI> he had expressed some Care and
Tenderness for <HI>Elvira Gonzales,</HI> Sister to <HI>Don
Alvaro Gonzales,</HI> Favourite to the King of <HI>Por∣tugal;</HI>
and this Amusement in the young Years
of the Prince, had made a deep Impression on
<HI>Elvira,</HI> who flatter'd her Ambition with the
Infirmities of <HI>Bianca.</HI> She saw, with a secret
Rage, <HI>Constantia</HI> take her place, who was pos∣sest
with such Charms, that quite divested her
of all Hopes.</P>
<P>Her Jealousie left her not idle, she examin'd
all the Actions of the Prince, and easily disco∣ver'd
the little Regard he had for the Princess;
but this brought him not back to her. And it
was upon very good Grounds that she suspected
him to be in Love with some other Person,
and possessed with a new Passion; and which
she promis'd herself, she would destroy as
soon as she could find it out. She had a Spi∣rit
altogether proper for bold and hazardous
<PB N="5" REF="128"/>
Enterprizes; and the Credit of her Brother
gave her so much Vanity, as all the Indiffe∣rence
of the Prince was not capable of hum∣bling.</P>
<P>The Prince languish'd, and conceal'd the
Cause with so much Care, that 'twas impossi∣ble
for any to find it out. No publick Plea∣sures
were agreeable to him, and all Conver∣sations
were tedious; and it was Solitude alone
that was able to give him any ease.</P>
<P>This Change surprized all the World. The
King who lov'd his Son very tenderly, ear∣nestly
press'd him to know the Reason of his
Melancholy; but the Prince made no answer,
but only this, That it was the Effects of his
Temper.</P>
<P>But Time ran on, and the Princess was
brought to Bed of a second Son, who liv'd,
and was call'd <HI>Fernando. Don Pedro</HI> forc'd him∣self
a little to take part in the publick Joy, so
that they believ'd his Humour was changing;
but this appearance of a Calm endured not
long, and he fell back again into his black Me∣lancholy.</P>
<P>The Artful <HI>Elvira</HI> was incessantly agitated
in searching out the Knowledge of this Secret.
Chance wrought for her: And, as she was
walking full of Indignation and Anger, in the
Garden of the Palace of <HI>Coimbra,</HI> she found the
Prince of <HI>Portugal</HI> sleeping in an obscure
Grotto.</P>
<P>Her Fury could not contain itself at the
Sight of this lov'd Object, she roul'd her Eyes
upon him, and perceiv'd in spight of Sleep,
<PB N="6" REF="129"/>
that some Tears escap'd his Eyes; the Flame
which burnt yet in her Heart, soon grew soft
and tender there: But oh! she heard him
sigh, and after that, utter these Words; <HI>Yes,
Divine</HI> Agnes, <HI>I will sooner die, than let you know
it:</HI> Constantia <HI>shall have nothing to reproach me
with. Elvira</HI> was enrag'd at this Discourse,
which represented to her immediately, the
same Moment, <HI>Agnes de Castro</HI> with all her
Charms; and not at all doubting, but it was
she who possest the Heart of <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> she
found in her Soul more Hatred for this fair
Rival, than Tenderness for him.</P>
<P>The Grotto was not a Place sit to make Re∣flections
in, or to form Designs. Perhaps her
first Transports would have made her waken'd
him, if she had not perceiv'd a Paper lying un∣der
his Hand, which she softly seiz'd on; and
that she might not be surpriz'd in the reading
it, she went out of the Garden with as much
Haste as Confusion.</P>
<P>When she was retir'd to her Apartment, she
open'd the Paper, trembling, and found in it
these Verses, writ by the Hand of <HI>Don Pedro;</HI>
and which in appearance, he had newly then
composed.</P>
<LG>
<L>In vain, oh! Sacred Honour, you debate</L>
<L>The mighty Business in my Heart:</L>
<L>Love! Charming Love! rules all my Fate,</L>
<L>Interest and Glory claim no part.</L>
<L>The God, sure of his Victory, Triumphs there,</L>
<L>And will have nothing in his Empire share.</L>
</LG>
<PB N="7" REF="129"/>
<LG>
<L>In vain, oh! Sacred Duty, you oppose;</L>
<L>In vain, your Nuptial Tye you plead:</L>
<L>Those forc'd Devoirs LOVE overthrows,</L>
<L>And breaks the Vows he never made.</L>
<L>Fixing his fatal Arrows every where,</L>
<L>I burn, and languish, in a soft Despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fair Princess, you to whom my Faith is due;</L>
<L>Pardon the Destiny that drags me on;</L>
<L>'Tis not my Fault, my Heart's untrue,</L>
<L>I am compell'd to be undone:</L>
<L>My Life is yours, I gave it with my Hand,</L>
<L>But my Fidelity I can't command.</L>
</LG>
<P><HI>Elvira</HI> did not only know the Writing of
<HI>Don Pedro,</HI> but she knew also that he could
write Verses. And seeing the sad Part which
<HI>Constantia</HI> had in these which were now fallen
into her Hands, she made no scruple of resol∣ving
to let the Princess see 'em: But that she
might not be suspected, she took care not to
appear in the Business herself; and since it
was not enough for <HI>Constantia</HI> to know that
the Prince did not love her, but that she must
know also he was a Slave to <HI>Agnes de Castro;
Elvira</HI> caused these few Verses to be written
in an unknown Hand, under those writ by the
Prince.</P>
<LG>
<L>Sleep betray'd, the unhappy Lover;</L>
<L>While Tears were streaming from his Eyes,</L>
<L>His heedless Tongue without disguise,</L>
<L>The Secret did discover.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="130"/>
The Language of his Heart declare,</L>
<L>That <HI>Agnes</HI> Image Triumphs there.</L>
</LG>
<P><HI>Elvira</HI> regarded neither Exactness nor Grace
in these Lines, and if they had but the Effect
she design'd, she wish'd no more.</P>
<P>Her Impatience could not wait till the next
Day to expose 'em; she therefore went im∣mediately
to the Lodgings of the Princess, who
was then walking in the Garden of the Pa∣lace;
and passing without resistance, even to
her Cabinet, she put the Paper into a Book, in
which the Princess us'd to read, and went
out again unseen, and satisfied with her good
Fortune.</P>
<P>As soon as <HI>Constantia</HI> was return'd, she en∣ter'd
into her Cabinet, and saw the Book open,
and the Verses lying in it, which were to cost
her so dear: She soon knew the Hand of the
Prince which was so familiar to her, and be∣sides
the Information of what she had always
fear'd, she understood it was <HI>Agnes de Castro,</HI>
(whose Friendship alone was able to comfort
her in her Misfortunes) who was the fatal Cause
of it; she read over the Paper an hundred
times, desiring to give her Eyes and Reason
the Lye; but finding but too plainly she was
not deceiv'd, she found her Soul possest with
more Grief than Anger: When she consi∣der'd
as much in Love as the Prince was, he
had kept his Torment secret. After having
made her Moan, without condemning him,
the Tenderness she had for him, made her
shed a Torrent of Tears, and inspir'd her
<PB N="9" REF="130"/>
with a Resolution of concealing her Resent∣ment.</P>
<P>She would certainly have done it by a Ver∣tue
extraordinary, if the Prince, who missing
his Verses when he wak'd, and fearing they
might fall into indiscreet Hands, had not en∣ter'd
the Palace, all troubl'd with his Loss,
and hastily going into <HI>Constantia</HI>'s Apartment,
saw her fair Eyes all wet with Tears, and at
the same instant cast his own on the unhappy
Verses that had escap'd from his Soul, and now
lay before the Princess.</P>
<P><HI>He immediately turn'd pale at this sight, and
appear'd so mov'd, that the generous Princess
felt more Pain than he did:</HI> Madam, <HI>said he,
(infinitely alarm'd)</HI> from whom had you that Pa∣per?
It cannot come but from the Hand of some
Person, <HI>answer'd</HI> Constantia, who is an Enemy
both to your Repose and mine; it is the Work, Sir,
of your own Hand; and doubtless, the Sentiment of
your Heart: But be not surpriz'd, and do not fear,
for if my Tenderness should make it pass for a
Crime in you, the same Tenderness, which no∣thing
is able to alter, shall hinder me from com∣plaining.</P>
<P>The Moderation and Calmness of <HI>Constantia,</HI>
serv'd only to render the Prince more asham'd
and confuss'd. <HI>How Generous are you, madam,</HI>
pursu'd he, <HI>and how Vnfortunate am I.</HI> Some
Tears accompanied his Words, and the Prin∣cess,
who lov'd him with extream Ardor, was
so sensibly touch'd, that it was a good
while before she could utter a Word: <HI>Con∣stantia</HI>
then broke Silence, and shewing him
<PB N="10" REF="131"/>
what <HI>Elvira</HI> had caus'd to be written; <HI>You are
betray'd, Sir,</HI> added she, <HI>you have been heard
speak, and your Secret is known.</HI> It was at this
very moment that all the Forces of the Prince
abandon'd him; and his Condition was really
worthy Compassion: He could not pardon
himself the unvoluntary Crime he had commit∣ted,
in exposing of the lovely, and the inno∣cent
<HI>Agnes.</HI> And tho' he was convinc'd of the
Vertue and Goodness of <HI>Constantia,</HI> the Ap∣prehensions
that he had, that this modest and
prudent Maid might suffer by his Conduct, car∣ried
him beyond all Consideration.</P>
<P>The Princess, who heedfully surveyed him,
saw so many Marks of Despair in his Face
and Eyes, that she was afraid of the Conse∣quences;
and holding out her Hand, in a very
obliging manner to him; she said, <HI>I promise
you, Sir, I will never more complain on you; and
that</HI> Agnes <HI>shall always be very dear to me; you
shall never hear me make you any Reproaches: And
since I cannot possess your Heart, I will content my
self with endeavouring to render myself worthy of it.
Don Pedro</HI> more confus'd and dejected than be∣fore
he had been, bent one of his Knees at the
Feet of <HI>Constantia,</HI> and with respect kiss'd that
fair kind Hand she had given him, and perhaps
forgot <HI>Agnes</HI> for a Moment.</P>
<P>But Love soon put a stop to all the little Ad∣vances
of <HI>Hymen,</HI> the fatal Star that presided
over the Destiny of <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> had not yet
vented its Malignity; and one Moment's sight
of <HI>Agnes</HI> gave new Forces to his Passion.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="131"/>
The Wish and Desires of this charming Maid
had no part in this Victory; her Eyes were just,
tho' penetrating, and they searched not in
those of the Prince, what they had a desire to
discover to her.</P>
<P><HI>As she was never far from</HI> Constantia, Don
Pedro <HI>was no sooner gone out of the Closet, but</HI>
Agnes <HI>entred; and finding the Princess all pale
and languishing in her Chair, she doubted not
but there was some sufficient Cause for her Af∣fliction;
she put herself in the same Posture
the Prince had been in before, and expressing
an Inquietude, full of Concern;</HI> Madam, <HI>said
she,</HI> by all your Goodness, conceal not from me the
Cause of your Trouble. Alas, <HI>Agnes, reply'd the
the Princess,</HI> what would you know? And what
should I tell you? The Prince, the Prince, my dear∣est
Maid, is in Love; the Hand that he gave me,
was not a Present of his Heart; and for the Advan∣tage
of this Alliance, I must become the Victim of
it.—What! the Prince in Love, <HI>replied</HI> Agnes,
(<HI>with an Astonishment mixt with Indignation</HI>)
What Beauty can dispute the Empire over a Heart
so much your due? Alas, Madam, all the Respect
I owe him, cannot hinder me from murmuring a∣gainst
him. Accuse him of nothing, <HI>interrupted</HI>
Constantia, he does what he can; and I am more
obliged to him for desiring to be Faithful, than if I
possest his real Tenderness. It is not enough to
Fight, but to Overcome; and the Prince does more
in the Condition wherein he is, than I ought reasona∣bly
to hope for: In fine, he is my Husband, and an
agreeable one; to whom nothing is wanting, but what
I cannot inspire; that is, a Passion which would
<PB N="12" REF="132"/>
have made me but too happy. Ah, Madam, <HI>cry'd
out</HI> Agnes, <HI>transported with her Tenderness
for the Princess,</HI> he is a blind and stupid Prince,
who knows not the precious Advantages he possesses.
He must surely know something, <HI>reply'd the Prin∣cess,
modestly.</HI> But, Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> Agnes,
Is there any thing, not only in <HI>Portugal,</HI> but in all
<HI>Spain,</HI> that can compare with you? And, without
considering the charming Qualities of your Person,
can we enough admire those of your Soul? My dear
Agnes, <HI>interrupted</HI> Constantia, <HI>sighing,</HI> she who
robs me of my Husband's Heart, has but too many
Charms to plead his Excuse; since it is Thou, Child,
whom Fortune makes use of, to give me the Killing
Blow. Yes, <HI>Agnes,</HI> the Prince loves thee; and the
Merit I know thou art possest of, puts Bounds to my
Complaints, without suffering me to have the least
Resentment.</P>
<P><HI>The delicate</HI> Agnes <HI>little expected to hear
what the Princess told her; Thunder would
have less surprized, and less oppress'd her: She
remained a long time without speaking, but at
last fixing her Looks all frightful on</HI> Constantia,
What say you, Madam? (<HI>cry'd she</HI>) And what
Thoughts have you of me? What, that I should be∣tray
you? And coming hither only full of Ardor to
be the Repose of your Life, do I bring a fatal Poyson
to afflict it? What Detestation must I have for the
Beauty they find in me, without aspiring to make it
appear? And how ought I to curse the unfortunate
Day, in which I first saw the Prince?—But,
Madam, it cannot be me, whom Heaven has cho∣sen
to torment you, and to destroy all your Tranquili∣ty:
No, it cannot be so much my Enemy, to put me
<PB N="13" REF="132"/>
to so great a Tryal: And if I were that odious Per∣son,
there is no Excuse, or Punishment, to which I
would not condemn myself: It is <HI>Elvira,</HI> Madam,
the Prince loves, and lov'd before his Marriage with
you, and also before his Divorce from <HI>Bianca;</HI> and
some Body has made an indiscreet Report to you of
this Intrigue of his Youth: But, Madam, what was
in the time of <HI>Bianca,</HI> is nothing to you. It is cer∣tain
that <HI>Don Pedro</HI> loves you, <HI>answer'd the Prin∣cess;</HI>
and I have Vanity enough to believe, that none
besides yourself could have disputed his Heart with
me: But the Secret is discover'd, and <HI>Don Pedro</HI>
has not disown'd it. What, <HI>interrupted</HI> Ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,
(<HI>more surprized than ever</HI>) is it then from himself
you have learn'd his Weakness? <HI>The Princess then
shew'd her the Verses; and there was never
any Despair like to hers.</HI></P>
<P>While they were both thus sadly employed,
both Sighing, and both Weeping, the impa∣tient
<HI>Elvira,</HI> who was willing to learn the Ef∣fect
of her Malice, return'd to the Apartment
of the Princess, where she freely entred, even
to the Cabinet where these unhappy Persons
were; whom all afflicted and troubled as they
were, blush'd at her approach, whose Compa∣ny
they did not desire: She had the pleasure to
see <HI>Constantia</HI> hide from her the Paper which
had been the Cause of all their Trouble, and
which the Princess had never seen, but for her
Spight and Revenge; and to observe also, in
the Eyes of the Princess, and those of <HI>Agnes,</HI>
an immoderate Grief: She stay'd in the Ca∣binet
as long as it was necessary to be assur'd,
that she had succeeded in her Design; but the
<PB N="14" REF="133"/>
Princess, who did not desire such a Witness of
the Disorder, in which she then was, desir'd
to be left alone. <HI>Elvira</HI> then went out of the
Cabinet, and <HI>Agnes de Castro</HI> withdrew at the
same time.</P>
<P>It was in her own Chamber, that <HI>Agnes</HI> exa∣mining
more freely this Adventure, found it as
cruel as Death: She lov'd <HI>Constantia</HI> sincere∣ly,
and had not 'till then any thing more than
an Esteem, mixt with Admiration, for the
Prince of <HI>Portugal;</HI> which, indeed, none could
refuse to so many fine Qualities. And look∣ing
on herself as the most unfortunate of her
Sex, as being the Cause of all the Suffering of
the Princess, to whom she was obliged for the
greatest Bounties, she spent the whole Night
in Tears and Complaints, sufficient to have re∣venged
<HI>Constantia</HI> of all the Griefs she made
her suffer.</P>
<P>The Prince, on his side, was in no greater
Tranquility; the Generosity of his Princess
increas'd his Remorse, without diminishing
his Love; he fear'd, and with Reason, that
those who were the occasion of <HI>Constantia</HI>'s
seeing those Verses, should discover his Passion
to the King, from whom he hop'd for no In∣dulgence,
and he would most willingly have
given his Life to have been free from this Ex∣tremity.</P>
<P>In the mean time the afflicted Princess lan∣guish'd
in a most deplorable Sadness; she found
nothing in those who were the Cause of her
Misfortunes, but things fitter to move her Ten∣derness
than her Anger; it was in vain that
<PB N="15" REF="133"/>
Jealousie strove to combat the Inclination she
had to love her fair Rival; nor was any occa∣sion
of making the Prince less dear to her; and
she felt neither Hatred, nor so much as Indiffe∣rence
for innocent <HI>Agnes.</HI></P>
<P>While these three disconsolate Persons aban∣don'd
themselves to their Melancholy, <HI>Elvira,</HI>
not to leave her Vengeance imperfect, study'd
in what manner she might bring it to the
Height of its Effects. Her Brother, on whom
she depended, shew'd her a great deal of
Friendship; and judging rightly that the
Love of <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> to <HI>Agnes de Castro,</HI> would
not be approv'd by the King, she acquainted
<HI>Don Alvaro,</HI> her Brother, with it, who was not
ignorant of the Passion the Prince had once
protested to have for his Sister. He found him∣self
very much interested in this News, from
a secret Passion he had for <HI>Agnes;</HI> whom the
Business of his Fortune had hitherto hindred
him from discovering: And he expected a
great many Favours from the King, that might
render the Effort of his Heart the more consi∣derable.</P>
<P>He hid not from his Sister this one thing,
which he found difficult to conceal; so that
she was now possest with a double Grief, to
find <HI>Agnes</HI> Sovereign of all the Hearts, to which
she had a pretension.</P>
<P><HI>Don Alvaro</HI> was one of those ambitious Men,
that are Fierce without Moderation, and Proud
without Generosity; of a melancholy, clou∣dy
Humour; of a cruel Inclination, and to
effect his Ends, found nothing difficult, or un∣lawful.
<PB N="16" REF="134"/>
Naturally he lov'd not the Prince,
who, on all Accounts ought to have held the
first Rank in the Heart of the King, which
should have set Bounds to the Favour of <HI>Don Al∣varo;</HI>
who when he knew the Prince was his
Rival, his Jealousie increas'd his Hate of him;
and he conjured <HI>Elvira</HI> to employ all her Care,
to oppose an Engagement that could not but
be destructive to 'em both; she promised him,
and he not very well satisfied, rely'd on her
Address.</P>
<P><HI>Don Alvaro,</HI> who had too lively a Represen∣tation
within himself, of the Beauties and
Grace of the Prince of <HI>Portugal,</HI> thought of
nothing but how to combate his Merits, he
himself being not handsome, or well made:
His Fashion was as disagreeable as his Humour,
and <HI>Don Pedro</HI> had all the Advantages that one
Man may possibly have over another. In fine,
all that <HI>Don Alvaro</HI> wanted, adorn'd the
Prince: But as he was the Husband of <HI>Con∣stantia,</HI>
and depended upon an absolute Father,
and that <HI>Don Alvaro</HI> was free, and Master of a
good Fortune, he thought himself more as∣sur'd
of <HI>Agnes,</HI> and fix'd his Hopes on that
Thought.</P>
<P>He knew very well, that the Passion of <HI>Don
Pedro,</HI> could not but inspire a violent Anger in
the Soul of the King. Industrious in doing Ill,
his first Business was to carry this unwelcome
News to him. After he had given time to his
Grief, and had compos'd himself to his Desire,
he then besought the King to Interest himself in
his amorous Affair, and to be the Protector of
his Person.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="134"/>
Though <HI>Don Alvaro,</HI> had no other Merit
to recommend him to the King, than a con∣tinual
and blind Obedience to all his Com∣mands;
yet he had favour'd him with several
Testimonies of his vast Bounty; and consi∣dering
the height to which the King's Libe∣rality
had rais'd him, there were few Ladies
that would have refus'd his Alliance. The
King assur'd him of the Continuation of his
Friendship and Favour, and promis'd him, if
he had any Authority, he would give him the
charming <HI>Agnes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Don Alvaro,</HI> perfectly skilful in managing his
Master, answer'd the King's last Bounties with
a profound Submission. He had yet never told
<HI>Agnes</HI> what he felt for her; but he thought now
he might make a publick Declaration of it, and
and sought all means to do it.</P>
<P>The Gallantry which <HI>Coimbra</HI> seem'd to have
forgotten, began now to be awaken'd. The
King, to please <HI>Don Alvaro,</HI> under pretence of
diverting <HI>Constantia,</HI> order'd some Publick
Sports, and commanded that every thing should
be magnificent.</P>
<P>Since the Adventure of the Verses, <HI>Don Pe∣dro</HI>
endeavour'd to lay a Constraint on him∣self,
and to appear less troubled: But in his
Heart he suffer'd always alike; and it was
not but with great Uneasiness he prepar'd him∣self
for the Turnament. And since he could
not appear with the Colours of <HI>Agnes,</HI> he took
those of his Wife, without Device, or any great
Magnificence.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="135"/>
<HI>Don Alvaro</HI> adorn'd himself with the Liv'ries
of <HI>Agnes de Castro;</HI> and this fair Maid, who
had yet found no Consolation from what the
Princess had told her, had this new Cause of
being displeas'd.</P>
<P><HI>Don Pedro</HI> appear'd in the List with an ad∣mirable
Grace; and <HI>Don Alvaro,</HI> who look'd
on this Day as his own, appear'd there all shi∣ning
with Gold, mix'd with Stones of Blew,
which were the Colours of <HI>Agnes;</HI> and there
was embroider'd all over his Equipage, fla∣ming
Hearts of Gold, on blew Velvet, and
Nets for the Snares of Love, with abundance
of double <HI>A's;</HI> his Device was a Love coming
out of a Cloud, with these Verses written un∣derneath.</P>
<LG>
<L>Love from a Cloud breaks like the God of Day,</L>
<L>And to the World his Glories does display;</L>
<L>To gaze on charming Eyes, and make 'em know,</L>
<L>What to soft Hearts, and to his Power they owe.</L>
</LG>
<P>The Pride of <HI>Don Alvaro</HI> was soon hum∣bled
at the Feet of the Prince of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who
threw him against the Ground, with twenty
others, and carry'd alone the Glory of the
Day. There was in the Evening a Noble
Assembly at <HI>Constantia</HI>'s, where <HI>Agnes</HI> would
not have been, unless expresly commanded by
the Princess. She appear'd there all negligent
and careless in her Dress, but yet she appear'd
all beautiful and charming. She saw, with
disdain, her Name, and her Colours, worn by
<HI>Don Alvaro,</HI> at a Publick Triumph; and if
<PB N="19" REF="135"/>
her Heart were capable of any tender Moti∣ons,
it was not for such a Man as he, for
whom her Delicacy destin'd them: She lookd
on him with a Contempt, which did not hin∣der
him from pressing so near, that there was
a necessity for her to hear, and what he had to
declare to her.</P>
<P><HI>She treated him not uncivily, but her Cold∣ness
would have rebated the Courage of any
but</HI> Alvaro. Madam, <HI>said he, (when he could
be heard of none but herself</HI>) I have hitherto
concealed the Passion you have inspir'd me with,
fearing it should displease you; but it has commit∣ted
a Violence on my Respect; and I could no longer
conceal it from you. I never reflected on your A∣ctions,
<HI>answer'd</HI> Agnes, <HI>with all the Indifference
of which she was capable,</HI> and if you think you of∣fend
me, you are in the wrong to make me perceive
it. This Coldness is but an ill Omen for me, <HI>reply'd
Don Alvaro,</HI> and if you have not found me out to
be your Lover to Day, I fear you will never approve
my Passion.</P>
<P>Oh! what a time you have chosen to make it
appear to me (<HI>pursu'd</HI> Agnes) is it so great an
Honour for me, that you must take such Care to shew
it to the World▪ And do you think that I am so
desirous of Glory, that I must aspire to it by your
Actions? If I must, you have very ill maintain'd
it in the Turnament; and if it be that Vanity that
you depend upon, you'll make no great Progress on
a Soul that is not fond of Shame. If you were
possest of all the Advantages, which the Prince has
this Day carried away, you yet ought to consider
what you are going about; and it is not a Maid
<PB N="20" REF="136"/>
like me, who is touch'd with Enterprizes, without
respect or permission.</P>
<P>The Favourite of the King, was too proud
to hear <HI>Agnes,</HI> without Indignation: But as he
was willing to conceal it, and not offend her,
he made not his Resentment appear; and con∣sidering
the Observation she made on the
Triumphs of <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> (which encreased his
Jealousies:) <HI>If I have not overcome at the Turna∣ment,</HI>
reply'd he, <HI>I am not the less in Love for
being vanquish'd, nor less capable of success on oc∣casions.</HI></P>
<P>They were interrupted here, but from that
Day, <HI>Don Alvaro,</HI> who had open'd the first
Difficulties, kept no more his wonted Di∣stance,
but perpetually persecuted <HI>Agnes;</HI> yet
tho' he were protected by the King, that in∣spir'd
in her never the more Consideration for
him. <HI>Don Pedro</HI> was always ignorant by what
Means the Verses he had lost in the Garden,
fell into the Hands of <HI>Constantia:</HI> As the Prin∣cess
appeared to him Indulgent, he was only
concerned for <HI>Agnes;</HI> and the Love of <HI>Don
Alvaro,</HI> which was then so well known, in∣creas'd
the Pain; and had he been possest of
the Authority, he would not have suffer'd
her to have been expos'd to the Persecutions
of so unworthy a Rival. He was also afraid
of the King's being advertised of his Passion,
but he thought not at all of <HI>Elvira</HI>'s, nor
apprehended any Malice from her Resent∣ment.</P>

While she burnt with a Desire of destroy∣ing
<HI>Agnes,</HI> against whom she vented all her
Venom; and she was never weary of making
new Reports to her Brother, assuring him,
that tho' they could not prove, that <HI>Agnes</HI>
made any returns to the Tenderness of the
Prince; yet that was the Cause of <HI>Constantia</HI>'s
Grief. And, that if this Princess should die
of it, <HI>Don Pedro</HI> might marry <HI>Agnes.</HI> In fine,
she so incens'd the jealous <HI>Don Alvaro</HI>'s Jealou∣sie,
that he could not hinder himself from run∣ning
immediately to the King, with the Dis∣covery
of all he knew, and all he guest, and
whom he had the Pleasure to find, was infinite∣ly
inrag'd at the News. <HI>My dear</HI> Alvaro, said
the King, <HI>you shall instantly marry this dangerous
Beauty: And let Possession; assure your Repose and
mine. If I have protected you in other Occasions,
judge what a Service of so great an Importance for
me, would make me undertake; and without any re∣serve,
the Forces of this State are in your Power,
and almost any thing that I can give, shall be assu∣red
you, so you render your self Master of the De∣stiny
of</HI> Agnes.</P>
<P><HI>Don Alvaro</HI> pleas'd, and vain with his Ma∣ster's
Bounty, made use of all the Authority
he gave him: He passionately lov'd <HI>Agnes,</HI> and
would not, on the sudden, make use of Vio∣lence;
but resolv'd with himself to employ all
possible Means to win her fairly; but if that
fail'd, to have recourse to force, if she conti∣nued
always insensible.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="137"/>
While <HI>Agnes de Castro</HI> (importun'd by his
Assiduities, despairing at the Grief of <HI>Constan∣tia,</HI>
and perhaps made tender by those she had
caus'd in the Prince of <HI>Portugal</HI>) took a Reso∣lution
worthy of her Vertue; yet, amiable as
<HI>Don Pedro</HI> was, she found nothing in him, but
his being Husband to <HI>Constantia,</HI> that was dear
to her: And far from encouraging the Power
she had got over his Heart, she thought of no∣thing
but removing from <HI>Coimbra;</HI> the Passion
of <HI>Don Alvaro,</HI> which she had no inclination to
favour, serv'd her as a Pretext, and press'd
with the fear of causing, in the End, a cruel
Divorce between the Prince and his Princess,
she went to find <HI>Constantia,</HI> with a Trouble,
which all her Care was not able to hide from
her.</P>
<P><HI>The Princess easily found it out; and their
common Misfortune having not chang'd their
Friendship:</HI>—What ails you, <HI>Agnes? said the
Princess to her, in a soft Tone, and her ordi∣nary
Sweetness;</HI> And what new Misfortune causes
that Sadness in thy Looks? Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> Agnes,
<HI>shedding a Rivulet of Tears,</HI> the Obligations
and Tyes I have to you, put me upon a cruel Tryal;
I had bounded the Felicity of my Life in hope of pas∣sing
it near your Highness; yet I must carry, to
some other part of the World, this unlucky Face of
mine, which renders me nothing but ill Offices: And
itis to obtain that Liberty, that I am come to throw
myself at your Feet; looking upon you as my Sove∣reign.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="137"/>
Constantia <HI>was so surpriz'd and touch'd with
the Proposition of</HI> Agnes, <HI>that she lost her
Speech for some Moments; Tears, which were
sincere, express'd her first Sentiments: And
after having shed abundance, to give a new
Mark of her Tenderness to the Fair afflicted</HI>
Agnes, <HI>she with a sad and melancholy Look,
fix'd her Eyes upon her, and holding out her
Hand to her, in a most obliging manner, sigh∣ing;
cry'd,</HI>—You will then, my dear <HI>Agnes,</HI>
leave me? and expose me to the Griefs of seeing you
no more? Alas, Madam, <HI>interrupted this love∣ly
Maid,</HI> hide from the unhappy <HI>Agnes</HI> a Bounty,
which does but increase her Misfortunes. It is not
I, Madam, that would leave you, it is my Duty,
and my Reason that orders my Fate. And those
Days which I shall pass far from you, promise me
nothing to oblige me to this Design, if I did not see
myself absolutely forc'd to it: I am not ignorant of
what passes at <HI>Coimbra;</HI> and I shall be an Ac∣complice
of the Injustice there committed, if I
should stay there any longer.—Ah, I
I know your Vertue, <HI>cry'd</HI> Constantia, and you may
remain here, in all safety, while I am your Pro∣tectress;
and let what will happen, I will accuse you
of nothing. There's no answering for what's to
come, <HI>reply'd</HI> Agnes, <HI>sadly;</HI> and I shall be suf∣ficiently
Guilty, if my Presence cause Sentiments,
which cannot be innocent. Beside, Madam, the
Importunities of <HI>Don Alvaro</HI> are insupportable to
me; and though I find nothing but Aversion for
him, since the King protects his Insolence, and he's
in a Condition of undertaking any thing, my Flight
is absolutely necessary: But, Madam, though he
<PB N="24" REF="138"/>
has nothing but what seems odious to me; I ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Heaven to witness, that if I could cure the Prince
by marrying <HI>Don Alvaro,</HI> I would not consider of
it a Moment; and finding in my Punishment the
Consolation of sacrificing my self to my Princess, I
would support it without murmuring. But if I were
the Wife of <HI>Don Alvaro, Don Pedro</HI> would al∣ways
look upon me with the same Eyes: So that I
find nothing more reasonable for me, than to hide
myself in some Corner of the World; where, though
I shall most certainly live without Pleasure, yet I
shall preserve the Repose of my dearest Mistress. All
the Reason you find in this Design, <HI>answered the
Princess,</HI> cannot oblige me to approve of your Ab∣sence:
Will it restore me the Heart of <HI>Don Pedro?</HI>
And will he not fly away with you? his Grief is mine,
and my Life is ty'd to his; do not make him despair
then, if you love me. I know ye, I tell you so once
more; and let your Power be never so great over the
Heart of the Prince, I will not suffer you to aban∣don
us.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Agnes</HI> thought she had perfectly
known <HI>Constantia,</HI> yet she did not expect to
find so intire a Vertue in her, which made her
think herself more happy, and the Prince more
criminal. <HI>Oh, Wisdom! Oh, Bounty without Ex∣ample!</HI>
(cry'd she) <HI>Why is it, that the cruel De∣stinies
do not give you all you deserve? You are the
Disposer of my Actions,</HI> continu'd she (in kissing
the Hand of <HI>Constantia</HI>) I'll do nothing but what
you'll have me: But consider, weigh well the Rea∣sons
that ought to counsel you in the Measures you
oblige me to take.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="138"/>
Don Pedro, <HI>who had not seen the Princess all
that Day, came in then, and finding 'em both
extreamly troubled; with a fierce Impatience,
demanded the Cause:</HI> Sir, <HI>answered</HI> Constan∣tia,
<HI>Agnes</HI> too wise, and too scrupulous, fears the
Effects of her Beauty, and will live no longer at
<HI>Coimbra;</HI> and it was on this Subject, (which can∣not
be agreeable to me) that she ask'd my Advice.
<HI>The Prince grew pale at this Discourse, and
snatching the Words from her Mouth (with
more concern, than possest either of them)
cry'd with a Voice very feeble, Agnes</HI> cannot
fail, if she follow your Councel Madam; and I
leave you full liberty to give it her. <HI>He then im∣mediately
went out, and the Princess, whose
Heart he perfectly possest, not being able to
hide her Displeasure, said,</HI> My dear <HI>Agnes,</HI> if
my Satisfaction did not only depend on your Conver∣sation,
I should desire it of you, for <HI>Don Pedro</HI>'s
sake; it is the only Advantage that his unfortunate
Love can hope: And would not the World have rea∣son
to call me Barbarous, if I contributed to deprive
him of that? But the sight of me will prove a Poyson
to him,—<HI>reply'd</HI> Agnes, And what should I
do, my Princess, if after the Reserve he has hitherto
kept, his Mouth should add any thing to the Tor∣ments
I have already felt, by speaking to me of his
Flame? You would hear him sure, without causing
him to despair, <HI>reply'd</HI> Constantia; and I should
put this Obligation to the Account of the rest you
have done. Would you then have me expect those
Events which I fear, Madam? <HI>reply'd</HI> Agnes;
Well—I will obey, but just Heavens, <HI>pursued
she,</HI> if they prove fatal, do not punish an innocent
<PB N="26" REF="139"/>
Heart for it. <HI>Thus this Conversation ended▪</HI>
Agnes <HI>withdrew into her Chamber, but it was
not to be more at ease.</HI></P>
<P>What <HI>Don Pedro</HI> had learn'd of the Design
of <HI>Agnes,</HI> caus'd a cruel Agitation in his Soul;
he wish'd he had never lov'd her, and desir'd a
thousand times to die: But it was not for him
to make Vows against a thing which Fate
had design'd him; and whatever Resolutions
he made, to bear the Absence of <HI>Agnes,</HI> his
Tenderness had not force enough to consent
to it.</P>
<P>After having, for a long time, combated
with himself, he determin'd to do, what was
impossible for him, to let <HI>Agnes</HI> do. His Cou∣rage
reproach'd him with the Idleness, in which
he past the most Youthful and Vigorous of his
Days; and making it appear to the King, that
his Allies, and even the Prince <HI>Don John Ema∣nuel,</HI>
his Father-in-Law, had Concerns in the
World, which demanded his Presence on the
Frontiers; he easily obtain'd Liberty to make
this Journey, to which the Princess would put
no Obstacle.</P>
<P><HI>Agnes</HI> saw him part without any Concern,
but it was not upon the Account of any Aver∣sion
she had for him. <HI>Don Alvaro</HI> began then
to make his Importunity, an open Persecution;
he forgot nothing that might touch the insen∣sible
<HI>Agnes,</HI> and made use, a long time, only of
the Arms of Love: But seeing that this Sub∣missions
and Respect was to no purpose, he
form'd strange Designs.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="139"/>
As the King had a Deference for all his
Counsels, it was not difficult to inspire him
with what he had a Mind to: He complain'd
of the ungrateful <HI>Agnes,</HI> and forgot nothing
that might make him perceive that she was not
cruel to him, on his Account; but from the
too much Sensibility she had for the Prince.
The King, who was extream angry at this, re∣iterated
all the Promises he had made him.</P>
<P><HI>The King had not yet spoke to</HI> Agnes, <HI>in fa∣vour
of</HI> Don Alvaro; <HI>and not doubting but his
Approbation would surmount all Obstacles,
he took an occasion to entertain her with it:
And removing some distance from those who
might hear him,</HI> I thought <HI>Don Alvaro</HI> had Me∣rit
enough, <HI>said he to her,</HI> to have obtain'd a lit∣tle
share in your Esteem; and I could not imagine,
there would have been any necessity of my solliciting
it for him: I know you are very charming, but he
has nothing that renders him unworthy of you; and
when you shall reflect on the Choice my Friendship has
made of him, from among all the Great Men of my
Court, you will do him, at the same time, Justice.
His Fortune is none of the meanest, since he has me
for his Protector: He is nobly born, a Man of Ho∣nour
and Courage; he adores you, and it seems to
me, that all these Reasons are sufficient to vanquish
your Pride.</P>
<P><HI>The Heart of</HI> Agnes <HI>was so little disposed to
give itself to</HI> Don Alvaro, <HI>that all that the King
of</HI> Portugal <HI>had said, had no Effect on her, in
his favour.</HI> If <HI>Don Alvaro,</HI> Sir, <HI>answered she,</HI>
were without Merit, he possest Advantages enough
in the Bounty your Majesty is pleased to Honour him
<PB N="28" REF="140"/>
with, to make him Master of all things,; it is not
that I find any Defect in him, that I answer not his
Desires: But, Sir, by what obstinate Power, would
you that I should Love, if Heaven has not given
me a Soul that is tender? And why should you pre∣tend
that I should submit to him, when nothing is
dearer to me than my Liberty? You are not so free,
nor so insensile, as you say, (<HI>answered the King,
blushing, with Anger;</HI>) and if your Heart were
exempt from all sorts of Affection, he might expect a
more reasonable Return than what he finds. But im∣prudent
Maid, conducted by an ill Fate, <HI>added he,
in Fury,</HI> what Pretensions have you to <HI>Don Pe∣dro?</HI>
Hitherto, I have hid the Chagreen, which
his Weakness, and yours gave me; but it was not the
less violent for being hid: And since you oblige me
to break out, I must tell you, that if my Son were
not already married to <HI>Constantia,</HI> he should never
be your Husband; renounce then those vain Ideas,
which will cure him, and justifie you.</P>
<P>The couragious <HI>Agnes</HI> was scarce Mistress
of the first Transports, at a Discourse so full
of Contempt; but calling her Vertue to the aid
of her Anger, she recover'd herself by the assi∣stance
of Reason: And considering the Out∣rage
she receiv'd, not as coming from a Great
King, but a Man blinded and possest by <HI>Don
Alvaro,</HI> she thought him not worthy of her
Resentment; her fair Eyes animated them∣selves
with so shining a vivacity, they answered
for the purity of her Sentiments; and fixing
them stedfastly on the King. <HI>If the Prince,</HI> Don
Pedro <HI>have Weaknesses,</HI> (reply'd she, with an
Air disdainful) <HI>he never communicated 'em to me;
<PB N="29" REF="140"/>
and I am certain, I never contributed wilfully to
'em: But to let you see how little I regard your
Defiance, and to put my Glory in safety, I will live
far from you, and all that belongs to you: Yes, Sir,
I will quit</HI> Coimbra <HI>with pleasure; and for this
Man, who is so dear to you,</HI> (answer'd she with
a noble Pride and Fierceness, of which the
King felt all the Force) <HI>for this Favourite, so
worthy to possess the most tender affections of a great
Prince, I assure you, that into whatever part of the
World Fortune conducts me, I will not carry away
the least Remembrance of him.</HI> At these words
she made a profound Reverence, and made
such haste from his Presence, that he could not
oppose her going if he would.</P>
<P>The King was now more strongly convinc'd
than ever, that she favoured the Passion of Don
<HI>Pedro,</HI> and immediately went to <HI>Constantia,</HI> to
inspire her with the same thought; but she was
not capable of receiving such Impressions, and
following her own natural Inclinations, she
generously defended the Virtue of <HI>Actions.</HI> The
King angry to see her so well intentioned to
her Rival, whom he would have had her ha∣ted,
reproached her with the sweetness of her
Temper, and went thence to mix his Anger
with Don <HI>Alvaro</HI>'s Rage, who was totally con∣founded
when he saw the Negotiation of his
Master had taken no effect. The haughty
Maid braves me then, Sir, said he to the King,
and despises the Honour which your Bounty
offered her! Why cannot I resist so fatal a
Passion? But I must love her, in spight of my
self; and if this Flame consume me, I can find
<PB N="30" REF="141"/>
no way to extinguish it; what can I farther
do for you, replied the King? Alas, Sir, an∣swer'd
Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI> I must do by force, what I
cannot otherwise hope from the Proud and
Cruel <HI>Agnes.</HI> Well then, added the King,
since it is not fit for me to Authorize publickly
a Violence in the midst of my Kingdom, chuse
those of my Subjects which you think most ca∣pable
of serving you, and take away by force
the Beauty that charms you, and if she do not
yield to your Love, put that Power you are
Master of in execution, to oblige her to mar∣ry
you.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI> ravish'd with this Proposition,
which at the same time flatter'd both his Love
and Anger, cast himself at the feet of the King,
and renew'd his Acknowledgments by fresh
Protestations, and thought of nothing but em∣ploying
his unjust Authority against <HI>Agnes.</HI></P>
<P>Don <HI>Pedro</HI> had been about three months ab∣sent,
when <HI>Alvaro</HI> undertook what the King
counsell'd him to; tho' the Moderation was
known to him, yet he feared his Presence, and
would not attend the Return of a Rival, with
whom he would avoid all Disputes.</P>
<P>One Night, when the sad <HI>Agnes,</HI> full of her
ordinary Inquietudes, in vain expected the
God of Sleep, she heard a noise, and after saw
some Men unknown enter her Chamber, whose
Measures being well consulted, they carried her
out of the Palace, and putting her in a close
Coach, forc'd her out of <HI>Coimbra,</HI> without be∣ing
hinder'd by any Obstacle. She knew not
of whom to complain, nor whom to suspect;
<PB N="31" REF="141"/>
Don <HI>Alvaro</HI> seem'd too puissant to seek his sa∣tisfaction
this way; and she accus'd not the
Prince of this Attempt, of whom she had so
favourable an Opinion; whatever she could
think or say, she could not hinder her ill For∣tune:
They hurried her on with diligence, and
before it was Day, were a considerable way off
from the Town.</P>
<P>As soon as Day began to break, she surveyed
those that encompassed her, without so much
as knowing one of them; and seeing that her
Cries and Prayers were all in vain with these
deaf Ravishers, she satisfied herself with im∣ploring
the Protection of Heaven, and aban∣don'd
herself to its Conduct.</P>
<P>While she sate thus overwhelmed with grief,
uncertain of her Destiny, she saw a Body of
Horse advance towards the Troop which con∣ducted
her; the Ravishers did not shun them,
thinking it to be Don <HI>Alvaro;</HI> but when he
approached more near, they found it was the
Prince of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who was at the Head of
'em, and who, without foreseeing the occasion
that would offer itself of serving <HI>Agnes,</HI> was
returning to <HI>Coimbra</HI> full of her Idea, after ha∣ving
performed what he ought in this Expe∣dition.</P>
<P><HI>Agnes,</HI> who did not expect him, changed
now her Opinion, and thought that it was the
Prince that had caused her to be stolen away.
<HI>Oh, Sir,</HI> said she to him, <HI>having still the same
Thought, Is it you that have torn me from the
Princess? and could so cruel a Blow come from
a Hand that is so dear to her, what will you
<PB N="32" REF="142"/>
do with an Ʋnfortunate Creature, who desires
nothing but Death? and why will you obscure
the Glory of your Life, by an Artifice unwor∣thy
of you?</HI> This Language astonish'd the
Prince no less than the Sight of <HI>Agnes</HI> had
done; he found by what she had said, that
she was taken away by force; and immediate∣ly
passing to the height of Rage, he made
her understand by one only Look, that he was
not the base Author of her Trouble. <HI>I tear
you from</HI> Constantia, <HI>whose only Pleasure you are,</HI>
replied he: <HI>What Opinion have you of Don</HI> Pe∣dro?
<HI>No, Madam, though you see me here, I am
altogether innocent of the Violence that has been done
you; and there is nothing I will refuse to hinder it.</HI>
He then turned himself to behold the Ra∣vishers,
but his Presence had already scattered
'em: he ordered some of his Men to pursue
'em, and to seize some of 'em, that he might
know what Authority it was that set 'em at
work.</P>
<P>During this, <HI>Agnes</HI> was no less confus'd than
before; she admir'd the Conduct of her Desti∣ny,
that brought the Prince at a time when he
was so necessary to her: Her Inclinations to
do him Justice, soon repair'd the Offence her
Suspicions had caus'd; she was glad to have
escap'd a Misfortune, which appear'd certain
to her; but this was not a sincere Joy, when
she consider'd that her Lover was her Delive∣rer,
and a Lover worthy of all her Acknow∣ledgments,
but who ow'd his Heart to the most
amiable Princess in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="142"/>
While the Prince's Men were pursuing the
Ravishers of <HI>Agnes,</HI> he was left almost alone
with her; and tho' he had always resolv'd to
shun being so, yet his Constancy was not Proof
against so fair an Occasion: <Q>Madam, said
he to her, is it possible that Men born a∣mongst
those that obey us, should be capa∣ble
of offending you? I never thought my
self destin'd to revenge such an Offence; but
since Heaven has permitted you to receive
it, I will either perish or make them repent it.
Sir, replied <HI>Agnes,</HI> more concern'd at this
course than at the Enterprize of Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI>
those who are wanting in their Respect to the
Princess and you, are not oblig'd to have any
for me. I do not in the least doubt but Don
<HI>Alvaro</HI> was the Undertaker of this Enterprize,
and I judg'd what I ought to fear from him,
by what his Importunities have already made
me suffer. He is sure of the King's Protection,
and he will make him an Accomplice in his
Crime; but, Sir, Heaven conducted you hither
happily for me, and I owe you for the liberty
I have of serving the Princess yet longer.
You will do for <HI>Constantia,</HI> replied the Prince,
what 'tis impossible not to do for you; your
Goodness attaches you to her, and my Desti∣ny
engages me to you for ever.</Q></P>
<P>The modest <HI>Agnes,</HI> who fear'd this Discourse
as much as the Misfortune she had newly shun∣ned,
answer'd nothing but by down-cast Eyes,
and the Prince, who knew the trouble she was
in, left her to go speak to his Men, who brought
back one of those that belong'd to Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="143"/>
by whose Confession he found the Truth: He
pardon'd him, thinking not fit to punish him,
who obey'd a Man whom the weakness of his
Father had render'd powerful.</P>
<P>Afterwards they conducted <HI>Agnes</HI> back to
<HI>Coimbra,</HI> where her Adventure began to make
a great noise: The Princess was ready to die
with Despair, and at first thought it was only
a continuation of the Design this fair Maid
had of retiring; but some Women that serv'd
her having told the Princess, that she was car∣ried
away by Violence, <HI>Constantia</HI> made her
Complaint to the King, who regarded her not
at all.</P>
<P><Q>Madam, said he to her, let this fatal Plague
remove itself, who takes from you the Heart
of your Husband, and without afflicting your
self for her Absence, bless Heaven and me
for it.</Q></P>
<P>The Generous Princess took <HI>Agnes</HI>'s part
with a great deal of Courage, and was then
disputing her defence with the King, when
Don <HI>Pedro</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Coimbra.</HI></P>
<P>The first Object that met the Prince's Eyes
was Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI> who was passing through one
of the Courts of the Palace, amidst a Croud of
Courtiers, whom his favour with the King
drew after him. This Sight made Don <HI>Pedro</HI>
rage; but that of the Princess and <HI>Agnes</HI>
caus'd in him another sort of Emotion: He
easily divin'd, that it was Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> who had
taken her from his Men, and, if his Fury had
acted what it would, it might have produc'd
very sad effects.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="143"/>
<Q>Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI> said the Prince to him, is it
thus you make use of the Authority which
the King my Father has given you? Have
you receiv'd Employments and Power from
him for no other end but to do base Actions,
and to commit Rapes on Ladies? Are you
ignorant how the Princess interests herself
in all that concerns this Maid? And do you
not know the tender and affectionate Esteem
she has for her? No, replied Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI></Q>
(with an Insolence that had like to have put
the Prince past all Patience) <Q>I am not igno∣rant
of it, nor of the Interest your Heart
takes in her. Base and treacherous as thou
art, replied the Prince, neither the Favour
which thou hast so much abused, nor the In∣solence
which makes thee speak this, should
hinder me from punishing thee, wert thou
worthy of my Sword; but there are other
ways to humble thy Pride, and 'tis not fit
for such an Arm as mine to seek so base an
Imployment to punish such a Slave as thou
art.</Q></P>
<P>Don <HI>Pedro</HI> went away at these words, and
left <HI>Alvaro</HI> in a Rage, which is not to be ex∣press'd,
despairing to see himself defeated in an
Enterprize he thought so sure, and at the Con∣tempt
the Prince shew'd him, he promised him∣self
to sacrifice all to his Revenge.</P>
<P>Tho' the King loved his Son, he was so pre∣possess'd
against his Passion, that he could not
pardon him what he had done, and condemn'd
him as much for this last Act of Justice, in de∣livering
<HI>Agnes,</HI> as if it had been the greatest of
Crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="144"/>
<HI>Elvira,</HI> whom the sweetness of Hope flatter'd
some moments, saw the return of <HI>Agnes</HI> with
a sensible Displeasure, which suffer'd her to
think of nothing but irritating her Brother.</P>
<P>In fine, the Prince saw the King, but instead
of being receiv'd by him with a Joy due to the
success of his Journey, he appear'd all sullen
and out of Humour. After having paid him
his first Respects, and gave him an exact
account of what he had done, he spoke to him
about the Violence committed against the Per∣son
of <HI>Agnes de Castro,</HI> and complain'd to him
of it in the Name of the Princess, and of his
own: <Q>You ought to be silent in this Affair,
replied the King, and the Motive which
makes you speak is so shameful for you, that
I sigh and blush at it: What is it to you, if
this Maid, whose Presence is troublesome to
me, be remov'd hence, since 'tis I that de∣sire
it? But, Sir, interrupted the Prince,
what necessity is there of employing Force,
Artifice, and the Night, when the least of
your Orders had been sufficient; <HI>Agnes</HI> would
willingly have obey'd you, and if she conti∣nue
at <HI>Coimbra,</HI> 'tis perhaps against her will;
but be it as it will, Sir, <HI>Constantia</HI> is offended,
and if it were not for fear of displeasing you,
(the only thing that retains me) the Ravisher
should not have gone unpunish'd. How hap∣py
are you, replied the King, smiling with
Disdain, in making use of the Name of <HI>Con∣stantia</HI>
to uphold the Interest of your Heart;
you think I am ignorant of it, and that this
unhappy Princess looks on the Injury you
<PB N="37" REF="144"/>
do her with Indifference. Never speak to me
more of <HI>Agnes,</HI> (with a Tone very severe)
Content your self, that I pardon what's past,
and think maturely of the Considerations I
have for <HI>Don Alvaro,</HI> when you would de∣sign
any thing against him. Yes, Sir, re∣ply'd
the Prince, with fierceness, I will speak
to you no more of <HI>Agnes,</HI> but <HI>Constantia,</HI> and
I will never suffer, that she should be any
more expos'd to the Insolence of your Fa∣vourite.</Q>
The King had like to have broke
out into Rage at this Discourse; but he had
yet a Rest of Prudence left, that hinder'd him.
<Q>Retire, (said he to <HI>Don Pedro</HI>) and go make
Reflections on what my Power can do, and
what you owe me.</Q></P>
<P>During this Conversation, <HI>Agnes</HI> was recei∣ving
from the Princess, and from all the Ladies
of the Court, great Expressions of Joy, and
Friendship, <HI>Constantia</HI> saw again her Husband,
with a great deal of satisfaction, and far from
being sorry at what he had lately done for
<HI>Agnes,</HI> she privately return'd him Thanks for
it, and still was the same towards him, not∣withstanding
all the Jealousie which was endea∣vour'd
to be inspir'd in her.</P>
<P><HI>Don Alvaro,</HI> who found in his Sister a Mali∣ciousness
worthy of his Trust, did not conceal
his Fury from her. After she had made vain
Attempts to moderate it, in blotting <HI>Agnes</HI> out
of his Heart, seeing that his Disease was incu∣rable,
she made him understand, that so long
as <HI>Constantio</HI> should not be Jealous, there was
<PB N="38" REF="145"/>
no Hopes. That if <HI>Agnes</HI> should once be su∣spected
by her, she would not fail of aban∣doning
her, and that then it would be easie
to get Satisfaction, the Prince being now so
proud of <HI>Constantia</HI>'s Indulgency. In giving
this Advice to her Brother, she promis'd to
serve him effectually; and having no need of
any Body but herself to perform Ill Things, she
recommended <HI>Don Alvaro</HI> to manage well the
King.</P>
<P>Four Years were pass'd in that melancho∣ly
Station, and the Princess, besides her first
dead Child, and <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who was still
living, had brought two Daughters into the
World.</P>
<P>Some Days after <HI>Don Pedro</HI>'s Return, <HI>Elvira,</HI>
who was most dextrous in the Art of Well-governing
any wicked Design, did gain one
of the Servants which belong'd to <HI>Constantia</HI>'s
Chamber. She first spoke her fair, then over∣whelm'd
her with Presents and Gifts, and
finding in her as ill a Disposition as in herself,
she readily resolv'd to employ her.</P>
<P>After she was sure of her, she compos'd a
Letter, which was after writ over again in
an unknown Hand, which she deposited in that
Maid's Hands, that she might deliver to <HI>Con∣stantia</HI>
with the first Opportunity, telling her,
that <HI>Agnes</HI> had drop'd it. This was the Sub∣stance
of it.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> Employ not my own Hand to write to you, for
Reasons that I shall acquaint you with. How
<PB N="39" REF="145"/>
happy am I to have overcome all your Scruples!
And what Happiness shall I find in the Progress of
our Intrigue! The whole Course of my Life, shall
continually represent to you the Sincerity of my Af∣fections;
pray think on the Secret Conversation that
I require of you; I dare not speak to you in publick,
therefore let me conjure you here, by all that I have
suffer'd, to come to Night to the Place appointed, and
speak to me no more of <HI>Constantia;</HI> for she must
be content with my Esteem, since my Heart can be
only Yours.</P>
<P>The unfaithful <HI>Portuguese</HI> serv'd <HI>Elvira</HI> exact∣ly
to her Desires, and the very next Day seeing
<HI>Agnes</HI> go out from the Princess, she carry'd
<HI>Constantia</HI> the Letter; which she took, and
found there what she was far from imagining:
Tenderness never produc'd an Effect more
full of Grief, than what it made her suffer:
<HI>Alas, they are both culpable</HI> (said she, sighing)
<HI>and in spight of the Defence my Heart wou'd make
for 'em, my Reason Condemns 'em. Ʋnhappy Prin∣cess,
the sad Subject of the Capriciousness of For∣tune!
Why dost not thou die, since thou hast not a
Heart of Honour to revenge itself? O</HI> Don Pedro!
<HI>Why did you give me your Hand, without your Heart?
And thou, Fair, and Ʋngrateful! Wert thou born
to be the Misfortune of my Life, and, perhaps, the
only Cause of my Death.</HI> After having given
some Moments to the Violence of her Grief,
she call'd the Maid, who brought her the Let∣ter,
commanding her to speak of it tono Bo∣dy,
and to suffer no one to enter into her
Chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="146"/>
She consider'd then of that Prince with more
liberty, whose Soul she was not able to touch
with the least Tenderness; and of the cruel
fair One that had betray'd her: Yet, even
while her Soul was upon the Rack, she was wil∣ling
to excuse 'em, and ready to do all she could
for Don <HI>Pedro;</HI> at least, she made a firm Re∣solution,
not to complain of him.</P>
<P><HI>Elvira</HI> was not long without being inform'd
of what had pass'd, nor of the Melancholly of
the Princess, from whom she hop'd all she de∣sir'd.</P>
<P><HI>Agnes,</HI> far from foreseeing this Tempest, re∣turn'd
to <HI>Constantia;</HI> and hearing of her Indis∣position,
pass'd the rest of the day at her Cham∣ber-door,
that she might from time to time
learn News of her Health, for she was not suf∣fer'd
to come in, at which <HI>Agnes</HI> was both sur∣priz'd
and troubled. The Prince had the
same Destiny, and was astonish'd at an Order
which ought to have excepted him.</P>
<P>The next day <HI>Constantia</HI> appear'd, but so al∣ter'd,
that 'twas not difficult to imagine what
she had suffer'd. <HI>Agnes</HI> was the most impatient
to approach her, and the Princess could not
forbear weeping. They were both silent for
some time, and <HI>Constantia</HI> attributed this Silence
of <HI>Agnes</HI> to some Remorse which she felt; and
this unhappy Maid being able to hold no lon∣ger,
<HI>Is it possible Madam,</HI> (said she,) <HI>that two
Days should have taken from me all the Goodness
you had for me? What have I done? And for
what do you punish me?</HI> The Princess regarded
her with a languishing look, and return'd her
<PB N="41" REF="146"/>
no Answer, but Sighs. <HI>Agnes,</HI> offended at this
Reserve, went out with very great Dissatisfa∣ction
and Anger; which contributed to her
being thought criminal. The Prince came in
immediately after, and found <HI>Constantia</HI> more
disorder'd than usual, and conjur'd her in a
most obliging manner to take care of her
Health: <HI>The greatest good for me</HI> (said she) <HI>is
not the Continuation of my Life; I should have
more Care of it if I lov'd you less; but</HI>—She
could not proceed; and the Prince, exces∣sively
afflicted at her trouble, sigh'd sadly,
without making her any Answer, which re∣doubled
her Grief. Spight then began to mix
itself; and all things perswading the Princess
that they made a Sacrafice of her, she would
enter into no Explanation with her Husband,
but suffer'd him to go away without saying a∣ny
thing to him.</P>
<P>Nothing is more capable of troubling our
Reason, and consuming our Health, then se∣cret
Notions of Jealousie in Solitude.</P>
<P><HI>Constantia,</HI> who us'd to open her Heart free∣ly
to <HI>Agnes,</HI> now believing she had deceiv'd
her, abandon'd herself so absolutely to Grief,
that she was ready to sink under it; she imme∣diately
fell sick with the violence of it, and all
the Court was concern'd at this Misfortune:
Don <HI>Pedro</HI> was truly afflicted at it, but <HI>Agnes</HI>
more than all the World beside. <HI>Constantia</HI>'s
Coldness towards her, made her continually
sigh; and her Distemper, created meerly by
Fancy, caus'd her to reflect on every thing that
offer'd itself to her Memory; so that at last
<PB N="42" REF="147"/>
she began even to fear herself, and to reproach
herself for what the Princess suffer'd.</P>
<P>But the Distemper began to be such, that
they fear'd <HI>Constantia</HI>'s Death, and she herself
began to feel the Approaches of it. This
Thought did not at all disquiet her; she look'd
on Death as the only Relief from all her Tor∣ments;
and regarded the Despair of all that
approach'd her without the least concern.</P>
<P><HI>The King, who lov'd her tenderly, and who
knew her Vertue, was infinitely mov'd at the
Extremity she was in. And Don</HI> Alvaro, <HI>who
lost not the least Occasion of making him un∣derstand,
that it was Jealousie which was the
Cause of</HI> Constantia<HI>'s Distemper, did but too
much incense him against Criminals worthy of
Compassion. The King was not of a Temper
to conceal his Anger long:</HI> You give fine Ex∣amples,
(<HI>said he to the Prince</HI>) and such as
will render your Memory illustrious; and the
Death of <HI>Constantia</HI> (of which you are only
to be accus'd of) is the unhappy Fruit of your
guilty Passion. Fear Heaven after this; and
behold yourself as a Monster that does not de∣serve
to see the Light. If the Interest you
have in my Blood did not plead for you, what
ought you not to fear from my just Resentment?
But what must not Imprudent <HI>Agnes,</HI> to
whom nothing ties me, expect from my hands?
If <HI>Constantia</HI> dyes, she, who has the Bold∣ness,
in my Court, to cherish a foolish Flame
by vain Hopes, and make us lose the most
Amiable Princess, whom thou art not worthy to
possess, shall feel the Effects of her Indiscretion.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="147"/>
<HI>Don</HI> Pedro <HI>knew very well, that</HI> Constantia
<HI>was not ignorant of his Sentiments for</HI> Agnes;
<HI>but he knew also with what Moderation she
receiv'd it: He was very sensible of the King's
Reproaches; but as his Fault was not volun∣tary,
and that a commanding Power, a fatal
Star had forc'd him to love in spight of him∣self,
he appear'd afflicted and confus'd:</HI> You
condemn me, Sir, (<HI>answered he</HI>) without having
well examin'd me; and if my Intentions were
known to you, perhaps you would not find me so
criminal: I would take the Princess for my
Judge, whom you say, I sacrifice, if she were
in a condition to be consulted. If I am guil∣ty
of any Weakness, her Justice never reproach'd
me for it; and my Tongue never inform'd <HI>Ag∣nes</HI>
of it. But, suppose I have committed any
Fault, why wou'd you punish an Innocent La∣dy,
who perhaps condemns me for it as much
as you? Ah, Villain! (<HI>interrupted the King,</HI>)
she has but too much favour'd you: You would
not have lov'd thus long, had she not made you
some Returns. Sir, (<HI>reply'd the Prince, pier∣ced
with Grief for the Outrage that was
committed against</HI> Agnes,) you offend a Ver∣tue,
than which nothing can be purer; and those
Expressions which break from your Choler, are
not worthy of you. <HI>Agnes</HI> never granted me
any Favours; I never asked any of her; and
I protest to Heaven, I never thought of any thing
contrary to the Duty I owe <HI>Constantia.</HI></P>
<P>As they thus argued, one of the Princess's
Women came all in Tears, to acquaint Don
<HI>Pedro,</HI> That the Princess was in the last Ex∣tremities
<PB N="44" REF="148"/>
of Life: <HI>Go see thy fatal Work,</HI> (said
the King,) <HI>and expect from a too-long-patient Fa∣ther
the Ʋsage thou deserv'st.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince ran to <HI>Constantia,</HI> whom he
found dying, and <HI>Agnes</HI> in a swoon, in the
Arms of some of the Ladies. What caus'd
this double Calamity, was, that <HI>Agnes,</HI> who
could suffer no longer the Indifferency of the
Princess, had conjur'd her to tell her what was
her Crime, and either to take her Life from
her, or restore her Friendship.</P>
<P>Constantia, <HI>who found she must die, could
no longer keep her secret Affliction from</HI> Ag∣nes;
<HI>and after some Words, which were a
Preparative to the sad Explanation, she shew'd
her that fatal Billet which</HI> Elvira <HI>had caus'd to
be written:</HI> Ah! Madam, (<HI>cry'd out the fair</HI>
Agnes, <HI>after having read it;</HI>) Ah, Madam!
How many cruel Inquietudes had you spar'd me, had
you open'd your Heart to me with your wonted Boun∣ty?
'Tis easy to see that this Letter is counterfeit,
and that I have Enemies without compassion. Cou'd
you believe the Prince so Impudent, to make use of a∣ny
other hand but his own, on an occasion like this?
And do you believe me so Simple, to keep about me
this Testimony of my Shame, with so little Precauti∣on?
You are neither betray'd by your Husband nor
me; I attest Heaven, and those Efforts I have made,
to leave <HI>Coimbra.</HI> Alas, my dear Princess! how
little have you known her, whom you have so much
honour'd? Do not believe, that when I have justi∣fy'd
myself, I will have any more Communication
with the World. No, no; there will be no Retreat
far enough from hence for me. I will take care to
<PB N="45" REF="148"/>
hide this unlucky Face, where it shall be sure to do no
more Harm.</P>
<P>The Princess touch'd at this Discourse, and
the Tears of <HI>Agnes,</HI> press'd her hand, which
she held in hers; and fixing looks upon her,
capable of moving pity in the most insensible
Souls, <HI>If I have committed any Offence, my dear</HI>
Agnes, (answer'd she) <HI>Death, which I expect
in a moment, shall revenge it. I ought also to pro∣test
to you, That I have not ceas'd loving you, and
that I believe every thing you have said, giving you
back my most tender Affections.</HI></P>
<P><HI>'Twas at this time that the Grief, which e∣qually
oppress'd 'em, put the Princess into
such an Extremity, that they sent for the
Prince. He came and found himself almost
without life or motion at this sight. And
what secret Motive soever might call him to
the Aid of</HI> Agnes, <HI>'twas to</HI> Constantia <HI>he ran.
The Princess, who finding her last Moments
drawing on, by a cold Sweat that cover'd her
all over; and finding she had no more busi∣ness
with Life, and causing those Persons she
most suspected to retire,</HI> Sir, (<HI>said she to Don</HI>
Pedro,) If I abandon Life without Regret, it is not
without Trouble that I part with you. But, Prince,
we must vanguish when we come to die; and I will
forget myself wholly, to think of nothing but of you.
I have no Reproaches to make against you, knowing
that 'tis Inclination that disposes Hearts, and not
Reason. <HI>Agnes</HI> is beautiful enough to inspire the
most ardent Passion, and vertuous enough to deserve
the first Fortunes in the World. I ask her, once
more, Pardon for the Injustice I have done her, and
<PB N="46" REF="149"/>
recommend her to you, as a Person most dear to me.
Promise me, my dear Prince, before I Expire, to
give her my Place in your Throne; it cannot be bet∣ter
fill'd; you cannot chuse a Princess more perfect
for your People, nor a better Mother for our little
Children. And you, my Dear, and my faithful
<HI>Agnes (pursu'd she</HI>) listen not to a Vertue too
scrupulous, that they may make any opposition to the
Prince of <HI>Portugal:</HI> Refuse him not a Heart, of
which he is worthy; and give him that Friendship
which you had for me, with that which is due to his
Merit. Take care of my little <HI>Fernando,</HI> and the
two young Princesses: let 'em find me in you, and
speak to 'em sometimes of me. Adieu; live both of
you happy, and receive my last Embraces.</P>
<P>The afflicted <HI>Agnes,</HI> who had recover'd a
little her Forces, lost 'em again a second time:
Her Weakness was follow'd with Convulsions
so vehement, that they were afraid of her
Life; but Don <HI>Pedro</HI> never remov'd from <HI>Con∣stantia:
What, Madam,</HI> (said he) <HI>you will leave
me then; and you think 'tis for my Good. Alas,</HI>
Constantia! <HI>if my Heart has committed any Out∣rage
against you, your Vertue has sufficiently reveng'd
you on me, in spight of you. Can you think me so
barbarous?</HI>—As he was going on, he saw
Death shut the Eyes of the most generous Prin∣cess
for ever; and he was within a very little
of following her.</P>
<P>But what loads of Grief was this for <HI>Agnes,</HI>
when she found that in that Interval, when
Life and Death were struggling in her Soul,
that <HI>Constantia</HI> was newly expir'd! She would
then have taken away her own Life, and have
let her Despair fully appear.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="149"/>
At the noise of the Death of the Princess,
the Town and the Palace was all in Tears. <HI>El∣vira,</HI>
who saw then Don <HI>Pedro</HI> free to engage
himself, repented of having contributed to the
Death of <HI>Agnes,</HI> who thought herself the cause
of it, promis'd her Griefs never to Pardon
herself.</P>
<P>She had need of being guarded several days
together; during which time, she fail'd not
incessantly to weep. And the Prince gave all
those days to deepest Mourning. But when
the first Emotions were past, those of his Love
made him feel that he was still the same.</P>
<P>He was a long time without seeing <HI>Agnes,</HI>
but this Absence of his serv'd only to make her
appear the more charming when he did see
her.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI> who was afraid of the Liberty
of the Prince, made new Efforts to move <HI>Ag∣nes
de Castro;</HI> who was now become insensible
to every thing but Grief. <HI>Elvira,</HI> who was
willing to make the best of the Design she had
begun, consulted all her Womens Arts, and
the delicacy of her Wit, to revive the Flames
with which the Prince once burnt for her:
But his Inconstancy was bounded, and it was
<HI>Agnes</HI> alone that was to reign over his Heart.
She had taken a firm Resolution, since the
Death of <HI>Constantia,</HI> to pass the rest of her days
in a solitary Retreat. In spight of the Precau∣tion
she took to hide this Design, the Prince
was inform'd of it, and did all he was able to
dispose his Constancy and Fortitude to it. He
thought himself stronger than he really was;

<PB N="47" REF="150"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="48" REF="151"/>
<HI>but after he had too well consulted his Heart,
he found but too well how necessary the Pre∣sence
of</HI> Agnes <HI>was to him:</HI> Madam, (<HI>said he
to her one day, with a Heart big, and his
Eyes in Tears</HI>) Which Action of my Life has made
you determine my Death? Though I never told you
now much I lov'd you, yet I am perswaded you are
not ignorant of it. I was constrain'd to be silent
during some Years for your sake, for <HI>Constantia</HI>'s
and my own; but 'tis not possible for me to put this
Force upon my Heart for ever: I must once at least
tell you how it languishes. Receive then the Assuran∣ces
of a Passion, full of Respect and Ardour; with
an Offer of my Fortune, which I wish not better, but
for your Advantage.</P>
<P>Agnes <HI>answer'd not immediately to these
Words, but with abundance of Tears; which
having wip'd away, and beholding Don</HI> Pedro
<HI>with an Air which made him easily compre∣hend
she did not agree with his Desires:</HI> If I
were capable of the Weakness with which you'd inspire
me, you'd be oblig'd to punish me for it. What! (<HI>said
she) Constantia</HI> is scarce bury'd, and you wou'd have
me offend her! No, my Princess, (<HI>added she
with more Softness;</HI>) No, no, she whom you
have heap'd so many Favours on, will not call down
the Anger of Heaven, and the Contempt of Men
upon her, by an Action so perfidious. Be not obsti∣nate
then in a Design in which I will never shew you
Favour. You owe to <HI>Constantia,</HI> after her Death,
a Fidelity that may justifie you: And I to repair the
Ills I have made her suffer, ought to shun all Converse
with you. Go, Madam, <HI>reply'd the Prince,
growing pale;</HI>) go, and expect the News of my
<PB N="49" REF="151"/>
Death, in that part of the World, whither your
Cruelty shall lead you, the News shall follow close af∣ter;
you shall quickly hear of it; and I will go seek
it in those Wars which reign among my Neighbours.</P>
<P><HI>These words made the fair</HI> Agnes de Castro
<HI>perceive that her Innocency was not so great
as she imagin'd, and that her Heart interested
itself in the Preservation of Don</HI> Pedro: You
ought, Sir, to preserve your Life, (<HI>reply'd</HI> Ag∣nes)
for the sake of the little Prince and Princesses,
which <HI>Constantia</HI> has left you. Wou'd you aban∣don
their Youth (<HI>continu'd she, with a tender
Tone</HI>) to the Cruelty of Don <HI>Alvaro?</HI> Live, Sir,
live! and let the unhappy <HI>Agnes</HI> be the only Sacri∣fice.
Alas, cruel Maid! (<HI>interrupted Don</HI> Pe∣dro;)
why do you command me to live, if I cannot
live with you? Is it an effect of your Hatred? No,
Sir, (<HI>replyed</HI> Agnes) I do not hate you; and I
wish to God that I cou'd be indifferent, that I might
be able to defend myself against the Weakness with
which I find myself possess'd. Oblige me to say no
more, Sir: You see my Blushes, interpret them as
you please; but consider yet, that the less Aversion I
find I have for you, the more culpable I am; and
that I ought no more to see, or speak to you. In fine,
Sir, if you oppose my Retreat, I declare to you, that
Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI> as odious as he is to me, shall serve
for a Defence against you; and that I will sooner
consent to marry a Man I abhor, than to favour a
Passion that cost <HI>Constantia</HI> her Life. Well then,
<HI>Agnes, (reply'd the Prince, with looks all lan∣guishing
and dying</HI>) follow the Motions which
barbarous Vertue inspires you with; take those Mea∣sures
you judge necessary, against an unfortunate Lo∣ver,
<PB N="50" REF="152"/>
and enjoy the Glory of having cruelly refus'd
me.</P>
<P>At these Words he went away; and as
troubled as <HI>Agnes</HI> was, she would not stay
him: Her Courage combated with her Grief,
and she thought now, more than ever of de∣parting.</P>
<P><HI>'Twas difficult for her to go out of</HI> Coimbra;
<HI>and not to defer what appear'd to her so ne∣cessary;
she went immediately to the Apart∣ment
of the King, notwithstanding the inter∣est
of Don</HI> Alvaro. <HI>the King receiv'd her
with a Countenance severe, not being able to
consent to what she demanded:</HI> You shall not
go hence, (<HI>said he</HI>) and if you are wise, you shall
enjoy here, with Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI> both my Friendship,
and my Favour. I have taken another Resolution,
(<HI>answer'd</HI> Agnes) and the World has no part in it.
You will accept Don <HI>Pedro, (reply'd the King;</HI>)
his Fortune is sufficient to satisfie an Ambitious
Maid: But you will not succeed <HI>Constantia,</HI> who
lov'd you so tenderly; and <HI>Spain</HI> has Princesses e∣nough
to fill up part of the Throne which I shall leave
him. Sir, (<HI>reply'd</HI> Agnes, <HI>piqu'd at this Dis∣course</HI>)
If I had a disposition to Love, and a de∣sign
to Marry, perhaps the Prince might be the on∣ly
Person on whom I would fix 'em: And you know,
if my Ancestors did not possess Crowns, yet they
were worthy to wear 'em. But let it be how it will,
I am resolv'd to depart, and to remain no longer a
Slave in a place to which I came Free.</P>
<P>This bold Answer, which shew'd the Cha∣racter
of <HI>Agnes,</HI> anger'd and astonish'd the
King: <HI>You shall go when we think fit,</HI> (reply'd he)
<PB N="51" REF="152"/>
<HI>and without being a Slave at</HI> Coimbra, <HI>you shall
attend our Orders.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Agnes</HI> saw she must stay, and was so griev'd
at it, that she kept her Chamber several days,
without daring to inform herself of the Prince;
and this Retirement spar'd her the Affliction
of being visited by Don <HI>Alvaro.</HI></P>
<P>During this, Don <HI>Pedro</HI> fell sick, and was
in so great Danger, that there was a general
Apprehension of his Death. <HI>Agnes</HI> did not in
the least doubt, but it was an Effect of his Dis∣content:
she thought at first she had strength
and resolution enough to see him die, rather
than to favour him; but had she reflected a lit∣tle,
she had soon been convinc'd to the contra∣ry:
She found not in her Heart that cruel Con∣stancy,
she thought there so well establish'd;
she felt Pains and Inquietude, shed Tears, made
Wishes; and in fine, discover'd that she
Lov'd.</P>
<P>'Twas impossible to see the Heir of the
Crown, a Prince that deserv'd so well, even
at the point of Death, without a general Affli∣ction:
The People who lov'd him, pass'd whole
days at the Palace-gate to hear News of him:
The Court was all overwhelm'd with Grief.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Alvaro</HI> knew very well how to conceal
a malicious Joy, under an Appearance of Sad∣ness.
<HI>Elvira,</HI> full of Tenderness, and per∣haps
of Remorse, suffer'd also on her side.
The King, altho' he condemn'd the Love of
his Son, yet still had a Tenderness for him,
and cou'd not resolve to lose him. <HI>Agnes de
Castro,</HI> who knew the Cause of his Distemper,
<PB N="52" REF="153"/>
expected the end of it with strange Anxieties.
In fine, after a Month had pass'd away in Fears,
they began to have a little Hopes of his Reco∣very.
The Prince, and Don <HI>Alvaro</HI> were the
only Persons that were not glad of it. But
<HI>Agnes</HI> rejoyc'd enough for all the rest.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> seeing that he must live whether
he wou'd or no, thought of nothing, but pas∣sing
his days in Melancholly and Discontent:
As soon as he was in a condition to walk, he
sought out the most solitary Places, and gain'd
so much upon his own Weakness, to go every∣where,
where <HI>Agnes</HI> was not; but her Idea
follow'd him always, and his Memory, faithful,
to represent her to him, with all her Charms,
render'd her always dangerous.</P>
<P>One day, when they had carry'd him into
the Garden, he sought out a Labyrinth which
was at the farthest part of it, to hide his Me∣lancholly,
during some hours; there he found
the sad <HI>Agnes,</HI> whom Grief, little different
from his, had brought thither; the sight of
her, whom he expected not, made him trem∣ble:
She saw by his pale and meagre Face, the
remains of his Distemper; his Eyes full of Lan∣guishment
troubled her, and tho' her desire
was so great to have fled from him, an un∣known
Power stopt her, and 'twas impossible
for her to go.</P>
<P>After some Moments of Silence, which ma∣ny
Sighs interrupted, Don <HI>Pedro</HI> rais'd himself
from the place, where his Weakness had forc'd
him to sit; he made <HI>Agnes</HI> see, as he approach∣ed
her, the sad Marks of his Sufferings, and
<PB N="53" REF="153"/>
not content with the Pity he saw in her Eyes,
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have resolv'd my Death then, Cruel</HI> Agnes,
(said he) <HI>my desire was the same with yours; but
Heaven has thought fit to reserve me for other Mis∣fortunes,
and I see you again as unhappy, but more
in love than ever.</HI></P>
<P>There was no need of these Words to move
<HI>Agnes</HI> to Compassion, the Languishment of the
Prince spoke enough: And the Heart of this
fair Maid, was but too much dispos'd to yield
itself: She thought then that <HI>Constantia</HI> ought
to be satisfied; Love, which combated for
Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> triumphed over Friendship, and
found that happy Moment, for which the
Prince of <HI>Portugal</HI> had so long sighed.</P>
<P>Do not reproach me, for that which has cost me
more than you, Sir; (<HI>reply'd she</HI>) and do not ac∣cuse
a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which is neither Ingrateful nor Bar∣barous;
and I must tell you, that I love you. But
now I have made you that Confession, what is it far∣ther
that you require of me? <HI>Don</HI> Pedro, <HI>who ex∣pected
not a Change so favourable, felt a
double Satisfaction, and falling at the Feet of</HI>
Agnes, <HI>he express'd more by the Silence his
Passion created, than he could have done by
the most eloquent Words.</HI></P>
<P>After having known all his good Fortune,
he then consulted with the Amiable <HI>Agnes,</HI>
what was to be fear'd from the King; they
concluded, that the cruel Billet, which so
troubled the last days of <HI>Constantia,</HI> could come
from none but <HI>Elvira</HI> and Don <HI>Alvaro.</HI> The
Prince, who knew that his Father had search'd
already an Alliance for him, and was resolv'd
<PB N="54" REF="154"/>
on his Favourite's marrying <HI>Agnes,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
her so tenderly to prevent these Persecu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
by consenting to a secret Marriage; that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
having a long time considered, she at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
consented, <HI>I will do what you will have me,</HI> (sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

it; all my Blood turns to Ice, when I think of this▪
Marriage, and the Image of</HI> Constantia <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
hinder me from doing it.</HI></P>
<P>The Amorous Prince surmounted all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Scruples, and separated himself from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
with a Satisfaction which soon redoubled his
Forces; he saw her afterward with the plea∣sure
of a Mystery, and the Day of their Union
arriv'd: Dom <HI>Gill,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Guarda;</HI> perform∣ed
the Ceremony of the Marriage, in the pre∣sence
of several Witnesses, faithful to Don <HI>Pe∣dro,</HI>
who saw him Possessor of all the Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms
of the Fair <HI>Agnes.</HI></P>
<P>She liv'd not the more peaceable for belong∣ing
to the Prince of <HI>Portugal;</HI> her Enemies,
who continually persecuted her, left her not
without troubles; and the King, whom her
Refusal inrag'd, laid his absolute Commands
on her, to Marry Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI> with Threats to
force her to it, if she continued Rebellious.</P>
<P>The Prince took loudly her part, and this
joyn'd to the Refusal he made of marrying the
Princess of <HI>Arragon,</HI> caus'd Suspicions of the
Truth in the King his Father. He was second∣ed
by those that were too much interested,
not to unriddle this Secret. Don <HI>Alvaro</HI> and
his Sister acted with so much Care, gave so
many Gifts, and made so many Promises, that
<PB N="55" REF="154"/>
they discovered the secret Engagements of
Don <HI>Pedro</HI> and <HI>Agnes.</HI></P>
<P>The King wanted but little of breaking out
into all the Rage and Fury so great a Disap∣pointment
could inspire him with, against the
Princess. Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI> whose Love was chang'd
into the most violent Hatred, appeas'd the
first Transports of the King, by making him
comprehend, that if they could break the
Marriage of 'em, that would not be a suffici∣ent
Revenge, and so poysoned the Soul of the
King, to consent to the Death of <HI>Agnes.</HI></P>
<P>The Barbarous Don <HI>Alvaro</HI> offered his Arm
for this terrible Execution, and his Rage was
Security for the Sacrifice.</P>
<P>The King, who thought the Glory of his
Family disgraced, by this Alliance, and his
own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> particular in the Procedure of his Son,
gave full Power to this Murder, to make the
innocent <HI>Agnes,</HI> a Victim to his Rage.</P>
<P>It was not easie to execute this horrid De∣sign:
Though the Prince saw <HI>Agnes</HI> but in se∣cret,
yet all his Cares were still awake for her,
and he was married to her above a Year, be∣fore
Don <HI>Alvaro</HI> could find out an Opportuni∣ty
so long sought for.</P>
<P>The Prince delivered himself but little, and
very rarely went far from <HI>Coimbra:</HI> but on a
Day, an Unfortunate Day, and mark'd out by
Heaven for an unheard of and horrid Assassin,
he made a Party to hunt at a fine House, which
the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> had near the City.</P>
<P><HI>Agnes</HI> lov'd every thing that gave the Prince
satisfaction; but a secret Trouble made her
<PB N="56" REF="155"/>
apprehend some Misfortune in this unhappy
Journey: <HI>Sir,</HI> (said she, to him alarm'd, with∣out
knowing the Reason why I tremble) <HI>seeing
you to day, as it were design'd the last of my Life
Preserve yourself, my Dear Prince, and though the
Exercise you take be not very dangerous, beware of
the least Hazards, and bring me back all that I trust
with you.</HI> Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> who had never found
her so Handsome and so Charming before,
embraced her several times, and went out of
the Palace with his Followers, with a design
not to return till the next Day.</P>
<P>He was no sooner gone, but the Cruel Don
<HI>Alvaro</HI> prepared himself for the Execution he
had resolv'd on; he thought it of that impor∣tance,
that it required more Hands than his
Own; and so chose for his Companions <HI>Diego
Lopes Pacheo,</HI> and <HI>Pedro Cuello,</HI> two Monsters
like himself, whose Cruelty he was assur'd of
by the Presents he had made 'em.</P>
<P>They waited the coming of the Night, and
the lovely <HI>Agnes</HI> was in her first sleep, which
the last of her Life, when these Assassins ap∣proach'd
her Bed. Nothing made resistance
to Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI> who could do every thing, and
whom the blackest Furies introduced to <HI>Agnes,</HI>
she wakened, and opening her Curtains, saw,
by the Candle burning in her Chamber, the
Poinard with which Don <HI>Alvaro</HI> was arm'd;
he having not his Face covered she easily knew
him, and forgetting herself, to think of no∣thing
but the Prince: <HI>Just Heaven,</HI> (said she,
lifting up her fine Eyes) <HI>if you will revenge</HI> Con∣stantia,
<HI>satisfie yourself with my Blood only, and
<PB N="57" REF="155"/>
spare that of</HI> Don <HI>Pedro.</HI> The Barbarous Man
that heard her, gave her not time to say more;
and finding he could never (by all he could do
by Love) touch the Heart of the Fair <HI>Agnes,</HI>
he pierc'd it with his Poinard; his Accompli∣ces
gave her several Wounds, tho' there were
no Necessity of so many to put an End to an
Innocent Life.</P>
<P>What a sad Spectacle was this for those who
approach'd her Bed the next Day: And what
dismal News was this to the Unfortunate
Prince of <HI>Portugal!</HI> He return'd to <HI>Coimbra,</HI> to
the first Report of this Adventure, and saw
what had certainly cost him his Life, if Men
could die of Grief; after having a thousand
times embraced the bloody Body of <HI>Agnes,</HI> and
said all that a just Despair could inspire him
with, he ran like a Mad-man into the Palace,
demanding the Murderers of his Wife, of
things that could not hear him: In fine, he
saw the King, and without observing any Re∣spect,
he gave a Loose to his Resentment: af∣ter
having rail'd a long time, overwhelm'd
with Grief, he fell into a Swoon, which con∣tinued
all that Day. They carried him into
his Apartment; and the King, believing that
this Misfortune would prove his Cure, re∣pented
not of what he had permitted,</P>
<P>Don <HI>Alvaro,</HI> and the two other Assassins,
quitted <HI>Coimbra.</HI> This Absence of theirs,
made 'em appear guilty of the Crime, for
which the Afflicted Prince vowed a speedy
Vengeance to the Ghost of his Lovely <HI>Agnes,</HI>
resolving to pursue them to the uttermost part
<PB N="58" REF="156"/>
of the Universe: He got a considerable num∣ber
of Men together, sufficient to have made
Resistance, even on the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> him∣self,
if he should yet take the Part of the Mur∣derers;
with these he ravag'd the whole Coun∣try,
as far as the <HI>Duero</HI> Waters, and carried
on a War, even till the Death of the King,
continually mixing Tears with Blood, which
he gave to the Revenge of his Dearest <HI>Agnes.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the deplorable End of the Unfor∣tunate
Love of Don <HI>Pedro</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and of
the Fair <HI>Agnes de Castro,</HI> whose Remembrance
he faithfully preserved in his Heart, even upon
the Throne, to which he mounted, by the
Right of his Birth, after the Death of the
King.</P>

Lover's Watch:

ART
OF
Making LOVE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="argument">
<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS in the most Happy and August
Court of the Best and Greatest Mo∣narch
of the World, that <HI>Damon,</HI> a
young Nobleman, whom we will ren∣der
under that Name, languishes for a Maid of
Quality, who will give us leave to call her <HI>Iris:</HI></P>
<P>Their Births are equally Illustrious; they are
both Rich, and both Young; their Beauty such, as
I dae not too nicely particularize, lest I should
<PB N="2" REF="158"/>
discover (which I am not permitted to do) who these
charming Lovers are. Let it suffice, that <HI>Iris</HI> is
the most fair and accomplisht Person that ever a∣dorn'd
a Court; and that <HI>Damon</HI> is only worthy
of the Glory of her Favour; for he has all that can
render him lovely in the fair Eyes of the Amiable
<HI>Iris.</HI> Nor is he Master of those Superficial Beau∣ties
alone, that please at first Sight; he can charm
the Soul with a thousand Arts of Wit and Gallan∣try.
And, in a word, I may say, without flatter∣ing
either, that there is no one Beauty, no one Grace,
no perfection of Mind and Body, that wants to com∣pleat
a Victory on both sides.</P>
<P>The Agreement of Age, Fortunes, Quality and
Humours in these two fair Lovers, made the im∣patient
<HI>Damon</HI> hope, that nothing would oppose his
Passion; and if he saw himself every Hour lan∣guishing
for the Adorable Maid, he did not howe∣ver
despair: And if <HI>Iris</HI> sigh'd, it was not for fear
of being one day more happy.</P>
<P>In the midst of the Tranquility of these two Lo∣vers,
<HI>Iris</HI> was obliged to go into the Country for some
Months, whither 'twas impossible for <HI>Damon</HI> to
wait on her, he being oblig'd to attend the King his
Master; and being the most Amorous of his Sex,
suffer'd with extream Impatience th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Absence of his
Mistress. Nevertheless, he fail'd not to send to
her every day, and gave up all his melancholly
Hours to Thinking, Sighing, and Writing to her
the softest Letters that Love could inspire. So that
<HI>Iris</HI> even blessed that Absence, that gave her so ten∣der
and convincing Proofs of his Passion; and found
this dear way of Conversing, even recompensed all
her Sighs for his Absence.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="158"/>
After a little Intercourse of this kind, <HI>Damon</HI>
be thought himself to ask <HI>Iris</HI> a <HI>Discretion,</HI> which
he had won of her, before she left the Town; and
in a <HI>Billet-doux</HI> to that purpose, prest her very ear∣nestly
for it. <HI>Iris</HI> being infinitely pleas'd with his
Importunity, suffer'd him to ask it often; and he ne∣ver
fail'd of doing so.</P>
<P>But as I do not here design to relate the Adven∣tures
of these two Amiable Persons, nor give you all
the <HI>Billet-douxes</HI> that past between them: You
shall here find nothing but the <HI>Watch,</HI> this charm∣ing
Maid sent her impatient Lover.</P>

<PB N="4" REF="159"/>
<HEAD>IRIS to DAMON.</HEAD>
<P>IT must be confest, <HI>Damon,</HI> that you are
the most importuning Man in the World.
Your Billets have an hundred times de∣manded
a <HI>Discretion,</HI> which you won of me;
and tell me, you will not wait my Return, to
be paid. You are either a very faithless Cre∣ditor,
or believe me very unjust, that you dun
with such Impatience. But, to let you see I
am a Maid of Honour, and value my Word, I
will acquit myself of this Obligation I have to
you, and send you a <HI>Watch</HI> of my fashion; per∣haps
you never saw any so good. It is not
one of those, that have always something to
be mended in it; but one that is without Fault,
very just and good, and will remain so, as long
as you continue to love me. But <HI>Damon,</HI> know,
that the very Minute you cease to do so, the
String will break, and it will go no more. 'Tis
only useful in my Absence, and when I return,
'twill change its Motion: And though I have
set it but for the Spring-time, 'twill serve you
the whole Year round; and 'twill be necessary
only, that you alter the business of the Hours
(which my <HI>Cupid,</HI> in the middle of my <HI>Watch,</HI>
points you out) according to the length of the
<PB N="5" REF="159"/>
Days and Nights. Nor is the Dart of that lit∣tle
God directed to those Hours, so much to
inform you how they pass, as how you ought
to pass them, how you ought to employ those
of your Absence from <HI>Iris.</HI> 'Tis there you shall
find the whole Business of a Lover, from his
Mistress; for I have design'd it a Rule to all
your Actions. The Consideration of the
Workman, ought to make you set a Value up∣on
the Work: And though it be not an accom∣plisht,
and perfect Piece; yet <HI>Damon,</HI> you
ought to be grateful, and esteem it, since I have
made it for you alone. But however I may
boast of the Design, I know, as well as I believe,
you love me; that you will not suffer me to
have the Glory of it wholly, but will say in
your heart,
<Q><L>That <HI>Love,</HI> the great Instructor of the Mind,</L>
<L>That forms a new, and fashions every Soul,</L>
<L>Refines the gross Defects of Humane kind;</L>
<L>Humbles the Proud and Vain, inspires the Dull:</L>
<L>Gives Cowards noble Heat in Fight,</L>
<L>And teaches feeble Woman how to write:</L>
<L>That doth the Ʋniverse command;</L>
<L>Does from my <HI>Iris</HI> Heart direct her Hand.</L></Q></P>
<P>I give you the liberty to say this to your
Heart, if you please: And that you may know,
with what Justice you do so, I will confess in
my turn.</P>

<HEAD>The Confession.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>That <HI>Love</HI>'s my Conduct where I go,</L>
<L>And <HI>Love</HI> instructs me all I do.</L>
<L>Prudence no longer is my Guide,</L>
<L>Nor take I Counsel of my Pride.</L>
<L>In vain does Honour now invade,</L>
<L>In vain does Reason take my part;</L>
<L>If against <HI>Love</HI> it do perswade,</L>
<L>If it rebel against my Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If the soft Ev'ning do invite,</L>
<L>And I incline to take the Air,</L>
<L>The Birds, the Spring, the Flowers no more delight;</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>Love</HI> makes all the Pleasure there;</L>
<L><HI>Love,</HI> which about me still I bear:</L>
<L>I'm charm'd with what I thither bring,</L>
<L>And add a Softness to the Spring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If for Devotion I design,</L>
<L><HI>Love</HI> meets me, even at the shrine;</L>
<L>In all my Worships claims a part,</L>
<L>And robs even Heaven of my Heart.</L>
<L>All Day does Counsel and controul,</L>
<L>And all the Night employs my Soul.</L>
<L>No wonder then, if all you think be true,</L>
<L>That <HI>Love</HI>'s concern'd in all I do for you.</L>
</LG>
<P>And <HI>Damon,</HI> you know that <HI>Love</HI> is no ill
Master; and I must say, with a Blush, that he
has found me no unapt Scholar; and he in∣structs
too agreeably, not to succeed in all he
undertakes:
<Q><PB N="7" REF="160"/>
<L>Who can resist his soft Commands?</L>
<L>When he resolves, what God withstands?</L></Q></P>
<P>But I ought to explain to you my <HI>Watch:</HI>
The naked <HI>Love</HI> which you will find in the
middle of it, with his Wings clip'd, to shew
you he is fix'd and constant, and will not fly
away, points you out, with his Arrow, the
four and twenty Hours that compose the Day
and the Night: Over every Hour you will find
written what you ought to do, during its
Course; and every Half-hour is marked with
a Sigh, since the quality of a Lover is, to sigh
day and night: Sighs are the Children of Lo∣vers,
that are born every hour. And that my
<HI>Watch</HI> may always be just, <HI>Love</HI> himself ought
to conduct it; and your Heart should keep
Time with the Movement:
<Q><L>My Present's delicate, and new,</L>
<L>If by your Heart the Motion's set;</L>
<L>According as that's false, or true,</L>
<L>You'll find, my <HI>Watch</HI> will answer it.</L></Q></P>
<P>Every hour is tedious to a Lover, separated
from his Mistress; and, to shew you how good
I am, I will have my <HI>Watch</HI> instruct you, to
pass some of them without Inquietude; that
the force of your Imagination may sometimes
charm the Trouble you have for my Absence:
<Q><PB N="8" REF="161"/>
<L>Perhaps I am mistaken here,</L>
<L>My Heart may too much Credit give;</L>
<L>But <HI>Damon,</HI> you can charm my Fear,</L>
<L>And soon my Error undeceive.</L></Q></P>
<P>But I will not disturb my Repose at this
time, with a Jealousie, which, I hope is alto∣gether
frivolous and vain; but begin to in∣struct
you in the Mysteries of my <HI>Watch:</HI> Cast
then your Eyes upon the Eighth Hour in the
Morning, which is the Hour I would have you
begin to wake: You will find there written.</P>

<HEAD>Eight a Clock.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Agreeable Reverie.</HEAD>
<P>DO not rise yet; you may find Thoughts
agreeable enough, when you awake, to
entertain you longer in Bed. And 'tis in that
hour you ought to recollect all the Dreams you
had in the Night. If you have dream'd any
thing to my Advantage, confirm yourself in
that thought; but if to my Disadvantage, re∣nounce
it, and disown the injurious Dream.
'Tis in this Hour also, that I give you leave to
reflection all that I have ever said and done,
that has been most obliging to you, and that
gives you the most tender Sentiments.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="9" REF="161"/>
<HEAD>The Reflection.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Remember <HI>Damon,</HI> while your mind</L>
<L>Reflects on things that charm and please,</L>
<L>You give me Proofs that you are kind,</L>
<L>And set my doubting Soul at ease:</L>
<L>For when your Heart receives with Joy</L>
<L>The thoughts of Favours which I give,</L>
<L>My Smiles in vain I not imploy,</L>
<L>And on the Square we love and live.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Think then on all I ever did,</L>
<L>That e're was charming, e're was dear;</L>
<L>Let nothing from that Soul be hid,</L>
<L>Whose Griefs and Joys I feel and share.</L>
<L>All that your Love and Faith have sought,</L>
<L>All that your Vows aad Sighs have bought,</L>
<L>Now render present to your Thought.</L>
</LG>
<P>And for what's to come, I give you leave, <HI>Da∣mon,</HI>
to flatter your self, and to expect, I shall
still pursue those Methods, whose remembrance
charms so well: But, if it be possible, conceive
these kind Thoughts between Sleeping and
Waking, that all my too forward Complai∣sance,
my Goodness, and my Tenderness,
which I confess to have for you, may pass for
half Dreams; for 'tis most certain,
<Q><L>That, though the Favours of the Fair</L>
<L>Are ever to the Lover dear,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="162"/>
Yet, lest he should reproach that easie Flame,</L>
<L>That buys its Satisfaction with its Shame,</L>
<L>She ought but rarely to confess,</L>
<L>How much she finds of Tenderness;</L>
<L>Nicely to guard the yielding part,</L>
<L>And hide the hard-kept Secret in her Heart.</L></Q></P>
<P>For, let me tell you <HI>Damon,</HI> though the Passi∣on
of a Woman of Honour be never so inno∣cent,
and the Lover never so discreet and ho∣nest;
her Heart feels I know not what of Re∣proach
within, at the Reflection of any Favours
she has allow'd him. For my part, I never call
to mind the least soft, or kind Word I have spo∣ken
to <HI>Damon,</HI> without finding, at the same in∣stant,
my Face cover'd over with Blushes, and
my Heart with sensible Pain. I sigh at the Re∣membrance
of every Touch I have stol'n from
his Hand, and have upbraided my Soul, which
confesses so much guilty Love, as that secret de∣sire
of Touching him made appear. I am an∣gry
at the Discovery, though I am pleas'd at
the same time, with the Satisfaction I take in
doing so; and ever disorder'd at the remem∣brance
of such Arguments of too much Love.
And these unquiet Sentiments alone, are suffi∣cient
to perswade me, that our Sex cannot be
reserv'd too much. And I have often, on these
occasions, said to my self,</P>

<L>That can adorn the Just and Brave,</L>
<L>That can the coldest Bosom warm;</L>
<L>Though Wit and Honour there abound;</L>
<L>Yet the Pursuer's ne'r pursu'd,</L>
<L>And when my Weakness he has found,</L>
<L>His Love will sink to Gratitude:</L>
<L>While on the Asking Part he lives,</L>
<L>'Tis she th' Obliger is, who gives.</L>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Reading of Letters.</HEAD>
<P>MY <HI>Cupid</HI> points you now to the Hour in
which you ought to retire into your Ca∣binet,
having already past an Hour in Dressing;
and for a Lover, who is sure not to appear be∣fore
his Mistress, even that Hour is too much
to be so employ'd. But I will think, you thought
of nothing less than Dressing, while you were
about it. Lose then no more Minutes, but open
your Scrutore, and read over some of those
Billets you have receiv'd from me. Oh! what
Pleasures a Lover feels about his Heart, in read∣ing
those from a Mistress he entirely loves!</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The Joy.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Who, but a Lover can express</L>
<L>The Joys, the Pants, the Tenderness,</L>
<L>That the soft Amorous Soul invades,</L>
<L>While the dear <HI>Billet-doux</HI> he reads?</L>
<L>Raptures Divine the Heart o're-flow;</L>
<L>Which he that Loves not, cannot know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A thousand Tremblings, thousand Fears,</L>
<L>The short-breath'd Sighs, the joyful Tears;</L>
<L>The Transport, where the Love's confest,</L>
<L>The Change, where Coldness is exprest;</L>
<L>The diff'ring Flames the Lover burns,</L>
<L>As those are shy, or kind, by Turns.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="15" REF="164"/>
However you find 'em <HI>Damon,</HI> construe 'em
all to my Advantage: Possibly, some of 'em
have an Air of Coldness, something different
from that Softness they are usually too amply
fill'd with; but where you find they have, be∣lieve
there, that Sence of Honour, and my Sexes
Modesty, guided my Hand a little, against the
Inclinations of my Heart; and that it was a
kind of an Atonement, I believed, I ought to
make, for something I feared, I had said too
kind, and too obliging before: But where-ever
you find that, stop that Check in my Career
of Love; you will be sure to find something
that follows it to favour you, and deny that
unwilling Imposition upon my Heart; which,
lest you should mistake, <HI>Love</HI> shews himself in
Smiles again, and flatters more agreeably, dis∣daining
the Tyranny of Honour, and Rigid
Custom, that Imposition on our Sex; and will,
in spight of me, let you see, he Reigns abso∣lutely
in my Soul.</P>
<P>The reading my <HI>Billet-doux</HI> may detain you
an Hour; I have had Goodness enough to write
you enough to entertain you so long, at least,
and sometimes reproach my self for it; but,
contrary to all my Scruples, I find my self dis∣pos'd
to give you those frequent Marks of my
Tenderness. If yours be so great as you express
it, you ought to kiss my Letters a Thousand
times, you ought to read them with Attention,
and weigh every Word, and value every Line.
A Lover may receive a Thousand indearing
Words from a Mistress, more easily than a Bil∣let.

<HEAD>Eleven a Clock.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Hour to Write in.</HEAD>
<P>IF my <HI>Watch</HI> did not inform you, 'tis now time
to Write: I believe, <HI>Damon,</HI> your Heart
wou'd; and tell you also, that I should take it
kindly, if you would employ a whole Hour that
way; and that you should never lose an Occasi∣on
of writing to me, since you are assured of
the Welcome I give your Letters. Perhaps you
will say, an Hour is too much, and that 'tis not
the Mode to write long Letters. I grant you,
<HI>Damon,</HI> when we write those indifferent ones,
of Gallantry in course, or necessary Compli∣ment;
the handsom comprizing of which, in
the fewest words, renders 'em the most agree∣able:
But in Love we have a Thousand foolish
things to say, that, of themselves, bear no
great Sound, but have a mighty Sence in Love;
for there is a peculiar Eloquence, natural alone
to a Lover, and to be understood by no other
Creature: To those, Words have a thousand
Graces and Sweetnesses; which, to the Uncon∣cerned,
appears Meanness, and Easie Sense,
at the best. But, <HI>Damon,</HI> you and I are none of
those ill Judges of the Beauties of Love; we can
penetrate beyond the Vulgar, and perceive the
fine Soul in every Line, through all the humble
Dress of Phrase; when possibly, they who
think they discern it best in florid Language,
do not see it at all. <HI>Love</HI> was not born, or bred
<PB N="19" REF="166"/>
in Courts, but Cottages; and nurs'd in Groves
and Shades, smiles on the Plains, and wantons
in the Streams; all unador'd, and harml<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
Therefore, <HI>Damon,</HI> do not consult your Wit in
this Affair, but Love alone; and speak all that
he and Nature taught you, and let the fine
Things you learn in Schools alone: Make use
of those Flowers you have gather'd there,
when you converse with States-men and the
Gown. Let <HI>Iris</HI> possess your Heart in all its
simple Innocence, that's the best Eloquence to
her that loves; and this is my Instruction to a
Lover, that would succeed in his Amours; for
I have a Heart very difficult to please, and this
is the nearest Way to it.</P>

<HEAD>Advice to Lovers.</HEAD>

<L><HI>Lovers,</HI>-if you would gain a Heart,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Damon</HI> learn to win the Prize;</L>
<L>He'll shew you all its tend'rest Part,</L>
<L>And where its greatest Danger lies.</L>
<L>The Magazine of its Disdain;</L>
<L>Where Honour, feebly guarded, does remain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If present, do but little say;</L>
<L>Enough the silent Lover speaks:</L>
<L>But wait, and sigh, and gaze all Day:</L>
<L>Such Rhet'rick, more than Languages takes.</L>
<L>For Words, the dullest way do move;</L>
<L>And utter'd more to shew your Wit, than Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="20" REF="167"/>
<L>Let your Eyes tell her of your Heart:</L>
<L>Its Story is, for Words, too delicate.</L>
<L>Souls thus exchange, and thus impart,</L>
<L>And all their Secrets can relate.</L>
<L>A Tear, a broken Sigh, she'll understand;</L>
<L>Or the soft trembling Pressings of the Hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or if your Pain must be in Words exprest,</L>
<L>Let 'em fall gently, unassur'd, and slow;</L>
<L>And where they fail, your Looks may tell the rest.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Damon</HI> spoke, and I was conquer'd so.</L>
<L>The witty Talker has mistook his Art;</L>
<L>The modest Lover only charms the Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, while all Day you gazing sit,</L>
<L>And fear to speak, and fear your Fate,</L>
<L>You more Advantages by Silence get,</L>
<L>Than the gay forward Youth, with all his Prate.</L>
<L>Let him be silent here; but when away,</L>
<L>Whatever Love can dictate, let him say.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There let the bashful Soul unvail,</L>
<L>And give a Loose to Love and Truth.</L>
<L>Let him improve the amorous Tale,</L>
<L>With all the Force of Words, and Fire of Youth.</L>
<L>There all, and any thing, let him express;</L>
<L>Too long he cannot write, too much confess.</L>
</LG>
<P>O <HI>Damon!</HI> How well have you made me un∣derstand

Tenderness too well, not to be sensible, how I
am charmed with your agreeable long Letters.</P>

<HEAD>The Invention.</HEAD>
<L>Ah! he who first found out the Way</L>
<L>Souls to each other to convey,</L>
<L>Without dull Speaking, sure must be</L>
<L>Something above Humanity.</L>
<L>Let the fond World in vain dispute,</L>
<L>And the first Sacred Mystery impute</L>
<L>Of Letters, to the Learned Brood;</L>
<L>And of the Glory, cheat a God:</L>
<L>'Twas <HI>Love</HI> alone that first the Art essay'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>Psyche</HI> was the first fair yielding Maid</L>
<L>That was by the dear <HI>Billet-doux</HI> betray'd.</L>
<P>It is an Art too ingenious to have been found
out by Man, and too necessary to Lovers, not
to have been invented by the God of Love him∣self.
But, <HI>Damon,</HI> I do not pretend to exact
from you those Letters of Gallantry which, I
have told you, are filled with nothing but fine
Thoughts, and writ with all the Arts of Wit
and Subtilty: I would have yours still, all ten∣der
unaffected Love, Words unchosen, Thoughts
unstudied, and Love unfeigned. I had rather
find more Softness than Wit, in your Passion;
more of Nature than of Art; more of the Lo∣ver
than the Poet. Nor would I have you write
any of those little short Letters that are read
over in a minute; in Love, long Letters bring
a long Pleasure: Do not trouble yourself to
make 'em fine, or write a great deal of Wit and
Sence in a few Lines; that is the Notion of a
witty Billet, in any Affair but that of Love:
<PB N="22" REF="168"/>
And have a Care, rather to avoid these Graces
to a Mistress; and assure yourself, dear <HI>Damon,</HI>
that what pleases the Soul pleases the Eye, and
the Largeness or Bulk of your Letter shall ne∣ver
offend me; and that I only am displeased
when I find them small. A Letter is ever, the
best and most powerful Agent to a Mistress, it
almost always perswades; 'tis always renewing
little Impressions, that possibly, otherwise, Ab∣sence
would deface. Make use then, <HI>Damon,</HI>
of your Time while it is given you, and thank
me, that I permit you to write to me: Perhaps
I shall not always continue in the Humor of
suffering you to do so; and it may so happen,
by some Turn of Chance and Fortune, that you
may be deprived, at the same time, both of my
Presence, and of the Means of sending to me.

you are Serving me the most Obligingly and

not that I fear you will squander away

passes for a judging Wit; and there is nothing
so troublesome, as such a Pretender. She, per∣haps,
may get some Knowledge of our Corre∣spondence;
and then, no doubt, will improve
it, to my disadvantage. Possibly she may rail at
me; that is her Fashion, by the way of Friend∣ly
Speaking; and an Aukward Commendation,
the most effectual Way of Defaming, and Tra∣ducing.
Perhaps she tells you, in a cold Tone,

That <HI>Iris,</HI> indeed, is handsome; and she won∣ders,

not of her Mind; if they were, you should have

I have blue Eyes, and 'tis pity my Complexion

to Fat. Cries—She would charm infinitely

is Mistress of it. And concludes,—But all

on, without giving you leave to edge in a Word,
in my Defence; and ever and anon, crying

up her own Conduct, and Management: Tell
you, how she is opprest with Lovers, and fa∣tigu'd
with Addresses; and recommending her
self, at every turn, with a perceivable Cun∣ning:
And all the while, is Jilting you of your
good Opinion; which she would buy, at the
Price of any Body's Repose, or her own Fame,
tho' but for the Vanity of adding to the Num∣ber

the first thing she does, she enquires into his E∣state:
If she find it such, as may (if the Cox∣comb
be well manag'd) supply her Vanity, she
makes Advances to him, and applies herself to
all those little Arts she usually makes use of, to
gain her Fools; and, according to his Humour,
dresses and affects her own. But, <HI>Damon,</HI> since

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Dinner time.</HEAD>
<P>LEave all those fond Entertainments, or you
will disoblige me, and make Dinner wait
for you; for my <HI>Cupid</HI> tells you, 'tis that Hour.
<HI>Love</HI> does not pretend to make you lose that;
nor is it my Province to order you your Diet.
Here I give you a perfect Liberty, to do what
you please: And possibly, 'tis the only Hour in
the whole Four and twenty, that I will abso∣lutely
resign you, or dispence with your even
so much as Thinking on me. 'Tis true, in
seating yourself at Table, I would not have
you placed over-against a very Beautiful Ob∣ject,
for in such a one there are a thousand
little Graces, in Speaking, Looking, and
Laughing, that fail not to Charm if one gives
way to the Eyes, to gaze and wander that
way; in which, perhaps, in spight of you,
you will find a Pleasure; And while you do so,
though without Design or Concern, you give
the fair Charmer a sort of Vanity, in believing
you have placed yourself there, only for the
Advantage of Looking on her; and assumes a
hundred little Graces and Affectations, which
are not Natural to her, to compleat a Conquest,
which she believes so well begun already. She
softens her Eyes, and sweetens her Mouth; and
in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, puts on another Air, than when she had
no Design; and when you did not, by your
<PB N="31" REF="172"/>
continual looking on her, rouze her Vanity,
and increase her easie Opinion of her own
Charms. Perhaps she knows, I have some In∣terest
in your Heart; and Prides herself, at
least, with believing, she has attracted the Eyes
of my Lover, if not his Heart; and thinks it
easie to vanquish the Whole, if she pleases; and
triumphs over me in her secret Imaginations.
Remember, <HI>Damon,</HI> that while you act thus in
the Company and Conversation of other Beau∣ties,
that every Look, or Word you give in
favour of 'em, is an Indignity to my Reputa∣tion;
and, which you cannot suffer, if you
love me truly, and with Honour: And, assure
yourself, so much Vanity as you inspire in her,
so much Fame you rob me of; for whatever
Praises you give another Beauty, so much you
take away from mine. Therefore, if you Dine
in Company, do as others do: Be generally
Civil, not applying yourself, by Words, or
Looks to any particular Person: Be as gay as
you please: Talk and laugh with all, for this is
not the Hour for Chagrin.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Visits to Friends.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DAmon,</HI> my Watch is juster than you ima∣gine;
it would not have you live retired
and solitary, but permits you to go, and make
Visits. I am not one of those that believe, Love
and Friendship cannot find a Place in one and
<PB N="33" REF="173"/>
the same Heart: And that Man would be very
unhappy, who, as soon as he had a Mistress,
should be obliged to renounce the Society of his
Friends. I must confess, I would not that you
should have so much Concern for them, as you
have for me; for I have heard a sort of a Pro∣verb,
that says, <HI>He cannot be very fervent in
Love, who is not a little cold in Friendship.</HI> You
are not ignorant, that when <HI>Love</HI> establishes him∣self
in a Heart, he reigns a Tyrant there, and
will not suffer even Friendship, if it pretend to
share his Empire there.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Cupid.</HEAD>
<L><HI>Love</HI> is a God, whose charming Sway</L>
<L>Both Heaven, and Earth, and Seas obey.</L>
<L>A Power that will not mingled be</L>
<L>With any dull Equality.</L>
<L>Since first from Heaven, which gave him Birth,</L>
<L>He rul'd the Empire of the Earth,</L>
<L>Jealous of Sov'raign Power, he rules,</L>
<L>And will be Absolute in Souls.</L>
<P>I should be very angry; if you had any of
those Friendships, which one ought to desire in
a Mistress only; for many times it happens,
that you have Sentiments a little too tender for
those Amiable Persons; and many times Love
and Friendship are so confounded together, that
one cannot easily discern one from t'other. I
have seen a Man flatter himself with an Opinion,
that he had but an Esteem for a Woman, when
by some Turn of Fortune in her Life, as Mar∣rying,
<PB N="34" REF="174"/>
or Receiving the Addresses of Men, he
has found, by Spight and Jealousies within, that
that was Love, which he before took for Com∣plaisance,
or Friendship. Therefore have a
Care; for such Amities are dangerous. Not
but that a Lover may have Fair and Generous
Female-Friends, whom he ought to visit; and
perhaps, I shou'd esteem you less, if I did not
believe you were valued by such, if I were per∣fectly
assured they were Friends, and not Lo∣vers.
But have a Care, you hide not a Mistress
under this Veil, or that you gain not a Lover
by this Pretence: For you may begin with
Friendship, and end with Love; and I shou'd
be equally afflicted, shou'd you give it, or receive
it. And though you charge our Sex with all
the Vanity; yet I often find Nature to have
given you as large a Portion of that Common
Crime, which you wou'd shuffle off, as asham'd
to own; and are as fond and vain of the Ima∣gination
of a Conquest, as any Coquet of us all;
though, at the same time, you despise the Vi∣ctim,
you think it adds a Trophy to your Fame.
And I have seen a Man dress, and trick, and
adjust his Looks and Mien, to make a Visit to a
Woman he lov'd, nor ever cou'd love, not as for
those he made to his Mistress; and only for the
Vanity of making a Conquest upon a Heart, even
unworthy of the little Pains he has taken about
it. And what is this but buying Vanity at the
Expence of Sence and Ease; and with Fatigue,
purchase the Name of a Conceited Fop, besides
that of a Dishonest Man? For he who takes
Pains to make himself Belov'd, only to please his
<PB N="35" REF="174"/>
curious Humour, tho' he should say nothing that
tends to it, more than by his Looks, his Sighs,
and now and then breaking into Praises and
Commendations of the Object, by the Care he
takes, to appear well drest before her, and in
good order; he lyes in his Looks, he deceives
with his Mien and Fashion, and cheats with e∣very
Motion, and every Grace he puts on: He
cozens when he Sings, or Dances; he dissembles
when he Sighs; and every thing he does, that
wilfully gains upon her, is Malice propense,
Baseness, and Art below a Man of Sence, or
Vertue: And yet these Arts, these Coz'nages,
are the common Practices of the Town. What's
this but that damnable Vice, of which they so
reproach our Sex; that of Jilting for Hearts?
And 'tis in vain, that my Lover, after such foul
Play, shall think to appease me, with saying, <HI>He
did it to try how easie he cou'd Conquer, and of how
great Force his Charms were: And why shou'd I be
angry, if all the Town lov'd him, since he lov'd none
but</HI> Iris? Oh foolish Pleasure! How little Sence
goes to the making of such a Happiness? And
how little Love must he have for one particular
Person, who wou'd wish to inspire it into all the
World, and yet himself pretend to be insensi∣ble?
But this (<HI>Damon</HI>) is rather what is but
too much practised by your Sex, than any Guilt
I charge on you; tho' Vanity be an Ingredient
that Nature very seldom omits in the Compo∣sition
of either Sex; and you may be allow'd a
Tincture of it at least. And, perhaps, I am not
wholly exempt from this Leaven in my Nature,
but accuse myself sometimes of finding a secret
<PB N="36" REF="175"/>
Joy of being ador'd, tho' I even hate my Wor∣shipper.
But if any such Pleasure touch my
Heart, I find it at the same time blushing in my
Cheeks with a guilty Shame; which soon checks
the petty Triumph, and I have a Vertue at so∣berer
Thoughts, that I find surmounts my Weak∣ness
and Indiscretion; and I hope <HI>Damon</HI> finds
the same: For, should he have any of those At∣tachments,
I should have no Pity for him.</P>

<HEAD>Four a Clock.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">General Conversation.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Visiting-Hour, many People will hap∣pen
to meet at one and the same time toge∣ther,
in a Place: And as you make not Visits to
Friends, to be silent, you ought to enter into
Conversation with 'em; but those Conversati∣ons
ought to be General, and of General
Things; for there is no necessity of making
your Friend the Confident of your Amours:
'Twould infinitely displease me, to hear you
have reveal'd to them, all that I have repos'd in
you; tho' Secrets never so trivial, yet, since
utter'd between Lovers, they deserve to be
priz'd at a higher rate: For what can shew a
Heart more indifferent and indiscreet, than to
declare in any Fashion, or with Mirth, or Joy,
the tender Things a Mistress says to a Lover;
and which possibly, related at Second Hand,
bear not the same Sence, because they have
not the same Sound, and Air, they had origi∣nally,
when they came from the soft Heart of
her, who sigh'd 'em first to her lavish Lover.
Perhaps they are told again with Mirth, or Joy,
unbecoming their Character and Business; and
then they lose their Graces; (for Love is
the most Solemn Thing in Nature, and the most
unsuiting with Gaiety.) Perhaps the soft Ex∣pressions
suit not so well the harsher Voice of
the Masculine Lover, whose Accents were not
<PB N="38" REF="176"/>
form'd for so much Tenderness; at least, not
of that sort; for Words that have the same
Meaning, are alter'd from their Sence, by the
least Tone, or Accent of the Voice; and those
proper, and fitted to my Soul, are not, possibly,
so to yours, tho' both have the same Efficacy up∣on
us: yours upon my Heart, as mine upon
yours; and both will be misunderstood by the
unjudging World. Besides this, there is a Ho∣liness
in Love that's true, that ought not to be
prophan'd: And as the Poet truly says, at the
latter end of an Ode; of which, I will recite the
whole.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The Invitation.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><HI>Aminta,</HI> fear not to confess,</L>
<L>The charming Secret of thy Tenderness:</L>
<L>That which a Lover can't conceal,</L>
<L>That which, to me, thou should'st reveal;</L>
<L>And is but what thy lovely Eyes express.</L>
<L>Come, whisper to my panting Heart,</L>
<L>That heaves, and meets thy Voice half way:</L>
<L>That guesses what thou wou'dst impart,</L>
<L>And languishes for what thou hast to say.</L>
<L>Confirm my trembling Doubt, and make me know,</L>
<L>Whence all these Blushings, and these Sighings flow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why dost thou scruple to unfold</L>
<L>A Mystery that does my Life concern?</L>
<L>If thou ne'er speak'st, it will be told;</L>
<L>For Lovers all things can discern,</L>
<L>From every Look, from every bashful Grace,</L>
<L>That still succeed each other in thy Face,</L>
<L>I shall the dear transporting Secret learn:</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="176"/>
But 'tis a Pleasure not to be exprest,</L>
<L>To hear it by the Voice confest,</L>
<L>When soft Sighs breathe it on my panting Breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All calm and silent is the Grove,</L>
<L>Whose shading Boughs resist the Day:</L>
<L>Here thou may'st blush, and talk of Love,</L>
<L>While only Winds, unheeding, stay,</L>
<L>That will not bear the Sound away:</L>
<L>While I, with solemn awful Joy,</L>
<L>All my attentive Faculties employ;</L>
<L>List'ning to every valu'd Word;</L>
<L>And in my Soul, the Sacred Treasure hoard.</L>
<L>There, like some Mystery Divine,</L>
<L>The wondrous Knowledge I'll enshrine.</L>
<L>Love can his Joys no longer call his own,</L>
<L>Than the dear Secret's kept unknown.</L>
</LG>
<P>There is nothing more true, than those two
last Lines; and that Love ceases to be a Plea∣sure,
when it ceases to be a Secret, and one you
ought to keep sacred: For the World, who
never makes a right Judgment of Things, will
misinterpret Love, as they do Religion; eve∣ry
one judging it, according to the Notion he
had of it, or the Talent of his Sence. <HI>Love,</HI> as
a great Duke said, <HI>is like Apparitions; every one
talks of 'em, but few have seen 'em:</HI> Every Body
thinks himself capable of understanding Love,
and that he is a Master in the Art of it; when
there is nothing so nice, or difficult, to be right∣ly
comprehended; and indeed, cannot be, but
to a Soul very delicate. Nor will he make him∣self
known to the Vulgar: There must be an
<PB N="40" REF="177"/>
uncommon Fineness in the Mind, that contains
him; the rest, he only visits in as many Dis∣guises,
as there are Dispositions and Natures;
where he makes but a short stay, and is gone.
He can fit himself to all Hearts, being the great∣est
Flatterer in the World: And he possesses e∣very
one with a Confidence, that they are in the
Number of his Elect; and they think, they know
him perfectly, when nothing but the Spirits re∣fin'd,
possess him in his Excellency. From this
difference of Love, in different Souls, proceeds
those odd fantastick Maxims, which so many
hold of so different Kinds: And this makes the
most innocent Pleasures pass oftentimes for
Crimes, with the unjudging Crowd, who call
themselves Lovers: And you will have your
Passion censur'd, by as many as you shall disco∣ver
it to, and as many several Ways. I advise
you therefore (<HI>Damon</HI>) to make no Confidents
of your Amours; and believe, that Silence has,
with me, the most powerful Charm.</P>
<P>'Tis also in these Conversations, that those
indiscreetly civil Persons often are▪ who think
to oblige a good Man, by letting him know he
is belov'd by some one or other; and making
him understand how many good Qualities he is
Master of, to render him agreeable to the Fair
Sex, if he wou'd but advance where Love and
good Fortune calls; and that a too constant Lo∣ver
loses a great part of his time, which might
be manag'd to more Advantage, since Youth
hath so short a Race to run: By this, and a
thousand the like indecent Complaisances, give
him a Vanity, that suits not with that Discre∣tion,

which has hitherto acquir'd him so good

But (<HI>Damon</HI>) I know all Lovers are naturally

because every one makes a Sense of
Beauty according to his own Fancy. But per∣haps
you will say in your own Defence, That

I shou'd be content to acquit you of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
provided you allow me the last: And if I appear
charming in <HI>Damon</HI>'s Eyes, I am not fond of

to justifie his Choice; but let your good Opini∣on
give what Increase it pleases to my Beauty;
though your Approbation give me a Pleasure,
it shall not a Vanity; and I am contented, that
<HI>Damon</HI> should think me a Beauty, without thy
believing I am one. 'Tis not to draw new As∣surances,
and new Vows from you, that I speak
this; though Tales of Love are the only ones
we desire to hear often told, and which never the
the Hearers, if addrest to themselves: But 'tis
not to this End, I now seem to doubt what you
say to my Advantage: No, my Heart knows no
Disguise, nor can dissemble one Thought of it
to <HI>Damon;</HI> 'tis all sincere and honest as his
Wish: 'Tis therefore it tells you, it does not
credit every thing you say; though I believe,
you say abundance of Truths, in a great Part of
my Character. But when you advance to that,
which my own Sense, my Judgment, or my
Glass cannot perswade me to believe; you must
give me leave either to believe you think me
vain enough to credit you, or pleas'd that your

Sentiments and mine are differing in this Point.
But I doubt, I may rather reply in some Verses,
a Friend of yours and mine sent to a Person, she
thought, had but indifferent Sentiments for her;
yet, who nevertheless flatter'd her, because he
imagin'd she had a very great Esteem for him.
She is a Woman that, you know, naturally hates

<P>Possibly, the angry <HI>Aminta,</HI> when she writ
these Verses, was more offended, that he be∣liev'd
himself belov'd, than that he flatter'd;
tho' she wou'd seem to make that a great part
of the Qsuarrel, and Cause of her Resentment:
For we are often in an Humour to seem more
modest in that Point, than naturally we are;
being too apt to have a favourable Opinion of
<PB N="47" REF="180"/>
ourselves: And 'tis rather, the Effects of a Fear
that we are flatter'd, than our own ill Opinion
of the Beauty flatter'd; and that the Praiser
does not think so well of it, as we do our selves,
or as at least he wish she shou'd. Not but there
are Grains of Allowance for the Temper of him
that speaks: One Man's Humour is to talk much;
and he may be permitted to enlarge upon the
Praise he gives the Person he pretends to, with∣out
being accus'd of much Guilt. Another
hates to be Wordy; from such an one, I have
known one soft Expression, one tender Thing,
go as far as whole Days everlasting Protestati∣ons,
urg'd with Vows, and mighty Eloquence:
And both the one, and the other, indeed, must
be allow'd in good Manners, to stretch the
Complement beyond the Bounds of nice Truth:
and we must not wonder to hear a Man call a
Woman a Beauty, when she is not Ugly; or
another, a Great Wit, if she have but common
Sence above the Vulgar; well Bred, when well
Drest; and good Natur'd when Civil. And
as I shou'd be very ridiculous, if I took all you
said for absolute Truth; so I should be very
unjust, not to allow you very sincere, in almost
all you said besides; and those Things, the
most material to Love, Honour, and Friend∣ship.
And for the rest (<HI>Damon</HI>) be it true, or
false, this believe: You speak with such a Grace,
that I cannot chuse but Credit you; and find an
infinite Pleasure in that Faith, because I lovu
you: And if I cannot find the Cheat, I am con∣tented
you shou'd deceive me on, because yoe
do it so agreeably.</P>

Treason against Sacred Love. For all the

you may acquit your self like a Man, and a Lo∣ver

I may have all the Story of it in your next

<P>AFter you have sufficiently recollected your

call your Page into your Cabinet, or him whom
you trusted with your last Letter to me; where
you ought to enquire of him a thousand things;

if he answers not your Curiosity soon enough:
Think that he has a Dreaming in his Voice, in
these Moments, more than at other times; and
reproach him with Dulness. For 'tis most cer∣tain,
that when one loves tenderly, we wou'd
know in a Minute, what cannot be related in an

his Letter? And if he examin'd the Air of my
Face, when I took it? If I blush'd, or look'd
pale? If my Hand trembled, or I spoke to him
with short interrupting Sighs? If I ask'd him
any Questions about you, while I was opening
the Seal? Or if I cou'd not well speak, and was
silent? If I read it attentively, and with Joy?
And all this, before you open the Answer I have
sent you by him: Which, because you are im∣patient

I was in, when I writ that to you. For,
Oh! A Lover has a thousand little Fears, and
Dreads, he knows not why. In fine, make him
recount to you all that past, while he was with
me: And then you ought to read that which I
have sent, that you may inform your self of all
that passes in my Heart; for you may assure
your self, all that I say to you that way, pro∣ceeds

I will flatter my self, that 'tis so with you; and
that the least Evils appear great Misfortunes;

a new remembrance of her Absence. I will be∣lieve,
that these are your Sentiments, you are

Think it a Blessing, to be permitted to love me:
Think it so, because I permit it to you alone;
and never could be drawn to allow it any other.

The first thing you ought to consider is, that at
length I have suffer'd my self to be overcome, to
quit that Nicety that is natural to me, and re∣ceive
your Addresses; nay, thought 'em agree∣able;
and that I have at last confest, the Present
of your Heart is very dear to me. 'Tis true, I
did not accept of it the first time it was offer'd
me, nor before you had told me a thousand
times, that you could not escape expiring, if I
did not give you leave to sigh for me, and gaze
upon me; and that there was an absolute neces∣sity
for me, either to give you leave to love, or
die. And all those Rigors my Severity has made
you suffer, ought now to be recounted to your
Memory, as Subjects of Pleasure; and you ought
to esteem and judge of the Price of my Affecti∣ons
by the Difficulties you found in being able
to touch my Heart: Not but you have Charms
that can conquer at first sight; and you ought
not to have valued me less, if I had been more
easily gain'd: But 'tis enough to please you, to
think and know I am gain'd; no matter when
or how. When, after a thousand Cares and
Inquietudes, that which we wish for succeeds
to our Desires, the Remembrance of those Pains
and Pleasures we encounter'd, in arriving at it,
gives us a new Joy.</P>
<P>Remember also (<HI>Damon</HI>) that I have prefer'd
you before all those that have been thought
worthy of my Esteem; and that I have shut
my Eyes to all their pleading Merits, and cou'd
survey none but yours.</P>
<P>Consider then, that you had not only the
Happiness to please me, but that you only
<PB N="60" REF="187"/>
found out the way of doing it, and I had the
Goodness at last to tell you so, contrary to all
the Delicacy and Niceness of my Soul; contra∣ry
to my Prudence, and all those Scruples, you
know, are natural to my Humour.</P>
<P>My Tenderness proceeded further, and I
gave you innocent Marks of my new-born Pas∣sion,
on all Occasions that presented themselves:
For, after that, from my Eyes and Tongue you
knew the Sentiments of my Heart, I confirm'd
that Truth to you by my Letters. Confess,
(<HI>Damon</HI>) that if you make these Reflections,
you will not pass this Hour very disagreeably.</P>

found so much Sweetness in these Thoughts,
that if one did not tell you, that Supper waits,
you would lose yourself in Reflections so plea∣sing,

where you are expected; perhaps, among the
Fair, the Young, the Gay; but do not abandon
your Heart to too much Joy, tho' you have so
much Reason to be contented; but the greatest
Pleasures are alwaies imperfect, if the Ob∣ject
belov'd do not partake of it. For this
Reason be cheerful and merry with Reserve:
Do not talk too much, I know you do not
love it; and if you do it, 'twill be the effect of
too much Complaisance, or with some design of
pleasing too well; for you know your own
charming Power, and how agreeable your Wit
and Conversation is to all the World. Remem∣ber,
I am covetous of every Word you speak,
that is not address'd to me, and envy the happy
Listner, if I am not by: And I may reply to
you as <HI>Aminta</HI> did to <HI>Philander,</HI> when he charg'd
her of loving a Talker: And because, perhaps,

you have not heard it, I will, to divert you,

of those Wordy Sparks, that value them∣selves
upon their ready and much Talking upon
every trivial Subject, and who have so good an

make all the Conversation themselves, that they
may pass for very Entertaining Persons, and
pure Company. But the Verses—</P>

<L><HI>Philander,</HI> since you'll have it so,</L>
<L>I grant, I was impertinent;</L>
<L>And, till this Moment, did not know,</L>
<L>Through all my Life, what 'twas I meant.</L>
<L>Your kind Opinion was the flattering Glass,</L>
<L>In which my Mind found how deform'd it was.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In your clear Sense, which knows no Art,</L>
<L>I saw the Errors of my Soul;</L>
<L>And all the Foibless of my Heart,</L>

<L>Kind as a God, and gently you chastise:</L>
<L>By what you hate, you teach me to be wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Impertinence, my Sex's Shame,</L>
<L>That has so long my Life pursu'd,</L>
<L>You with such Modesty reclaim,</L>
<L>As all the Women has subdu'd.</L>
<L>To so Divine a Power what must I owe,</L>
<L>That renders me so like the perfect You?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="64" REF="189"/>
<L>That Conversable thing I hate</L>
<L>Already, with a just Disdain,</L>
<L>That prides himself upon his Prate,</L>
<L>And is, of Words, that Nonsence vain.</L>
<L>When in you few appears such Excellence,</L>
<L>As have reproach'd, and charm'd me into Sense.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For ever may I list'ning sit,</L>
<L>Tho' but each Hour a Word be born;</L>
<L>I would attend the coming Wit,</L>
<L>And bless what can so well inform.</L>
<L>Let the dull World henceforth to Words be dam'd;</L>
<L>I'm into nobler Sense than Talking sham'd.</L>
</LG>
<P>I believe you are so good a Lover, as to be of
my Opinion; and that you will neither force
yourself against Nature, nor find much occasion
to lavish out those excellent things that must
proceed from you, whenever you speak. If all
Women were like me, I should have more rea∣son
to fear your Silence than your Talk, for you
have a thousand waies to charm without speak∣ing;
and those which to me shew a great deal
more Concern. But (<HI>Damon</HI>) you know, the
greatest part of my Sex judge the fine Gentle∣man
by the Volubility of his Tongue, by his
Dexterity in Repartee, and cry,—<HI>Oh! he
never wants fine things to say: He's eternally talking
the most surprizing things.</HI> But (<HI>Damon</HI>) you
are well assur'd, I hope, that <HI>Iris</HI> is none of these
<HI>Coquets;</HI> at least, if she had any spark of it once
in her Nature, she is, by the Excellency of your
contrary Temper, taught to know, and scorn
the Folly: And take heed your Conduct never

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Complaisance.</HEAD>
<P>NEvertheless (<HI>Damon</HI>) Civility requires a
little Complaisance after Supper; and I
am assur'd, you can never want that, though, I
confess, you are not accus'd of too general a
Complaisance, and do not often make use of it
to those Persons you have an Indifference for;
though one is not the less esteemable, for having
more of this than one ought; and though an
excess of it be a Fault, 'tis a very excusable one:
Have therefore some for those with whom you
are: You may laugh with 'em, drink with 'em,
dance or sing with 'em; yet think of me. You
may discourse of a thousand indifferent things
with 'em, and at the same time still think of
me. If the Subject be any beautiful Lady, whom
they praise, either for her Person, Wit, or Vir∣tue,
you may apply it to me: And if you dare
not say it aloud, at least, let your Heart an∣swer
in this Language:
<Q><L>Yes, the fair Object, whom you praise,</L>
<L>Can give us Love a thousand ways.</L>
<L>Her Wit and Beauty charming are;</L>
<L>But still my <HI>Iris</HI> is more fair.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="190"/>
No Body ever spoke before me, of a faithful
Lover, but I still sigh'd, and thought of <HI>Damon:</HI>
And ever when they tell me Tales of Love, any
soft pleasing Intercourses of an Amour; Oh!
with what Pleasure do I listen! and with Plea∣sure
answer 'em, either with my Eyes, or
Tongue—
<Q><L>That Lover may his <HI>Silvia</HI> warm,</L>
<L>But cannot, like my <HI>Damon,</HI> charm.</L></Q></P>
<P>If I have not all those excellent Qualities
you meet with in those beautiful People, I am,
however, very glad that Love prepossesses your
Heart to my Advantage: And I need not tell
you (<HI>Damon</HI>) that a true Lover ought to per∣swade
himself, that all other Objects ought to
give place to her, for whom his Heart sighs.—But see, my <HI>Cupid</HI> tells you 'tis One a Clock,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Impossibility to Sleep.</HEAD>
<P>YOU have been up long enough; and <HI>Cupid,</HI>
who takes care of your Health, tells you,
'tis time for you to go to Bed. Perhaps you may
not sleep as soon as you are laid, and possibly
you may pass an Hour in Bed, before you shut
your Eyes. In this impossibility of sleeping, I
think it very proper for you to imagine what I
am doing, where I am. Let your Fancy take a
little Journey then invisible to observe my Acti∣ons
and my Conduct. You will find me sitting
alone in my Cabinet (for I am one that do not
love to go to Bed early) and will find me very
uneasie and pensive; pleas'd with none of those
things that so well entertain others. I shun all
Conversation, as far as Civility will allow, and
find no Satisfaction like being alone, where my
Soul may, without interruption, converse with
<HI>Damon.</HI> I sigh, and sometimes you will see my
<PB N="63" REF="191"/>
Cheeks wet with Tears, that insensibly glide
down at a thousand Thoughts that present them∣selves
soft and afflicting. I partake of all your
Inquietude. On other things I think with In∣difference,
if ever my Thoughts do stray from
the more agreeable Object. I find, however, a
little Sweetness in his Thought, that, during
my Absence, your Heart thinks of me, when
mine sighs for you. Perhaps I am mistaken,
and that at the same time that you are the En∣tertainment
of all my Thoughts, I am no more
in yours; and perhaps you are thinking of those
things that immortalize the Young and Brave;
either by those Glories the Muses flatter you
with, or that of <HI>Bellona,</HI> and the God of War;
and serving now a Monarch whose glorious Acts
in Arms has out-gone all the feign'd and real
Heroes of any Age, who has, himself, out-done
whatever History can produce of Great and
Brave, and set so illustrious an Example to the
Under-World, that it is not impossible, as much
a Lover as you are, but you are thinking now
how to render yourself worthy the Glory of such
a God-like Master, by projecting a thousand
things of Gallantry and Danger. And tho', I
confess, such Thoughts are proper for your
Youth, your Quality, and the Place you have the
Honour to hold under our Sovereign, yet let me
tell you (<HI>Damon</HI>) you will not be without In∣quietude,
if you think of either being a delicate
Poet, or a brave Warriour; for <HI>Love</HI> will still
interrupt your Glory, however you may think
to divert him, either by Writing or Fighting.
And you ought to remember these Verses:</P>

<HEAD>Love and Glory.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Beneath the kind protecting Lawrel's shade,</L>
<L>For sighing Lovers, and for Warriours made,</L>
<L>The soft <HI>Adonis</HI> and rough <HI>Mars</HI> were laid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Both were design'd to take their Rest;</L>
<L>But <HI>Love,</HI> the gentle Boy, opprest,</L>

<LG>
<L>This thinks to soften all his Toils of War,</L>

<L>And That, by Hunting to divert his Care.</L>

<LG>
<L>All Day, o'er Hills and Plains, wild Beasts he chas'd,</L>
<L>Swift as the flying Winds, his eager haste,</L>
<L>In vain! the God of Love pursues as fast.</L>

<L>But, oh! no Sports, no Toils divertive prove,</L>

<L>Where Elegies and Sonnets he does frame,</L>
<L>And to the list'ning Ecchoes sighs her Name,</L>
<L>And on the Trees carves Records of his Flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Warriour, in the dusty Camp all Day,</L>
<L>With ratling Drums and Trumpets does essay,</L>
<L>To fright the tender flatt'ring God away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But still, alas, in vain: whate'er Delight,</L>
<L>What Care he takes the wanton Boy to fright,</L>
<L><HI>Love</HI> still revenges it at Night.</L>

<LG>
<PB N="70" REF="192"/>
<L>'Tis then he haunts the Royal Tent,</L>
<L>The sleeping Hours in Sighs are spent,</L>
<L>And all his Resolutions does prevent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In all his Pains, <HI>Love</HI> mix'd his Smart;</L>
<L>In every Wound he feels a Dart;</L>
<L>And the soft God is trembling in his Heart.</L>

<LG>
<L>Then he retires to shady Groves,</L>
<L>And there, in vain, he seeks Repose,</L>
<L>And strives to fly from what he cannot lose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus he lay, <HI>Bellona</HI> came,</L>
<L>And with a generous fierce Disdain</L>
<L>Ʋpbraids him with his feeble Flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Arise, the World's great Terror, and their Care;</L>
<L>Behold the glitt'ring Host from far,</L>
<L>That waits the Conduct of the God of War.</L>

<L>Beneath these glorious Lawrels, which were made</L>
<L>To Crown the Noble Victor's Head,</L>
<L>Why thus supinely art thou laid?</L>

oftentimes in Affliction, even under the Shades
of their protecting Lawrels; and let the Nymphs
and Virgins sing what they please to their Me∣mory,
under the Mirtles, and on Flow'ry Beds,
much better Days than in the Campaign. Nor
do the Crowns of Glory surpass those of Love:
The first is but an empty Name, which is won,
kept, and lost with Hazard; but Love more
nobly employs a brave Soul, and all his Pleasures
are solid and lasting; and when one has a wor∣thy
Object of one's Flame, Glory accompanies
Love too. But go to sleep, the Hour is come;

<P>I Doubt not but you will think it very bold

to rule even your Sleeping Hours, and that my
<HI>Cupid</HI> should govern your very Dreams; which

are but Thoughts disorder'd, in which Reason
has no part; Chimera's of the Imagination, and
no more: But tho' my Watch does not pretend
to Counsel unreasonable, yet you must allow it
here; if not to pass the Bounds, at least, to ad∣vance
to the utmost limits of it. I am assur'd,
that after having thought so much of me in the
Day, you will think of me also in the Night. And
the first Dream my <HI>Watch</HI> permits you to make,
is to think you are in Conversation with me.</P>
<P>Imagine (<HI>Damon</HI>) that you are talking to
me of your Passion, with all the Transport of a

That all my Looks and Blushes, while you are

that you are not indifferent to me, and that I

all Innocent and Obliging.</P>
<P>While you are saying all that Love can dictate,
all that Wit and good Manners can invent, and
all that I wish to hear from <HI>Damon,</HI> believe in

having shew'd me the Ardour of your Flame,
that I confess to you the Bottom of my Heart,
and all the loving Secrets there; that I give you
Sigh for Sigh, Tenderness for Tenderness,
Heart for Heart, and Pleasure for Pleasure.
And I would have your Sense of this Dream so
perfect, and your Joy so entire, that if it hap∣pen
you should awake with the Satisfaction from
this Dream, you should find your Heart still pan∣ting

Transport, and you should be ready to cry

<HEAD>The Request.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Oh <HI>Iris!</HI> let my sleeping Hours be fraught</L>
<L>With Joys, which you deny my waking Thought.</L>
<L>Is't not enough you absent are?</L>
<L>Is't not enough I sigh all Day,</L>
<L>And languish out my Life in Care,</L>
<L>To e'ery Passion made a Prey?</L>
<L>I burn with Love and soft Desire;</L>
<L>I rave with Jealousie and Fear:</L>
<L>All Day, for Ease, my Soul I tire;</L>
<L>In vain I search it e'ery-where:</L>
<L>It dwells not with the Witty or the Fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It is not in the Camp or Court,</L>
<L>In Bus'ness, Musick, or in Sport;</L>
<L>The Plays, the Park, and Mall afford</L>
<L>No more than the dull Basset-board.</L>
<L>The Beauties in the Drawing-room,</L>
<L>With all their Sweetness, all their Bloom,</L>
<L>No more my faithful Eyes invite,</L>
<L>Nor rob my <HI>Iris</HI> of a Sigh or Glance,</L>

There let me find you kind, and that you give</L>
<L>All that a Man of Honour dares receive.</L>
<L>And may my Eyes Eternal Watches keep,</L>

</LG>
<P>Some such Complaint as this, I know you will
make; but (<HI>Damon</HI>) if the little Quarrels of
Lovers render the reconciling Moments so infi∣nitely
Charming, you must needs allow, that
these little Chagrins in capricious Dreams must
awaken you to more Joy to find 'em but Dreams,
than if you had met with no Disorder there.
'Tis for this Reason that I wou'd have you suf∣fer
a little Pain, for a coming Pleasure; nor,
indeed, is it possible for you to escape the
Dreams my <HI>Cupid</HI> points you out. You shall
dream that I have a thousand <HI>Foiblesses,</HI> some∣thing
of the lightness of my Sex; that my Soul
is employ'd in a thousand Vanities; that (proud
and fond of Lovers) I make Advances for the
Glory of a Slave, without any other Interest, or
Design, than that of being ador'd. I will give
you leave to think my Heart fickle, and that,
far from resigning it to any one, I lend it only
for a Day, or an Hour, and take it back at
pleasure, that I am a very <HI>Coquet,</HI> even to Im∣pertinence.</P>
<P>All this I give you leave to think, and to of∣fend
me; but 'tis in Sleep only that I permit it;
for I would never pardon you the least Offence
of this nature, if in any other kind than in a
Dream. Nor is it enough Affliction to you, to
imagine me thus idly vain; but you are to pass
on to an hundred more capricious Humours; as
<PB N="76" REF="195"/>
that I exact of you a hundred unjust Things;
that I pretend you should break off with all your
Friends, and for the future, have none at all;
that I will, myself, do those Things, which I
violently condemn in you; and that I will have
for others, as well as you, that tender Friend∣ship
that resembles Love, or rather that Love
which People call Friendship; and that I will
not, after all, have you dare complain on me.</P>
<P>In fine, be as ingenious as you please, to tor∣ment
yourself; and believe, that I am become
unjust, ungrateful, and insensible: But were I

Heart, and tell me; Wou'd your Love stand
the Proof of all these Faults in me? But know,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Jealousie in Dreams.</HEAD>
<P>DO not think (<HI>Damon</HI>) to wake yet; for I
design you shall yet suffer a little more:
Jealousie must now possess you, that Tyrant o∣ver
the Heart, that compels your very Reason,
and seduces all your good Nature. And in this
Dream, you must believe that in sleeping which
<PB N="77" REF="195"/>
you cou'd not do me the Injustice to do when
awake. And here you must explain all my Acti∣ons
to the utmost Disadvantage: Nay, I will
wish, that the force of this Jealousie may be so
extream, that it may make you languish in Grief
and be overcome with Anger.</P>
<P>You shall now imagine, that one of your Ri∣vals
is with me, interrupting all you say, or hin∣dring
all you wou'd say; that I have no atten∣tion
to what you say aloud to me, but that I in∣cline
my Ear to hearken to all that he whispers
to me. You shall repine, that he pursues me
every-where, and is eternally at your Heels if
you approach me; that I caress him with Sweet∣ness
in my Eyes, and that Vanity in my Heart,
that possesses the Humors of almost all the Fair;
that is, to believe it greatly for my Glory to
have abundance of Rivals for my Lovers. I
know you love too well, not to be extreamly
uneasie in the Company of a Rival, and to have
one perpetually near me; for let him be belov'd
or not by the Mistress, it must be confess'd, a
Rival is a very troublesome Person: But, to af∣flict
you to the utmost, I will have you imagine
that my Eyes approve of all his Thoughts; that
they flatter him with Hopes, and that I have ta∣ken
away my Heart from you, to make a Pre∣sent
of it to this more lucky Man. You shall
suffer, while possess'd with this Dream, all that a
cruel Jealousie can make a tender Soul suffer.</P>

Spightful as Witchcraft, which th' Invoker harms;</L>

<L>Thou Opposite to Good, Antipathy to Joy,</L>
<L>Whose Attributes are cruel, Rage, and Fire,</L>
<L>Reason debauch'd, false Sence, and mad Desire.</L>
<P>In fine, it is a Passion that ruffles all the Sen∣ses,
and disorders the whole Frame of Nature.
It makes one hear and see what was never spoke
and what never was in view. 'Tis the Bane of
Health and Beauty, an unmannerly Intruder;
and an Evil of Life worse than Death. She is a
very cruel Tyrant in the Heart; she possesses

And you shall be this unhappy Lover (<HI>Damon</HI>)

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Accommodation in Dreams.</HEAD>
<P>THough the angry Lovers force themselves,
all they can, to chase away the trouble∣some
Tenderness of the Heart, in the height of
their Quarrels, Love sees all their Sufferings,
pities and redresses 'em: And when we begin
to cool, and a soft Repentance follows the
Chagrin of the Love-Quarrel, 'tis then that
Love takes the advantage of both Hearts, and
renews the charming Friendship more forcibly
than ever, puts a stop to all our Feuds, and ren∣ders
the Peace-making Minutes the most dear
and tender part of our Life. How pleasing 'tis
to see your Rage dissolve! How sweet, how soft
is every Word that pleads for Pardon at my
Feet! 'Tis there that, you tell me, your very
Sufferings are over-paid, when I but assure you
from my Eyes, that I will forget your Crime:
And your Imagination shall here present me the
<PB N="82" REF="198"/>
most sensible of your past Pain, that you can
wish; and that, all my Anger being vanish'd, I
give you a thousand Marks of my Faith and
Gratitude; and lastly, to crown all, that we
again make new Vows to one another of invio∣lable
Peace.</P>
<Q><L>After these Debates of Love,</L>
<L>Lovers thousand Pleasures prove,</L>
<L>Which they ever think to taste,</L>
<L>Tho' oftentimes they do not last.</L></Q>
<P>Enjoy then all the Pleasures that a Heart that
is very amorous, and very tender, can enjoy.
Think no more on those Inquietudes that you
have suffer'd, bless <HI>Love</HI> for his Favours, and
thank me for my Graces; and resolve to en∣dure
any thing, rather than enter upon any new
Quarrels. And however dear the reconciling
Moments are, there proceeds a great deal of
Evil from these little frequent Quarrels; and I
think, the best Counsel we can follow, is to a∣void
'em as near as we can: And if we cannot,
but that, in spight of Love and good Under∣standing,
they should break out, we ought to
make as speedy a Peace as possible, for 'tis not
good to grate the Heart too long, lest it grow
harden'd insensibly, and lose its native Tem∣per.
A few Quarrels there must be in Love;
Love cannot support itself without 'em; and,
besides the Joy of an Accommodation, Love be∣comes
by it more strongly united, and more
charming. Therefore let the Lover receive this
as a certain Receipt against declining Love:</P>

For thus far I pretend to give Bounds to your
Imagination, and will not have it pass beyond
'em: Take heed, in Sleeping, you give no Ear
to a flatt'ring <HI>Cupid,</HI> that will favour your slum∣bring
Minutes with Lies too pleasing and vain:
You are discreet enough when you are awake;
Will you not be so in Dreams?</P>
<P><HI>Damon,</HI> awake: My <HI>Watch</HI>'s Course is done;
after this, you cannot be ignorant of what you
ought to do during my absence. I did not be∣lieve
it necessary to caution you about Balls and
Comedies; you know, a Lover depriv'd of his
Mistress, goes seldom there. But if you cannot
handsomly avoid these Divertions, I am not so
unjust a Mistress, to be angry with you for it;
go, if Civility, or other Duties, oblige you: I
will only forbid you, in consideration of me,
not to be too much satisfied with those Plea∣sures,
but see 'em so, as the World, may have
Reason to say, you do not seek 'em, you do
not make a Business or a Pleasure of 'em, and
that 'tis Complaisance, and not Inclination, that
carries you thither. Seem rather negligent than
concern'd at any thing there; and let every
part of you say, Iris <HI>is not here.</HI>—</P>
<P>I say nothing to you neither of your Duty
elsewhere; I am satisfied you know it too well,
and have too great a Veneration for your Glori∣ous
Master, to neglect any part of that for even
Love itself: And I very well know how much
you love to be eternally near his illustrious Per∣son;
and that you scarce prefer your Mistress
<PB N="85" REF="199"/>
before him, in point of Love: In all things else,
I give him leave to take place of <HI>Iris,</HI> in the no∣ble
Heart of <HI>Damon.</HI></P>
<P>I am satisfied you pass your Time well now
at <HI>Windsor,</HI> for you adore that place, and 'tis not▪
indeed, without great Reason; for 'tis most cer∣tainly
now render'd the most glorious Palace
in the Christian World. And had our late
Gracious Soveraign of blessed Memory had no
other Miracles and Wonders of his Life and
Reign, to have immortaliz'd his Fame, (of
which there shall remain a Thousand to Posteri∣ty)
this Noble Structure alone, this Building
(almost Divine) would have eterniz'd the great
Name of Glorious <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, till the
World moulder again to its old Confusion, its
first <HI>Chaos.</HI> And the Paintings of the famous
<HI>Vario,</HI> and Noble Carvings of the unimitable
<HI>Gibon,</HI> shall never die, but remain, to tell suc∣ceeding
Ages, that all Arts and Learning were
not confin'd to ancient <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> but
that <HI>England</HI> too could boast its mightiest
Share. Nor is the In-side of this Magnificent
Structure, immortaliz'd with so many eternal I∣mages
of the Illustrious <HI>Charles</HI> and <HI>Katherine,</HI>
more to be admir'd than the wondrous Pro∣spects
without. The stupendious Heighth, on
which the famous Pile is built, renders the Fields
and Flowery Meads below, the Woods, the
Thickets, and the winding Streams, the most
delightful Object that ever Nature produc'd.
Beyond all these, and far below, in an inviting
Vale, the venerable College, an Old, but No∣ble
Building, raises itself, in the midst of all the
<PB N="86" REF="200"/>
Beauties of Nature, high-grown Trees, fruitful
Plains, purling Rivulets, and spacious Gardens,
adorn'd with all Variety of Sweets that can de∣light
the Senses.</P>
<P>At farther distance yet, on an Ascent almost
as high as that to the Royal Structure, you may
behold that famous and noble <HI>Clifdon</HI> Rise, a Pa∣lace
erected by the illustrious Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham:</HI>
Who will leave this wondrous Piece of
Architecture, to inform the future World of
the Greatness and Delicacy of his Mind, it be∣ing,
for its Situation, its Prospects, and its
marvellous Contrivances, one of the finest <HI>Villa</HI>'s
of the World; at least, were it finish'd as be∣gun;
and would sufficiently declare the mag∣nifick
Soul of the Hero that caus'd it to be
built, and contriv'd all its Fineness. And this
makes up not the least part of the beautiful Pro∣spect
from the Palace-Royal, while on the other
side lies spread a fruitful and delightful Park and
Forest, well stor'd with Deer, and all that make
the Prospect charming; fine Walks, Groves,
distant Valleys, Downs and Hills, and all that
Nature could invent, to furnish out a quiet soft
Retreat for the most Fair and most Charming
of Queens, and the most Heroick, Good, and
Just of Kings: And these Groves alone are fit
and worthy to divert such Earthly Gods.</P>
<P>Nor can Heaven, Nature, or Humane Art
contrive an Addition to this Earthly Paradise,
unless those great Inventors of the Age, Sir <HI>Sa∣muel
Morland,</HI> or Sir <HI>Robert Gorden,</HI> cou'd, by
the Power of Engines, convey the Water so in∣to
the Park and Castle, as to furnish it with de∣lightful
<PB N="87" REF="200"/>
Fountains, both useful and beautiful.
These are only wanting, to render the Place all
Perfection, without Exception.</P>
<P>This, <HI>Damon,</HI> is a long Digression from the
Business of my Heart; but, you know, I am so
in Love with that charming Court, that when
you gave me an Occasion, by your being there
now, but to name the Place, I could not forbear
transgressing a little, in favour of its wondrous
Beauty; and the rather, because I wou'd, in
recounting it, give you to understand how ma∣ny
fine Objects there are, besides the Ladies that
adorn it, to employ your vacant Moments in;
and hope you will, without my Instructions,
pass a great part of your idle Time in surveying
these Prospects, and give that Admiration you
shou'd pay to living Beauty, to those more vene∣rable
Monuments of everlasting Fame.</P>
<P>Neither need I (<HI>Damon</HI>) assign you your wait∣ing
Times; your Honour, Duty, Love, and
Obedience will instruct you when to be near
the Person of the King; and, I believe, you will
omit no part of that Devoir. You ought to e∣stablish
your Fortune aud your Glory: For I
am not of the Mind of those Critical Lovers,
who believe it a very hard Matter to reconcile
Love and Interest, to adore a Mistress, and serve
a Master at the same time. And I have heard
those, who, on this Subject, say, <HI>Let a Man be
never so careful in these double Duties, 'tis Ten to
One but he loses his Fortune or his Mistress.</HI> These
are Errors that I condemn: And I know, that
Love and Ambition are not incompatible, but
that a brave Man may preserve all his Duties to
<PB N="88" REF="201"/>

for his Mistress. And this is my Notion of it.</P>

</LG>
<P>After having told you, my lovely <HI>Iris,</HI> that I
design to put your Watch into a Heart I
ought to shew you the Ornaments of the Case.
I do intend to have 'em Crown'd Cyphers. I
do not mean those Crowns of Vanity, which
are put indifferently on all sorts of Cyphers:
No, I must have such, as may distinguish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
from the rest; and may be true Emblems of
what I wou'd represent. My four Cyphers
therefore shall be Crown'd with these four
Wreaths of Olive, Laurel, Myrtle, and Roles:
And the Letters that begin the Names of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and <HI>Damon,</HI> shall compose the Cyphers;
though I must intermix some other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that bear another Sence, and have another
Signification.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The First CYPHER.</HEAD>
<P>THE first Cypher is compos'd of an I, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
a <HI>D,</HI> which are joyn'd by an <HI>L,</HI> and an
<HI>E:</HI> Which signifies, Love extream. And 'tis
but just, O adorable <HI>Iris!</HI> that Love shou'd be
<PB N="95" REF="204"/>
mixt with our Cyphers, and that Love alone
shou'd be the Union of 'em.</P>
<Q><L>Love ought alone the Mystick Knot to die;</L>
<L>Love, that great Master of all Arts:</L>
<L>And this dear <HI>Cypher,</HI> is to let you see,</L>
<L>Love unites Names, as well as Hearts.</L></Q>
<P>Without this charming Union, our Souls
could not communicate those invisible Sweet∣nesses,
which compleat the Felicity of Lovers;
and which, the most tender and passionate Ex∣pressions,
are too feeble to make us compre∣hend.
But, my adorable <HI>Iris,</HI> I am contented
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he vast Pleasure I feel in loving well,
without the Care of expressing it well; if you
will imagine my Pleasure, without expressing
it. For I confess, 'twou'd be no Joy to me to
adore you, if you did not perfectly believe I
did adore you. Nay, though you lov'd me, if
you had no Faith in me, I shou'd languish, and
love in as much Pain, as if you scorn'd, and at
the same time believ'd I dy'd for you. For sure∣ly,
<HI>Iris,</HI> 'tis a greater Pleasure to please, than
to be pleas'd; and the glorious Power of gi∣ving,
is infinitely a greater Satisfaction, than
that of receiving; there is so great and God∣like
a Quality in it. I wou'd have your Belief
therefore equal to my Passion, extream; as in∣deed,
all Love shou'd be, or it cannot bear
that Divine Name: It can pass but for an indif∣ferent
Affection. And these Cyphers ought to
make the World find all the noble Force of
delicate Passion. For, O my <HI>Iris!</HI> what wou'd
<PB N="96" REF="205"/>
Love signifie, if we did not love fervently. Si∣sters
and Brothers Love; Friends and Relati∣ons
have Affections; but where the Souls are
joyn'd, which are fill'd with eternal soft Wishes,
Oh! there is some Excess of Pleasure, which
cannot be exprest!</P>
<P>Your Looks, your dear obliging Words, and
your charming Letters have sufficiently perswa∣ded
me of your Tenderness; and you might
surely see the Excess of my Passion, by my
Cares, my Sighs, and entire Resignation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
your Will. I never think of <HI>Iris,</HI> but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Heart feels double Flames, and pants and
heaves with double Sighs; and whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
makes its Ardors known, by a thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
sports: And they are very much to blame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
give the Name of Love to feeble easie Passions:
Such transitory tranquil Inclinations are at best
but Well-wishers to Love; and a Heart that
has such Heats as those, ought not put, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
into the Rank of those nobler Victims that are
offer'd at the Shrine of Love. But our Souls,
<HI>Iris,</HI> burn with a more glorious Flame, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
lights and conducts us beyond a Possibility of
losing one another. 'Tis this that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
my Hopes: 'Tis this alone makes me believe
myself worthy of <HI>Iris:</HI> And let her judge
of its Violence, by the Greatness of its Sple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dour.</P>
<P>Does not a Passion of this Nature, so true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
ardent, deserve to be crown'd? And will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Second CYPHER.</HEAD>
<P>IS crown'd with Olives; and I add to the two
Letters of our Names, an <HI>R,</HI> and an <HI>L,</HI> for
Reciprocal Love. Every time that I have given
you, O lovely <HI>Iris!</HI> Testimonies of my Passion,
I have been so blest, as to receive some from
your Bounty; and you have been pleas'd to
flatter me with a Belief, that I was not indif∣ferent
to you. I dare therefore say, that being
honour'd with the Glory of your Tenderness
and Care, I ought, as a Trophy of my illustri∣ous
Conquest, to adorn the Watch with a Cy∣pher,
that is so advantageous to me. Ought I
not to esteem myself the most fortunate and
happy of Mankind, to have exchang'd my
Heart with so charming and admirable a Per∣son
<PB N="98" REF="206"/>
as <HI>Iris?</HI> Ah! how sweet, how precious is
the Change; and how vast a Glory arrives to
me from it! Oh! you must not wonder if my
Soul abandon itself to a thousand Extasies! In
the Merchandize of Hearts, Oh! how dear it is,
to receive as much as one gives; and better
Heart for Heart! Oh! I wou'd not receive
mine again, for all the Crowns the Universe
contains! Nor ought you, my Adorable, make
any Vows or Wishes, ever to retrieve yours;
or shew the least Repentance for the Blessing
you have given me. The Exchange we made,
was confirm'd by a noble Faith; and you ought
to believe, you have bestow'd it well, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
you are paid for it, a Heart that is so confor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣able
to yours, so true, so just, and so full of
Adoration: And nothing can be the just Re∣compence
of Love, but Love; and to enjoy
the true Felicity of it, our Hearts ought to
keep an equal Motion; and, like the Scales <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f
Justice, always hang even.</P>
<P>'Tis the Property of Reciprocal Love, to
make the Heart feel the Delicacy of Love, and
to give the Lover all the Ease and Softness he
can reasonably hope. Such a Love renders all
things advantageous and prosperous: Such a
Love triumphs over all other Pleasures. And I
put a Crown of Olives over the Cypher of Re∣ciprocal
Love, to make known, that two Hearts,
where Love is justly equal, enjoy a Peace, that
nothing can disturb.</P>
<Q><PB N="99" REF="206"/>
<L>Olives are never fading seen;</L>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Third CYPHER.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>C,</HI> and the <HI>L,</HI> which are joyn'd to the
Letters of our Names in this Cypher,
crown'd with Laurel, explains a constant Love.
It will not, my fair <HI>Iris,</HI> suffice, that my Love
is extream, my Passion violent, and my Wishes
fervent, or that our Loves are reciprocal: But
it ought also to be constant; for in Love, the I∣magination
is oftner carried to those things that
may arrive, and which we wish for, than to
things that Time has robb'd us of: And in those
agreeable Thoughts of Joys to come, the Heart
takes more delight to wander, than in all those
that are past; though the Remembrance of 'em
are very dear, and very charming. We shou'd
be both unjust, if we were not perswaded we
are possest with a Vertue, the Use of which is so
admirable, as that of Constancy. Our Loves
are not of that sort, that can finish, or have
end; but such a Passion, so perfect, and so con∣stant,
that it will be a President for future Ages,
to love perfectly; and when they wou'd express
an extream Passion, they will say, <HI>They lov'd, as</HI>
Damon <HI>did the charming</HI> Iris. And he that knows
<PB N="100" REF="207"/>
the Glory of constant Love, will despise those
fading Passions, those little Amusements, that
serve for a Day. What Pleasure, or Depen∣dance
can one have in a Love of that sort?
What Concern? What Raptures can such an
Amour produce in a Soul? And what, Satis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ction
can one promise one's self, in playing
with a false Gamester; who, though you
are aware of him, in spight of all your Pre∣caution,
puts the false Dice upon you, and
wins all?</P>
<LG>
<L>Those Eyes, that can no better Conquest make,</L>
<L>Let 'em ne'r look abroad:</L>
<L>Such, but the empty Name of Lovers take,</L>
<L>And so prophane the God.</L>
<L>Better they never shou'd pretend,</L>
<L>Than e'er begun to make an End.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of that fond Flame, what shall we say,</L>
<L>That's born and languish'd in a Day?</L>
<L>Such short-liv'd Blessings cannot bring</L>
<L>The Pleasure of an Envying.</L>
<L>Who is't will celebrate that Flame,</L>
<L>That's damn'd to such a scanty Fame?</L>
<L>While constant Love, the Nymphs and Swains</L>
<L>Still sacred make, in lasting Strains,</L>
<L>And chearful Lays throughout the Plains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A constant Love knows no Decay;</L>
<L>But still advancing e'ery D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</L>
<L>Will last as long as Life can stay,</L>
<L><PB N="101" REF="207"/>
With e'ery Look and Smile improves,</L>
<L>With the same Ardour always moves,</L>
<L>With such, as <HI>Damon,</HI> charming <HI>Iris</HI> loves!</L>
</LG>
<P>Constant Love finds it self impossible to be
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken; it resists the Attacks of Envy, and a
thousand Accidents that endeavour to change
it: Nothing can disoblige it, but a known False∣ness,
or Contempt: Nothing can remove it,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for a short Moment it may lie sullen and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, it recovers, and returns with greater
Force and Joy. I therefore, with very good
Reason, Crown this <HI>Cypher</HI> of <HI>Constant Love</HI>
with a Wreath of <HI>Laurel;</HI> since such Love al∣ways
triumphs over Time and Fortune, though
it be not her Property to besiege; for she cannot
overcome, but in defending herself; but the
Victories she gains, are never the less glorious.</P>
<Q><L>For far less Conquest, we have known</L>
<L>The Victor wear the Laurel Crown.</L>
<L>The Triumph with more Pride let him receive;</L>
<L>While those of Love, at least, more Pleasures give.</L></Q>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Fourth CYPHER.</HEAD>
<P>PErhaps, my lovely Maid, you will not find
out what I mean by the <HI>S,</HI> and the <HI>L,</HI> in
this last Cypher, that is crown'd with Roses. I
will therefore tell you, I mean <HI>Secret Love.</HI>
There are very few People, who know the Na∣ture
of that Pleasure, which so Divine a Love
creates: And let me say what I will of it, they
must feel it themselves, who wou'd rightly un∣derstand
<PB N="102" REF="208"/>
it, and all its ravishing Sweets. But
this there is a great deal of Reason to believe,
the Secrecy in Love doubles the Pleasures of it.
And I am so absolutely perswaded of this, that
I believe all those Favours that are not kept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣cret,
are dull and paul'd, very insipid and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Pleasures: And let the Favours be never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
innocent that a Lover receives from a Mistre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,
she ought to value 'em, set a Price upon '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and make the Lover pay dear; while he recei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
'em with Difficulty, and sometimes with Hazard.
A Lover that is not secret, but suffers every
one to count his Sighs, has, at most, but a fee∣ble
Passion, such as produces sudden and tran∣sitory
Desires, which die as soon as born. A
true Love has not this Character; for whenso∣ever
'tis made Publick, it ceases to be a Plea∣sure,
and is only the Result of Vanity. Not
that I expect our Loves shou'd always remain a
Secret: No, I shou'd never, at that Rate, ar∣rive
to a Blessing, which, above all the Glories
of the Earth, I aspire to; but even then, there
are a thousand Joys, a thousand Pleasures that
I shall be as careful to conceal from the foolish
World, as if the whole Preservation of that
Pleasure depended on my Silence; as indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
does in a great Measure.</P>
<P>To this Cypher I put a Crown of Roses, which
are not Flowers of a very lasting Date. And
'tis to let you see, that 'tis impossible Love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
be long hid. We see every Day, with what fine
Dissimulation and Pains, People conceal a thou∣sand
Hates and Malices, Disgusts, Disobligati∣ons,
and Resentments, without being able to
<PB N="103" REF="208"/>
conceal the least part of their Love; but Repu∣tation
has an Ardour, as well as Roses; and a
Lover ought to esteem that as the dearest and
tenderest Thing; not only that of his own,
which is, indeed, the least part; but that of his
Mistress, more valuable to him than Life. He
ought to endeavour to give People no occasion
to make false Judgments of his Actions or to
give their Censures; which, most certainly are
never in the Favour of the fair Person; for
likely, those false Censures are of the busie Fe∣male
Sex, the Coquets of that number; whose
little Spights and Railleries, joyn'd to that fan∣cy'd
Wit they boast of, sets 'em at Odds with
all the Beautiful and Innocent: And how very
little of that kind serves to give the World a
Faith, when a thousand Vertues, told of the
same Persons, by more credible Witnesses and
Judges, shall pass unregarded; so willing and
inclin'd is all the World to credit the Ill, and
condemn the Good. And yet, Oh! what pity
'tis, we are compell'd to live in Pain, to oblige
this foolish scandalous World! And tho' we
know each others Vertue and Honour, we are
oblig'd to observe that Caution (to humour the
Talking Town) which takes away so great a
part of the Pleasure of Life! 'Tis therefore that
among these Roses, you will find some Thorns;
by which you may imagine, that in Love, Pre∣caution
is necessary to its Secrecy: And we must
restrain our selves, upon a thousand Occasions,
with so much Care, that, O <HI>Iris!</HI> 'tis impossible
to be Discreet, without Pain; but 'tis a Pain
that creates a thousand Pleasures.</P>

<P>AH, charming <HI>Iris!</HI> Ah, my lovely Maid!
'Tis now in a more peculiar Manner, that
I require your Aid in the finishing of my De∣sign,

<HI>Inviolable Faith:</HI> For this Case, this Heart ought
to be shut up by this eternal Clasp. Oh, there
is nothing so necessary as this! Nothing can
secure Love, but Faith.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="209"/>
That Vertue ought to be a Guard to all the
Heart thinks, and all the Mouth utters: Nor
can Love say he triumphs without it. And
when that remains not in the Heart, all the rest
deserves no Regard. Oh! I have not lov'd so
ill, to leave one Doubt upon your Soul. Why
then, will you want that Faith? O unkind
Charmer, that my Passion, and my Services so
justly merit!</P>
<LG>
<L>When two Hearts entirely love,</L>
<L>And in one Sphere of Honour move,</L>
<L>Each maintains the other's Fire,</L>
<L>With a Faith that is entire.</L>
<L>For what heedless Youth bestows,</L>
<L>On a faithless Maid, his Vows.</L>
<L>Faith without Love, bears Vertue's Price;</L>
<L>But Love, without her Mixture, is a Vice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Love, like Religion, still shou'd be,</L>
<L>In the Foundation, firm and true:</L>
<L>In Points of Faith, shou'd still agree:</L>
<L>Tho' Innovations vain and new</L>
<L>(Love's little Quarrels) may arise;</L>
<L>In Fundamentals still they're just and wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, charming Maid, be sure of this:</L>
<L>Allow me Faith as well as Love;</L>
<L>Since that alone affords no Bliss,</L>
<L>Ʋnless your Faith your Love improve.</L>
<L>Either resolve to let me die</L>
<L>By fairer Play, your Cruelty;</L>

<L>In mad Despair I'd rather fall,</L>

<P>So certain it is, that Love without Faith, is
of no value.</P>
<P>In fine, my adorable <HI>Iris,</HI> this Case shall be,
as near as I can, like those delicate ones of <HI>Fil∣ligrin</HI>
Work, which do not hinder the Sight
from taking a View of all within: You may
therefore see, through this Heart, all your
Watch. Nor is my Desire of preserving this
inestimable Piece more, than to make it the
whole Rule of my Life and Actions. And my
chiefest Design in these Cyphers, is to compre∣hend
in them, the principal Vertues that are
most necessary to Love. Do not we know,
that Reciprocal Love is Justice; Constant Love,
Fortitude; Secret Love, Prudence? Though
'tis true, that Extream Love, that is, Excess
of Love, in one Sense, appears not to be Tem∣perance;
yet you must know, my <HI>Iris,</HI> that in
Matters of Love, Excess is a Vertue, and that
all other Degrees of Love are worthy Scorn
alone. 'Tis this alone, that can make good
the glorious Title: 'Tis this alone, that can
bear the true Name of Love; and this alone,
that can bear the true Name of Love; and
this alone, that renders the Lovers truly hap∣py,
in spight of all the Storms of Fate, and
Shocks of Fortune. This is an Antidote against
all other Griefs: This bears up the Soul in all

<HEAD>THE
Lady's Looking-Glass,
TO
DRESS Herself by:
OR, THE
ART of Charming.</HEAD>
<P>HOW long, O charming <HI>Iris!</HI> shall
I speak in vain of your adorable
Beauty? You have been just, and
believe I love you with a Passion
perfectly tender and extream; and yet you
will not allow your Charms to be infinite.
You must either accuse my Flames to be unrea∣sonable,
and that my Eyes and Heart are false
Judges of Wit and Beauty; or allow, that
you are the most perfect of your Sex. But in∣stead
of that, you always accuse of me Flat∣tery,
when I speak of your infinite Merit; and
when I refer you to your Glass, you tell me,
that flatters, as well as <HI>Damon;</HI> though one
<PB N="2" REF="214"/>
wou'd imagine, that shou'd be a good Witness
for the Truth of what I say, and undeceive you
of the Opinion of my Injustice. Look—and
confirm yourself, that nothing can equal your
Perfections. All the World says it, and you
must doubt it no longer. <HI>O Iris!</HI> Will you di∣spute
against the whole World?</P>
<P>But since you have so long distrusted your
own Glass, I have here presented you with one,
which I know is very true; and having been
made for you only, can serve only you. All o∣ther
Glasses present all Objects, but this reflects
only <HI>Iris;</HI> whenever you consult it, it will con∣vince
you; and tell you, how much Right I
have done you, when I told you, you were the
fairest Person that ever Nature made. When
other Beauties look into it, it will speak to all
the fair Ones; but let 'em do what they will,
'twill say nothing to their Advantage.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Iris,</HI> to spare what you call flattery,</L>
<L>Consult your Glass each Hour of the Day:</L>
<L>'Twill tell you where your Charms and Beauties lie,</L>
<L>And where your little wanton Graces play:</L>
<L>Where Love does revel in your Face and Eyes;</L>
<L>What Look invites your Slaves, and what denies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where all the Loves adorn you with such Care,</L>
<L>Where dress your Smiles, where arm your lovely Eyes;</L>
<L>Where deck the flowing Tresses of your Hair:</L>
<L>How cause your Snowy Breasts to fall and rise:</L>
<L>How this severe Glance makes the Lover die;</L>
<L>How that, more soft, gives Immortality.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="214"/>
<L>Where you shall see, what 'tis enslaves the Soul;</L>
<L>Where e'ry Feature, e'ry Look combines:</L>
<L>When the adorning Air, o're all the whole,</L>
<L>To so much Wit, and so nice Vertue joyns.</L>
<L>Where the <HI>Belle Taille</HI> and Motion still afford</L>
<L>Graces to be eternally ador'd.</L>
</LG>
<P>But I will be silent now, and let your Glass
speak.</P>

<HEAD>THE
Lady's Looking-Glass.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DAmon,</HI> (O charming <HI>Iris!</HI>) has given
me to you, that you may sometimes
give your self the Trouble, and me
the Honour of Consulting me in the great and
weighty Affairs of Beauty. I am, my adora∣ble
Mistress! a faithful Glass; and you ought
to believe all I say to you.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Shape of IRIS.</HEAD>
<P>I Must begin with your Shape, and tell you,
without Flattery, 'tis the finest in the
World, and gives Love and Admiration to all
that see you. Pray observe how free and easie
it is, without Constraint, Stiffness, or Affecta∣tion;
those mistaken Graces of the Fantastick,
and the Formal; who give themselves Pain to
shew their Will to please; and whose Dressing
makes the greatest part of its Fineness, when
they are more oblig'd to the Taylor, than to
Nature; who add, or diminish, as occasion
serves, to form a Grace, where Heaven ne∣ver
gave it: And while they remain on this
<PB N="5" REF="215"/>
Wreck of Pride, they are eternally uneasie,
without pleasing any Body. <HI>Iris,</HI> I have seen
a Woman of your Acquaintance, who, having
a greater Opinion of her own Person, than any
Body else, has screw'd her Body into so fine a
Form (as she calls it) that she dares no more
stir a Hand, lift up an Arm, or turn her Head
aside, than if, for the Sin of such a Disorder,
she were to be turn'd into a Pillar of Salt; the
less stiff and fix'd Statue of the two. Nay, she
dares not speak or smile, lest she shou'd put her
Face out of that order she had set it in her
Glass, when she last look'd on herself: And is
all over such a Lady Nice (excepting in her
Conversation) that ever made a ridiculous Fi∣gure.
And there are many Ladies more, but
too much tainted with that nauseous Formality,
that old-fashion'd Vice: But <HI>Iris,</HI> the charming,
the all-perfect <HI>Iris,</HI> has nothing in her whole
Form, that is not free, natural, and easie; and
whose every Motion cannot please extreamly▪
and which has not given <HI>Damon</HI> a thousand Ri∣vals.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Damon.</HI> the Young, the Am'rous, and the True;</L>
<L>Who sighs incessantly for you:</L>
<L>Whose whole Delight, now you are gone,</L>
<L>Is to retire to Shades alone,</L>
<L>And to the Eccho's make his Moan.</L>
<L>By purling Streams the wishing Youth is laid,</L>
<L>Still sighing <HI>Iris!</HI> lovely charming Maid!</L>
<L>See, in thy Absence, how thy Lover dies;</L>
<L>While to his Sighs, the Eccho still replies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="216"/>
<L>Then with the Stream he holds Discourse:</L>
<L>O thou that bend'st thy liquid force</L>
<L>To lovely <HI>Tames!</HI> upon whose Shore</L>
<L>The Maid resides, whom I adore!</L>
<L>My Tears of Love upon thy Surface bear:</L>
<L>And if upon thy Banks thou seest my Fair,</L>
<L>In all thy softest Murmurs sing,</L>
<L>From <HI>Damon</HI> I this Present bring;</L>
<L>My e'ery Curl contains a Tear!</L>
<L>Then at her Feet thy Tribute pay:</L>
<L>But haste, O happy Stream! away;</L>
<L>Lest charm'd too much, thou shoud'st for ever stay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And thou, O gentle, murm'ring Breeze!</L>
<L>That plays in Air, and wantons with the Trees;</L>
<L>On thy young Wings, where gilded Sun-beams play,</L>
<L>To <HI>Iris</HI> my soft Sighs convey,</L>
<L>Still as they rise, each Minute of the Day:</L>
<L>But whisper gently in her Ear;</L>
<L>Let not the ruder Winds thy Message hear,</L>
<L>Nor ruffle one dear Curl of her bright Hair.</L>
<L>Oh! touch her Cheeks with sacred Reverence,</L>
<L>And stay not gazing on her lovely Eye!</L>
<L>But if thou bear'st her Rosie Breath from thence,</L>
<L>'Tis Incense of that Excellence,</L>
<L>That as thou mount'st, 'twill perfume all the Skies.</L>

<HEAD>IRIS'S Complexion.</HEAD>
<P>SAY what you will, I am confident, if you
will confess your Heart, you are, every time
you view yourself in me, surpriz'd at the Beau∣ty
of your Complexion; and will secretly own,
you never saw any thing so fair. I am not the
first Glass, by a thousand, that has assur'd you
of this. If you will not believe me, ask <HI>Da∣mon;</HI>
he tells it you every Day, but that Truth
from him offends you; and because he loves too
much, you think his Judgment too little; and
since this is so perfect, that must be defective.
But 'tis most certain, your Complexion is infi∣nitely
fine, your Skin soft and smooth, as polisht
Wax, or Ivory, extreamly white and clear;
though if any Body speaks but of your Beauty,
an agreeable Blush casts itself all over your Face,
and gives you a thousand new Graces.</P>
<Q><L>And then two Flowers, newly born,</L>
<L>Shine in your Heav'nly Face:</L>
<L>The Rose, that blushes in the Morn,</L>
<L>Ʋsurps the Lilly's place:</L>
<L>Sometimes the Lilly does prevail,</L>
<L>And makes the gen'rous Crimson pale.</L></Q>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>IRIS'S Hair.</HEAD>
<P>OH, the beautiful Hair of <HI>Iris!</HI> It seems, as
if Nature had crown'd you with a great
<PB N="8" REF="217"/>
Quantity of lovely fair brown Hair, to make
us know, that you were born to Rule; and to
repair the Faults of Fortune, that has not given
you a Diadem: And do not bewail the Want of
that (so much your Merit's due) since Heaven
has so gloriously recompens'd you with what
gains more admiring Slaves.</P>
<Q><L>Heav'n for Sovereignty, has made your form:</L>
<L>And you were more than for dull Empire born.</L>
<L>O'er Hearts your Kingdom shall extend,</L>
<L>Your vast Dominion know no end.</L>
<L>Thither the <HI>Loves</HI> and <HI>Graces</HI> shall resort;</L>
<L>To <HI>Iris</HI> make their Homage, and their Court.</L>
<L>No envious Star, no common Fate,</L>
<L>Did on my <HI>Iris</HI> Birth-day wait;</L>
<L>But all was happy, all was delicate.</L>
<L>Here Fortune wou'd inconstant be in vain:</L>
<L><HI>Iris,</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> eternally shall reign.</L></Q>
<P>Love does not make less use of your Hair for
new Conquests, than of all the rest of your Beau∣ties
that adorn you. If he takes our Hearts
with your fine Eyes, it ties 'em fast with your
Hair; and if it weaves a Chain, not easily bro∣ken.
It is not of those sorts of Hair, whose
harshness discovers ill Nature; nor of those,
whose Softness shews us the Weakness of the
Mind: Not that either of these are Arguments
without Exception; but 'tis such as bears the
Character of a perfect Mind, and a delicate
Wit; and for its Colour, the most faithful, di∣screet,
and beautiful in the World; such as
shews a Complexion and Constitution, neither
<PB N="9" REF="217"/>
so cold, to be insensible; nor so hot, to have
too much Fire; that is, neither too white, nor
too black; but such a mixture of the two Co∣lours,
as makes it the most agreeable in the
World.</P>
<Q><L>'Tis that which leads those captivated Hearts,</L>
<L>That bleeding at your Feet do lie.</L>
<L>'Tis that the Obstinate converts,</L>
<L>That dare the Power of Love deny.</L>
<L>'Tis that which <HI>Damon</HI> so admires;</L>
<L><HI>Damon,</HI> who often tells you so.</L>
<L>If from your Eyes Love takes his Fires,</L>
<L>'Tis with your Hair he strings his Bow:</L>
<L>Which touching but the feather'd Dart,</L>
<L>It never mist the destin'd Heart.</L></Q>

<HEAD>IRIS'S Eyes.</HEAD>
<P>I Believe, my fair Mistress, I shall dazle you
with the Lustre of your own Eyes. They
are the finest Blue in the World: They have all
the Sweetness, that ever charm'd the Heart;
with a certain Languishment that's irresistable;
and never any look'd on 'em, that did not sigh
after 'em. Believe me, <HI>Iris,</HI> they carry una∣voidable
Darts and Fires; and whoever expose
themselves to their Dangers, pay for their Im∣prudence.</P>
<LG>
<L>Cold as my solid Chrystal is,</L>
<L>Hard and impenetrable too;</L>
<L>Yet I am sensible of Bliss,</L>
<L>When your charming Eyes I view:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="218"/>
Even by me, their Flames are felt;</L>
<L>And at each Glance, I fear to melt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah, how pleasant are my Days!</L>
<L>How my glorious Fate I bless!</L>
<L>Mortals never knew my Joys,</L>
<L>Nor Monarchs guest my Happiness.</L>
<L>Every Look that's soft and gay,</L>
<L><HI>Iris</HI> gives me every Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Spight of her Vertue, and her Pride,</L>
<L>Every Morning I am blest</L>
<L>With what to <HI>Damon</HI> is deny'd;</L>
<L>To view her when she is undrest.</L>
<L>All her Heaven of Beauty's shown</L>
<L>To triumphing Me—alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce the prying Beams of Light,</L>
<L>Or th' impatient God of Day,</L>
<L>Are allow'd so dear a Sight,</L>
<L>Or dare prophane her with a Ray;</L>
<L>When she has appear'd to me,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Venus</HI> rising from the Sea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Oh! I must those Charms conceal,</L>
<L>All too Divine for vulgar Eyes:</L>
<L>Shou'd I my secret Joys reveal,</L>
<L>Of sacred Trust I break the Tyes;</L>
<L>And <HI>Damon</HI> wou'd with Envy die,</L>
<L>Who hopes, one Day, to be as blest as I.</L>
</LG>
<P>Extravagant with my Joys, I have stray'd be∣yond
my Limits; for I was telling you of the
wondrous Fineness of your Eyes; which no
<PB N="11" REF="218"/>
Mortal can resist, nor any Heart stand the force
of their Charms; and the most difficult Con∣quests
they gain, scarce cost 'em the Expence of
a Look. They are modest and tender, chaste
and languishing. There you may take a View
of the whole Soul, and see Wit and Good Na∣ture
(those two inseparable Vertues of the
Mind) in an extraordinary Measure. In fine,
you see all that fair Eyes can produce, to make
themselves ador'd. And when they are angry,
they strike an unresistable Awe upon the Soul:
And those Severities, <HI>Damon</HI> wishes, may per∣petually
accompany them, during their Absence
from him; for 'tis with such Eyes, he wou'd
have you receive all his Rivals.</P>
<LG>
<L>Keep, lovely Maid, the Softness in your Eyes,</L>
<L>To flatter <HI>Damon</HI> with another Day:</L>
<L>When at your Feet the ravish'd Lover lies,</L>
<L>Then put on all that's tender, all that's gay:</L>
<L>And for the Griefs your Absence makes him prove,</L>
<L>Give him the softest, dearest Looks of Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His trembling Heart with sweetest Smiles caress,</L>
<L>And in your Eyes, soft Wishes let him find;</L>
<L>That your Regret of Absence may confess,</L>
<L>In which, no Sense of Pleasure you cou'd find:</L>
<L>And to restore him, let your faithful Eyes</L>
<L>Declare, that all his Rivals you despise.</L>

<P>I Perceive your Modesty wou'd impose Si∣lence

to present yourself before a Glass, if you wou'd
not have it tell you all your Beauties: Content
yourself, that I only speak of 'em, <HI>En Passant;</HI>
for shou'd I speak what I wou'd, I shou'd dwell
all Day upon each particular, and still say some∣thing
new. Give me Liberty then to speak of
your fine Mouth: You need only open it a little,
and you will see the most delicate Teeth, that
ever you beheld; the whitest, and the best set.
Your Lips are the finest in the World; so round,
so soft, so plump, so dimpled, and of the love∣liest
Colour. And when you smile, Oh! What
Imagination can conceive how sweet it is, that
has not seen you Smiling? I cannot describe
what I so admire; and 'tis in vain to those, who

Oh! how often have you made your Lovers en∣vy

of your too nice Severity. Pray do not
hide it so carefully. See how perfectly turn'd it
is; with small blue Veins, wandring and ran∣ging
here and there, like little Rivulets, that

<P>I Shall not be put to much trouble to shew you
your Hands and Arms, because you may view
them without my help; and you are very un∣just,
if you have not admir'd 'em a Thousand
times. The beautiful Colour and Proportion
of your Arm is unimitable, and your Hand is
dazling, fine, small, and plump; long-pointed
Fingers, delicately turn'd; dimpl'd on the
Snowy out-side, but adorn'd within with Rose,
all over the soft Palm. O <HI>Iris!</HI> Nothing equals
your fair Hand; that Hand, of which Love so
often makes such use to draw his Bow, when he
wou'd send the Arrow home with more success;
and which irresistibly wounds those, who possi∣bly,
have not yet seen your Eyes: And when
you have been veil'd, that lovely Hand has gain'd
you a thousand Adorers. And I have heard <HI>Da∣mon</HI>
say, <HI>Without the Aid of more Beauties, that a∣lone
had been sufficient to have made an absolute Con∣quest
o'er his Soul.</HI> And he has often vow'd, <HI>It
never touch'd him, but it made his Blood run with
little irregular Motions in his Veins; his Breath
beat short and double; his Blushes rise, and his ve∣ry

<HEAD>The Grace and Air of IRIS.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS I alone, O charming Maid! that can
shew you that noble part of your Beauty:
That generous Air, that adorns all your lovely
Person, and renders every Motion and Action
perfectly adorable. With what a Grace you
walk!—How free, how easie, and how unaf∣fected!
See how you move;—for only here
you can see it. <HI>Damon</HI> has told you a thousand
times, that never any Mortal had so glorious an
Air; but he cou'd not half describe it, nor wou'd
you credit even what he said; but with a care∣less
Smile, pass it off for the Flattery of a Lover.
But here behold, and be convinc'd; and know,
no part of your Beauty can charm more than
this. O <HI>Iris,</HI> confess, Love has adorn'd you
with all his Art and Care. Your Beauties are
the Themes of all the Muses; who tell you in
daily Songs, that the Graces themselves have
<PB N="16" REF="221"/>
not more than <HI>Iris.</HI> And one may truly say,
that you alone know how to joyn the Orna∣ments
and Dress, with Beauty; and you are
still adorn'd, as if that Shape and Air had a pe∣culiar
Art to make all things appear gay and
fine. Oh, how well drest you are! How every
thing becomes you! Never singular, never
gawdy; but always suiting with your Quality.</P>
<LG>
<L>Oh, how that Negligence becomes your Air!</L>
<L>That careless flowing of your Hair,</L>
<L>That plays about with wanton Grace,</L>
<L>With every Motion of your Face:</L>
<L>Disdaining all that dull Formality,</L>
<L>That dares not move the Lip, or Eye;</L>
<L>But at some fancy'd Grace's cost;</L>
<L>And think, with it, at least, a Lover lost.</L>
<L>But the unlucky Minute to reclaim,</L>
<L>And ease the Coquet of her Pain,</L>
<L>The Pocket-Glass adjusts the Face again:</L>
<L>Re-sets the Mouth, and languishes the Eyes;</L>
<L>And thinks, the Spark that ogles that way—dies.</L>

<L>Of <HI>Iris</HI> learn, O ye mistaken Fair!</L>

<HEAD>The Discretion of IRIS.</HEAD>
<P>BUT O <HI>Iris!</HI> The Beauties of the Body
are imperfect, if the Beauties of the Soul
do not advance themselves to an equal height.
But, O <HI>Iris!</HI> What Mortal is there so damned
to Malice, that does not, with Adoration, con∣fess,
that you (O charming Maid!) have an
equal Portion of all the Braveries and Vertues
of the Mind? And, who is it, that confesses
your Beauty, that does not, at the same time
acknowledge and bow to your Wisdom? The
whole World admires both in you; and all,
with impatience, ask, Which of the two is
most surprising, your Beauty, or your Discre∣tion?
But we dispute in vain on that excel∣lent
Subject; for after all, 'tis determin'd, that
the two Charms are equal. 'Tis none of those
idle Discretions that consists in Words alone,
and ever takes the Shadow of Reason for the
Substance; and that makes use of all the little
Artifices of Subtilty, and florid Talking, to
make the outside of the Argument appear fine,
and leave the inside wholly mis-understood:
Who runs away with Words, and never thinks
of Sence. But you, O lovely Maid! never
make use of these affected Arts; but without
being too brisk, or too severe; too silent, or
too talkative; you aspire in all your Hearers,
a Joy, and a Respect. Your Soul is an Enemy
to that usual Vice of your Sex, of using little
Arguments against the Fair; or by a Word,
<PB N="18" REF="222"/>
or Jest, make your self and Hearers pleasant,
at the Expence of the Fame of others.</P>
<P>Your Heart is an Enemy to all Passions, but
that of Love. And this is one of your noble
Maxims: <HI>That every one ought to love, in some
part of his Life: And that, in a Heart truly brave,
Love is without Folly: That Wisdom is a Friend to
Love, and Love to perfect Wisdom.</HI> Since these
Maxims are your own, do not, O charming
<HI>Iris!</HI> resist that noble Passion: And since <HI>Da∣mon</HI>
is the most tender of all your Lovers, an∣swer
his Passion with a noble Ardour: Your

<HEAD>The Goodness and Complaisance of Iris.</HEAD>
<P>WHO but your Lovers (fair <HI>Iris!</HI>)
doubts, but you are the most complai∣sant
Person in the World: And that with so
much Sweetness you oblige all, that you com∣mand
<PB N="19" REF="222"/>
in yielding; and as you gain the Heart
of both Sexes, with the Affability of your
noble Temper; so all are proud and vain of
obliging you. And <HI>Iris,</HI> you may live assur'd,
that your Empire is eternally establish'd, by
your Beauty, and your Goodness: Your Power
is confirm'd, and you grow in Strength every
Minute: Your Goodness gets you Friends, and
your Beauty Lovers.</P>
<P>This Goodness is not one of those, whose
Folly renders it easie to every Desirer; but a
pure Effect of the Generosity of your Soul;
such as Prudence alone manages, according to
the Merit of the Person, to whom it is exten∣ded;
and those whom you esteem, receive the
sweet Marks of it; and only your Lovers com∣plain:
Yet even then you charm. And though
sometimes you can be a little disturb'd, yet
through your Anger, your Goodness shines;
and you are but too much afraid, that that may
bear a false Interpretation: For oftentimes
Scandal makes that pass for an Effect of Love,
which is purely that of Complaisance.</P>
<P>Never had any Body more Tenderness for
their Friends, than <HI>Iris:</HI> Their Presence gives
her Joy; their Absence, Trouble; and when
she cannot see them, she finds no Pleasure,
like speaking of them obligingly. Friendship
reigns in your Heart, and Sincerity on your
Tongue. Your Friendship is so strong, so
constant, and so tender, that it charms,
pleases, and satisfies all, that are not your A∣dorers.
'Tis therefore, <HI>Damon</HI> is excusable,
if he be not contented with your noble Friend∣ship
<PB N="20" REF="223"/>
alone; for he is the most tender of that
Number.</P>
<LG>
<L>No! Give me all, th' impatient Lover cries;</L>
<L>Without your Soul, I cannot live:</L>
<L>Dull Friendship cannot mine suffice,</L>
<L>That dies for all you have to give.</L>
<L>The Smiles, the Vows, the Heart must all be mine:</L>
<L>I cannot spare one Thought, or Wish of thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I sigh, I languish all the Day;</L>
<L>Each Minute ushers in my Groans:</L>
<L>To e'ry God in vain I pray;</L>
<L>In e'ry Grove repeat my Moans.</L>
<L>Still <HI>Iris</HI> Charms are all my Sorrows Themes!</L>
<L>They pain me Waking, and they wreck in Dreams.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Return, fair <HI>Iris!</HI> Oh, return!</L>
<L>Lest sighing long, your Slave destroys.</L>
<L>I wish, I rave, I faint, I burn;</L>
<L>Restore me quickly all my Joys:</L>
<L>Your Mercy else, will come too late.</L>

<HEAD>The Wit of Iris.</HEAD>
<P>YOU are deceiv'd in me, fair <HI>Iris,</HI> if you
take me for one of those ordinary Glasses,
that represent the Beauty only of the Body; I
remark to you also the Beauties of the Soul:
And all about you declares yours the finest that
ever was formed; that you have a Wit that
surprizes, and is always new: 'Tis none of
those that loses its Lustre, when one considers
<PB N="21" REF="223"/>
it; the more we examine yours, the more ado∣rable
we find it. You say nothing, that is not
at once agreeable and solid; 'tis always quick
and ready, without Impertinence, that little
Vanity of the Fair; who, when they know
they have Wit, rarely manage it so, as not to
abound in Talking; and think, that all they
say must please, because luckily, they some∣times
chance to do so. But <HI>Iris</HI> never speaks,
but 'tis of use; and gives a Pleasure to all that
hears her. She has the perfect Art of pene∣trating,
even the most secret Thoughts. How
often have you known, without being told, all
that has past in <HI>Damon</HI>'s Heart? For all great
Wits are Prophets too:</P>
<LG>
<L>Tell me; Oh, tell me! Charming Prophetess;</L>
<L>For you alone can tell my Love's Success.</L>
<L>The Lines in my dejected Face,</L>

<L>I tell you, that I love a Maid,</L>
<L>As bright as Heav'n, of Angel-hue:</L>
<L>The softest, Nature ever made:</L>
<L>Whom I, with Sighs and Vows, pursue.</L>

<L>A thousand Rivals do obstruct my Way;</L>

<L>To give my Rivals Hope, as well as Love?</L>

<LG>
<L>She has a thousand Charms of Wit,</L>
<L>With all the Beauty Heav'n e're gave:</L>

<HEAD>The Modesty of Iris.</HEAD>
<P>I Perceive, fair <HI>Iris,</HI> you have a Mind to tell
me, I have entertain'd you too long, with a
Discourse on yourself. I know, your Modesty
makes this Declaration an offence, and you
suffer me, with Pain, to unveil those Treasures
you wou'd hide. Your Modesty, that so com∣mendable
a Vertue in the Fair, and so peculiar
to you, is here a little too severe: Did I flatter
you, you shou'd blush: Did I seek, by praising
you, to shew an Art of Speaking finely, you
might chide. But, O <HI>Iris!</HI> I say nothing, but
such plain Truths, as all the World can witness
are so. And so far I am from Flattery, that I
seek no Ornament of Words. Why do you take
such Care to conceal your Vertues? They have
too much Lustre, not to be seen, in spight of all
your Modesty: Your Wit, your Youth, and
<PB N="23" REF="224"/>
Reason oppose themselves, against this dull Ob∣structer
of our Happiness. Abate, O <HI>Iris,</HI> a
little of this Vertue, since you have so many
other, to defend yourself against the Attacks
of your Adorers.</P>
<P>You yourself have the least Opinion of your
own Charms: And being the only Person in the
World, that is not in love with 'em, you hate
to pass whole Hours before your <HI>Looking-Glass;</HI>
and to pass your time, like most of the idle
Fair, in dressing, and setting off those Beau∣ties,
which need so little Art. You, more wise,
disdain to give those Hours to the Fatigue of
Dressing, which you know so well how to em∣ploy
a thousand Ways. The Muses have blest
you, above your Sex; and you know how to
gain a Conquest with your Pen, more absolute∣ly,
than all the industrious Fair, who trust to
Dress and Equipage.</P>
<P>I have a thousand things to tell you more, but
willingly resign my place to <HI>Damon,</HI> that faith∣ful
Lover; he will speak more ardently than I:
For, let a Glass use all its Force, yet, when it
speaks its best, it speaks but coldly.</P>
<P>If my Glass, O charming <HI>Iris!</HI> have the good
Fortune (which I cou'd never entirely boast)
to be believ'd, 'twill serve, at least, to convince
you, I have not been so guilty of Flattery, as I
have a thousand times been charg'd. Since then
my Passion is equal to your Beauty (without
Comparison, or End) believe, O lovely Maid!
how I sigh in your Absence: And be perswaded
to lessen my pain, and restore me to my Joys;

<HEAD>THE
Lucky Mistake.
A NEW
NOVEL.</HEAD>
<P>THe River <HI>Loyre</HI> has on its delightful Banks
abundance of handsome, beautiful and rich
Towns and Villages, to which the noble
Stream adds no small Graces and Advan∣tages,
blessing their Fields with Plenty, and their
Eyes with a thousand Diversions: In one of these hap∣pily
situated Towns, called <HI>Orleance,</HI> where abundance
of People of the best Quality and Condition reside,
there was a rich Nobleman, now retird from the bu∣sie
Court, where, in his Youth he had been bred, wea∣ried
with the Toyls of Ceremony and Noise, to en∣joy
that perfect Tranquility of Life, which is no where
to be found, but in Retreat, a faithful Friend, and a
good Library; and, as the Admirable <HI>Horace</HI> says, in
a little House and large Gardens, Count <HI>Bellyaurd,</HI>
for so was this Nobleman call'd, was of this Opinion:
and the rather, because he had one only Son, call'd
<HI>Rinaldo,</HI> now grown to the Age of Fifteen, who ha∣ving
all the excellent Qualities and Graces of Youth,
by Nature, he would bring him up in all Vertues and
noble Sciences, which he believ'd the Gaiety and Lu∣stre
of the Court might divert: He therefore in his
Retirement spar'd no Cost, to those that could in∣struct
and accomplish him; and he had the best Tu∣tors
<PB N="2" REF="227"/>
and Masters that could be purchased at Court;
<HI>Bellyaurd</HI> making far less account of Riches than of
fine Parts. He found his Son capable of all Impres∣sions,
having a Wit suitable to his delicate Person, so
that he was the sole Joy of his Life, and the Darling
of his Eyes.</P>
<P>In the very next House, which joyn'd close to that
of <HI>Bellyaurd</HI>'s, there liv'd another Count, who had in
his Youth been banish'd the Court of <HI>France</HI> for some
Misunderstandings, in some high Affairs wherein he
was concern'd; his name was <HI>De Pais,</HI> a Man of great
Birth, but no Fortune; or at least one not suitable to
the Grandeur of his Original: And as it is most na∣tural
for great Souls to be most proud (if I may call
a handsome Disdain by that vulgar Name,) when they
are most depress'd; so <HI>De Pais</HI> was more retir'd, more
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>strang'd from his Neighbours, and kept a greater Di∣stance,
than if he had enjoy'd all he had lost at Court,
and took more Solemnity and State upon him, because
he would not be subject to the Reproaches of the
World, by making himself familiar with it. So that
he rarely visited, and was as rarely visited; and, con∣trary
to the Custom of those in <HI>France,</HI> who are easie
of Excess, and free of Conversation, he kept his Fa∣mily
retir'd so close, that 'twas rare to see any of 'em;
but when they went abroad, which was but seldom,
they wanted nothing as to outward appearance, that
was fit for his Quality, and was much above his Con∣dition.</P>
<P>This old Count had two only Daughters, of ex∣ceeding
Beauty, who gave the generous Father Ten
thousand Torments, as often as he beheld them, when
he consider'd their extream Beauty, their fine W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,
their Innocence, Modesty, and above all, their Birth;
and that he had not the Fortune to marry them ac∣cording
to their Quality▪ and below it, he had rather
see them laid in their silent Graves, than consent to;
for he scorn'd the World should see him forced by his
Poverty, to commit an Action below his Dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="227"/>
There lived in a Neighbouring Town, a certain
Nobleman, Friend to <HI>De Pais,</HI> call'd Count <HI>Vernole,</HI> a
Man of about Forty Years of Age, of low Stature,
Complexion very black and swarthy, lean, lame, ex∣tream
proud and haughty; extracted of a Descent
from the Blood-Royal; not extreamly brave, but ve∣ry
glorious: He had no very great Estate, but was in
Election of a greater, and of an Addition of Honour
from the King, his Father having done most worthy
Services against the <HI>Hugonots,</HI> and by the high Favour
of Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> was represented to his Majesty,
as a Man related to the Crown, of great Name, but
small Estate; so that there was now nothing but great
Expectations and Preparations in the Family of Count
<HI>Vernole</HI> to go to Court, to which he daily hop'd an
Invitation or Command.</P>
<P><HI>Vernole</HI>'s Fortune being hitherto something a kin to
that of <HI>De Pais,</HI> there was a greater Correspondency
between these two Gentlemen, than they had with
any other Persons; they accounting themselves above
the rest of the World, believ'd none so proper and fit
for their Conversation, as that of each other; so that
there was a very particular Intimacy between them:
Whenever they went abroad, they clubb'd their Train,
to make one great Show, and were always together,
bemoaning each other's Fortune, that from so high a
Descent, as one from Monarchs by the Mother's side,
and the other from Dukes of his side, they were re∣duc'd
by Fate, to the degree of private Gentlemen.
They would often consult how to manage Affairs most
to advantage, and often <HI>De Pais</HI> would ask Counsel of
<HI>Vernole,</HI> how best he should dispose of his Daughters,
which now were about their ninth Year the eldest,
and eight the youngest. <HI>Vernole</HI> had often seen these
two Buds of Beauty, and already saw opening in <HI>At∣lante</HI>'s
Face and Mind (for that was the Name of the
eldest, and <HI>Charlot</HI> the youngest) a Glory of Wit and
Beauty, which could not but one day display itself,
with dazling Lustre, to the wondring World.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="228"/>
<HI>Vernole</HI> was a great Virtuoso, of a Humour, Nice,
Delicate, Critical and Opinionative: He had nothing of
the <HI>French</HI> Mien in him, but all the Gravity of the
Don. His ill-favour'd Person, and his low Estate, put
him out of Humour with the World; and because
that should not upbraid or reproach his Follies and
Defects, he was sure to be before-hand with that, and
to be always Satyrick upon it, and lov'd to live and
act contrary to the Custom and Usage of all Man∣kind
besides.</P>
<P>He was infinitely delighted to find a Man of his own
Humour in <HI>De Pais,</HI> or at least a Man that would be
perswaded to like his so well, to live up to it; and it
was no little Joy and Satisfaction to him to find, that
he kept his Daughters in that severity, which was
wholly agreeable to him, and so contrary to the Man∣ner
and Fashion of the <HI>French</HI> of Quality; who allow
all Freedoms, which to <HI>Vernole</HI>'s rigid Nature, seem'd
as so many Steps to Vice, and in his Opinion, the
Ruiner of all Vertue and Honour in Woman-kind.
<HI>De Pais</HI> was extreamly glad his Conduct was so well
interpreted, which was no other in him, than a proud
Frugality; who, because they could not appear, inso
much Gallantry, as their Quality requir'd, kept 'em
retir'd, and unseen to all, but his particular Friends,
of which <HI>Vernole</HI> was chief.</P>
<P><HI>Vernole</HI> never appear'd before <HI>Atlante</HI> (which was
seldom,) but he assum'd a Gravity and Respect, fit to
have entertain'd a Maid of Twenty, or rather a Ma∣tron,
of much greater Years and Judgment. His Dis∣courses
were always of Matters of State or Philosophy;
and sometimes when <HI>De Pais</HI> would Laughing, say, <HI>He
might as well entertain</HI> Atlante <HI>with</HI> Greek <HI>and</HI> Hebrew,
would reply gravely; <HI>You are mistaken Sir, I find the
Seeds of great and profound Matter in the Soul of the
young Maid, which ought to be nourish'd, now while she
was young, and they will grow up to very great Perfecti∣on;
I find</HI> Atlante <HI>capable of all the Noble Vertues of the
Mind, and am infinitely mistaken in my Observations,
and Art of Phisiognomy, if</HI> Atlante <HI>be not born for greater
<PB N="5" REF="228"/>
Things than her Fortune does now promise: She will be ve∣ry
Considerable in the World, believe me, and this will
arrive to her perfectly from the Force of her Charms. De
Pais</HI> was extreamly overjoy'd to hear such Good pro∣phesied
to <HI>Atlante,</HI> and from that time, set a sort of
an Esteem upon her, which he did not on <HI>Charlot</HI> his
younger; who, by the Perswasions of <HI>Vernole,</HI> he re∣solv'd
to put in a Monastery, that what he had might
descend to <HI>Atlante;</HI> not but he confess'd <HI>Charlot</HI> had
Beauty, extreamly attractive, and a Wit that promi∣sed
much, when it should be cultivated by Years and
Experience; and would shew itself with great Advan∣tage,
and Lustre in a Monastery: All this pleased <HI>De
Pais</HI> very well, who was easily perswaded, since he
had not a Fortune to marry her well in the World.</P>
<P>As yet <HI>Vernole</HI> had never spoke to <HI>Atlante</HI> of Love;
nor did his Gravity think it Prudence to discover his
Heart to so young a Maid, he waited her more sensi∣ble
Years, when he could hoope to have some return.
And all he expected from this her tender Age, was by
his daily Converse with her, and the Presents, he made
her suitable to her Years, to ingratiate himself insen∣sibly
into her Friendship and Esteem: Since she was
not yet capable of Love, but even in that he mistook
his Aim, for every day he grew more and more dis∣agreeable
to <HI>Atlante,</HI> and would have been her abso∣lute
Aversion, had she known, she had every day en∣tertained
a Lover; but as she grew in Years and Sense,
he seemed the more despicable in her Eyes as to his
Person; but as she had respect to his Parts, and Qua∣lities,
she paid him all the Complaisance she could,
and which was due to him; and so must be confess'd,
tho' he had a stiff Formality in all he said and did,
yet he had Wit and Learning, and was a great Phi∣losopher;
as much of his Learning, as <HI>Atlante</HI> was
capable of attaining to, he made her Mistress of, and
that was no small Portion, for all his Discourse was
fine and easily comprehended, his Notions of Philoso∣phy
fit for Ladies; and he took greater Pains with
<HI>Atlante,</HI> than any Master would have done with a
<PB N="6" REF="229"/>
Scholar; so that it was most certain, he added▪ very
great Accomplishment to her Natural Wit, and the
more because she took a very great Delight in Philo∣sophy;
which very often made her impatient of his
coming; especially when she had many Questions to
ask him concerning it, and she wou'd often receive
him with a Pleasure in her Face; which he did not
fail to interpret to his own Advantage, being very apt
to flatter himself. Her Sister <HI>Charlot</HI> would often ask
her, <HI>How she could give whole Afternoons to so disagree∣able
a Man: What is it,</HI> said she, <HI>that charms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
his tawny Leather Face, his extraordinary high Nose, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
wide Mouth and Eye-brows, that hang lowring over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Eyes, his lean Carcase, and his lame and haulting Hips?</HI>
But <HI>Atlante</HI> wou'd discreetly reply, <HI>If I must grant al
you say of Count</HI> Vernole <HI>to be true, yet he has a Wit and
Learning, that will attone sufficiently for all those Faults
you mention: A fine Soul is infinitely to be preferr'd to a
fine Body; this decays, but that's eternal; and Age that
ruins one, refines the other.</HI> Though possibly <HI>Atlante</HI>
thought as ill of the Count, as her Sister; yet in Re∣spect
to him, she would not own it.</P>
<P><HI>Atlante</HI> was now arriv'd to her thirteenth Year,
when her Beauty, which every day increas'd, became
the Discourse of the whole Town; which had already
gain'd her as many Lovers as had beheld her, for none
saw her without languishing for her, or at least, but
what were in very great Admiration of her. Every
body talk'd of the young <HI>Atlante,</HI> and all the Noble∣men,
who had Sons (knowing the Smallness of her
Fortune, and the Lustre of her Beauty) would send
them for fear of their being Charm'd with her, either
to some other part of the World, or exhorted them,
by way of Precaution, to keep out of her sight. Old
<HI>Bellyuard</HI> was one of those wise Parents, and by a time∣ly
Prevention, as he thought of <HI>Rinaldo</HI>'s falling in
Love with <HI>Atlante,</HI> perhaps was the Occasion of his
being so; he had before heard of <HI>Atlante,</HI> and of her
Beauty, but it had made no Impressions on his Heart;
but his Father no sooner forbid him Loving, then he
<PB N="7" REF="229"/>
felt a new Desire tormenting him, of seeing this love∣ly
and dangerous young Person; he wonders at his
unaccountable Pain, which daily solicits him within,
to go where he may behold this Beauty; of whom he
frames a thousand Idea's, all such as were most agree∣able
to him; but then upbraids his Fancy, for not
forming her half so delicate as she was; and longs yet
more to see her, to know how near she approaches to
the Picture he has drawn of her in his Mind; and
tho' he knew she liv'd the next House to him, yet he
knew also she was kept within like a Vow'd <HI>Nun,</HI> or
with the Severity of a <HI>Spaniard:</HI> And tho' he had a
Chamber, which had a jetting Window, that look'd
just upon the Door of Monsieur <HI>De Pais,</HI> and that he
would watch many Hours at a time, in hope to see
them go out, yet he could never get a glimps of her;
yet he heard she often frequented the Church of our
<HI>Lady:</HI> Thither then young <HI>Rinaldo</HI> resolv'd to go, and
did so two or three Mornings, in which time, to his
unspeakable Grief, he saw no Beauty appear that
charm'd him; and yet he fancy'd that <HI>Atlante</HI> was
there, and that he had seen her, that some one of those
young Ladies, that he saw in the Church was she, tho'
he had no body to enquire of, and that she was not
so fair as the World reported; for which he would of∣ten
sigh, as if he had lost some very great Expecta∣tion;
however he ceased not to frequent this
Church, and one day saw a young Beauty, who at first
glimps made his Heart leap to his Mouth, and fell
trembling again into its wanted place, for it immedi∣ately
told him, that that young Maid was <HI>Atlante;</HI> she
was with her Sister <HI>Charlot,</HI> who was very handsome,
but not comparable to <HI>Atlante:</HI> He fix'd his Eyes up∣on
her, as she kneel'd at the Altar, he never remov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
from that charming Face as long as she remain'd there;
he forgot all Devotion, but what he paid to her, he
ador'd her, he burnt and languish'd already for her,
and found he must possess <HI>Atlante,</HI> or die: Often as
he gaz'd upon her, he saw her fair Eyes lifted up to∣wards
his, where they often met; which she percei∣ving,
<PB N="8" REF="230"/>
would cast hers down into her Bosom, or on her
Book, and blush as if she had done a Fault: <HI>Charlot</HI>
perceiv'd all the Motions of <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> how he folded
his Arms, how he sigh'd, and how he gaz'd on her
Sister; she took notice of his Cloaths, his Garniture,
and every particular of his Dress, as young Girls use
to do, and seeing him so very handsome, and so much
better dress'd than all the young Cavaliers that were
in the Church, she was very much pleas'd with him;
and could not forbear saying, in a low Voice, to <HI>At∣lante,
Look, look, my Sister, what a pretty Monsieur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣der
is, see how fine his Face is, how delicate his Hair, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
gallant his Dress; and do but look how he gazes on you:</HI>
This would make <HI>Atlante</HI> blush anew, who durst not
raise her Eyes for fear she should encounter his. While
he had the Pleasure to imagine they were talking of
him, and he saw in the pretty Face of <HI>Charlot,</HI> that
what he said, was not to his disadvantage, and by the
Blushes of <HI>Atlante,</HI> that she was not displeas'd with
what was spoken to her; he perceiv'd the young one
importunate with her, and <HI>Atlante</HI> jogging her with
her Elbow, as much as to say, Hold your peace; all
this, he made a very kind Interpretation of, and was
transported with Joy, at the good Omens. He was
willing to flatter his new Flame, and to Complement
his young Desire with a little Hope; but the Divine
Ceremony ceasing, <HI>Atlante</HI> left the Church, and it
being very fair Weather, she walk'd home, <HI>Rinaldo,</HI>
who saw her going, felt all the Agonies of a Lover,
who parts with all that can make him happy, and see∣ing
only <HI>Atlante</HI> attended with her Sister, and a Foot∣man,
following with their Books, he was a thousand times
about to speak to 'em, but he no sooner advanc'd a step
or two towards 'em, to that Purpose (for he followed
them) but his Heart fail'd, and a certain Awe and Reve∣rence,
or rather the Fears and Tremblings of a Lover,
prevented him; but when he consider'd, that possible
he might never have so favourable an Opportunity a∣gain,
he resolv'd a-new, and call'd up so much Cou∣rage
to his Heart, as to speak to <HI>Atlante;</HI> but before he
<PB N="9" REF="230"/>
did so, <HI>Charlot</HI> looking behind her, saw <HI>Rinaldo</HI> very
near to 'em, and cry'd out, with a Voice of Joy, Oh!
Sister, Sister, look where the handsome Monsieur is,
just behind us; sure he is Some-body of Quality, for
see he has two Foot-men that follow him, in just such
Liveries, and so rich as those of our Neighbour, Mon∣sieur
<HI>Bellyaurd.</HI> At this, <HI>Atlante</HI> could not forbear, but
before she was aware of it, turn'd her Head, and look'd
on <HI>Rinaldo;</HI> which encourag'd him to advance, and
putting off his Hat, which he clapt under his Arm,
with a low Bow, said, <HI>Ladies, you are slenderly attend∣ed,
and so many Accidents arrive to the Fair in the rude
Streets, that I humbly implore, you will permit me, whose
Duty it is, as a Neighbour, to wait on you to your Door.
Sir,</HI> said <HI>Atlante,</HI> blushing, <HI>we fear no Insolence, and need
no Protector; or if we did, we should not be so rude, to
take you out of your Way, to serve us. Madam,</HI> said he,
<HI>my Way lies yours, I live at the next Door, and am Son
to</HI> Bellyaurd, <HI>your Neighbour. But, Madam,</HI> added
he, <HI>if I were to go all my Life out of the Way, to do you
Service, I should take it for the greatest Happiness, that
could arrive to me; but, Madam, sure a Man can never
be out of his Way, who has the Honour of so charming
Company. Atlante</HI> made no Reply to this, but blush'd
and bow'd: But <HI>Charlot</HI> said, <HI>Nay, Sir, if you are our
Neighbour, we will give you leave to Conduct us home;
But pray, Sir, how came you to know we are your Neigh∣bours;
for we never saw you before, to our knowledge.
My pretty Mis,</HI> reply'd <HI>Rinaldo, I knew it from the tran∣scendent
Beauty appear'd in your Faces, and sine Shapes;
for I have heard, there was no Beauty in the World, like
that of</HI> Atlante<HI>'s; and I no sooner saw her, but my Heart
told me, it was she. Heart,</HI> said <HI>Charlot</HI> laughing, <HI>Way,
does Hearts use to speak? The most intelligibly of any
thing, Rinaldo</HI> reply'd, <HI>when 'tis tenderly touch'd, when
'tis charm'd and transported.</HI> At these Words he sigh'd,
and <HI>Atlante,</HI> to his extream Satisfaction, blushed.
<HI>Touch, charm'd, and transported, said</HI> Charlot, <HI>what's
that? And how do you do to have it be all these Things?
For I would give any thing in the World to have my Heart</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="231"/>
speak. Oh! <HI>said</HI> Rinaldo, your Heart is too young, it is
not yet arrived to the Years of speaking; about thirteen
or fourteen, it may possibly be saying a thousand soft
Things to you; but it must be first inspir'd by some No∣ble
Object, whose Idea it must retain. What, <HI>reply'd
this pretty Pratlet,</HI> I'll warrant I must be in love? Yes,
<HI>said</HI> Rinaldo, most passionately, or you will have but little
Conversation with your Heart. Oh! <HI>reply'd she,</HI> I am
afraid the Pleasure of such a Conversation, will not make
me Amends for the Pain that Love will give me. That,
<HI>said</HI> Rinaldo, is according as the Object is kind; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
you Hope, if he Love, and you Hope, you will have a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ble
Pleasure: And in this, how great an Advantage have
you, fair Ladies, above us Men? 'Tis almost impossible
for you to love in vain, you have your Choice of a thousand
Hearts, which you have subdu'd, and may not only chuse
your Slaves, but be assur'd of 'em; without speaking you
are belov'd, it needs not cost you a Sigh or a Tear: But
unhappy Man, is often destsn'd to give his Heart, where
it is not regarded, to sigh, to weep, and languish, with∣out
any hope of Pity. You speak so feelingly, Sir, <HI>said
Charlot,</HI> that I am afraid this is your Case? Yes, Ma∣dam,
<HI>reply'd</HI> Rinaldo, <HI>sighing,</HI> I am that unhappy Man,
Indeed, 'tis pity, <HI>said she,</HI> Pray how long have you been
so? Ever since I heard of the charming <HI>Atlante, reply'd
he, sighing again;</HI> I ador'd her Character, but now I
have seen her, I die for her. For me, Sir, <HI>said</HI> Atlante,
(who had not yet spoke) this is the common Complement
of all the young Men, who pretend to be Lovers; and if
one should pity all those Sighers, we should have but very
little left for ourselves. I believe, <HI>saith</HI> Rinaldo, there
are none that tell you so, who do not mean as they say;
yet among all those Adorers, and those that say they will
die for you, you will find none will be so good as their Words
as <HI>Rinaldo.</HI> Perhaps, <HI>said</HI> Atlante, of all those who tell
me of dying, there are none that tell it with so little Rea∣son
as <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> if that be your Name, Sir. Madam, it
is, <HI>said he,</HI> and who am transported with an unspeakable
Joy, to hear those last Words from your fair Mouth; and
let me, O lovely <HI>Atlante,</HI> assure you, that what I have
<PB N="11" REF="231"/>
said, are not Words of Course, but proceed from a Heart
that has vow'd itself eternally yours, even before I had the
Happiness to behold this Divine Person; but now that
my Eyes have made good all my Heart before imagin'd,
and did but hope: I swear, I will die à thousand
Deaths, rather than violate what I have said to you; That
Indore you, that my Soul, and all my Faculties are charm'd
with your Beauty and Innocence, and that my Life and
Fortune, not inconsiderable, shall be laid at your Feet.
<HI>This he spoke with a Fervency of Passion, that left her
no doubt of what he had said; yet she blush'd for
shame, and a little angry at herself, for suffering him
to say so much to her, the very first time she saw him,
and accused herself for giving him any Encourage∣ment:
And in this Confusion she replied,</HI> Sir, you have
said too much to be believed; and I cannot imagine so
short an Acquaintance can make so considerable an Im∣pression;
of which Confession I accuse myself much more
than you, in that I did not only hearken to what you said,
without forbidding you to entertain me at that rate, but
for unheedily speaking something, that has encourag'd this
Boldness, for so must I call it, in a Man so great a
Stranger to me. Madam, <HI>said he,</HI> if I have offended by
the suddenness of my presumptuous Discovery, I beseech
you to consider my Reasons for it, the few Opportunities I
am like to have, and the impossibility of waiting on you,
both from the Severity of your Father and mine; who e'r I
saw you, warn'd me of my Fate, as if he foresaw I should
fall in Love, as soon as I should chance to see you; and
for that Reason has kept me closer to my Studies, than hi∣therto
I have been: And from that time I began to feel
a Flame, which was kindled by Report alone, and the De∣scription
my Father gave of your wondrous, and dangerous
Beauty: Therefore, Madam, I have not suddenly told
you of my Passion, I have been long your Lover, and have
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong languish'd without telling of my Pain, and you ought
to pardon it now, since it is done with all the Respect and
Religious Awe, that 'tis possible for a Heart to deliver
and unload itself in, therefore, Madam, if you have by
Chance uttered any thing, that I have taken advantage
<PB N="12" REF="232"/>
or hope from, I assure you, 'tis so small, that you have no
Reason to repent it; but rather, if you would have me
live, send me not from you, without a Confirmation of
that little hope, See, Madam, <HI>said he, more earnestly
and trembling,</HI> see we are almost arriv'd at our Homes,
send me not to mine in a Despair, that I cannot support
with Life; but tell me, I shall be bless'd with your Sight,
sometimes in your Balcony, which is very near to a jetting
Window in our House, from whence I have sent many a
longing Look towards yours, in hope to have seen my Soul's
Tormenter. I shall be very unwilling, <HI>said she,</HI> to enter
into an Intreigue of Love, or Friendship, with a Man▪
whose Parents will be averse to my Happiness, and possi∣bly
mine as refractory, tho' he cannot but know such an
Alliance would be very considerable, my Fortune being
not suitable to yours: I tell you this, that you may with∣draw
in time from an Engagement, in which I find there
will be a great many Obstacles. Oh! Madam, <HI>replied</HI>
Rinaldo, <HI>sighing,</HI> if my Person be not disagreeable to you,
you will have no occasion to fear the rest, 'tis that I dread,
and that which is all my fear. <HI>He, sighing, beheld her
with a languishing Look, that told her, he expected
her Answer; when she reply'd,</HI> Sir, if that will be Sa∣tisfaction
enough for you at this time, I do assure you, I
have no Aversion for your Person, in which I find more to
be valu'd, than in any I have yet seen; and if what you
say be real, and proceed from a Heart truly affected, I
find, in spight of me, you will oblige me to give you
hope.</P>
<P>They were come so near their own Houses, that he
had not time to return her any Answer, but with a low
Bow he acknowledg'd her Bounty, and express'd the
Joy her last Words had given him, by a Look that
made her understand, he was charm'd and pleas'd;
and she bowing to him with an Air of Satisfaction in
her Face, he was well assured, there was nothing to
be seen so lovely as she then appear'd, and left her to
go into her own House; but 'till she was out of sight,
he had not power to stir, and then sighing, retired to
his own Appartment, to think over all that had past
<PB N="13" REF="232"/>
between them. He found nothing but what gave him
a thousand Joys, in all she had said; and he blest this
happy Day, and wondred how his Stars came so kind,
to make him one hour at once see <HI>Atlante,</HI> and have the
Happiness to know from her own Mouth, that he was
not disagreeable to her: Yet with this Satisfaction, he
had a thousand Thoughts mix'd, which were torment∣ing,
and those were the Fear of their Parents; he fore∣saw
from what his Father had said to him already, that
it would be difficult to draw him to a Consent of his
Marriage with <HI>Atlante:</HI> These Joys and Fears were
his Companions all the Night, in which he took but
little rest. Nor was <HI>Atlante</HI> without her Inquietudes:
She <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound <HI>Rinaldo</HI> more in her Thoughts, than she wish'd,
and a sudden change of Humour, that made her know
something was the matter with her, more than usual;
she calls to mind <HI>Rinaldo</HI>'s speaking of the Conversa∣tion
with his Heart, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound hers would be tarling
to her, if she would give way to it; and yet the more
she strove to avoid it, the more it importun'd her, and
in spight of all her Resistance, would tell her, that <HI>Ri∣naldo</HI>
had a thousand Charms: It tells her, that he
loves and adores her, and that she would be the most
cruel of her Sex, should she not be sensible of his Pas∣sion.
She finds a thousand Graces in his Person and
Conversation, and as many Advantages in his Fortune,
which was one of the most considerable in all those
Parts; for his Estate exceeded that of the most Noble
Men in <HI>Orleance,</HI> and she imagines she would be the
most fortunate of all Womankind, in such a Match.
With these Thoughts she employ'd all the Hours of the
Night; so that she lay so long in Bed the next Day,
that Count <HI>Vernole,</HI> who had invited himself to Din∣ner,
came before she had quitted her Chamber, and
she was forc'd to say, she had not been well. He had
brought her a very fine Book, newly come out, of de∣licate
Philosophy, fit for the Study of Ladies. But he
appear'd so disagreeable to that Heart, wholly taken
up with a new and fine Object, that she could now
hardly pay him that Civility she was wont to do; while
<PB N="14" REF="233"/>
on the other side, that little State and Pride <HI>Atlante</HI>
assum'd, made her appear the more charming to him;
so that if <HI>Atlante</HI> had no Mind to begin a new Lesson
of Philosophy, while she fancied her Thoughts were
much better employ'd, the Count every Moment ex∣pressing
his Tenderness and Passion, had as little an
Inclination to instruct her, as she was to be instruct∣ed;
Love had taught her a new Lesson, and he would
fain teach her a new Lesson of Love, but fears it will
be a diminishing of his Gravity and Grandeur, to open
the Secrets of his Heart to so young a Maid; he there∣fore
thinks it more agreeable to his Quality and Years,
being about Forty, to use her Father's Authority in
this Affair, and that it was sufficient for him to de∣clare
himself to Monsieur <HI>De Pais,</HI> who he knew would
be proud of the Honour he did him some time past,
before he could perswade himself, even to declare him∣self,
to her Father; he fancies, the little Coldness and
Pride he saw in <HI>Atlante</HI>'s Face, which was not usual,
proceeded from some Discovery of Passion, which his
Eyes had made, or now and then a Sigh, that una∣wares
broke forth, and accuses himself of a Levity
below his Quality, and the Dignity of his Wit and
Gravity; and therefore, assumes a more rigid and
formal Behaviour than he was wont, which rendred
him yet more disagreeable than before; and 'twas
with greater Pain than ever, she gave him that Respect
which was due to his Quality.</P>
<P><HI>Rinaldo,</HI> after a restless Night, was up very early
in the Morning; and tho' he was not certain of see∣ing
his adorable <HI>Atlante,</HI> he dress'd himself with all
that care, as if he had been to have waited on hers
and got himself into the Window, that overlook,
Monsieur <HI>De Pais</HI> his Balcony, where he had not re∣main'd
long, before he saw the pretty <HI>Charlot</HI> come
into it, not with any design of seeing <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> but to
lock and gaze about her a little: <HI>Rinaldo</HI> saw her,
and made her a very low Reverence, and found some
disordered Joy on the sight of even <HI>Charlot,</HI> since she
was Sister to <HI>Atlante.</HI> He call'd to her (for the Win∣dow
<PB N="15" REF="233"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was so near her, he could easily be heard by her)
and told her, <HI>He was infinitely indebted to her Bounty,
for giving him an opportunity yesterday of falling on that
Discourse, which had made him the happiest Man in the
World:</HI> He said, <HI>if she had not by her agreeable Con∣versation
encourag'd him, and drawn him from one Word
to another, she should never have had the Confidence to
have told</HI> Atlante, <HI>how much he ador'd her. I am very
glad,</HI> replied <HI>Charlot, that I was the Occasion of the Be∣ginning
of an Amour, which was displeasing to neither
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nor to the other; for I assure you, for your Comfort, my
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nothing but thinks on you: We lie together, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have taught her already to sigh so, that I could not
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for her.</HI> At this, his Face was covered over with
a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Joy, which his Heart could not contain: And
after some Discourse, in which this innocent Girl dis∣covered
more than <HI>Atlante</HI> wish'd she should, he be∣sought
her to become his Advocate; and since she had
an Brother, to give him leave to assume that Honour,
and call her Sister. Thus, by degrees, he flatter'd her
into a Consent, of carrying a Letter from him to <HI>At∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te;</HI>
which she, who believ'd all as innocent as her
self, and being not forbid to do so, immediately con∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed
to, when he took his Pen and Ink, that stood
in the Window, with Paper, wrote <HI>Atlante</HI> this fol∣lowing
Letter:</P>

if your Charity can sometimes afford me a sight of you,

in the Morning, it would save me from that Despair
and Torment, which must possess a Heart so unassur'd, us
that of</P>

</LETTER>
<P>He having writ and seal'd this, toss'd it into the
Balcony, to <HI>Charlot,</HI> having first look'd about to see
if none perceiv'd them: She put it in her Bosom, and
ran into her Sister, whom by chance she found alone;
<HI>Vernole</HI> having taken <HI>De Pais</HI> into the Garden, to dis∣course
him concerning the sending <HI>Charlot</HI> to the Mo∣nastery;
which Work he desir'd to see perform'd, be∣fore
he declar'd his Intentions to <HI>Atlante;</HI> for among
all his other good Qualities, he was very avaritious;
and as fair as <HI>Atlante</HI> was, he thought she would be
much fairer with the Addition of <HI>Charlot</HI>'s Portion:
This Affair of his, with Monsieur <HI>De Pays,</HI> gave <HI>Char∣lot</HI>
an Opportunity of delivering her Letter to her Si∣ster;
who no sooner drew it from her Bosom, but <HI>At∣lante</HI>'s
Face was cover'd over with Blushes: For
she imagin'd from whence it came, and had a se∣cret
Joy in that Imagination, tho' she thought she must
put on the Severity and Niceness of a Virgin, who
would not be thought to have surrendred her Heart
with so small an Assault, and the first too: So she de∣manded
from whence <HI>Charlot</HI> had that Letter? Who
replied with Joy, <HI>From the fine young Gentleman, our
Neighbour.</HI> At which <HI>Atlante</HI> assum'd all the Gravity
she could, to chide her Sister; who replied, <HI>Well, Si∣ster,
had you this Day seen him, you would not have been
angry to have receiv'd a Letter from him; he look'd so
handsome, and was so richly dress'd, ten times finer than
he was yesterday; and I promis'd him, you should read it;
therefore pray let me keep my Word with him; and not
only so, but carry him an Answer. Well,</HI> said <HI>Atl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,
to save your Credit with Monsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur</HI> Rinaldo, <HI>I will read it.</HI>
Which she did, and finished with a Sigh. While she
was reading, <HI>Charlot</HI> ran into the Garden, to see if they
<PB N="17" REF="234"/>
were not likely to be surprized; and finding the Count
and her Father set in an Arbor, in deep Discourse, she
brought Pen, Ink, and Paper, to her Sister, and told
her, she might write without the fear of being disturbed;
and urged her so long to what was enough her Inclina∣tion,
she at last obtained this Answer:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>ATLANTE to RINALDO.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CHarlot,</HI> your little importunate Advocate, has, at last
subdued me to a Consent of returning you this. She
has put me on an Affair which I am wholly unacquainted
with; and you ought to take this very kindly from me, since
it is the very first time I ever writ to one of your Sex, tho'
perhaps I might with less Danger have done it to any other
Man. I tremble while I write, since I dread a Correspon∣dence
of this Nature, which may insensibly draw us into an
Inconvenience, and engage me beyond the Limits of that
Nicety I ought to preserve: For this way we venture to say
a thousand little kind Things, which in Conversation we
dare not do; for now none can see us blush. I am sensible
I shall this way put myself too soon into your Power; and
tho' you have abundance of Merit, I ought to be ashamed
of Confessing, I am but too sensible of them:—But hold
—I shall discover for your Repose (which I would preserve)
too much of the Heart of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>ATLANTE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>She gave this Letter to <HI>Charlot;</HI> who immediately
ran into the Balcony with it, where she still found <HI>Ri∣naldo</HI>
in a Melancholy Posture, leaning his Head on his
Hand: She shewed him the Letter, but was afraid to
toss it to him, for fear it might fall to the Ground; so
he ran and fetched a long Cane, which he cleft at one
end, and holding it where she put the Letter into the
Cleft, and staid not to hear what he said to it: But ne∣ver
was Man so transported with Joy, as he was, at the
reading of this Letter; it gives him new Wounds; for
to the Generous, nothing obliges Love so much as Love:
<PB N="18" REF="235"/>
Tho' it is now too much the Nature of that inconstant
Sex, to cease too Love as soon as they are sure of the
Conquest. But it was far different with our Cavalier;
he was the more inflamed, by imagining he had made
some Impressions on the Heart of <HI>Atlante,</HI> and kindled
some Sparks there, that in time might increase to some
thing more; so that he now resolves to die hers; and
considering all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bstacles that may possibly hinder
his Happiness, he found none but his Father's Obsti∣nacy,
perhaps occasioned by the Meanness of <HI>Atlante</HI>'s
Fortune: To this he urged again, that he was his on∣ly
Son, and a Son whom he loved equal to his own
Life; and that certainly, as soon as he should behold
him dying for <HI>Atlante,</HI> which if forc'd to quit he must
be, that then he believed the Tenderness of so fond a
Parent, would break forth into Pity and Compassion,
and plead within for his Consent. These were the
Thoughts that flattered this young Lover all the Day,
and whether he were riding the great Horse, or at his
Study of Philosophy, or Mathematicks, Singing, Dancing,
or whatsoever other Exercise his Tutors ordered, his
Thoughts were continually on <HI>Atlante,</HI> and now he pro∣fited
no more; whatever he seem'd to do, every Day
he fail'd not to write to her by the Hand of the kind <HI>Char∣lot;</HI>
who young as she was, had conceiv'd a very great
Friendship for <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> and fail'd not to fetch her Let∣ters,
and bring him Answers, such as he wish'd to re∣ceive.
But all this did not satisfie our impatient Lover;
Absence kill'd, and he was no longer able to support him∣self,
without a sight of this adorable Maid; he there∣fore
implores, she will give him that Satisfaction: And
she at last grants it, with a better Will than he imagin'd.
The next Day was the appointed time, when she would,
under pretence of going to Church, give him an Assig∣nation:
And because all Publick Places were dangerous,
and might make a great Noise, and they had no Pri∣vate
Place to trust to, <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> under pretence of going
up the River in his Pleasure-Boat, which he often did,
sent to have it made ready against the next Day, at Ten
of the Clock. This was accordingly done, and he gave
<PB N="19" REF="235"/>
<HI>Atlante</HI> Notice of his Design, of going an Hour or two
on the River, in his Boat; which lay near to such a
place, not far from the Church. She, and <HI>Charlot,</HI>
came thither; and because they durst not come out,
without a Foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man, or two; they taking one, sent him
with a <HI>How de ye?</HI> to some young Ladies; and told
him, he should find them at Church. So getting rid of
their Spy, they hastned to the River-side, and found a
Boat, and <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> waiting to carry them on Board his
little Vessel; which was richly adorn'd, and a very
handsome Collation ready for them, of Cold Meats, Sal∣lads,
and Sweetmeats. As soon as they were come in∣to
the Pleasure-Boat, unseen of any, he kneel'd at the
Feet of <HI>Atlante;</HI> and there utter'd so many passionate
and tender Things to her, with a Voice so trembling,
and soft; with Eyes so languishing; and a Fervency,
and Fire, so sincere; that her young Heart, wholly un∣capable
of Artifice, could no longer resist such Language,
and such Looks of Love, she grows tender, and he per∣ceives
it in her fine Eyes, who could not dissemble; he
reads her Heart in her Looks, and found it yielding a∣pace;
and therefore assaults it anew, with fresh Forces
of Sighs and Tears: He implores, she would assure him
of her Heart; which she could no other way do, then
by yielding to marry him: He would carry her to the
next Village, there consummate that Happiness, without
which he was able to live no longer; for he had a thou∣sand
Fears, that some other Lover was, or would sud∣denly
be provided for her; and therefore he would
make sure of her, while he had this Opportunity; and
to that end, he answered all the Objections she could
make to the contrary: But ever, when he nam'd Mar∣riage,
she trembled, with fear of doing something that
she fancy'd she ought not to do, without the Consent of
her Father: She was sensible of the Advantage, but had
been so us'd to a strict Obedience, that she could not,
without Horrour, think of violating it; and therefore
besought him, as he valu'd her Repose, not to urge her
to that. And told him further, That if he fear'd any
Rival, she would give him what other Assurance, and
<PB N="20" REF="236"/>
Satisfaction he pleas'd, but that of Marriage; which she
could not consent to, 'till she knew such an Alliance
would not be fatal to him; for she fear'd as passionate∣ly
as he lov'd her, when he should find she had occasi∣on'd
him the loss of his Fortune, or his Father's Affection,
he would grow to hate her; tho' he answer'd to this,
all that a fond Lover could urge, yet she was resolv'd,
and he was forc'd to content himself with obliging her
by his Prayers and Protestations, his Sighs, and his
Showers of Tears, to a Contract, which they solemnly
made each other, vowing on either side, that they would
never marry any other. This being solemnly conclu∣ded,
he assum'd a Look more gay, and contented than
before: He presented her a very rich Ring; which she
durst not put on her Finger, but hid it in her Bosom:
And beholding each other now, as Man and Wife, she
suffer'd him all the decent Freedoms he could wish to
take; so that the Hours of this Voyage, seem'd the most
soft and charming of his Life: And doubtless they were
so; every Touch of <HI>Atlante</HI> transported him, every
Look pierced his Soul, and he was all Raptures of Joy,
when he consider'd this charming lovely Maid was his
own.</P>
<P><HI>Charlot</HI> all this while was gazing above Deck, admi∣ring
the Motion of the little Vessel, and how easily the
Wind and Tide bore her up the River. She had never
been in any thing of this kind before, and was very well
pleased and entertain'd, when <HI>Rinaldo</HI> call'd her down
to eat; where they enjoy'd themselves as well as was
possible; and <HI>Charlot</HI> was wondering to see such a Con∣tent
in their Eyes.</P>
<P>But now they thought it was high time for them to
return; they fancy the Foot-man missing them at
Church, would go home, and alarm their Father, and
the Knight of the Ill-favour'd Countenance, as <HI>Charlot</HI>
call'd Count <HI>Vernole;</HI> whose Severity put their Father
on a greater Restriction of them, than naturally he would
do of himself. At the Name of this Count, <HI>Rinaldo</HI>
chang'd Colour, fearing he might be some Rival; and
ask'd <HI>Atlante,</HI> if this <HI>Vernole</HI> was a-kin to her? She an∣swered,
<PB N="21" REF="236"/>
No: But was a very great Friend to her Fa∣ther;
and on who, from their Infancy, had had a par∣ticular
Concern for their Breeding, and was her Ma∣ster
for Philosophy. <HI>Ah!</HI> replied <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> sighing, <HI>This
Man's Concern must proceed from something more than
Friendship for her Father;</HI> and therefore conjured her to
tell him, whether he was not a Lover? <HI>A Lover,</HI> re∣plied
<HI>Atlante; I assure you, he is a perfect Antidote a∣gainst
that Passion;</HI> and tho' she suffered his ugly Pre∣sence
now, she should loath and hate him, should he
name but Love to her.</P>
<P>She said, she believ'd she need not fear any such Per∣secution,
since he was a Man, who was not at all A∣morous;
that he had too much of the Satyr in his Hu∣mour
to harbour any softness there: And Nature had
form'd his Body to his Mind, wholly unfit for Love;
and that he might set his Heart absolutely at rest: She
assur'd him her Father had never yet propos'd any Mar∣riage
to her, tho' many advantagious ones are offer'd
him every day.</P>
<P>The Sails being turn'd to carry them back from
whence they came; after having discours'd of a thou∣sand
things, and all of Love and Contrivance, to carry
on their Mutual Design, they with Sighs parted, <HI>Ri∣naldo</HI>
staying behind in the Pleasure-Boat, and they go∣ing
a Shoar in the Wherry, that attended; after which,
he cast many an amorous and sad Look, and perhaps
was answer'd by those of <HI>Atlante.</HI></P>
<P>It was past Church time two or three Hours; when
they arriv'd at home, wholly unprepared with an Ex∣cuse,
so absolutely was <HI>Atlante</HI>'s Soul possest with soft∣er
Business. The first Person they met withal, was
the Footman, who open'd the Door, and began to cry
out, how long he had waited in the Church, and how
in vain; without giving them time to reply. <HI>De Pais</HI>
came towards 'em; and with a frowning Look, de∣manded
where they had been? <HI>Atlante,</HI> who was not
accustomed to Excuses, and Untruth, was a while at a
stand; when <HI>Charlot</HI> with a Voice of Joy cried out;
<HI>Oh, Sir, we have been a Board of a fine little Ship:</HI> At
<PB N="22" REF="237"/>
this <HI>Atlante</HI> blush'd, fearing she would tell the Truth.
But she proceeded on, and said, that they had not
been above a Quarter of an Hour at Church, when
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ady—, with some other Ladies and Cavaliers,
were going out of the Church, and that spying them,
they wou'd needs have them go with 'em: My Sister,
Sir, continued she, was very loath to go, for fear you
should be angry; but my Lady—was so importu∣nate
with her on one side, and I on the other; because
I never saw a little Ship in my Life, that at last we pre∣vailed
with her; therefore, good Sir, be not angry. He
promised them, he was not: And when they came in,
they found Count <HI>Vernole,</HI> who had been inspiring <HI>De
Pais</HI> with Severity, and counsell'd him to chide the young
Ladies, for being too long absent, under pretence of go∣ing
to their Devotion. Nor was it enough for him to
set the Father on, but himself, with a Gravity, where
Concern and Malice were both apparent, reproach'd
<HI>Atlante</HI> with Levity; and told her, He believ'd she had
some other Motive, than the Invitation of a Lady, to
go on Ship-board; and that she had too many Lovers,
not to make them doubt that this was a design'd thing;
and that she had heard Love from some one, for whom
it was design'd. To this she made him but a short Re∣ply,
That if it was so, she had no Reason to conceal it,
since she had Sence enough to look after herself; and if
any Body had made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove to her, he might be assur'd,
it was some one, whose Quality and Merit deserv'd to
be heard: And with a Look of Scorn, she past on to
another Room, and left him silently raging within with
Jealousie: Which, if before she tormented him, this
Declaration increas'd it to a Pitch not to be conceal'd.
And this Day he said so much to the Father, that he re∣solv'd
forthwith to send <HI>Charlot</HI> to a Nunnery: And
accordingly, the next Day, he bid her prepare to go.
<HI>Charlot,</HI> who was not yet arrived to the Years of Distin∣ction,
did not much regret it; and having no Trouble,
but leaving her Sister, she prepared to go to a Nunnery,
not many Streets from that where she dwelt. The Lady
Abbess was her Father's Kinswoman, and had treated
<PB N="23" REF="237"/>
her very well, as often as she came to visit her; so that
with Satisfaction enough, she was condemned to a Mo∣nastick
Life, and was now going for her Probation-Year.
<HI>Atlante</HI> was troubled at her Departure, because
she had no Body to bring, and to carry Letters between
<HI>Rinaldo</HI> and she: However she took her leave of her,
and promis'd to come and see her, as often as she should
be permitted to go abroad; for she fear'd now some
Constraint extraordinary would be put upon her; and
so it happen'd.</P>
<P><HI>Atlante</HI>'s Chamber was that to which the Balcony
belong'd, and though she durst not appear there in the
Day-time, she could in the Night, and that way give
her Lover as many Hours of Conversation, as she plea∣sed,
without being perceived: But how to give <HI>Rinaldo</HI>
notice of this, she could not tell, who not knowing
<HI>Charlot</HI> was gone to a Monastery, waited many Days
at his Window to see her; at last they neither of them
knowing who to trust with any Message, one Day
when he was, as usual, upon his watch, he saw <HI>Atlante</HI>
step into the Balcony, who having a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etter, in which
she had put a Piece of Lead, she tost it into his Window,
whose Casement was open, and run in again unper∣ceived
by any but himself, the Paper contain'd only
this:</P>
<P>My Chamber is that which looks into the Balcony, from
whence, tho' I cannot converse with you in the Day, I can
at Night, when I am retired to go to Bed; therefore be at
your Window. <HI>Farewel.</HI></P>
<P>There needed no more to make him a diligent Watch∣er,
and accordingly she was no sooner retired to her
Chamber, but she would come into the Balcony, where
she fail'd not to see him attending at his Window. This
happy Contrivance was thus carry'd on for many
Nights, where they entertain'd one another, with all
the Indearment that two Hearts could dictate, who
were perfectly united and assured of each other, and
this pleasing Conversation would often last till Day ap∣peared,
and forced them to part.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="238"/>
But old <HI>Belyuard</HI> perceiving his Son frequent that
Chamber more than usual, fancy'd something extraor∣dinary
must be the Cause of it; and one Night asking
for his Son, his Vallet told him, he was gone into the great
Chamber; so this was called: <HI>Belyuard</HI> asked the Val∣let,
what he did there; he told him, he could not tell;
for often he had lighted him thither; and, that his Ma∣ster
would take the Candle from him, at the Chamber
Door, and suffer him to go no further: Tho' the old
Gentleman could not imagine, what Affairs he could
have alone every Night in that Chamber, he had a
Curiosity to see; and one unlucky Night, putting off
his Shooes, he came to the Door of the Chamber,
which was open, he entered softly, and saw the Candle
set in the Chimney, and his Son at a great open Bay
Window; he stopt a while to wait when he would
turn, but finding him immovable, he advanced some∣thing
further, and at last heard the soft Dialogue of
Love, between him and <HI>Atlante;</HI> whom he knew to
be she, by his often calling her by her Name in their
Discourse: He heard enough to confirm him how Mat∣ters
went; and unseen as he came, he returned, full
of Indignation, and thought how to prevent so great
an Evil, as this Passion of his Son might produce; at
first he thought to round him severely in the Ear about
it, and upbraid him for doing the only thing he had
thought fit to forbid him; but then he thought that
would but terrifie him for a while, and he would re∣turn
again, where he had so great an Inclination, if he
were near her: He therefore resolves to send him to
<HI>Paris,</HI> that by absence he might forget the young Beau∣ty,
that had charmed his Youth: Therefore, without
letting <HI>Rinaldo</HI> know the Reason, and without taking
notice that he knew any thing of his Amour, he came
to him one Day, and told him all the Masters he had
for the improving him in noble Sciences were very dull,
or very remiss; and that he resolved he should go for a
Year or two, to the Academy at <HI>Paris.</HI> To this, the
Son made a thousand Evasions; but the Father was
positive, and not to be perswaded by all his Reasons;
<PB N="25" REF="238"/>
and finding he should absolutely displease him, if he re∣fused
to go, and not daring to tell him the dear Cause
of his Desire to remain at <HI>Orleance.</HI> He therefore,
with a breaking Heart, consents to go, nay, resolves it,
though it should be his Death: But, alas! he considers,
that this parting will not only prove the greatest Tor∣ment
upon Earth to him, but that <HI>Atlante</HI> will share
in his Misfortunes also: This Thought gives him a
double Torment, and yet finds no way to evade it.</P>
<P>The Night that finished this fatal Day, he goes again
to his wonted Station, the Window; where he had
not sig'hd very long, but he saw <HI>Atlante</HI> enter the Bal∣cony:
He was not able a great while to speak to her,
or to utter one Word. The Night was light enough
to see him at the wonted place; and she admires at his
Silence, and demands the Reason in such obliging
Terms, as adds to his Grief; and he, with a deep
Sigh, replied, <HI>Ʋrge me not, my fair</HI> Atlante, <HI>to speak
lest by obeying you, I give you more cause of Grief, than
my Silence is capable of doing:</HI> And then sighing again,
he held his Peace, and gave her leave to ask the Cause
of these last Words. But when he made no Reply,
but by sighing, she imagin'd it much worse, than in∣deed
it was; and with a trembling and fainting Voice,
she cried, <HI>Oh!</HI> Rinaldo, <HI>give me leave to divine that
cruel News you are so unwilling to tell me: It is so,</HI> added
she, <HI>you are destined to some more fortunate Maid than</HI>
Atlante: At this, Tears stopp'd her Speech, and she
could utter no more. <HI>No, my dearest Charmer,</HI> reply∣ed
<HI>Rinaldo</HI> (elevating his Voice) <HI>if that were all, you
should see with what Fortitude I would die, rather than
obey any such Commands: I am vowed yours to the last
Moment of my Life; and will be yours in spight of all the
Opposition in the World; that Cruelty I could evade, but
cannot this that threatens me. Ah!</HI> cried <HI>Atlante, let
Fate do her worst, so she still continue</HI> Rinaldo <HI>mine, and
keep that Faith he hath sworn to me entire: What can she
do beside that can afflict me? She can separate me,</HI> cried
he, <HI>for some time from</HI> Atlante. <HI>Oh!</HI> replied she, <HI>all
Misfortunes fall so below that which I first imagined, that
<PB N="26" REF="239"/>
methinks I do not resent this, as I should otherwise have
done; but I know, when I have a little more considered it,
I shall even die with the Grief of it. Absence being so
great an Enemy to Love, and makes us soon forget the
Object beloved: This, though I never experienced, I have
heard, and fear it may be my Fate.</HI> He then convinced
her Fear with a thousand new Vows, and a thousand
Imprecations of Constancy. She then asked him, <HI>If
their Loves were discovered, that he was with such haste to
depart?</HI> He told her, <HI>Nothing of that was the Cause; and
he could almost wish it were discovered, since he could re∣solutely
then refuse to go: But it was only to cultivate his
Mind, more effectually than he could do here; 'twas the
Care of his Father to accomplish him the more; and there∣fore
he could not contradict it. But,</HI> said he, <HI>I am not
sent where Seas shall part us, nor vast distances of Earth,
but to</HI> Paris; <HI>from whence he might come in two Days to
see her again, and that he would expect from that Balco∣ny,
that had gave him so many happy Moments, many
more when he should come to see her.</HI> He besought her to
send him away with all the Satisfaction she could,
which she could no otherwise do, than by giving him
new Assurances, that she would never give away that
Right he had in her, to any other Lover: She vows
this with innumerable Tears; and is almost angry with
him for questioning her Faith. He tells her then he has
but one Night more to stay, and his Grief would be un∣speakable,
if he should not be able to take a better
Leave of her, than at a Window; and that, if she
would give him leave, he would by a Rope or two
tied together, so as it may serve for Steps, ascend her
Balcony; he not having time to provide a Ladder of
Ropes. She tells him, she has so great a Confidence in
his Vertue and Love, that she will refuse him nothing,
though it would be a very bold venture for a Maid, to
trust herself with a passionate young Man, in silence of
Night; and though she did not exert a Vow from him
to secure her, she expected he would have a Care of
her Honour. He swore to her, his Love was too Re∣ligious
for so base an Attempt. There needed not ma∣ny
<PB N="27" REF="239"/>
Vows to confirm her Faith; and it was agreed on
between them▪ that he should come the next Night in∣to
her Chamber.</P>
<P>It happened that Night, as it often did, that Count
<HI>Vernole,</HI> lay with Monsieur <HI>De Pays,</HI> which was in a
Ground-Room, just under that of <HI>Atlante</HI>'s: And as
soon as she knew all were in Bed, she gave the Word
to <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> who was attending with the Impatience of
a passionate Lover below, under the Window; and,
who sooner heard the Balcony open, but he ascended
with some difficulty, and entered the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mber, where
he found <HI>Atlante</HI> tremble with Joy and Fear: He
throws himself at her Feet, as unable to speak as she;
who nothing but blushed and bent down her Eyes,
hardly daring to glance them towards the dear Object
of her Desires, the Lord of all her Vows: She was
was ashamed to see a Man in her Chamber, where yet
none had ever been alone, and by Night too. He saw
her Fear, and felt her Trembling; and after a thousand
Sighs of Love had made way for Speech, he besought
her to fear nothing from him; for his Flame was too
sacred, and his Passion too holy to offer any thing, but
what Honour with Love might afford him. At last he
brought her to some Courage, and the Roses of her fair
Cheeks assumed their wonted Colour, not blushing too
Red, nor languishing too Pale. But when the Con∣versation
began between them, it was the softest
in the World: They said all that parting Lovers
could say, all that Wit and Tenderness could express:
They exchanged their Vows a-new, and to confirm his,
he tied a Bracelet of Diamonds about her Arm; and
she returned him one of her Hair, which he had long
begged, and she had on purpose made, which clasped
together with Diamonds; this she put about his Arm,
and he swore to carry it to his Grave. The Night was
very far spent in tender Vows, soft Sighs and Tears on
both sides; and it was high time to part: But as if
Death had been to have arrived to them in that Minute,
they both linger'd away the time, like Lovers who had
forgot themselves; and Day was near approaching,
<PB N="28" REF="240"/>
when he bid farewel; which he repeated very often,
for still he was interrupted by some commanding Soft∣ness
from <HI>Atlante,</HI> and then lost all his Power of going;
till she, more couragious and careful of his Interest,
and her own Fame, forc'd him from her; and it was
happy she did so; for he was no sooner got over the
Balcony, and she had flung him down his Rope, and
shut the Door, but <HI>Vernole,</HI> whom Love and Contri∣vance
kept waking, fancied several times he heard a
Noise in <HI>Atlante</HI>'s Chamber. And whether in passing
over the Balcony, <HI>Rinaldo</HI> made any noise or not, or
whether it were still his jealous Fancy, he came up in
his Night-Gown, with a Pistol in his Hand. <HI>Atlante</HI>
was not so much lost in Grief, though she were all in
Tears, but she heard a Man come up, and imagined it
had been her Father, she not knowing of Count <HI>Ver∣nole</HI>'s
lying in the House that Night; if she had, she
possibly had taken more care to have been silent: But
whoever it was, she could not get to Bed soon enough;
and therefore turn'd herself to her Dressing-table, where
Candle stood, and where lay a Book open of the Story
of <HI>Ariadne</HI> and <HI>Thesias.</HI> The Count turning the Latch,
entred halting into her Chamber, in his Night-Gown
clapped close about him, which betrayed an ill-favour∣ed
Shape, his Night-Cap on, without a Perriwig, which
discovered all his lean withered Jaws, his pale Face, and
his Eyes staring; and making altogether so dreadful a
Figure, that <HI>Atlante,</HI> who no more dreamt of him than
of a Devil, had possibly have rather seen the last. She
gave a great Shriek, which frighted <HI>Vernole;</HI> so both
stood for a while staring on each other, till both were re∣collected:
He told her, the Care of her Honour had
brought him thither; and then rolling his small Eyes
round the Chamber, to see if he could discover any
Body; he proceed and cried, <HI>Madam, if I had no other
Motive than your being up at this time of Night, or rather
of Day, I could easily guess how you have been entertained.
What Insolence is this,</HI> said she, all in a Rage, <HI>when to
cover your Boldness of approaching my Chamber at this
Hour, you would question how I have been entertained;
<PB N="29" REF="240"/>
either explain yourself, or quit my Chamber; for I do not
use to see such terrible Objects here. Possibly those you do
see,</HI> said the Count, <HI>are indeed more agreeable, but I am
afraid have not that regard to your Honour as I have.</HI> And
at that Word he stepped to the Balcony, opened it,
and looked out, but seeing no Body, he shut it too a∣gain.
This enraged <HI>Atlante</HI> beyond all Patience; and
snatching the Pistol out of his Hand, she told him, <HI>He
deserved to have it aimed at his Head, for having the Im∣pudence
to question her Honour, or her Conduct; and com∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded
him to avoid her Chamber as he loved his Life;</HI>
which she believed he was fonder of than of her Ho∣nour:
She speaking this in a Tone wholly transported
with Rage; and at the same time holding the Pistol to∣wards
him, made him tremble with Fear; and he now
found whether she were guilty or not, it was his turn
to beg pardon: For you must know, however it came
to pass, that his Jealousie made him come up in that
force Posture; at other times <HI>Vernole</HI> was the most
tame and passive Man in the World, and one who was
afraid of his own Shadow in the Night: He had a
natural Aversion for Danger, and thought it below a
Man of Wit, or common Sense, to be guilty of that
brutal Thing, called Courage or Fighting: His Phi∣losophy
told him, <HI>It was safe sleeping in a whole Skin;</HI>
and possibly he apprehended as much Danger from this
<HI>Virago,</HI> as ever he did from his own Sex; he therefore
fell on his Knees, and besought her to hold her fair
Hand; and not to suffer that, which was the greatest
Mark of his Respect, to be the Cause of her Hate or
Indignation. The pitiful Faces he made, and the Signs
of mortal Fear in him, had almost made her laugh, at
least it allayed her Anger; and she bid him rise and
play the Fool hereafter some-where-else, and not in her
Presence: Yet for once, she would deign to give him
this Satisfaction; that she was got into a Book, which
had many moving Stories very well writ; and that
she found herself so well entertained, she had forgot
how the Night passed. He most humbly thanked her
<PB N="30" REF="241"/>
for this Satisfaction, and retired, perhaps not so well
satisfied as he pretended.</P>
<P>After this, he appeared more submissive and respect∣ful
towards <HI>Atlante;</HI> and she carried herself more reser∣ved
and haughty towards him; which was one Reason,
he would not yet discover his Passion.</P>
<P>Thus the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me ran on at <HI>Orleance,</HI> while <HI>Rinald<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
found himself daily languishing at <HI>Paris.</HI> He was in∣deed
in the best Academy in the City amongst a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

other Business; his time was wholly past in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
solitary Parts of the Garden, by the melancholy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
, and in the most gloomy Shades; wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
with most Liberty breath out his Passion and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪
He was past the Tutorage of a Boy; and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
could not upbraid him, but found he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
Cause of Grief, which made him not mind these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
, which were the Delight of the rest; so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
thing being able to divert his Melancholy, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
increased upon him: He fear'd it would bring him
into a Fever, if he did not give himself the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of seeing <HI>Atlante.</HI> He had no sooner though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of
this, but he was impatient to put it into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
he resolves to go (having very good Horses) without
acquainting any of his Servants with it. He got a very
handsome and light I adder of Ropes made, which he
carried under his Coat, and away he rid for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI>
stay'd at a little Village, till the Darkness of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
might favour his Design: And then walking about <HI>At∣lante</HI>'s
Lodgings, till he saw a Light in her Chamber;
and then making that Noise on his Sword, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
greed between them. He was heard by his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>Atlante,</HI> and suffered to mount her Chamber; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
he would stay till almost break of Day, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣turn
to the Village, and take Horse and away for <HI>Paris</HI>
again. This, once in a Month, was his Exercise, with∣out
which he could not live; so that his whole Year
<PB N="31" REF="241"/>
was past in riding between <HI>Orleance</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> between
excess of Grief and excess of Joy by turns.</P>
<P>It was now that <HI>Atlante</HI> arrived to her fifteenth
Year, shone out with a Lustre of Beauty greater than
ever; and in this Year of the Absence of <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> had
carried herself with that Severity of Life, without the
youthful Desire of going abroad, or desiring any Di∣version,
but what she found in her own retired
Thoughts: That <HI>Vernole,</HI> wholly unable longer to con∣ceal
his Passion, resolved to make a Publication of it,
first to the Father, and then to the lovely Daughter,
of whom he had some hope, because she had carried
herself very well towards him for this Year past;
which she would never have done, if she had imagi∣ned
he would ever have been her Lover: She had seen
no Signs of any such Misfortune towards her in these
many Years he had conversed with her, and she had
to cause to fear him. When one Day her Father ta∣king
her into the Garden, told her what Honour and
Happiness was in store for her; and that now the Glo∣ry
of his fallen Family would rise again, since she had
a Lover of an illustrious Blood, allied to Monarchs;
and one whose Fortune was newly encreas'd to a very
considerable Degree, answerable to his Birth. She
changed Colour at this Discourse, imagining but too
well, who this illustrious Lover was: When <HI>De Pais</HI>
proceeded, and told her, <HI>Indeed his Person was not the
most agreeable that ever was seen; but he married her to
Glory and Fortune, not the Man: And a Woman,</HI> says he,
<HI>ought to look no farther.</HI></P>
<P>She needed not any more to inform her, who this
intended Husband was; and, therefore bursting forth
into Tears, she throws herself at his Feet, imploring
him not to use the Authority of a Father, to force her
to a thing so contrary to her Inclinations; assuring, she
could not consent to any such thing; and that she
would rather die than yield: She urged many Argu∣ments
for this her Disobedience. But none would pass
for current with the old Gentleman, whose Pride had
<PB N="32" REF="242"/>
slattered him with hopes of so considerable a Son-in-Law:
He was very much surprized at <HI>Atlante</HI>'s refu∣sing
what he believed she would receive with Joy;
and finding that no Arguments on his side could draw
hers to an obedient Consent, he grew to such a Rage,
as very rarely possest him; vowing, if she did not con∣form
her Will to his, he would abandon her to all the
Cruelty of Contempt and Poverty; so that at last she
was forced to return him this Answer, <HI>That she would
strive all she could with her Heart; but she verily belie∣ved
she should never bring it to consent to a Marriage
with Monsieur the Count.</HI> The Father continued threat∣ning
her, and gave her some Days to consider of it:
So leaving her in Tears, he returned to his Chamber,
to consider what Answer he should give Count <HI>Vernole,</HI>
whom he knew would be impatient to learn what Suc∣cess
he had, and what himself was to hope: <HI>De Pais,</HI>
after some Consideration, resolved to tell him, she re∣ceived
the Offer very well; but, that he must expect
a little Maiden Nicety in the Case; and accordingly
did tell him so; and he was not at all doubtful of his
good Fortune.</P>
<P>But <HI>Atlante,</HI> who resolved to die a thousand Deaths
rather than break her solemn Vows to <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> or to
marry the Count, cast about how she should avoid it
with the least Hazard of her Father's Rage. She found
<HI>Rinaldo</HI> the better and more advantageous Match of the
two, could they but get his Father's Consent: He was
beautiful and young; his Title was equal to that of
<HI>Vernole,</HI> when his Father should die; and his Estate
exceeded his; yet she dares not make a Discovery, for
fear she should injure her Lover; who at this time,
though she knew it not, lay sick of a Fever, while she
was wondering that he came not as he used to do:
However, she resolves to send him a Letter, and ac∣quaint
him with the Misfortune; which she did in
these Terms:</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="33" REF="242"/>
<HEAD>ATLANTE to RINALDO.</HEAD>
<P>MY Father's Authority would force me to vio∣late
my sacred Vows to you, and give them
to the Count <HI>Vernole,</HI> whom I mortally hate,
yet could wish him the greatest Monarch in the
World, that I might show you. I could even then
despise him for your sake. My Father is already
too much inraged by my denial, to hear Reason
from me, if I should confess to him my Vows to you:
So that I see nothing but a Prospect of Death before
me; for assure yourself, my <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> I will die ra∣ther
than consent to marry any other: Therefore
come, my <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> and come quickly, to see my
Funerals, instead of those Nuptials they vainly ex∣pect
from</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Faithful
ATLANTE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="34" REF="243"/>
This Letter <HI>Rinaldo</HI> received; and there needed no
more to make him sly to <HI>Orleance:</HI> This raised him
soon from his Bed of Sickness, and getting immediate∣ly
to hers, he arrived at his Father's House; who did
not so much admire to see him, because he heard he
was sick of a Fever, and gave him leave to return, if
he pleas'd: He went directly to his Father's House,
because he knew somewhat of the Business; he was
resolv'd to make his Passion known, as soon as he had
seen <HI>Atlante;</HI> from whom he was to take all his Mea∣sures:
He therefore fail'd not, when all were in Bed,
to rise and go from his Chamber, into the Street;
where finding a Light in <HI>Atlante</HI>'s Chamber, for she
every Night expected him, he made the usual Sign,
and she went into the Balcony; and he having no
Conveniency of mounting up into it, they discours'd,
and said all they had to say: From thence, she tells
him of the Count's Passions, of her Father's Resolution,
and her own, which was rather to die his than live
any body's else: And at last, as their last Refuge, they
resolv'd to discover the whole Matter; she to her Fa∣ther,
and he to his, to see what Accommodation they
could make; if not, to die together. They parted at
this Resolve, for she would permit him no longer to stay
the Street, after such a Sickness; so he went home to
Bed, but not to sleep.</P>
<P>The next Day, at Dinner, <HI>Monsigniore Bellyuard</HI> be∣lieving
his Son absolutely cur'd by Absence of his Pas∣sion;
and speaking of all the News of the Town; a∣mong
the rest, told him, he was come in good time to
Dance at the Wedding of Count <HI>Vernole</HI> with <HI>Atlante,</HI>
the Match being agreed on: <HI>No, Sir,</HI> reply'd <HI>Rinaldo,
I shall never Dance at the Marriage of Count</HI> Vernole
<HI>with</HI> Atlante; <HI>and you will see in Monsieur</HI> De Pais'<HI>s House
a Funeral sooner than a Wedding:</HI> And thereupon, he
told his Father all his Passion, for that lovely Maid;
and assur'd him, if he would not see him laid in his
Grave, he must consent to this Match: <HI>Bellyuard</HI> rose
in a Fury, and told him, <HI>He had rather see him in the
<PB N="35" REF="243"/>
Grave, than in the Arms of</HI> Atlante: <HI>Not,</HI> continued he,
<HI>so much for any dislike I have to the young Lady, or the
Smallness of her Fortune; but, because I have so long warn'd
you from such a Passion, and have with such Care endea∣vour'd
by your Absence to prevent it.</HI> He traverss'd the
Room very fast, still protesting against this Alliance;
and was deaf to all <HI>Rinaldo</HI> could say: On the other
side, the Day being come, wherein <HI>Atlante</HI> was to
give her final Answer to her Father, concerning her
Marriage with Count <HI>Vernole:</HI> She assum'd all the
Courage and Resolution she could to withstand the
Storm, that threaten'd a Denial. And her Father came
to her, and demanding her Answer; she told him, <HI>She
could not be the Wife of</HI> Vernole, <HI>since she was Wife to</HI>
Rinaldo, <HI>only Son to</HI> Bellyuard. If her Father storm'd
before, he grew like a Man distracted at her Confessi∣on;
and <HI>Vernole</HI> hearing them loud, ran to the Cham∣ber,
to learn the Cause; where, just as he entered, he
found <HI>De Pais</HI>'s Sword drawn, and ready to kill his
Daughter, who lay all in Tears at his Feet, he with∣held
his Hand; and asking the Cause of this Rage, he
was told all that <HI>Atlante</HI> had confess'd; which put
<HI>Vernole</HI> quite beside all his Gravity, and made him
discover the Infirmity of Anger; which he us'd to say,
ought to be dissembled by all wise Men: So that <HI>De
Pais</HI> forgot his own to appease his; but 'twas in vain,
for he went out of the House, vowing Revenge on <HI>Ri∣naldo:</HI>
And to that end, being not very well assur'd of
his own Courage, as I said before, and being of the
Opinion, that no Man ought to expose his Life to him,
who has injur'd him: He hir'd <HI>Swiss</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Sol∣diers
to attend him in the Nature of Footmen; and
watch'd several Nights about <HI>Bellyuard</HI>'s Door: And
that of <HI>De Pais,</HI> believing he should sometime or other
see him under the Window of <HI>Atlante,</HI> or perhaps
mounting in it; for now he no longer doubted, but
this happy Lover was he, whom he fancy'd he heard
go from the Balcony that Night, he came up with his
Pistol; and being more a <HI>Spaniard</HI> than a <HI>French</HI> Man
<PB N="36" REF="244"/>
in his Nature, he resolv'd to take him any way un∣guarded
or unarmed, if he came in his way.</P>
<P><HI>Atlante,</HI> who heard his Threatnings, when he went
from her in a Rage, fear'd his Cowardize might put
him on some base Action, to deprive <HI>Rinaldo</HI> of his
Life; and therefore thought it not safe to suffer him
to come to her by Night, as he had before done; but
sent him word in a Note, that he should forbear her
Window, for <HI>Vernole</HI> had sworn his Death: This Note
came unseen by his Father to his Hands; but this could
not hinder him from coming to her Window, which
he did as soon as it was dark, he came thither, only
attended with his Vallet and two Footmen; for now
he cared not who knew the Secret: He had no sooner
made the Sign, but he found himself incompass'd with
<HI>Vernole</HI>'s Bravoes; and himself standing at a distance,
cry'd out, <HI>That he is:</HI> With that, they all drew on both
sides, and <HI>Rinaldo</HI> receiv'd a Wound in the Arm. <HI>At∣lante</HI>
heard this, and ran crying out, <HI>That</HI> Rinaldo,
prest by Numbers, <HI>would be kill'd. De Pais,</HI> who was
reading in his Closet, took his Sword, and ran out;
and contrary to all expectation, seeing <HI>Rinaldo</HI> fight∣ing
with his back to the Door, pull'd him▪ into the
House, and fought himself with the Bravoes. Who
being very much wounded by <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> gave ground
and sheer'd off; and <HI>De Pais</HI> putting up old <HI>Billo</HI> into
the Scabbard, went into his House, where he found
<HI>Rinaldo</HI> almost fainting with loss of Blood, and <HI>Atlante</HI>
with her Maids binding up his Wound; to whom <HI>De
Pais</HI> said, <HI>This Charity</HI> Atlante <HI>very well becomes you, and
is what I can allow you; and I could wish you had no other
Motive for this Action. Rinaldo</HI> by degrees recovered
of his Fainting, and as well as his Weakness would
permit him, he got up and made a low Reverence to
<HI>De Pais;</HI> telling him, <HI>He had now a double Obligation
to pay him all the Respect in the World; first, for his be∣ing
the Father of</HI> Atlante; <HI>and secondly, for being the
Preserver of his Life; two Tyes that should eternally oblige
him to Love and Honour him, as his own Parent:</HI> De Pais
<PB N="37" REF="244"/>
reply'd, <HI>He had done nothing but what common Humani∣ty
compelled him to: But if he would make good that Re∣spect
he profess'd towards him, it must be in quitting all
Hopes of</HI> Atlante, <HI>whom he had destin'd to another, or to
an eternal Inclosure in a Monastery: He had another
Daughter, whom if he would think worthy of his regard,
he should take his Alliance as a very great Honour; but
his Word and Reputation, nay, his Vows were past, to give</HI>
Atlante <HI>to Count</HI> Vernole. <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> who before he spoke,
took measure from <HI>Atlante</HI>'s Eyes; which told him,
her Heart was his; return'd this Answer to <HI>De Pais:
That he was infinitely glad to find by the Generosity of his
Offer, that he had no Aversion to his being his Son-in-Law;
and that next to</HI> Atlante, <HI>the greatest Happiness he
could wish would be, his receiving</HI> Charlot <HI>from his Hands,
but that he could not think of quitting</HI> Atlante, <HI>how ne∣cessary
soever it would be for Glory, and his—(the fur∣ther)
Repose. De Pais</HI> would not let him at this time,
argue the Matter further, seeing he was ill, and had
need of looking after; he therefore begg'd he would
for his Health's sake retire to his own House, whither
he himself conducted him; and left him to the Care of
his Men, who were escap'd the Fray; and return'd to
his own Chamber, he found <HI>Atlante</HI> retir'd, and so he
went to Bed full of Thoughts; this Night had increa∣sed
his Esteem for <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> and lessen'd it for Count
<HI>Vernole;</HI> but his Word and Honour being past, he
could not break it, neither with Safety nor Honour;
for he knew the haughty resenting Nature of the Count,
and he fear'd some Danger might arrive to the brave
<HI>Rinaldo,</HI> which troubled him very much: At last he re∣solv'd,
that neither might take any thing ill at his
Hands, to loose <HI>Atlante,</HI> and send her to the Mona∣stery,
where her Sister was, and compel her to be a
Nun. This he thought would prevent Mischiefs on
both sides; and accordingly, the next day (having in
the Morning sent word to the Lady <HI>Abbess</HI> what he
would have done; he carries <HI>Atlante</HI> under pretence
of visiting her Sister, which they often did) to the Mo∣nastery,
<PB N="38" REF="245"/>
where she was no sooner come, but she was
led into the Inclosure: Her Father he had rather Sa∣crifice
her than she should be the Cause of the
Murther of two such Noble Men as <HI>Vernole</HI> and <HI>Ri∣naldo.</HI></P>
<P>The Noise of <HI>Atlante</HI>'s being inclos'd, was soon spread
all over the busie Town, and <HI>Rinaldo</HI> was not the last
to whom the News arriv'd: He was for a few Days
confin'd to his Chamber; where, when alone, he rav'd
like a Man distracted. But his Wounds had so incen∣sed
his Father against <HI>Atlante,</HI> that he swore he would
see his Son die of them, rather than suffer him to marry
<HI>Atlante;</HI> and was extreamly over-joyed, to find she was
condemned for ever to the Monastery; so that the Son
thought it the wisest Course, and the most for the Ad∣vantage
of his Love, to say nothing to contradict his
Father; but being almost assured <HI>Atlante</HI> would nei∣ther
consent to be shut up in a Cloyster, and abandon
him, he flatter'd himself with hope, that he should steal
her from thence, and marry her in spight of all Oppo∣sition.
This he was impatient to put in Practice: He
believed, if he were not permitted to see <HI>Atlante,</HI> he
had still a kind Advocate in <HI>Charlot,</HI> who was now ar∣riv'd
to her Thirteenth Year, and infinitely advanc'd in
Wit and Beauty. <HI>Rinaldo</HI> therefore often goes to the
Monastery, surrounding it, to see what possibility there
was of accomplishing his Design; if he could get her
Consent, he finds it not impossible, and goes to visit
<HI>Charlot;</HI> who had Command not to see him, or speak
to him. This was a Cruelty he look'd not for, and
which gave him an unspeakable Trouble, and without
her Aid it was wholly impossible to give <HI>Atlante</HI> any
Account of his Design. In this Perplexity he remain'd
many Days, in which he languish'd almost to Death;
he was distracted with Thought, and continually ho∣vering
about the Nunnery-Walls, in hope, at some
time or other, to see or hear from the lovely Maid,
who alone could make his Happiness. In these Tra∣verses
he often met <HI>Vernole,</HI> who had liberty to see her
<PB N="39" REF="245"/>
when he pleas'd: If it happen'd that they chanc'd to
meet in the Day-time, tho' <HI>Vernole</HI> were attended with
an Equipage of Ruffians, and <HI>Rinaldo</HI> but only with a
couple of Footmen, he could perceive <HI>Vernole</HI> shun him,
grow pale, and almost tremble with Fear sometimes,
and get to the other side of the Street; and if he did
not, <HI>Rinaldo</HI> having a mortal hate to him, would often
bear up close to him, that he would jostle him against
the Wall; which <HI>Vernole</HI> would patiently put up, and
pass on; so that he could never be provok'd to fight by
Day-light, how solitary soever the place was where they
met: but if they chanc'd to meet at Night, they were
certain of a Skirmish, in which he would have no part
himself; so that <HI>Rinaldo</HI> was often like to be assassina∣ted,
but still came off with some slight Wound. This
continued so long, and made so great a Noise in the
Town, that the two Old Gentlemen were mightily a∣larm'd
by it; and Count <HI>Bellyuard</HI> came to <HI>De Pays,</HI>
one Day, to discourse with him of this Affair; and
<HI>Bellyuard,</HI> for the Preservation of his Son, as almost
consenting, since there was no Remedy, that he should
marry <HI>Atlante. De Pays</HI> confess'd the Honour he prof∣fer'd
him, and how troubled he was, that his Word
was already past to his Friend, the Count <HI>Vernole,</HI> whom
he said she should marry, or remain for ever a Nun;
but if <HI>Rinaldo</HI> could displace his Love from <HI>Atlante,</HI>
and place it on <HI>Charlot,</HI> she should gladly consent to the
Match. <HI>Bellyuard,</HI> who would now do any thing for
the Repose of his Son, tho' he believ'd this Exchange
would not pass, yet resolv'd to propose it, since by
Marrying him, he took him out of the Danger of <HI>Ver∣nole</HI>'s
Assassinates, who would never leave him, 'till they
had dispatch'd him, should he marry <HI>Atlante.</HI></P>
<P>While <HI>Rinaldo</HI> was contriving a thousand Ways to
come to speak to, or send Billets to <HI>Atlante,</HI> none of
which would succeed without the Aid of <HI>Charlot,</HI> his
Father came and proposed this Agreement between <HI>De
Pays,</HI> and himself, to his Son. At first <HI>Rinaldo</HI> receiv'd
it with chang'd Countenance, and a breaking Heart;
<PB N="40" REF="246"/>
but swiftly turning from Thought to Thought, he con∣ceiv'd
this the only way to come at <HI>Charlot,</HI> and so
consequently at <HI>Atlante;</HI> he therefore, after some dis∣sembled
Regret, consents, with a sad put-on-Look:
And <HI>Charlot</HI> had Notice given her, to see and entertain
<HI>Rinaldo.</HI> As yet they had not told her the Reason;
which her Father would tell her, when he came to vi∣sit
her, he said. <HI>Rinaldo</HI> over-joy'd at this Contrivance,
and his own Dissimulation, goes to the Monastery, vi∣sits
<HI>Charlot;</HI> where he ought to have said something of
this Proposition; but wholly bent upon other Thoughts,
he solicits her to convey some Letters, and Presents to
<HI>Atlante;</HI> which she readily did, to the unspeakable Joy
of the poor Distrest. Sometimes he would talk to
<HI>Charlot</HI> of her own Affairs; asking her, If she resolv'd
to become a Nun? To which she would sigh, and say,
If she must, it would be extreamly against her Inclina∣tions;
and, if it pleased her Father, she had rather be∣gin
the World with any tolerable Match.</P>
<P>Things past thus for some Days, in which our Lo∣vers
were happy, and <HI>Vernole</HI> assured he should have
<HI>Atlante.</HI> But at last <HI>De Pays</HI> came to visit <HI>Charlot,</HI> who
asked her, if she had seen <HI>Rinaldo?</HI> she answered, She
had. <HI>And how does he entertain you?</HI> reply'd <HI>De Pays;
Have you received him as a Husband? and has he behaved
himself like one?</HI> At this a sudden Joy seized the Heart
of <HI>Charlot;</HI> and loth to confess what she had done for
him to her Sister, she hung down her blushing Face, to
study for an Answer. <HI>De Pays</HI> continued, and told her
the Agreement between <HI>Bellyuard</HI> and him, for the sa∣ving
of Bloodshed.</P>
<P>She, who blest the Cause, whatever it was, having
always a great Friendship and Tenderness for <HI>Rinaldo,</HI>
gave her Father a thousand Thanks for his Care; and
assured him, since she was commanded by him, she
would receive him as her Husband.</P>
<P>And the next Day, when <HI>Rinaldo</HI> came to visit her,
as he used to do, and bringing a Letter with him,
wherein he proposed the sight of <HI>Atlante:</HI> He found a
<PB N="41" REF="246"/>
Coldness in <HI>Charlot,</HI> as soon as he told her his Design,
and desired her to carry the Letter. He asked the rea∣son
of this Change▪ She tells him, she was informed of
the Agreement between their two Fathers, and that she
look'd upon herself as his Wife, and would act no
more as a Confident, that she had ever a violent Incli∣nation
of Friendship for him, which she would soon im∣prove
into something more soft.</P>
<P>He could not deny the Agreement, nor his Promise;
but it was in vain to tell her, he did it only to get a
Correspondence with <HI>Atlante:</HI> She is obstinate, and he
as pressing, with all the Tenderness of Perswasion: He
vows he can never be any but <HI>Atlante</HI>'s; and she may
see him die, but never break his Vows. She urges her
Claim in vain, so that at last she was overcome, and
promised she would carry the Letter; which was to
have her make her escape that Night. He waits at the
Grate for her Answer, and <HI>Charlot</HI> returns with one that
pleased him very well; that was, that Night her Si∣ster
would make her escape, and that he must stand in
such a place of the Nunnery-Wall, and she would come
out to him.</P>
<P>After this she upbraids him with his false Promise to
her, and of her Goodness to serve him after such a Dis∣appointment.
He receives her Reproaches with a thou∣sand
Sighs, and bemoans his Misfortune in not being
capable of more than Friendship for her; and vows,
that next <HI>Atlante,</HI> he esteems her of all Womenkind.
She seems to be obliged by this, and assured him, she
would hasten the Flight of <HI>Atlante;</HI> and taking leave,
he went home to order a Coach, and some Servants to
assist him.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Count <HI>Vernole</HI> came to visit <HI>At∣lante;</HI>
but she refused to be seen by him: And all he
could do there that Afternoon, was entertaining <HI>Char∣lot</HI>
at the Grate; to whom he spoke a great many fine
Things, both of her improved Beauty and Wit; and
how happy <HI>Rinaldo</HI> would be in so fair a Bride. She
received this with all the Civility that was due to his
<PB N="42" REF="247"/>
Quality; and their Discourse being at an end, he took
his leave, it being towards the Evening.</P>
<P><HI>Rinaldo,</HI> wholly impatient, came betimes to the Cor∣ner
of the dead Wall, where he was appointed to stand,
having ordered his Footmen and Coach to come to him
as soon as it was dark: While he was there walking
up and down, <HI>Vernole</HI> came by the end of the Wall to
go home, and looking about, he saw at the other end
<HI>Rinaldo</HI> walking, whose Back was towards him; but
he knew him well; and tho' he feared and dreaded his
Bus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness there, he durst not encounter him, they being
both attended but by one Footman a piece. But <HI>Ver∣nole</HI>'s
Jealousie and Indignation was so high, that he
resolv'd to fetch his Bravoes to his Aid, and come and as∣sault
him; for he knew he waited there for some Mes∣sage
from <HI>Atlante.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time it grew dark, and <HI>Rinaldo</HI>'s Coach
came with another Footman; which were hardly arri∣ved,
when <HI>Vernole,</HI> with his assistance, came to the
Corner of the Wall, and screening themselves a little
behind it, near to the place where <HI>Rinaldo</HI> stood, who
waited now close to a little Door, out of which the
Gardeners used to throw the Weeds and Dirt. <HI>Ver∣nole</HI>
could perceive anon, the Door to open, and a Wo∣man
come out of it, calling <HI>Rinaldo</HI> by his Name; who
stept up to her, and caught her in his Arms, with Signs
of infinite Joy. <HI>Vernole</HI> being now all Rage, cried to
his Assassinate, <HI>Fall on, and kill the Ravisher:</HI> And im∣mediately
they all fell on. <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> who had only his
two Footmen on his side, was forced to let go the La∣dy;
who would have run into the Garden again, but
the Door fell too, and lock'd; so that while <HI>Rinaldo</HI>
was fighting, and beaten back by the Bravoes, one of
which he laid dead at his Feet, <HI>Vernole</HI> came up to the
frighted Lady, and taking her by the Hand, cried,
<HI>Come, my fair Fugitive, you must along with me.</HI> She,
wholly scared out of her Senses, was willing to go any
where out of the Terror she heard so near her, and
without Reply, gave herself into his Hand; who car∣ried
<PB N="43" REF="247"/>
her directly to her Father's House; where she was
no sooner come, but he told her Father all that had
past, and how she was running away with <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> but
that his good Fortune brought him just in the lucky Mi∣nute.
Her Father turning to reproach her, found by
the Light of a Candle, that this was <HI>Charlot,</HI> and not
<HI>Atlante,</HI> whom <HI>Vernole</HI> had brought home: At which
<HI>Vernole</HI> was extreamly astonish'd. Her Father deman∣ded
of her, Why she was running away with a Man,
who was designed her by Consent. <HI>Yes,</HI> said <HI>Charlot,
you had his Consent, Sir, and that of his Father; but I
was far from getting it: I found he resolved to die, rather
than quit</HI> Atlante; <HI>And promising him my assistance in
his Amour, since he could never be mine, he got me to carry
a Letter to</HI> Atlante; <HI>which was, to desire her to fly away
with him. Instead of carrying her this Letter, I told her, he
was designed for me, and had cancelled all his Vows to her:
She swooned at this News; and being recovered a little, I
left her in the Hands of the Nuns, to perswade her to
live; which she resolves not to do without</HI> Rinaldo.
<HI>Though they press'd me, yet I resolved to pursue my Design,
which was to tell</HI> Rinaldo, <HI>she would obey his kind Sum∣mons.
He waited for her; but I put myself into his Hands
in lieu of</HI> Atlante; <HI>and had not the Count received me,
we had been married by this time, by some false Light
that could not have discovered me: But I am satisfied, if
I had, he would never have lived with me longer than the
Cheat had been undiscovered; for I find them both resol∣ved
to die, rather than change: And for my part, Sir, I
was not so much in Love with</HI> Rinaldo, <HI>as I was out of
Love with a Nunnery; and took any Opportunity to quit
a Life absolutely contrary to my Humour.</HI> She spoke
this with a Gaiety so brisk, and an Air so agree∣able,
that <HI>Vernole</HI> found it touch'd his Heart; and
the rather, because he found <HI>Atlante</HI> would never be
his; or if she were, he should be still in Danger from
the Resentment of <HI>Rinaldo;</HI> he therefore bowing to
<HI>Charlot,</HI> and taking her by the Hand, cryed, <HI>Madam,
since Fortune has dispos'd you thus luckily for me, in my
<PB N="44" REF="248"/>
Possession, I humbly implore you would consent she should
make me entirely happy, and give me the Prize for which
I fought, and have conquered with my Sword. My Lord,</HI>
replied <HI>Charlot,</HI> with a modest Air, <HI>I am superstitious e∣nough
to believe, that since Fortune, so contrary to all our
Designs, has given me into your Hands, that she from the
beginning dostined me to the Honour; which, with my Fa∣ther's
Consent, I shall receive as becomes me. De Pais</HI> tran∣sported
with Joy, to find all things would be so well
brought about; it being all one to him, whether <HI>Char∣lot</HI>
or <HI>Atlante</HI> gave him Count <HI>Vernole</HI> for his Son-in-Law,
readily consented; and immediately a Priest was
sent for; and they were that Night married. And
it being now not above Seven a Clock, many of their
Friends were invited, the Musick sent for, and as
good a Supper as so short a time would provide, was
made ready.</P>
<P>All this was performed in as short a time as <HI>Rinaldo</HI>
was fighting; and having killed one, and wounded
the rest, they all fled before his conquering Sword;
which was never drawn with so good a Will. When
he came where his Coach stood, just against the Back-Garden-Door,
he looked for his Mistress: But the
Coachman told him, He was no sooner engaged, but a
Man came, and with a thousand Reproaches on her
Levity, bore her off.</P>
<P>This made our young Lover rave; and he is satis∣fied
she is in the Hands of his Rival; and that he had
been fighting, and shedding his Blood, only to secure
her Flight with him. He lost all Patience; and it was
with much ado his Servants perswaded him to return;
telling him, in their Opinion, she was more likely to get
out of the Hands of his Rival, and come to him, than
when she was in the Monastery.</P>
<P>He suffers himself to go into his Coach, and be car∣ry'd
home; but he was no sooner alighted, but he heard
Musick, and a Noise of Festival at <HI>De Pays</HI>'s House.
He saw Coaches surround his Door, and Pages and
Footmen, with Flambeaus. This Sight and Noise of
<PB N="45" REF="248"/>
Joy made him ready to sink at the Door; and sending
his Footman to learn the Cause of this Triumph; the
Pages that waited there, told him, That Count <HI>Ver∣nole</HI>
was, this Night, married to Monsieur <HI>De Pais</HI>'s
Daughter. He needed no more to deprive him of all
Sense; and staggering against his Coach, he was
caught by his Footmen, and carried into his House,
and to his Chamber, where they put him to Bed, all
sensless as he was, and had much ado to recover him
to Life. He asked for his Father, with a faint Voice;
for he desired to see him before he died. It was told
him, he was gone to Count <HI>Vernole</HI>'s Wedding, where
there was a perfect Peace agreed on between them, and
all Animosities laid aside. At this News <HI>Rinaldo</HI> faint∣ed
again; and his Servants called his Father home, and
told him in what Condition they had brought home their
Master, recounting to him all that was past. He ha∣sted
to <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> whom he found just recovered of his
Swooning; who, putting his Hand out to his Father,
all cold, and trembling, cry'd, <HI>Well, Sir, now you are
satisfied, since you have seen</HI> Atlante <HI>married to Count</HI>
Vernole: <HI>I hope now you will give your unfortunate Son
leave to die; as you wish'd he should, rather than give him
to the Arms of</HI> Atlante. Here his Speech failed, and he
fell again into a Fit of Swoooning: His Father ready
to die with Fear of his Son's Death, kneeled down by
his Bed-side; and after having recovered him a little,
he said, <HI>My dear Son, I have been indeed at the Wedding
of Count</HI> Vernole; <HI>but 'tis not to</HI> Atlante, <HI>to whom he is
married, but</HI> Charlot; <HI>who was the Person you were bear∣ing
from the Monastery, instead of</HI> Atlante; <HI>who is still
reserved for you, and is dying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till she hear you are reserved
for her: Therefore, as you regard her Life, make much of
your own, and make your self fit to receive her: For her
Father▪ and I have agreed the Marriage already.</HI> And
without giving him leave to thank him, he called to
one of his Gentlemen, and sent him to the Monastery,
with this News to <HI>Atlante. Rinaldo</HI> bowed himself as
low as he could in his Bed, and kiss'd the Hand of his
<PB N="46" REF="249"/>
Father, with Tears of Joy: But his Weakness conti∣nued
all next Day; and they were fain to bring <HI>At∣lante</HI>
to him, to confirm his Happiness.</P>
<P>It must only be guessed by Lovers, the perfect Joy
these two received in the sight of each other. <HI>Bellyuard</HI>
received her as his Daughter; and the next Day made
her so with very great Solemnity; at which were <HI>Ver∣nole</HI>
and <HI>Charlot:</HI> Between <HI>Rinaldo,</HI> and him, was con∣cluded
a perfect Peace, and all thought themselves
happy in this double Union.</P>

<HEAD>THE
COURT
OF THE
King of Bantam.</HEAD>
<P>THIS <HI>Money,</HI> certainly, is a most
Dev'lish Thing! I'm sure, the want
of it had like to have ruin'd my dear
<HI>Philibella</HI> in her Love to <HI>Valentine
Goodland;</HI> who was, really, a pretty
deserving Gentleman, Heir to about Fifteen-hundred
Pound a Year; which, however did
not so much recommend him, as <HI>the Sweetness of
his Temper, the Comeliness of his Person,</HI> and <HI>the
Excellency of his Parts:</HI> In all which Circum∣stances
my obliging Acquaintance equall'd him,
unless in the advantage of their Fortune. Old
Sir <HI>George Goodland</HI> knew of his Son's Passion
for <HI>Philibella;</HI> and though he was Generous,
and of an Humour sufficiently Complying, yet
he cou'd by no means think it convenient, that
his only Son shou'd marry with a young Lady
of so slender a Fortune as my Friend, who had
not above Five hundred Pound, and that the
Gift of her Uncle Sir <HI>Philip Friendly;</HI> though
her Vertue and Beauty might have deserv'd and
<PB N="4" REF="251"/>
have adorn'd the Throne of an <HI>Alexander</HI> or
<HI>Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Philip</HI> himself, indeed, was but a Younger
Brother, though of a Good Family, and of a
Generous Education; which with his <HI>Person,
Bravery</HI> and <HI>Wit,</HI> recommended him to his
Lady <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> Widow of Sir <HI>Bartholomew
Banquier,</HI> who left her possess'd of Two thou∣sand
Pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> besides Twenty thousand
Pound in Money and Jewels; which oblig'd
him to get himself <HI>Dubb'd,</HI> that she might not
descend to an <HI>inferior</HI> Quality. When he was in
Town, he liv'd—Let me see! in the <HI>Strand;</HI>
or, as near as I can remember, somewhere
about <HI>Charing-Cross;</HI> where, first of all,
Mr. <HI>Wou'd be King,</HI> a Gentleman of a large
Estate in Houses, Land and Money, of a <HI>ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghty,
extravagant</HI> and <HI>profuse Humour,</HI> very fond of
every new Face, had the misfortune to fall pas∣sionately
in love with <HI>Philibella,</HI> who then liv'd
with her Uncle.</P>
<P>This Mr. <HI>Wou'd be</HI> (it seems) had often been
told, when he was yet a Stripling, either by one
of his <HI>Nurses,</HI> by his own <HI>Grand-mother,</HI> or by
some other <HI>Gypsie,</HI> that he shou'd infallibly be
what his Sirname imply'd, <HI>a King,</HI> by <HI>Provi∣dence</HI>
or <HI>Chance,</HI> e're he dy'd, or never. This
glorious <HI>Prophecy</HI> had so great an Influence on
all his Thoughts and Actions, that he distributed
and dispers'd his Wealth sometimes so largely,
that one wou'd ha' thought he had undoubtedly
been King of some part of the <HI>Indies;</HI> to see a
Present made, to day, of a <HI>Diamond-Ring,</HI> worth
Two or Three hundred Pound, to <HI>Madam Flip∣pant;</HI>
tomorrow, a large Chest of the finest <HI>China,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="251"/>
to <HI>my Lady Fleecewell;</HI> and next day (perhaps)
a rich <HI>Necklace of large Oriental Pearl,</HI> with a
<HI>Locquet</HI> to it of <HI>Saphires, Emeralds, Rubies,</HI> &amp;c.
to pretty <HI>Miss. Ogleme,</HI> for an Amorous Glance,
for a Smile, and (it may be, though but rarely)
for the mighty Blessing of one single Kiss.
But such were his Largesses, not to reckon his
Treats, his Balls, and Serenades besides, that
at the same time he had marry'd a Vertuous
Lady, and of Good Quality: but her Relation
to him (it may be fear'd) made her very dis∣agreeable:
For a Man of his Humour and Estate
can no more be satisfy'd with one Woman, than
with one Dish of Meat: And, to say truth, 'tis
something unmodish. However, he might ha'
dy'd a pure Celibate, and altogether unexpert
of Woman, had his good or bad hopes only
terminated in Sir <HI>Philip</HI>'s Niece. But the <HI>Brave</HI>
and <HI>Haughty</HI> Mr. <HI>Wou'd be</HI> was not to be baulk'd
by <HI>Appearances</HI> of Virtue, which he thought all
Womankind did only affect; besides, he pro∣mis'd
himself the Victory over any Lady whom
he attempted, by the force of his damn'd Money,
though her Virtue were never so real and
strict.</P>
<P>With <HI>Philibella</HI> he found another pretty
young Creature, very like her, who had been
a <HI>quondam</HI> Mistress to Sir <HI>Philip:</HI> He, with
young <HI>Goodland,</HI> was then diverting his Mistress
and Niece at a Game of Cards, when <HI>Wou'd be</HI>
came to visit him: he found 'em very merry,
with a Flasque of Claret or two before 'em, and
Oranges roasting by a large Fire, (for it was
<HI>Christmas</HI>-time.) The Lady <HI>Friendly</HI> under∣derstanding
that this Extraordinary Man was
<PB N="6" REF="252"/>
with Sir <HI>Philip</HI> in the Parlour, came in to 'em,
to make the number of both Sexes equal, as
well as in hopes to make up a Purse of Guinea's
toward the purchase of some new fine bus'ness
that she had in her head, from his accustom'd
Design of losing at play to her. Indeed, she
had part of her Wish; for she got Twenty
Guinea's of him; <HI>Philibella,</HI> Ten; and <HI>Lucy,</HI>
Sir <HI>Philip</HI>'s Quondam, Five: Not but that
<HI>Wou'd be</HI> intended better Fortune to the young
ones, than he did to Sir <HI>Philip</HI>'s Lady; but her
Ladyship was utterly unwilling to give him
over to their Management, though at the last.
When they were all tir'd with the Cards, after
<HI>Wou'd be</HI> had said as many obliging things as his
present Genius wou'd give him leave, to <HI>Phili∣bella</HI>
and <HI>Lucy,</HI> especially to the first, not for∣getting
his Baisemains to the Lady <HI>Friendly,</HI> he
bid the Knight and <HI>Goodland</HI> adieu; but with a
Promise of repeating his Visit at six a clok in the
Evening o' <HI>Twelfth-day,</HI> to renew the famous and
ancient Solemnity of <HI>Chusing King and Queen;</HI>
to which Sir <HI>Philip</HI> before invited him, with a
Design yet unknown to you, I hope.</P>
<P>As soon as he was gone, every one made their
Remarks on him, but with very little or no dif∣ference
in all their figures of him. In short,
<HI>all Mankind,</HI> had they ever known him, wou'd
have universally agreed in this his Character,
<HI>That he was an Original;</HI> since nothing in <HI>Hu∣manity</HI>
was ever so <HI>Vain,</HI> so <HI>Haughty,</HI> so <HI>Pro∣fuse,</HI>
so <HI>Fond,</HI> and so <HI>ridiculously Ambitious</HI> as
<HI>Mr. Wou'd be King.</HI> They Laugh'd and Talk'd
about an hour longer, and then young <HI>Goodland</HI>
was oblig'd to see <HI>Lucy</HI> home in his Coach; tho'
<PB N="7" REF="252"/>
he had rather have sate up all Night in the
same House with <HI>Philibella,</HI> I fansie, of whom
he took but an unwilling leave; which was vi∣sible
enough to every one there, since they
were all acquainted with his Passion for my
Fair Friend.</P>
<P>About Twelve a' clock on the Day prefix'd,
young <HI>Goodland</HI> came to Dine with Sir <HI>Philip,</HI>
whom he found just return'd from Court, in a
very good Humour. On the sight of <HI>Valentine,</HI>
the Knight ran to him, and embracing him,
told him, That he had prevented his Wishes,
in coming thither before he sent for him, as he
had just then design'd. T'other return'd, That
he therefore hop'd he might be of some service
to him, by so happy a prevention of his inten∣ded
Kindness. No doubt, (reply'd Sir <HI>Philip,</HI>)
the Kindness, I hope, will be to us both; I am
assur'd it will, if you will act according to my
measures. I desire no better Prescriptions for
my Happiness (return'd <HI>Valentine</HI>) than what
you shall please to set down to me: But is it
necessary or convenient that I shou'd know 'em
first? It is, (answer'd Sir <HI>Philip;</HI>) Let us sit,
and you shall understand 'em.—I am very
sensible (continu'd he) of your sincere and ho∣nourable
Affection and Pretention to my Niece,
who, perhaps, is as dear to me as my own Child
cou'd be, had I one; nor am I ignorant how
averse Sir <HI>George</HI> your Father is to your marriage
with her, insomuch that I am confident he
would dishinherit you immediately upon it,
meerly for want of a Fortune somewhat pro∣portionable
to your Estate; but I have now
contriv'd the means to add Two or Three thou∣sand
<PB N="8" REF="253"/>
Pounds to the Five hundred I design'd to
give with her; I mean, if you marry her, <HI>Val.</HI>
not otherwise; for I will not labour so for any
other Man. What inviolable Obligations you
put upon me! (cry'd <HI>Goodland.</HI>) No Returns
by way of Complements, good <HI>Val.</HI> (said the
Knight:) Had I not engag'd to my Wife, be∣fore
marriage, that I wou'd not dispose of
any part of what she brought me, without her
consent, I wou'd certainly make <HI>Philibella's</HI> For∣tune
answerable to your Estate: And besides,
my Wife is not yet full Eight and twenty, and
we may therefore expect Children of our own,
which hinders me from proposing any thing
more for the advantage of my Niece:—But
now to my Instructions;—<HI>King</HI> will
be here this Evening, without fail, and, at some
time or other to night, will shew the Haughti∣ness
of his Temper to you, I doubt not, since
you are in a manner a Stranger to him: Be sure
therefore you seem to quarrel with him before
you part, but suffer as much as you can first
from his tongue; for I know he will give you
occasions enough to exercise your passive Va∣lour:
I must appear his Friend; and you must
retire home, if you please, for this night, but
let me see you early as your convenience will
permit to morrow: My late Friend <HI>Lucy</HI> must
be my Niece too:—Observe this, and leave
the rest to me. I shall most punctually, and
will in all things be directed by you, (re∣turn'd
<HI>Valentine.</HI>) I had forgot to tell
you (said <HI>Friendly</HI>) that I have so order'd
matters, that He must be <HI>King</HI> to Night, and
<HI>Lucy Queen,</HI> by the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the Cake. By
<PB N="9" REF="253"/>
all means, (return'd <HI>Goodland;</HI>) It must be
<HI>Majesty.</HI></P>
<P>Exactly at Six a' clock came <HI>Wou'd be</HI> in his
Coach and Six, and found Sir <HI>Philip</HI> and his
Lady, <HI>Goodland, Philibella</HI> and <HI>Lucy</HI> ready to
receive him; <HI>Lucy</HI> as Fine as a Dutchess, and
almost as Beautiful as she was before her Fall.
All things were in ample Order for his Enter∣tainment.
They Play'd till Supper was serv'd
in, which was between Eight and Nine. The
Treat was very seasonable and splendid. Just
as the Second Course was set on the Table,
they were all on a sudden surpriz'd, except
<HI>Wou'd be,</HI> with a Flourish of Violins, and other
Instruments, which proceeded to entertain 'em
with the best and newest Airs in the last new
Plays, being then in the Year 1683. The
Ladies were curious to know to whom they
ow'd this chearful part of their Entertainment:
On which he call'd out, Hey! <HI>Tom Farmer!
Aleworth! Eccles! Hall!</HI> and the rest of you!
Here's a Health to these Ladies, and all this
Honourable Company. They Bow'd; He Drank,
and commanded another Glass to be fill'd, into
which he put something yet better than the
<HI>Wine,</HI> I mean, Ten Guinea's: Here, <HI>Farmer,</HI>
(said he then;) This for you and your Friends.
We humbly thank the Honourable Mr. <HI>Wou'd be
King.</HI> They all return'd, and struck up with
more spritelyness than before. For <HI>Gold</HI> and
<HI>Wine,</HI> doubtless, are the best Rosin for Musicians.</P>
<P>After Supper, they took a hearty Glass or
two to the King, Queen, Duke, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And then
the mighty <HI>Cake,</HI> Teeming with the Fate of
this Extraordinary Personage was brought in,
<PB N="10" REF="254"/>
the Musicians playing an <HI>Overture</HI> at the En∣trance
of the <HI>Alimental Oracle;</HI> which was then
Cut and Consulted, and the Royal <HI>Bean</HI> and
<HI>Pea</HI> fell to those to whom Sir <HI>Philip</HI> had de∣sign'd
'em. 'Twas then the Knight began a
merry Bumper, with Three Huzza's, and,
<HI>Long live King Wou'd be!</HI> to <HI>Goodland;</HI> who
Echo'd, and Pledg'd him, putting the Glass
about to the Harmonious Attendants: while
the Ladies drank their own quantities, among
themselves, <HI>To his aforesaid Majesty.</HI> Then of
course, you may believe, <HI>Queen Lucy</HI>'s Health
went merrily round, with the same Ceremony.
After which, he saluted his Royal <HI>Consort,</HI>
and condescended to do the same Honour to
the two other Ladies.</P>
<P>Then they fell a Dancing like Lightning;
I mean, they mov'd as swift, and made <HI>almost</HI>
as little Noise: But His <HI>Majesty</HI> was soon weary
of that; for he long'd to be making Love
both to <HI>Philibella</HI> and <HI>Lucy,</HI> who (believe me)
that Night might well enough have pass'd for
a Queen.</P>
<P>They fell then to <HI>Questions and Commands;</HI>
to <HI>Cross Purposes; I Think a Thought, What is
it like?</HI> &amp;c. In all which, His <HI>Wou'd be Ma∣jesty</HI>
took the opportunity of shewing the Ex∣cellency
of his Parts, as, How Fit he was to
Govern; How Dexterous at Mining and Coun∣termining;
and, How he cou'd Reconcile the
most Contrary and Distant Thoughts. The
Musick, at last, good as it was, grew trouble∣som,
and too loud; which made him dismiss
'em: And then he began to this effect, addres∣sing
himself to <HI>Philibella;</HI> Madam, had Fortune
<PB N="11" REF="254"/>
been Just, and were it possible that the World
shou'd be Govern'd and Influenc'd by Two
Suns, undoubtedly we had all been Subjects to
you, from this Night's Chance, as well as to
that Lady, who, indeed, alone can Equal you
in the Empire of Beauty, which yet you share
with Her <HI>Majesty</HI> here present, who only cou'd
dispute it with you, and is only Superior to you
in <HI>Title.</HI> My Wife is infinitely oblig'd to your
<HI>Majesty,</HI> (interrupted Sir <HI>Philip,</HI>) who, in my
opinion, has greater Charms, and more than
both of 'em together. You ought to <HI>think</HI> so,
Sir <HI>Philip,</HI> (return'd the New Dubb'd <HI>King;</HI>)
However, you shou'd not so liberally have ex∣press'd
your self, in Opposition and Deroga∣tion
to <HI>Majesty:</HI>—Let me tell you, 'tis a
sawcy Boldness that thus has loos'd your Tongue!
—What think you, young Kinsman and
Counsellor? (said he to <HI>Goodland.</HI>) With all
Respect due to your Sacred Title, (return'd
<HI>Valentine,</HI> rising and bowing,) Sir <HI>Philip</HI> spoke as
became a truly affectionate Husband; and it
had been Presumption in him, unpardonable,
to have seem'd to preferr her <HI>Majesty,</HI> or that
other sweet Lady, in his Thoughts, since your
<HI>Majesty</HI> has been pleas'd to say so much and so
particularly of their Merits: 'Twou'd appear
as if he durst lift up his Eyes, with Thoughts,
too near the Heaven you only wou'd enjoy.
And only can <HI>deserve,</HI> you shou'd have added,
(said <HI>King,</HI> no longer <HI>Wou'd be.</HI>) How! May
it please your <HI>Majesty,</HI> (cry'd <HI>Friendly,</HI>) Both
my Nieces! Though you deserve Ten thousand
more, and better, wou'd your <HI>Majesty</HI> enjoy
'em Both? Are they then Both your Nieces?
<PB N="12" REF="255"/>
(ask'd Chance's <HI>King.</HI>) Yes; Both, Sir, (re∣turn'd
the Knight;) Her <HI>Majesty</HI>'s the Eldest,
and in <HI>that</HI> Fortune has shewn some Justice.
So she has, (reply'd the Titular <HI>Monarch;</HI>) My
Lot is fair, (pursu'd he,) though I can be blest
but with One:
<Q><L>Let Majesty with Majesty be join'd,</L>
<L>To 'get and leave a Race of Kings behind.</L></Q>
Come, Madam, (continu'd he, kissing <HI>Lucy:</HI>)
This, as an Earnest of our future Endeavours.
I fear (return'd the pretty <HI>Queen</HI>) your Ma∣jesty
will forget the unhappy <HI>Statira,</HI> when you
return to the Embraces of your Dear and Beau∣tiful
<HI>Roxana.</HI> There is none Beautiful but you,
(reply'd the Titular <HI>King,</HI>) unless this Lady,
to whom I yet cou'd pay my Vows most zea∣lously,
were't not that Fortune thus has pre∣engag'd
me: But, Madam, (continu'd he,) to
shew that still you hold our Royal Favour, and
that, next to our Royal <HI>Consort,</HI> we Esteem you,
we greet you thus, (kissing <HI>Philibella;</HI>) And,
as a Signal of our continued Love, wear this
rich Diamond: (here he put a Diamond-Ring
on her Finger, worth Three hundred Pounds.)
Your <HI>Majesty</HI> (pursu'd he to <HI>Lucy</HI>) may please
to wear this Necklace, with this Locket of
Emeralds. Your <HI>Majesty</HI> is Bounteous as
a God! (said <HI>Valentine.</HI>) Art thou in want,
young Spark? (ask'd the King of <HI>Bantam,</HI>) I'll
give thee an Estate shall make thee merit the
Mistress of thy Vows, be she who she will.
That is, my other Niece, Sir, (cry'd <HI>Friendly.</HI>)
How! How! Presumptuous Youth! How are
<PB N="13" REF="255"/>
thy Eyes and Thoughts exalted? Ha! To
Bliss your <HI>Majesty</HI> must never hope for, (re∣ply'd
<HI>Goodland.</HI>) How now, thou Creature
of the basest Mold! Not hope for what thou
dost aspire to! <HI>Mock-King,</HI> thou canst not,
dar'st not, shall not hope it, (return'd <HI>Valen∣tine,</HI>
in a Heat.) Hold, <HI>Val.</HI> (cry'd Sir <HI>Philip,</HI>)
you grow warm; forget your Duty to Their <HI>Ma∣jesties,</HI>
and abuse your Friends, by making us
suspected. Good-night, Dear <HI>Philibella,</HI> and
my <HI>Queen!</HI> Madam, I am your Ladyship's
Servant, (said <HI>Goodland:</HI>) Farewell, Sir <HI>Philip,</HI>
Adieu, thou <HI>Pageant!</HI> thou <HI>Property-King!</HI>
I shall see thy Brother on the Stage, e're long;
but first I'll visit <HI>Thee;</HI> and in the mean time,
by way of return to thy proffer'd Estate, I
will add a real Territory to the rest of thy
empty Titles; for, from thy Education, Bar∣barous
manner of Conversation, and Com∣plexion,
I think, I may justly proclaim thee,
<HI>King of Bantam:</HI>—So, <HI>Hail, King that
Wou'd be! Hail, thou King of Christmas! All
Hail, Wou'd be King of Bantam!</HI>—And so
he left 'em.—They all seem'd amaz'd,
and gaz'd on one another, without speaking a
syllable; till Sir <HI>Philip</HI> broke the Charm, and
sigh'd out, Oh, the monstrous effects of Pas∣sion!
Say rather, Oh, the foolish effects of a
mean Education! (interrupted his <HI>Majesty of
Bantam;</HI>) For Passions were given us for Use,
Reason to govern and direct us in the Use, and
Education to cultivate and refine that Reason:
But (pursu'd he) for all his Impudence to me,
which I shall take a time to correct, I am oblig'd
to him, that at last he has found me out a King∣dom
<PB N="14" REF="256"/>
to my Title; and if I were Monarch of
that Place, (Believe me, Ladies,) I wou'd make
you all Princesses and Dutchesses; and Thou,
my old Companion, <HI>Friendly!</HI> should'st Rule
the Roast with me: But these Ladies shou'd be
with us there; where we would erect Temples
and Altars to 'em: Build Golden Palaces of
Love, and Castles—In the Air (interrup∣ted
her Majesty <HI>Lucy</HI> the First, smiling.) 'Gad
take me, (cry'd King <HI>Woud be,</HI>) thou dear
Part'ner of my Greatness, and shalt be, of all
my Pleasures! thy pretty satyrical Observation
has oblig'd me beyond Imitation. I think your
Majesty is got into a vein of Rhiming to night,
(said <HI>Philadelphia.</HI>) Ay! Pox o' that young
insipid Fop, we cou'd else have been as Great as
an Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> and as Witty as <HI>Horace</HI>
in his Wine; but let him go, like a pragmati∣cal,
captious, giddy Fool as he is! I shall take
a time to see him. Nay, Sir, (said <HI>Philibella,</HI>)
he has promis'd your Majesty a Visit, in our
hearing: Come, Sir, I beg your Majesty to
pledge me this Glass to your Long and Happy
Reign; laying aside all thoughts of ungovern'd
Youth: Besides, this Discourse must needs be
ungreatful to her Majesty, to whom, I fear, he
will be marry'd within this Month. How!
(cry'd <HI>King and no King,</HI>) Marry'd to my <HI>Queen!</HI>
I must not, cannot suffer it! Pray restrain
your self a little, Sir, (said Sir <HI>Philip,</HI>) and
when once these Ladies have left us, I will
discourse your Majesty further about this
Business. Well, Pray, Sir <HI>Philip,</HI> (said his
Lady,) let not your Worship be pleas'd to sit
up too long for his Majesty: About Five o'clock
<PB N="15" REF="256"/>
I shall expect you: 'Tis your old Hour. And
yours, Madam, to wake, to receive me coming
to Bed:—Your Ladyship understands me,
(return'd <HI>Friendly.</HI>) You're merry, my Love,
you're merry, (cry'd <HI>Philadelphia:</HI>) Come,
Niece, to Bed! to Bed! Ay, (said the Knight,)
Go both of you and sleep together, if you can,
without the thoughts of a Lover, or a Husband.
His Majesty was pleas'd to wish 'em a good
Repose; and so, with a Kiss, they parted for
that time.</P>
<P>Now we're alone, (said Sir <HI>Philip,</HI>) let me
assure you, Sir, I resent this Affront done
to you by Mr. <HI>Goodland,</HI> almost as highly as
you can; and though I can't wish that you
shou'd take such Satisfaction as, perhaps, some
other hotter Sparks wou'd; yet let me say, his
Miscarriage ought not to go unpunish'd in him.
Fear not, (reply'd t'other,) I shall give him a
sharp Lesson. No, Sir, (return'd <HI>Friendly,</HI>)
I wou'd not have you think of a Bloody Re∣venge;
for 'tis that which, possibly, he designs
on you: I know him Brave as any Man: How∣ever,
were it convenient that the Sword shou'd
determine betwixt you, you shou'd not want
mine: The Affront is partly to me, since done
in my House: But I've already laid down safer
measures for us, though of more fatal conse∣quence
to him; that is, I've form'd 'em in my
Thoughts: Dismiss your Coach and Equi∣page,
all but one Servant, and I will discourse
it to you at large: 'Tis now past Twelve;
and, if you please, I wou'd invite you to take
up as easie a Lodging here, as my House will
afford. (Accordingly they were dismiss'd, and
<PB N="16" REF="257"/>
he proceeded:)—As I hinted to you before, he
is in love with my youngest Niece, <HI>Philibella;</HI> but
her Fortune not exceeding Five hundred Pound,
his Father will assuredly disinherit him, if he
marries her; though he has given his Consent
that he shou'd marry her Eldest Sister, whose
Father dying e're he knew his Wife was with
Child of the Youngest, left <HI>Lucy</HI> Three thou∣sand
Pounds, being as much as he thought con∣venient
to match her handsomly; and accor∣dingly,
the Nuptials of Young <HI>Goodland</HI> and
<HI>Lucy</HI> are to be celebrated next <HI>Easter.</HI> They
shall not, if I can hinder 'em, (interrupted his
offended <HI>Majesty.</HI>) Never endeavour the ob∣struction,
(said the Knight,) for I'll shew you
the way to a dearer Vengeance: <HI>Women</HI> are
<HI>Women,</HI> your Majesty knows; she may be won
to your Embraces before that time, and then
you antedate him, <HI>your Creature.</HI> A Cuckold,
you mean, (cry'd <HI>King in Fansie;</HI>) O Exquisite
Revenge! But can you consent that I shou'd at∣tempt
it? What is't to me? we live not in
<HI>Spain,</HI> where all the Male Relations of the Fa∣mily
are oblig'd to vindicate a Whore; No, I
wou'd wound him in his most Tender Part.
But how shall we compass it? (ask'd t'other.)
Why thus; Throw away Three thousand
Pounds on the Youngest Sister, as a Portion,
to make her as happy as she can be in her new
Lover Sir <HI>Frederick Flygold,</HI> an Extravagant
young Fop, and wholly given over to Gaming;
so, ten to one, but you may retrieve your Mo∣ney
of him, and have the two Sisters at your
devotion. Oh, Thou my better Genius than
that which was given to me by Heav'n at my
<PB N="17" REF="257"/>
birth! What Thanks, what Praises shall I re∣turn
and sing to Thee, for this! (cry'd King
<HI>Conundrum.</HI>) No Thanks, no Praises, I be∣seech
your Majesty; since in this I gratifie my
selfe—You think I am your Friend? And,
you will agree to this? (said <HI>Friendly,</HI> by way
of Question.) Most readily, (return'd the <HI>Fop-King;</HI>)
Wou'd it were broad-Day, that I
might send for the Money to my Bankers; for
in all my Life, in all my Frolicks, Encounters
and Extravagancies, I never had one so grate∣ful
and pleasant as this will be, if you are in
earnest, to gratifie both my Love and Re∣venge!
That I am in earnest, you will not
doubt, when you see with what Application
I shall pursue my Design: In the mean time,
<HI>My Duty to your Majesty; To our good Success
in this Affair.</HI> While he drank, t'other re∣turn'd,
<HI>With all my Heart;</HI> and pledg'd him.
Then <HI>Friendly</HI> began afresh;—Leave the whole
Management of this to me; only one thing more
I think necessary, that you make a Present of
Five hundred Guinea's to Her Majesty, the
Bride that must be. By all means, (return'd the
wealthy <HI>King of Bantam;</HI>) I had so design'd
before. Well, Sir, (said Sir <HI>Philip,</HI>) what
think you of a Sett Party or two at <HI>Piquet,</HI> to
pass away some few hours, till we can sleep?
A seasonable and welcome Proposition, (re∣turn'd
that <HI>King;</HI>) but I won't play above
Twenty Guinea's the Game, and Forty the
Lurch. Agreed, (said <HI>Friendly;</HI>) First call
in your Servant; mine is here already. The
Slave came in, and they began, with unequal
fortune at first; for the <HI>Knight</HI> had lost an Hun∣dred
<PB N="18" REF="258"/>
Guinea's to <HI>Majesty;</HI> which he paid in
<HI>Specie;</HI> and then propos'd Fifty Guinea's the
Game, and an Hundred the Lurch. To which
t'other consented; and without winning more
than three Games, and those not together,
made shift to get Three thousand two hundred
Guinea's in debt to Sir <HI>Philip:</HI> For which <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI>
was pleas'd to give him Bond, whether
<HI>Friendly</HI> wou'd or no, <HI>Seal'd and Deliver'd in
the Presence of</HI>
<Q><L>The Mark of (W.) Will. Watchful,</L>
<L>And, [S.] Sim. Slyboots.</L></Q>
A Couple of delicate Beagles, their mighty At∣tendants.</P>
<P>It was then about the hour that Sir <HI>Philip</HI>'s
(and, it may be, other Ladies) began to Yawn
and Stretch; when the Spirits Refresh'd, Troul'd
about and Tickl'd the Blood with Desires of
Action; which made <HI>Majesty</HI> and <HI>Worship</HI> think
of a Retreat to Bed; where, in less than Half
an hour, or, before ever he could say his
Prayers, I'm sure, the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell fast asleep:
but the last, perhaps, paid his accustom'd De∣votion,
e're he began his Progress to the <HI>Shadow
of Death:</HI> However, he wak'd earlier than
his <HI>Cully-Majesty,</HI> and got up to receive young
<HI>Goodland,</HI> who came to his Word, with the
first Opportunity. Sir <HI>Philip</HI> receiv'd him
with more than usual Joy, though not with
greater Kindness, and let him know every Syl∣lable
and Accident that had pass'd between 'em
till they went to bed: which you may believe
was not a little pleasantly surprising to <HI>Valen∣tine,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="258"/>
who began then to have some Assurance of
his Happiness with <HI>Philibella.</HI> His Friend told
him, that he must now be reconcil'd to his
<HI>Mock-Majesty,</HI> though with some difficulty;
and so taking one hearty Glass a piece▪ he left
<HI>Valentine</HI> in the Parlour, to carry the ungrate∣ful
News of his Visit to him that Morning.
<HI>King</HI>—was in an odd sort of Taking, when he
heard that <HI>Valentine</HI> was Below; and had been,
as Sir <HI>Philip</HI> inform'd <HI>Majesty,</HI> at <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Pa∣lace,
to enquire for him there: but when he
told him, that he had already school'd him,
on his own behalf, for the Affront done in his
House, and that he believ'd he cou'd bring
his Majesty off without any loss of present Ho∣nour,
his Countenance visibly discover'd his
past Fear, and present Satisfaction; which was
much encreas'd too, when <HI>Friendly,</HI> shewing
him his Bond for the Money he won of him at
Play, let him know, that if he paid Three
thousand Guinea's to <HI>Philibella,</HI> he wou'd im∣mediately
deliver him up his Bond, and not
expect the Two hundred Guinea's Over-plus.
His <HI>Majesty of Bantam</HI> was then in so good an
humour, that he cou'd have made love to
Sir <HI>Philip;</HI> nay, I believe he cou'd a kiss'd <HI>Va∣lentine,</HI>
instead of seeming angry. Down they
came, and saluted like Gentlemen: But after
the Greeting was over, <HI>Goodland</HI> began to talk
something of <HI>Affront, Satisfaction, Honour,</HI> &amp;c.
when immediately <HI>Friendly</HI> interpos'd, and after
a little seeming Uneasiness and Reluctancy, re∣concil'd
the Hot and Cholerick Youth to the
Cold Phlegmatick King.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="259"/>
Peace was no sooner proclaim'd, than the
<HI>King of Bantan</HI> took his Rival and late Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gonist
with him in his own Coach, not ex∣cluding
Sir <HI>Philip</HI> by any means, to <HI>Locket</HI>'s;
where they Din'd: Thence he wou'd have 'em
to Court with him, where he met the Lady
<HI>Flippant,</HI> the Lady <HI>Harpy,</HI> the Lady <HI>Crocodile,</HI>
Madam <HI>Tattlemore,</HI> Miss <HI>Medler,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Gingerly</HI>
a rich Grocer's Wife, and some others, besides
Knights and Gentlemen of as good humours as
the Ladies; all whom he invited to a Ball at his
own House, the Night following; his own
Lady being then in the Countrey. Madam <HI>Tat∣tlemore,</HI>
I think, was the first he spoke to in
Court, and whom first he surpriz'd with the
happy News of his Advancement to the Title
of <HI>King of Bantam.</HI> How wondrous hasty was
she to be gone, as soon as she heard it! 'Twas
not in her Power, because not in her Nature,
to stay long enough to take a civil Leave of the
Company, but away she flew, big with the
Empty Title of a Fantastick <HI>King,</HI> proclaiming
it to every one of her Acquaintance, as she
pass'd through every Room, till she came to
the <HI>Presence-Chamber,</HI> where she only <HI>whisper</HI>'d
it; but her Whispers made above half the Ho∣nourable
Company quit the Presence of the
<HI>King of Great Britain,</HI> to go make their Court
to His <HI>Majesty of Bantam;</HI> some cry'd, <HI>God
Bless Your Majesty!</HI> some, <HI>Long live the King
of Bantam!</HI> others, <HI>All Hail to Your Sacred Ma∣jesty!</HI>
In short, he was Congratulated on all
sides. Indeed, I don't hear that <HI>His Majesty,
King Charles the Second</HI> ever sent any Embas∣sador
to Complement him; though, possibly,
<PB N="21" REF="259"/>
He saluted him by his Title, the first time he
saw him afterwards: For, you know, <HI>He is
a wonderful Good-natur'd and a Well-bred Gen∣tleman.</HI></P>
<P>After he thought the Court of <HI>England</HI> was
universally acquainted with his <HI>mighty Honour,</HI>
he was pleas'd to think fit to retire to his own
more private Palace, with Sir <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Good∣land,</HI>
whom he Entertain'd that night very hand∣somly,
till about Seven a clock; when they went
together to the <HI>Play,</HI> which was, that Night,
<HI>A King and No King.</HI> His Attendant-Friends
cou'd not forbear smiling, to think how aptly
the Title of the <HI>Play</HI> suited his Circumstances.
Nor cou'd he chuse but take notice of it be∣hind
the Scenes, between Jest and Earnest; tel∣ling
the Players how kind <HI>Fortune</HI> had been
the Night past, in disposing the <HI>Bean</HI> to him;
and justifying what one of her Prophetesses
had foretold, some Years since: I shall now no
more regard (said he) that old Doating Fellow
<HI>Pythagoras</HI>'s Saying, <HI>Abstineto à Fabis;</HI> That is,
(added he, by way of Construction,) <HI>Abstain
from Beans:</HI> For, I find the Excellency of 'em
in Cakes and Dishes: From the first, they in∣spire
the Soul with mighty Thoughts; and from
the last, our Bodies receive a strong and whol∣som
Nourishment. That is, (said a Wag
among those sharp Youths, I think 'twas my
Friend the <HI>Count;</HI>) These Puff you up in
<HI>Mind,</HI> Sir; Those, in <HI>Body.</HI> They had some
further Discourse among the Nymphs of the
Stage, e're they went into the Pit; where
Sir <HI>Philip</HI> spread the News of his Friend's Ac∣cession
to the <HI>Title,</HI> tho' not yet to the <HI>Throne</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="260"/>
of <HI>Bantam;</HI> upon which he was there again
Complemented on that Occasion. Several of
the Ladies and Gentlemen who saluted him,
he invited to the next Night's Ball at his
Palace.</P>
<P>The Play done, they took each of 'em a
Bottle at the <HI>Rose,</HI> and parted till Seven the
Night following: which came not sooner than
desired; for he had taken such care, that all
things were in readiness before Eight, only he
was to expect the Musick, till the end of the
Play. About Nine, Sir <HI>Philip,</HI> his Lady, <HI>Good∣land,
Philibella</HI> and <HI>Lucy</HI> came. Sir <HI>Philip</HI> re∣turn'd
him <HI>Rabelais,</HI> which he had borrow'd of
him, wherein the Knight had written, in an
old odd sort of Character, this <HI>Prophecy</HI> of his
own making; with which he surpriz'd the <HI>Ma∣jesty
of Bantam,</HI> who vow'd he had never taken
notice of 'em before; but he said, he perceiv'd
they had been long written, by the Character;
and here it follows, as near as I can remember:
<Q><L>When M. D. C. come L before,</L>
<L>Three XXX<SUP>s</SUP>. two II<SUP>s</SUP>. &amp; one I more;</L>
<L>Then, <HI>KING,</HI> tho' <HI>now</HI> but <HI>Name</HI> to thee,</L>
<L>Shall both thy <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Title</HI> be.</L></Q>
They had hardly made an end of reading 'em,
e're the whole Company, and more than he
had invited, came in, and were receiv'd with
a great deal of Formality and Magnificence
<HI>Lucy</HI> was there attended as his <HI>Queen;</HI> and
<HI>Philibella,</HI> as the <HI>Princess</HI> her Sister. They
Danc'd then till they were weary; and after∣wards
<PB N="23" REF="260"/>
retir'd to another large Room, where
they found the Tables spread and furnish'd with
all the most seasonable Cold Meats; which was
succeeded by the choicest Fruits and the richest
Disert of Sweet-meats that Luxury cou'd think
on, or, at least, that this Town cou'd afford.
The Wines were all most excellent in their
kind; and their Spirits flew about through
every corner of the House: There was scarce
a Spark sober in the whole Company, with
drinking repeated Glasses to the Health of the
<HI>King of Bantam</HI> and his <HI>Royal Consort,</HI> with the
Princess <HI>Philibella</HI>'s, who sate together under a
Royal Canopy of State, his <HI>Majesty</HI> between the
two Beautiful Sisters: only <HI>Friendly</HI> and <HI>Goodland</HI>
wisely manag'd that Part of the Engagement
where they were concern'd, and preserv'd them∣selves
from the Heat of the Debauch.</P>
<P>Between Three and Four most of 'em began
to draw off, laden with Fruit and Sweet-meats,
and rich <HI>Favours</HI> compos'd of Yellow, Green,
Red and White, the <HI>Colours of his New Majesty
of Bantam.</HI> Before Five they were left to them∣selves;
when the Lady <HI>Friendly</HI> was discompos'd,
for want of Sleep, and her <HI>usual Cordial;</HI> which
oblig'd Sir <HI>Philip</HI> to wait on her home, with
his two Nieces: But his <HI>Majesty</HI> wou'd by no
means part with <HI>Goodland;</HI> whom, before Nine
that Morning, he made as Drunk as a Lord,
and by consequence one of his <HI>Peers;</HI> for <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI>
was then, indeed, as Great as an Empe∣ror:
He fancy'd himself <HI>Alexander,</HI> and young
<HI>Valentine</HI> his <HI>Hephaestion;</HI> and did so <HI>Be-buss</HI> him,
that the young Gentleman fear'd he was faln
into the hands of an <HI>Italian.</HI> However, by the
<PB N="24" REF="261"/>
kind Persuasions of his Condescending and Dis∣sembling
<HI>Majesty,</HI> he ventur'd to go into Bed
with him; where <HI>King Wou'd be</HI> fell asleep,
<HI>hand-over-head;</HI> and not long after, <HI>Goodland,</HI>
his new made <HI>Peer,</HI> follow'd him to the cool
Retreats of <HI>Morpheus.</HI></P>
<P>About Three the next afternoon they both
Wak'd, as by consent, and call'd to Dress.
And after that bus'ness was over, I think, they
swallow'd each of 'em a Pint of <HI>Old-Hook,</HI> with
a little Sugar, by the way of Healing. Their
Coaches were got ready in the mean time; but
the <HI>Peer</HI> was forc'd to accept of the Honour of
being carry'd in his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s to Sir <HI>Philip</HI>'s;
whom they found just risen from Dinner, with
<HI>Philadelphia</HI> and his two Nieces. They sate down,
and ask'd for something to relish a Glass of
Wine; and Sir <HI>Philip</HI> order'd a cold Chine to
be set before 'em; of which they eat about an
Ounce a-piece: but they drank more by the
half, I dare say.</P>
<P>After their little Repast, <HI>Friendly</HI> call'd the
<HI>Wou'd be-Monarch</HI> aside, and told him, that he
wou'd have him go the <HI>Play</HI> that Night, which
was, <HI>The London Cuckolds;</HI> promising to meet
him there in less than Half an Hour after his
departure; telling him withal, that he wou'd
surprize him with a much better Entertainment
than the Stage afforded. <HI>Majesty</HI> took the
Hint, imagining, and that rightly, that the <HI>Knight</HI>
had some Intrigue in his head, for the Promo∣tion
of the Commonwealth of Cuckoldom: in
order therefore to his Advice, he took his leave,
about a Quarter of an Hour after.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="261"/>
When he was gone, Sir <HI>Philip</HI> thus bespoke
his pretended Niece; Madam, I hope your
<HI>Majesty</HI> will not refuse me the Honour of wait∣ing
on you to a Place where you will meet with
better Entertainment than your <HI>Majesty</HI> can ex∣pect
from the best Comedy in Christendom.
<HI>Val.</HI> (continu'd he,) you must go with us, to
secure me against the Jealousie of my Wife.
That, indeed, (return'd his <HI>Lady</HI>) is very ma∣terial;
and you are mightily concern'd not to
give me occasion, I must own. You see I am
now, (reply'd he:) But—Come! on with
Hoods and Scarf! (pursu'd he, to <HI>Lucy.</HI>) Then
addressing himself again to his Lady; Madam,
(said he,) we'll wait on you in less time than
I cou'd have drank a Bottle to my share. (The
Coach was got ready, and on they drove to the
<HI>Play-house.</HI>) By the way, said <HI>Friendly</HI> to <HI>Val.</HI>—Your
Honour, Noble <HI>Peer,</HI> must be set
down at <HI>Long</HI>'s; for only <HI>Lucy</HI> and I must be
seen to his <HI>Majesty of Bantam:</HI> And now, I
doubt not, you understand what you must
trust to.—To be robb'd of her <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI>'s
Company, I warrant, (return'd t'other)
for these long three Hours. Why, (cry'd
<HI>Lucy,</HI>) you don't mean, I hope, to leave me
with his <HI>Majesty of Bantam?</HI> 'Tis for thy
Good, Child! 'Tis for thy Good! (return'd
<HI>Friendly.</HI>) To the <HI>Rose</HI> they got then; where
<HI>Goodland</HI> lighted, and expected Sir <HI>Philip;</HI> who
led <HI>Lucy</HI> into the King's Box, to his <HI>New Ma∣jesty;</HI>
where, after the first Scene, he left 'em
together. The over-joy'd Fantastick <HI>Monarch</HI>
wou'd fain have said some fine obliging things to
the Knight, as he was going out; but <HI>Friendly</HI>'s
<PB N="26" REF="262"/>
haste prevented 'em, who went directly to
<HI>Valentine,</HI> took one Glass, call'd a Reck'ning,
mounted Chariot, and away home they came:
where, I believe, he was welcome to his Lady;
for I never heard any thing to the contrary.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his <HI>Majesty</HI> had not the pa∣tience
to stay out half the Play, at which he was
saluted by above twenty Gentlemen and Ladies
by his New and Mighty Title: but out he led
Miss <HI>Majesty,</HI> e're the Third Act was half done;
pretetending, that it was so Damn'd Bawdy
a Play, that he knew her Modesty had been
already but too much offended at it; so into
his Coach he got her. When they were seated,
she told him she wou'd go to no place with him,
but to the Lodgings her Mother had taken for
her, when she first came to Town, and which
still she kept. Your Mother! Madam, (cry'd
he;) Why, is Sir <HI>Philip</HI>'s Sister living then?
His Brother's Widow is, Sir, (she reply'd.)
Is she there? (he ask'd.) No, Sir, (she re∣turn'd;)
she's in the Countrey. Oh, then
we'll go thither to chuse. The Coach-man
was then order'd to drive to <HI>Germin's-street;</HI>
where, when he came into the Lodgings, he
found 'em very rich and modishly furnish'd.
He presently call'd one of his Slaves, and whis∣per'd
him to get three or four pretty Dishes
for Supper; and then getting a Pen, Ink and
Paper, writ a Note to <HI>C</HI>—<HI>d</HI> the Goldsmith,
within <HI>Temple-Barr,</HI> for Five hundred Guinea's;
which <HI>Watchwell</HI> brought him in little more
than an Hour's time, when they were just in
the height of Supper; <HI>Lucy</HI> having invited her
Landlady, for the better colour of the matter.
<PB N="27" REF="262"/>
His <HI>Bantamite Majesty</HI> took the Gold from his
Slave, and threw it by him in the Window,
that <HI>Lucy</HI> might take notice of it; (which, you
may assure your self she did, and after Supper,
wink'd on the goodly Matron of the House to
retire; which she immediately obey'd.) Then
his <HI>Majesty</HI> began his Court very earnestly and
hotly, throwing the naked Guinea's into her
Lap: which she seem'd to refuse, with much
Disdain; but, upon his repeated Promises,
confirm'd by unheard of Oaths and Impreca∣tions,
that he wou'd give her Sister Three thou∣sand
Guinea's to her Portion, she began by de∣grees
to mollifie, and let the Gold lie quietly
in her Lap: And the next night, after he had
drawn Notes on two or three of his Bankers,
for the Payment of Three thousand Guinea's
to Sir <HI>Philip,</HI> or Order, and receiv'd his own
Bond, made for what he had lost at Play, from
<HI>Friendly,</HI> she made no great difficulty to admit
his <HI>Majesty</HI> to her Bed. Where I think fit to
leave 'em for the present; for (perhaps) they
had some private Bus'ness.</P>
<P>The next Morning, before the <HI>Titular King</HI>
was (I won't say, <HI>up,</HI> or <HI>stirring,</HI> but) our
o' bed, young <HI>Goodland</HI> and <HI>Philibella</HI> were pri∣vately
marry'd; the Bills being all Accepted
and Paid in Two Days time. As soon as ever
the <HI>Phantastick Monarch</HI> cou'd find in his heart
to divorce himself from the dear and charming
Embraces of his Beautiful Bedfellow, he came
flying to Sir <HI>Philip,</HI> with all the haste that Ima∣gination
Big with Pleasure cou'd inspire him
with, to discharge it self to a suppos'd Friend.
The Knight told him, that he was really much
<PB N="28" REF="263"/>
troubl'd, to find that his Niece had yielded so
soon and easily to him; however, he wish'd
him Joy. To which t'other return'd, That
he cou'd never want it, whilst he had the Com∣mand
of so much Beauty, and that without the
ungrateful Obligations of Matrimony, which
certainly are the most Nauseous, Hateful, Per∣nicious
and Destructive of Love imaginable.
Think you so, Sir? (ask'd the <HI>Knight;</HI>) We
shall hear what a Friend of mine will say on
such an occasion, to morrow about this time:
but I beseech your Majesty to conceal your Sen∣timents
of it to him, lest you make him as
uneasie as you seem to be in that circumstance.
Be assur'd I will, (return'd t'other;) But when
shall I see the Sweet, the Dear, the Blooming,
the Charming <HI>Philibella?</HI> She will be with us
at Dinner. Where's her Majesty? (ask'd Sir
<HI>Philip.</HI>) Had you enquir'd before, she had
been here; for, Look, she comes. <HI>Friendly</HI>
seem'd to regard her with a kind of Displeasure,
and whisper'd <HI>Majesty,</HI> that he shou'd express
no particular Symptoms of Familiarity with
<HI>Lucy</HI> in his House, at any time, especially when
<HI>Goodland</HI> was there, as then he was above with
his Lady and <HI>Philibella,</HI> who came down pre∣sently
after to Dinner.</P>
<P>About Four a clock, as his Majesty had in∣trigu'd
with her, <HI>Lucy</HI> took a Hackney-Coach
and went to her Lodgings; whither, about an
hour after, he follow'd her. Next Morning,
at Nine, he came to <HI>Friendly</HI>'s, who carry'd him
up to see his new marry'd Friends—But
(O Damnation to Thought!) what Torments
did he feel, when he saw young Goodland and
<PB N="29" REF="263"/>
<HI>Philibella</HI> in bed together; the last of which
return'd him humble and hearty Thanks for
her Portion and Husband, as the first did for
his Wife. He shook his Head at Sir <HI>Philip,</HI>
and without speaking one word, left 'em and
hurry'd to <HI>Lucy,</HI> to lament the ill treatment
he had met with from <HI>Friendly.</HI> They <HI>Coo'd</HI>
and <HI>Bill'd</HI> as long as <HI>He</HI> was able; she (Sweet
Hypocrite) seeming to 'moan his Misfortunes:
which he took so kindly, that when he left her,
which was about Three in the Afternoon, he
caus'd a Scrivener to draw up an Instrument,
wherein he settl'd a Hundred Pounds a Year
on <HI>Lucy,</HI> for her Life, and gave her an Hundred
Guinea's more against her Lying-in: (For she
told him (and indeed 'twas true) that she was
with Child, and knew her self to be so, from
a very good Reason—) And indeed she
was so—by the <HI>Friendly</HI> Knight. When he
return'd to her, he threw the Obliging Instru∣ment
into her Lap; (it seems, he had a par∣ticular
Kindness for that Place—) then call'd
for Wine, and something to eat; for he had
not drank a Pint to his share all the day, (tho'
he had ply'd it at the <HI>Chocolate-house</HI>—) The
Landlady, who was invited to Sup with 'em,
bid 'em Good-night, about Eleven; when they
went to bed, and, <HI>partly, slept</HI> till about Six;
when they were entertain'd by some Gentlemen
of their Acquaintance, who Play'd and Sung
very finely, by way of <HI>Epithalamium,</HI> these words
and more:
<Q><L>Joy to Great <HI>Bantam!</HI></L>
<L>Live long Love and Wanton!</L>
<L>And thy Royal Consort!</L>
<L>For, Both are of one sort, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<PB N="30" REF="264"/>
The rest I have forgot. He took some offence
at the Words; but more at the Visit that
Sir <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Goodland</HI> made him, about an
hour after, who found him in Bed with his
<HI>Royal Consort,</HI> and after having wish'd 'em Joy,
and thrown their <HI>Majesties</HI> own Shooes and
Stockings at their Heads, retreated. This gave
<HI>Monarch in Fansie</HI> so great a Caution, that he
took his <HI>Royal Consort</HI> into the Countrey, (but
above Forty Miles off the Place where his own
Lady was,) where, in less than Eight Months,
she was Deliver'd of a <HI>Princely Babe,</HI> who
was Christen'd by the Heathenish Name of
<HI>Hayoumorecake Bantam;</HI> while her <HI>Majesty</HI>
Lay-in like a <HI>petty Queen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE
NUN:
OR, THE
Perjur'd Beauty.</HEAD>
<P>DOn <HI>Henrique</HI> was a Person of Great
Birth, of a Great Estate, of Bra∣very
equal to either, of a most Ge∣nerous
Education; but of more
Passion than Reason: He was be∣sides
of an Opener and Freer Temper than ge∣nerally
his Countrey-men are; I mean, the
<HI>Spaniards;</HI> always engag'd in some Love-Intrigue
or other.</P>
<P>One Night, as he was retreating from one
of those Engagements, Don <HI>Sebastian,</HI> whose
Sister he had abus'd with a Promise of Marriage,
set upon him at the Corner of a Street, in
<HI>Madrid,</HI> and by the help of three of his Friends,
design'd to have dispatcht him on a doubtful
Embassy to the Almighty Monarch: But he re∣ceiv'd
their first Instructions with better Ad∣dress
than they expected, and dismiss'd <HI>his</HI>
Envoy first, killing one of Don <HI>Sebastian</HI>'s Friends.
<PB N="4" REF="266"/>
Which so enrag'd the Injur'd Brother, that his
Strength and Resolution seem'd to be re∣doubl'd,
and so animated his two surviving
Companions, that (doubtless) they had gain'd
a dishonourable Victory, had not Don <HI>Antonio</HI>
accidentally come in to his Rescue; who, after
a very short Dispute, kill'd one of the two who
attack'd him only; whilst Don <HI>Henrique</HI> with
the greatest difficulty defended his Life, for
some moments, against <HI>Sebastian,</HI> whose Rage
depriv'd him of Strength, and gave his Adver∣sary
the unwish'd Advantage of his seeming
Death, though not without bequeathing some
Bloody Legacies to Don <HI>Henrique. Antonio</HI> had
receiv'd but one slight Wound in the Left Arm,
and his surviving Antagonist none; who, how∣ever
thought it not adviseable to begin a fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h
Dispute against two, of whose Courage he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d
but too fatal a Proof, though one of 'em <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
sufficiently disabl'd. The Conquerors, on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e
other side, politickly Retreated, and quitting
the Field to the Conquer'd, left the Living to
bury the Dead, if he <HI>cou'd,</HI> or thought con∣venient.</P>
<P>As they were marching off, Don <HI>Antonio,</HI>
who all this while knew not whose Life he had
so happily preserv'd, told his Companion in
Arms, that he thought it indispensably necessary
that he should quarter with him that Night,
for his further Preservation. To which he
prudently consented, and went, with no little
uneasiness, to his Lodgings; where he surpriz'd
<HI>Antonio</HI> with the sight of his Dearest Friend.
For they had certainly the nearest Sympathy
in all their Thoughts, that ever made two
<PB N="5" REF="266"/>
Brave Men unhappy! And, undoubtedly, no∣thing
but <HI>Death,</HI> or <HI>more Fatal Love,</HI> cou'd
have divided 'em. However, at present, they
were united and secure:</P>
<P>In the mean time, Don <HI>Sebastian</HI>'s Friend was
just going to call help to carry off the Bodies,
as the—came by; who seeing three
Men lie dead, seiz'd the fourth; who, as he
was about to justifie himself, by discovering one
of the Authors of so much Bloodshed, was in∣terrupted
by a Groan from his suppos'd dead
Friend Don <HI>Sebastian;</HI> whom, after a brief ac∣count
of some part of the matter, and the
knowledge of his Quality, they took up, and
carry'd to his House; where, within a few
days, he was recover'd past the fear of Death.
All this while, <HI>Henrique</HI> and <HI>Antonio</HI> durst not
appear, so much as by Night; nor cou'd be
found, though diligent and daily search was
made after the first: but upon Don <HI>Sebastian</HI>'s
Recovery, the Search ceasing, they took the
advantage of the Night, and, in Disguize, re∣treated
to <HI>Sevil.</HI> 'Twas there they thought
themselves most secure, where indeed they
were in the greatest danger; for tho' (hap'ly)
they might there have escap'd the murtherous
Attempt of Don <HI>Sebastian</HI> and his Friends, yet
they cou'd not there avoid the malicious In∣fluence
of their Stars.</P>
<P>This City gave Birth to <HI>Antonio,</HI> and to the
cause of his greatest Misfortunes, as well as of
his Death. Donna <HI>Ardelia</HI> was born there, a
Miracle of Beauty and Falshood. 'Twas more
than a Year since Don <HI>Antonio</HI> had first <HI>seen</HI> and
<HI>lov'd</HI> her. (For 'twas impossible any Man
<PB N="6" REF="267"/>
shou'd do one without t'other.) He had had
the unkind opportunity of speaking and con∣veying
a Billette to her at Church; and to his
greater misfortune, the next time he found her
there, he met with too kind a return both
from her Eyes, and from her Hand, which
privately slipt a Paper into his; in which he
found abundantly more than he expected, di∣recting
him in that, how he shou'd proceed,
in order to carry her off from her Father with
the least danger he cou'd look for in such an
Attempt; since it wou'd have been vain and
fruitless to have ask'd her of her Father, because
their Families had been at enmity for several
Years; though <HI>Antonio</HI> was as well descended
as she, and had as ample a Fortune; nor was
his Person, according to his Sex, any way in∣ferior
to her's; and certainly, the Beauties of
his Mind were more excellent, especially if it be
an Excellence to be Constant.</P>
<P>He had made several Attempts to take posses∣sion
of her, but all prov'd ineffectual; however,
he had the good fortune not to be known, tho'
once or twice he narrowly 'scap'd with Life,
bearing off his Wounds with difficulty.—(Alas,
that the Wounds of <HI>Love</HI> shou'd cause
those of <HI>Hate!</HI>) Upon which she was strictly
confin'd to one Room, whose only Window
was towards the Garden, and that too was
Grated with Iron; and, once a Month, when
she went to Church, she was constantly and
carefully attended by her Father, and a Mother-in-Law,
worse than a <HI>Duegna.</HI> Under this
miserable Confinement <HI>Antonio</HI> understood she
still continu'd, at his return to <HI>Sevil</HI> with Don
<PB N="7" REF="267"/>
<HI>Henrique,</HI> whom he acquainted with his invin∣cible
Passion for her; lamenting the severity of
her present circumstances, that admitted of no
prospect of relief: which caus'd a generous
Concern in Don <HI>Henrique,</HI> both for the Suffer∣ings
of his Friend, and of the Lady: He pro∣pos'd
several ways to Don <HI>Antonio,</HI> for the Re∣lease
of the Fair Prisoner; but none of 'em was
thought practicable, or, at least, likely to suc∣ceed.
But <HI>Antonio,</HI> who (you may believe)
was then more nearly engag'd, bethought him∣self
of an Expedient that wou'd undoubtedly
reward their Endeavours. 'Twas, That Don
<HI>Henrique,</HI> who was very well acquainted with
<HI>Ardelia's</HI> Father, shou'd make him a Visit, with
pretence of begging his Consent and Admission
to make his Addresses to his Daughter; which,
in all probability, he cou'd not refuse to
Don <HI>Henrique</HI>'s Quality and Estate: And then
this freedom of access to her wou'd give him
the opportunity of delivering the Lady to his
Friend. This was thought so reasonable, that
the very next day it was put in practice; and
with so good success, that Don <HI>Henrique</HI> was
receiv'd by the Father of <HI>Ardelia</HI> with the
greatest and most respectful Ceremony imagi∣nable:
And when he made the Proposal to
him of Marrying his Daughter, it was embrac'd
with a visible Satisfaction and Joy in the Air of
his Face. This their first Conversation ended
with all imaginable Content on both Sides;
Don <HI>Henrique</HI> being invited by the Father to
Dinner, the next day, when Donna <HI>Ardelia</HI>
was to be present; who, at that time, was
said to be indispos'd, (as 'tis very probable she
<PB N="8" REF="268"/>
was, with so close an Imprisonment.) <HI>Henrique</HI>
return'd to <HI>Antonio,</HI> and made him happy with
the Account of his Reception; which cou'd not
but have terminated in the perfect Felicity of
<HI>Antonio,</HI> had his Fate been just to the Merits of
his Love. The Day and Hour came which
brought <HI>Henrique</HI> with a private Commission
from his Friend to <HI>Ardelia.</HI> He <HI>saw</HI> her;—(Ah!
wou'd he had only seen her Veil'd!)
and, with the first opportunity, gave her the
Letter, which held so much Love and so much
Truth, as ought to have preserv'd him in the
Empire of her Heart. It contain'd, besides, a
Discovery of his whole Design upon her Fa∣ther,
for the compleating of their Happiness;
which nothing then cou'd obstruct but her self.
But <HI>Henrique</HI> had <HI>seen</HI> her; he had <HI>gaz'd</HI> and
swallow'd all her Beauties at his Eyes. How
greedily his Soul drank the strong Poyson in!
But yet his Honour and his Friendship were
strong as ever, and bravely fought against the
Usurper <HI>Love,</HI> and got a noble Victory, at least
he thought and wish'd so. With this, and a
short Answer to his Letter, <HI>Henrique</HI> return'd
to the Longing <HI>Antonio;</HI> who receiving the
Paper with the greatest Devotion, and kissing
it with the greatest Zeal, open'd and read these
words to himself:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Don ANTONIO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOu have, at last made use of the best
and only Expedient for my Enlarge∣ment;
for which I thank you, since I know
it is purely the Effect of your Love. Your
<PB N="9" REF="268"/>
Agent has a mighty Influence on my Father:
And you may assure your self, that as you
have Advis'd and Desir'd me, he shall have
no less on me, till I am</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your's entirely,
And only Your's,
ARDELIA.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Having respectfully and tenderly kiss'd the
Name, he cou'd not chuse but shew the <HI>Billette</HI>
to his Friend; who reading that part of it
which concern'd himself, started and blush'd:
Which <HI>Antonio</HI> observing, was curious to know
the cause of it. <HI>Henrique</HI> told him, That he
was surpriz'd to find her express so little
Love, after so long an Absence. To which
his Friend reply'd, for her, That, doubtless,
she had not Time enough to attempt so great a
Matter as a perfect Account of her Love; and
added, That it was Confirmation enough to
him of its continuance, since she Subscrib'd
her self His <HI>entirely,</HI> and <HI>only</HI> His.—How
Blind is Love! Don <HI>Henrique</HI> knew how to
make it bear another meaning; which, how∣ever,
he had the Discretion to conceal. <HI>An∣tonio,</HI>
who was as Real in his Friendship, as Con∣stant
in his Love, ask'd him what he thought
of her Beauty? To which t'other answer'd,
That he thought it irresistible to any, but to
a Soul prepossess'd and nobly fortify'd with a
perfect Friendship:—Such as is Thine, my
<PB N="10" REF="269"/>
<HI>Henrique,</HI> (added <HI>Antonio;</HI>) yet as sincere
and perfect as <HI>that</HI> is, I know you <HI>must,</HI> nay,
I know you <HI>do</HI> Love her. As I ought, I do,
(reply'd <HI>Henrique.</HI>) Yes, Yes, (return'd his
Friend,) it must be so; otherwise the Sym∣pathy
which unites our Souls wou'd be want∣ing,
and consequently our Friendship were not
in a state of Perfection. How industriously
you wou'd argue me into a Crime that wou'd
tear and destroy the very Foundation of the
strongest Ties of Truth and Honour! (said
<HI>Henrique.</HI>) But (he continu'd) I hope, within
a few Days, to put it out of my power to
be guilty of so great a <HI>Sacrilege.</HI> I can't de∣termine,
(said <HI>Antonio,</HI>) if I knew that you
Lov'd one another, whether I cou'd easier
part with my Friend, or my Mistress. Tho'
what you say, is highly Generous, (reply'd
<HI>Henrique,</HI>) yet give me leave to urge, that
it looks like a Trial of your Friend, and
argues you inclinable to Jealousie: But, Par∣don
me, I know it to be sincerely meant by
<HI>you;</HI> and must therefore own, that 'tis the
Best, because 'tis the Noblest way of securing
both your Friend and Mistress. I need make
use of no Arts to secure me of either, (re∣ply'd
<HI>Antonio;</HI>) but expect to enjoy 'em both
in a little time.</P>
<P><HI>Henrique,</HI> who was a little uneasie with a
Discourse of this nature, diverted it, by re∣flecting
on what had pass'd at <HI>Madrid,</HI> between
them two and Don <HI>Sebastian</HI> and his Friends;
which caus'd <HI>Antonio</HI> to bethink himself of the
Danger to which he expos'd his Friend, by
appearing daily, tho' in Disguise: For, doubt∣less,
<PB N="11" REF="269"/>
Don <HI>Sebastian</HI> wou'd pursue his Revenge
to the utmost Extremity. These Thoughts put
him upon desiring his Friend, for his own sake,
to hasten the performance of his Attempt; and
accordingly, each day Don <HI>Henrique</HI> brought
<HI>Antonio</HI> the nearer hopes of Happiness, while
he himself was hourly sinking into the lowest
state of Misery. The last Night before the
Day in which <HI>Antonio</HI> expected to be bless'd in
her Love, Don <HI>Henrique</HI> had a long and fatal
Conference with her, about his Liberty. Being
then with her alone in an Arbour of the Garden,
which Privilege he had had for some days: After
a long silence, and observing Don <HI>Henrique</HI> in
much disorder, by the Motion of his Eyes,
which were sometimes stedfastly fix'd on the
Ground, then lifted up to her or Heaven, (for
he cou'd see nothing more Beautiful on Earth,)
she made use of the Privilege of her Sex, and
began the Discourse first, to this effect;—Has
any thing happen'd, Sir, since our retreat hi∣ther,
to occasion that Disorder which is but
too visible in your Face, and too dreadful in
your hitherto continu'd silence? Speak, I
beseech you, Sir, and let me know if I have
any way unhappily contributed to it! No,
Madam, (reply'd he;) my Friendship is now
likely to be the only cause of my greatest Mi∣sery;
for to morrow I must be guilty of an
unpardonable Crime, in betraying the gene∣rous
Confidence which your noble Father has
plac'd in me: To morrow (added he, with a
pitious Sigh) I must deliver you into the Hands
of one whom your Father hates even to death,
instead of doing my self the Honour of be∣coming
<PB N="12" REF="270"/>
his Son-in-Law within a few Days
more:—But—I will consider and re∣mind
my self, that I give you into the hands of
my Friend; of my Friend, that Loves you bet∣ter
than his Life which he has often expos'd
for your sake; and what is more than All, to
my Friend, whom you Love more than any
Consideration on Earth.—And <HI>must</HI> this be
done? (she ask'd.) Is it inevitable as Fate?—Fix'd
as the Laws of Nature, Madam, (reply'd
he;) Don't you find the Necessity of it, <HI>Ar∣delia?</HI>
(continu'd he, by way of Question:)
Does not your Love require it? Think! you
are going to your Dear <HI>Antonio,</HI> who alone can
merit you, and whom only you can love.
Were your last words true, (return'd she,) I
shou'd yet be unhappy in the Displeasure of a
Dear and Tender Father, and infinitely more,
in being the cause of your Infidelity to him:
No, Don <HI>Henrique,</HI> (continu'd she;) I cou'd
with greater Satisfaction return to my miserable
Confinement, than by any means disturb the
Peace of your Mind, or occasion one moment's
interruption of your Quiet.—Wou'd
to Heaven you did not, (sigh'd he to himself.)
Then addressing his words more distinctly to
her, cry'd he, Ah, Cruel! Ah, Unjust <HI>Ar∣delia!</HI>
These Words belong to none but <HI>An∣tonio;</HI>
why then wou'd you endeavour to per∣suade
me, that I <HI>do,</HI> or ever <HI>can</HI> merit the Ten∣derness
of such an Expression:—Have a
care! (pursu'd he,) Have a care, <HI>Ardelia!</HI>
your <HI>outward</HI> Beauties are too powerful to be
resisted; even your <HI>Frowns</HI> have such a sweet∣ness,
that it attracts the very Soul that is not
<PB N="13" REF="270"/>
strongly prepossess'd with the noblest Friend∣ship,
and the highest Principles of Honour:
Why then, alas! did you add such Sweet and
Charming Accents? Why—Ah, Don
<HI>Henrique!</HI> (she interrupted,) why did you ap∣pear
to me so Charming in your Person, so
great in your Friendship, and so Illustrious in
your Reputation? Why did my Father, e'er
since your first Visit, continually fill my Ears
and Thoughts with Noble Characters and
Glorious Idea's, which yet but imperfectly and
faintly represent the Inimitable Original!—But—(what
is most severe and cruel) why,
Don <HI>Henrique,</HI> why will you defeat my Father
in his Ambition of your Alliance! and me of
those glorious Hopes with which you had
bless'd my Soul, by casting me away from you
to <HI>Antonio!</HI>—Ha! (cry'd he, starting,)
What said you, Madam! What did <HI>Ardelia</HI>
say! That I had bless'd your Soul with Hopes!
That I wou'd <HI>cast you away to Antonio!</HI>—Can
they who safely arrive in their wish'd for
Port, be said to be Shipwrack'd! Or, Can an
Abject, Indigent Wretch make a King?—These
are more than Riddles, Madam; and I
must not think to Expound 'em. No, (said
she;) Let it alone, Don <HI>Henrique;</HI> I'll ease
you of that trouble, and tell you plainly that
<HI>I Love you.</HI> Ah! (cry'd he,) now all my
Fears are come upon me!—How! (ask'd
she,) Were you <HI>afraid</HI> I shou'd Love you? Is
my Love so dreadful then? Yes, when mis∣plac'd,
(reply'd he;) but 'twas your <HI>Falshood</HI>
that I fear'd: Your Love were what I wou'd
have sought, with utmost hazard of my Life;
<PB N="14" REF="271"/>
nay, even of my Future Happiness, I fear, had
you not been Engag'd; strongly oblig'd to Love
else where, both by your own Choice and Vows,
as well as by his dangerous Services, and match∣less
Constancy. For which (said she) I do
not <HI>Hate</HI> him; though his Father kill'd my
Uncle: Nay, perhaps (continu'd she) I have
a Friendship for him, but no more. No <HI>more!</HI>
said you, Madam? (cry'd he;)—But tell me,
Did you never Love him? Indeed, I did,
(reply'd she;) but the Sight of You, has better
instructed me, both in my Duty to my Father,
and in causing my Passion for you, without
whom I shall be eternally miserable: Ah, then!
pursue your honourable Proposal, and make
my Father happy in my Marriage! It must
not be, (return'd Don <HI>Henrique;</HI>) my <HI>Honour,</HI>
my <HI>Friendship</HI> forbids it. No, (she return'd,)
your Honour requires it; and if your Friend∣ship
opposes your Honour, it can have no sure
nor solid Foundation. <HI>Female Sophistry!</HI> (cry'd
<HI>Henrique;</HI>) But you need no Art nor Artifice,
<HI>Ardelia,</HI> to make me Love you: <HI>Love you!</HI>
(pursu'd he;) By that bright <HI>Sun,</HI> the Light
and Heat of all the World, <HI>You</HI> are my only
Light and Heat.—Oh, <HI>Friendship! Sacred
Friendship,</HI> now assist me!—[Here for
a time he paus'd, and then afresh proceeded,]
thus,—You told me, or my Ears deceiv'd
me, that you Lov'd me, <HI>Ardelia.</HI> I did, (she
reply'd;) and that I do Love you, is as true
as that I told you so. 'Tis well;—But wou'd
it were not so! Did ever Man receive a Bles∣sing
<HI>thus!</HI>—Why, I cou'd wish I did not
Love <HI>you, Ardelia!</HI> But that were impossible—
<PB N="15" REF="271"/>
At least, <HI>unjust,</HI> (interrupted she.) Well then,
(he went on) to shew you that I do sincerely
consult your particular Happiness, without any
regard to my own, to morrow I will give you
to Don <HI>Antonio;</HI> and as a Proof of your Love
to me, I expect your ready Consent to it. To
let you see, Don <HI>Henrique,</HI> how perfectly and
tenderly I Love you, I will be sacrific'd to
morrow to Don <HI>Antonio,</HI> and to your Quiet.
Oh, Strangest, Dearest Obligation! (cry'd
<HI>Henrique;</HI>) To morrow then, as I have told
your Father, I am to bring you to see the
Dearest Friend I have on Earth, who dare not
appear within this City for some unhappy Rea∣sons,
and therefore cannot be present at our
Nuptials; for which cause, I cou'd not but
think it my Duty to one so nearly related to
my Soul, to make him happy in the Sight of
my Beautiful Choice, e're yet she be my Bride.
I hope (said she) my Loving Obedience may
merit your Compassion; and that at last, e're
the Fire is lighted that must consume the Of∣fering,
I mean, the Marriage-Tapers, (alluding
to the old <HI>Roman</HI> Ceremony) that <HI>you,</HI> or some
other pitying Angel, will snatch me from the
Altar. Ah, No more, <HI>Ardelia!</HI> Say no more!
(cry'd he;) we must be <HI>Cruel,</HI> to be Just to
our selves. [Here their Discourse ended, and
they walk'd into the House, where they sound
the Good Old Gentleman and his Lady, with
whom he stay'd till about an Hour after Supper,
when he return'd to his Friend with joyful News,
but a sorrowful Heart.]</P>
<P><HI>Antonio</HI> was all Rapture with the Thoughts
of the approaching Day; which though it
<PB N="16" REF="272"/>
brought Don <HI>Henrique</HI> and his Dear <HI>Ardelia</HI> to
him, about Five a clock in the Evening, yet at
the same time brought his last and greatest Mis∣fortune.
He saw her then at a She-Relations of
his, about three Miles from <HI>Sevil,</HI> which was
the Place assign'd for their fatal Interview. He
<HI>saw</HI> her, I say; but, Ah! how strange, how
alter'd from the Dear, Kind <HI>Ardelia</HI> she was
when last he left her! 'Tis true, he flew to
her with Arms expanded, and with so swift
and eager a motion, that she cou'd not avoid
nor get loose from his Embrace, till he had
<HI>kiss'd,</HI> and <HI>sigh'd,</HI> and <HI>dropt some Tears,</HI> which
all the strength of his Mind cou'd not restrain;
whether they were the effects of Joy, or whe∣ther
(which rather may be fear'd) they were
the Heat-drops which preceded and threaten'd
the Thunder and Tempest that shou'd fall on
his Head, I cannot positively say; yet all this
she was then <HI>forc'd</HI> to endure, e're she had li∣berty
to speak, or, indeed, to <HI>breathe.</HI> But
as soon as she had freed her self from the Lo∣ving
Circle that shou'd have been the dear and
lov'd Confinement or Centre of a Faithful Heart,
she began to dart whole showers of Tortures
on him from her Eyes; which that Mouth that
he had but just before so tenderly and sacredly
kiss'd, seconded with whole volleys of Deaths
cramm'd in every Sentence, pointed with the
keenest Affliction that ever pierc'd a Soul!
<HI>Antonio,</HI> (she began) you have treated me now,
as if you were never like to see me more; and
wou'd to Heav'n you were not!—Ha!
(cry'd he, starting, and staring wildly on her;)
What said you, Madam? What said you, <HI>my
<PB N="17" REF="272"/>
Ardelia?</HI> If you like the Repetition, Take it!
(reply'd she, unmov'd,) <HI>Wou'd to Heav'n you
were ne'er like to see me more!</HI> Good! Very
Good! (cry'd he, with a Sigh that threw him
trembling into a Chair behind him, and gave
her the opportunity of proceeding thus,)—Yet,
<HI>Antonio,</HI> I must not have my Wish; I must
continue with you, not out of Choice, but by
Command, by the strictest and severest Obli∣gation
that ever bound Humanity; Don <HI>Hen∣rique,</HI>
your Friend, Commands it; Don <HI>Hen∣rique,</HI>
the Dearest Object of my Soul, Enjoins
it; Don <HI>Henrique,</HI> whose only Aversion I am,
will have it so. Oh, Do not wrong me,
Madam! (cry'd Don <HI>Henrique.</HI>) Lead me,
Lead me a little more by the Light of your
Discourse, I beseech you, (said Don <HI>Antonio,</HI>)
that I may see your Meaning! for hitherto 'tis
Darkness all to me. Attend therefore with
your best Faculties, (pursu'd <HI>Ardelia</HI>) and know,
That I do most sincerely and most passionately
Love Don <HI>Henrique;</HI> and as a Proof of my
Love to him, I have this Day consented to be
deliver'd up to you by Him; not for your sake
in the least, <HI>Antonio,</HI> but purely to sacrifice all
the Quiet of my Life to his Satisfaction. And
now, Sir, (continu'd she, addressing her self
to Don <HI>Henrique,</HI>) Now, Sir, if you can be so
cruel; execute your own most dreaded Decree,
and join our Hands, though our Hearts ne'er
can meet. All this to Try me! It's too much,
<HI>Ardelia,</HI>—(said <HI>Antonio:</HI>) And then turning
to Don <HI>Henrique,</HI> he went on, Speak <HI>Thou!</HI> if
yet thou'rt not Apostate to our Friendship!
Yet Speak, however! Speak, though the Devil
<PB N="18" REF="273"/>
has been Tampering with Thee too! Thou
art a <HI>Man,</HI> a <HI>Man of Honour</HI> once. And
when I forfeit my just Title to <HI>that,</HI> (inter∣rupted
Don <HI>Henrique,</HI> may I be made most mi∣serable!
—May I lose the Blessings of thy
Friendship!—May I lose <HI>Thee!</HI>—Say
on then, <HI>Henrique!</HI> (cry'd <HI>Antonio;</HI>) And
I charge thee, by all the Sacred Tyes of Friend∣ship,
say, Is this a Trial of me? Is't Elusion,
Sport? or shameful, murtherous Truth?—O!
my Soul burns within me, and I can bear
no longer!—Tell! Speak! Say on!—[Here,
with folded Arms, and Eyes fix'd sted∣fastly
on <HI>Henrique,</HI> he stood like a Statue,
without motion; unless sometimes, when his
swelling Heart rais'd his o'er-charg'd Breast.]
After a little Pause, and a hearty Sigh or two,
<HI>Henrique</HI> began;—Oh, <HI>Antonio!</HI> O my
Friend! prepare thy self to hear yet more
dreadful Accents!—I am (pursu'd he)
unhappily the Greatest and most Innocent Cri∣minal
that e'er, till now, offended:—I
Love her, <HI>Antonio,</HI>—I Love <HI>Ardelia,</HI> with
a Passion strong and violent as Thine!—Oh,
summon all that us'd to be more than Man
about thee, to suffer to the end of my Dis∣course,
which nothing but a Resolution like
Thine can bear! I know it by my self.—Though
there be Wounds, Horror and Death
in each Syllable, (interrupted <HI>Antonio,</HI>) yet
prithee, <HI>now,</HI> go on, but with all haste. I will,
(return'd Don <HI>Henrique,</HI>) though I feel, my own
Words have the same cruel effects on me. I say
again, my <HI>Soul</HI> Loves <HI>Ardelia.</HI> And how can it
be otherwise? Have we not Both the self-same
<PB N="19" REF="273"/>
Appetites? the same Disgusts? How then cou'd
I avoid my Destiny, that has decreed that I
shou'd Love and Hate just as you do? Oh,
hard Necessity! that oblig'd you to use Me, in
the Recovery of this Lady! Alas, Can you
think that any Man of Sense or Passion cou'd
have seen, and not have Lov'd her! Then
how shou'd I, whose Thoughts are Unisons to
Yours, evade those Charms that had prevail'd
on you?—And now, to let you know 'tis
no Elusion, no Sport, but serious and amazing
woful Truth, <HI>Ardelia</HI> best can tell you whom
she Loves. What I've already said, is true,
by Heav'n, (cry'd she;) 'Tis you, Don <HI>Hen∣rique,</HI>
whom I only Love, and who alone can
give me Happiness: Ah, wou'd you wou'd!
—With you, <HI>Antonio,</HI> I must remain Un∣happy,
Wretched, Curs'd: Thou art my Hell;
Don <HI>Henrique</HI> is my Heaven. And Thou art
mine, (return'd he,) which here I part with to
my Dearest Friend. Then taking her Hand;
Pardon me, <HI>Antonio,</HI> (pursu'd he) that I thus take
my last Farewell of all the Tasts of Bliss from
your <HI>Ardelia,</HI> at this moment. [At which words
he kiss'd her Hand, and gave it to Don <HI>An∣tonio;</HI>
who receiv'd it, and gently press'd it
close to his Heart, as if he wou'd have her feel
the Disorders she had caus'd there.] Be Happy,
<HI>Antonio,</HI> (cry'd <HI>Henrique;</HI>) Be very Tender
of her; To morrow early I shall hope to see
thee.—<HI>Ardelia,</HI> (pursu'd he,) all Hap∣piness
and Joy surround Thee! May'st thou
ne'er want those Blessings thou canst give <HI>An∣tonio!</HI>
—Farewell to Both! (added he,
going out.) Ay, (cry'd she,) Farewell to all
<PB N="20" REF="274"/>
Joys, Blessings, Happiness, if you forsake me
—Yet do not go!—Ah, Cruel! (con∣tinu'd
she, seeing him quit the Room;) But
you shall take my Soul with you. Here she
swooned away in Don <HI>Antonio</HI>'s Arms; who,
though he was happy that he had her fast there,
yet was oblig'd to call in his Cousin, and <HI>Ar∣delia</HI>'s
Attendants, e're she cou'd be perfectly
recover'd. In the mean while, Don <HI>Henrique</HI>
had not the power to go out of sight of the
House, but wander'd to and fro about it, di∣stracted
in his Soul, and not being able longer
to refrain her sight, her last Words still re∣sounding
in her Ears, he came again into the
Room where he left her with Don <HI>Antonio,</HI> just
as she reviv'd and call'd upon him, exclaiming
on his Cruelty, in leaving her so soon. But
when, turning her Eyes towards the Door, she
saw him; Oh! with what eager haste she flew
to him! then clasp'd him round the Wast,
obliging him, with all the tender Expressions
that the Soul of a Lover, and a Woman's too,
is capable of uttering, not to leave her in the
possession of Don <HI>Antonio.</HI> This so amaz'd her
slighted Lover, that he knew not, at first, how
to proceed in this Tormenting Scene; but at
last, summoning all his wonted Resolution,
and Strength of Mind, he told her, He wou'd
put her out of his power, if she wou'd consent
to retreat for some few hours to a Nunnery that
was not above half a Mile distant thence, till
he had discours'd his Friend, Don <HI>Henrique,</HI>
something more particularly than hitherto,
about this Matter. To which she readily
agreed, upon the Promise that Don <HI>Henrique</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="274"/>
made her, of seeing her with the first oppor∣tunity.
They waited on her then to the Con∣vent,
where she was kindly and respectfully
receiv'd by the Lady Abbess; but it was not long
before that her Grief renewing with greater
violence, and more afflicting circumstances,
had oblig'd 'em to stay with her till it was al∣most
dark, when they once more begg'd the
liberty of an hour's absence; and the better to
palliate their Design, <HI>Henrique</HI> told her, that
he wou'd make use of her Father Don <HI>Richardo</HI>'s
Coach, in which they came to Don <HI>Antonio</HI>'s,
for so small a time: Which they did, leaving
only <HI>Eleanora</HI> her Attendant with her, without
whom she had been at a loss, among so many
Fair Strangers; Strangers, I mean, to her un∣happy
Circumstances: whilst they were carry'd
near a Mile farther, where, just as 'twas dark,
they 'lighted from the Coach, Don <HI>Henrique</HI>
ordering the Servants not to stir thence till
their return from their private Walk, which
was about a Furlong, in a Field that belong'd
to the Convent. Here Don <HI>Antonio</HI> told Don
<HI>Henrique,</HI> That he had not acted Honourably;
That he had Betray'd him and Robb'd him at
once both of a Friend and Mistress. To which
t'other return'd, That he understood his mean∣ing,
when he propos'd a <HI>particular Discourse</HI>
about this Affair, which he now perceiv'd must
end in Blood: But you may remind your self
(continu'd he) that I have kept my Promise,
in delivering her to you. Yes, (cry'd <HI>An∣tonio</HI>)
after you had practis'd foully and basely
with her. By Heavens! not at all, (return'd
<HI>Henrique;</HI>) It was her Choice, or Fate, that
<PB N="22" REF="275"/>
brought this mischief on her; for I urg'd the
Shame and Scandal of Inconstancy, but all in
vain, to her. But don't you Love her, <HI>Hen∣rique?</HI>
(t'other ask'd.) Too well; and can∣not
live without her, though I fear I may feel
the cursed Effects of the same Inconstancy:
However, I had quitted her All to you, but
you see how she resents it. And you shall see,
Sir, (cry'd <HI>Antonio,</HI> drawing his Sword in a
Rage) how I resent it. Here, without more
Words, they fell to Action, to Bloody Action.
(Ah! how wretched is our Sex, in being the un∣happy
Occasion of so many fatal Mischiefs ev'n
between the Dearest Friends!) They fought on
each side with the greatest Animosity of Rivals,
forgetting all the Sacred Bonds of their former
Friendship; till Don <HI>Antonio</HI> fell, and said,
dying, <HI>Forgive me,</HI> Henrique! <HI>I was to blame;
I cou'd not live without her:—I fear she will
betray thy Life, which</HI> haste <HI>and preserve, for my
sake!—Let me not die all at once!—Heav'n
pardon both of us!—Farewell! Oh, Haste!
Farewell!</HI> (return'd Don <HI>Henrique,) Farewell,
thou Bravest, Truest Friend! Farewell, thou
Noblest Part of me!—And, Farewell all the
Quiet of my Soul.</HI> Then stooping, he kiss'd his
Cheek; but, rising, found he must retire in
time, or else must perish through loss of Blood,
for he had receiv'd two or three dangerous
Wounds, besides others of less consequence:
wherefore he made all the convenient haste he
cou'd to the Coach, into which, by the help of
the Foot-men, he got, and order'd 'em to drive
directly to Don <HI>Richardo</HI>'s with all imaginable
speed; where he arriv'd in little more than
<PB N="23" REF="275"/>
half an hour's time, and was receiv'd by <HI>Ar∣delia</HI>'s
Father with the greatest Confusion and
Amazement that is expressible, seeing him re∣turn'd
without his Daughter, and so desperately
wounded. Before he thought it convenient to
ask him any Questions more than to enquire of
his Daughter's safety, to which he receiv'd a
short but satisfactory Answer, Don <HI>Richardo</HI> sent
for an Eminent and Able Surgeon, who prob'd
and dress'd Don <HI>Henrique</HI>'s Wounds, who was
immediately put to Bed, not without some
despondency of his Recovery; but (Thanks
to his kind Stars, and kinder Constitution!)
he rested pretty well for some hours that Night;
and early in the Morning, <HI>Ardelia</HI>'s Father,
who had scarce taken any Rest all that Night,
came to visit him, as soon as he understood
from the Servants who watch'd with him that
he was in a condition to suffer a short Discourse;
which, you may be sure, was to learn the Cir∣cumstances
of the past Night's Adventure; of
which Don <HI>Henrique</HI> gave him a perfect and
pleasant Account, since he heard that Don <HI>An∣tonio,</HI>
his mortal Enemy, was kill'd; the assu∣rance
of whose Death was the more delightful
to him, since, by this Relation, he found that
<HI>Antonio</HI> was the Man whom his care of his
Daughter had so often frustrated. Don <HI>Hen∣rique</HI>
had hardly made an end of his Narration,
e're a Servant came hastily to give <HI>Richardo</HI> no∣tice,
that the Officers were come to search for
his Son-in-Law that shou'd have been; whom
the Old Gentleman's wise Precaution had se∣cur'd
in a Room so unsuspected, that they might
as reasonably have imagin'd the entire Walls
<PB N="24" REF="276"/>
of his House had a Door made of Stones, as that
there shou'd have been one to that close Apart∣ment:
He went therefore boldly to the Officers,
and gave 'em all the Keys of his House, with
free liberty to examine every Room and Cham∣ber:
Which they did, but to no purpose; and
Don <HI>Henrique</HI> lay there undiscover'd till his
Cure was perfected.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Ardelia,</HI> who, that fatal
Night, but too rightly guess'd that the Death
of one or both her Lovers was the cause that
they did not return to their Promise, the next
Day fell into a high Fever, in which her Father
found her, soon after he had clear'd himself
of those who came to search for her Lover.
The assurance which her Father gave her of
<HI>Henrique</HI>'s Life seem'd a little to revive her;
but the severity of <HI>Antonio</HI>'s Fate was no way
obliging to her, since she cou'd not but retain
the memory of his Love and Constancy; which
added to her Afflictions, and heightned her Di∣stemper,
insomuch that <HI>Richardo</HI> was constrain'd
to leave her under the care of the good Lady
Abbess, and to the diligent Attendance of
<HI>Eleanora,</HI> not daring to hazard her Life in a
removal to his own House. All their Care and
Diligence was however ineffectual; for she
languish'd even to the least hope of Recovery,
till immediately after the first Visit of Don <HI>Hen∣rique,</HI>
which was the first he made in a Month's
time, and that by Night, <HI>incognito,</HI> with her
Father, her Distemper visibly retreated each
day: yet when at last she enjoy'd a perfect
Health of Body, her Mind grew sick, and she
plung'd into a deep Melancholy; which made
<PB N="25" REF="276"/>
her entertain a positive Resolution of taking
the Veil at the end of her Novitiate: which
accordingly she did, notwithstanding all the
Entreaties, Prayers and Tears both of her Fa∣ther
and Lover. But she soon repented her
Vow, and often wish'd that she might by any
means see and speak to Don <HI>Henrique,</HI> by
whose help she promis'd to her self a Deli∣verance
out of her voluntary Imprisonment:
Nor were his Wishes wanting to the same effect,
though he was forc'd to flie into <HI>Italy,</HI> to avoid
the Prosecution of <HI>Antonio</HI>'s Friends. Thither
she pursu'd him; nor cou'd he any way shun
her, unless he cou'd have left his Heart at a di∣stance
from his Body: Which made him take a
fatal Resolution of returning to <HI>Sevil</HI> in Dis∣guise;
where he wander'd about the Convent
every Night like a Ghost, (for indeed his Soul
was within, while his Inanimate Trunk was
without,) till at last he found means to convey
a Letter to her, which both surpriz'd and de∣lighted
her. The Messenger that brought it
her, was one of her Mother-in-Laws Maids,
whom he had known before, and met acciden∣tally
one night as he was going his Rounds,
and she coming out from <HI>Ardelia;</HI> with her he
prevail'd, and with Gold oblig'd her to Secrecy
and Assistance: which prov'd so successful, that
he understood from <HI>Ardelia</HI> her strong desire
of Liberty, and the continuance of her Passion
for him, together with the Means and Time
most convenient and likely to succeed for her
Enlargement. The Time was the Fourteenth
Night following, at Twelve a clock, which
just compleated a Month since his return thi∣ther;
<PB N="26" REF="277"/>
at which time they Both promis'd them∣selves
the greatest Happiness on Earth. But
you may observe the justice of Heaven, in their
Disappointment.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Sebastian,</HI> who still pursu'd him with a
most implacable Hatred, had trac'd him even to
<HI>Italy,</HI> and there narrowly missing him, posted
after him to <HI>Toledo;</HI> so sure and secret was his
Intelligence! As soon as he arriv'd, he went
directly to the Convent where his Sister <HI>Elvira</HI>
had been one of the Profess'd, ever since Don
<HI>Henrique</HI> had forsaken her, and where <HI>Ardelia</HI>
had taken her Repented Vow. <HI>Elvira</HI> had all
along conceal'd the Occasion of her coming
thither from <HI>Ardelia;</HI> and though she was her
only Confident, and knew the whole Story of
her Misfortunes, and heard the Name of Don
<HI>Henrique</HI> repeated an hundred times a day,
whom still she Lov'd most perfectly, yet never
gave her Beautiful Rival any cause of suspicion
that she Lov'd him, either by Words or Looks:
nay, more, when she understood that Don <HI>Hen∣rique</HI>
came to the Convent with <HI>Ardelia</HI> and
<HI>Antonio,</HI> and at other times with her Father,
yet she had so great a command of her self, as
to refrain seeing him, or to be seen by him;
nor ever intended to have spoken or writ to
him, had not her Brother, Don <HI>Sebastian,</HI> put
her upon the cruel necessity of doing the last;
who coming to visit his Sister (as I have said
before) found her with Donna <HI>Ardelia,</HI> whom
he never remembred to have seen, nor who
ever had seen him but twice, and that was
about Six Years before, when she was but Ten
Years of Age, when she fell passionately in Love
<PB N="27" REF="277"/>
with him, and continu'd her Passion till about
the Fourteenth Year of her Empire, when the
unhappy <HI>Antonio</HI> first began his Court to her
Don <HI>Sebastian</HI> was really a very desirable Person,
being at that time very Beautiful, his Age not
exceeding Six and twenty, of a sweet Conver∣sation,
very Brave, but Revengeful and Irre∣concileable
(like most of his Countrey-men,)
and of an Honourable Family. At the sight of
him, <HI>Ardelia</HI> felt her former Passion renew;
which proceeded and continu'd with such Vio∣lence,
that it utterly defac'd the Idea's of <HI>An∣tonio</HI>
and <HI>Henrique.</HI> (No wonder that she who
cou'd resolve to forsake her God for Man,
shou'd quit one Lover for another.) In short,
she then only wish'd that he might Love her
equally, and then she doubted not of con∣triving
the means of their Happiness betwixt
'em. She had her Wish, and more, if possible;
for he Lov'd her beyond the thought of any
other present or future Blessing, and fail'd not
to let her know it, at the second Interview;
when he receiv'd the greatest Pleasure he cou'd
have wish'd, next to the Joys of a Bridal Bed:
For she confess'd her Love to him, and presently
put him upon thinking on the means of her
Escape; but not finding his Designs so likely to
succeed, as those Measures she had sent to Don
<HI>Henrique,</HI> she communicates the very same to
Don <HI>Sebastian,</HI> and agreed with him to make
use of 'em on that very Night wherein she had
oblig'd Don <HI>Henrique</HI> to attempt her Delive∣rance;
the Hour indeed was different, being
determin'd to be at Eleven. <HI>Elvira,</HI> who was
present at the Conference, took the Hint; and
<PB N="28" REF="278"/>
not being willing to disoblige a Brother who had
so hazarded his Life in Vindication of her,
either durst not or wou'd not seem to oppose his
Inclinations, at that time: However, when he
retir'd with her to talk more particularly of
his intended Revenge on Don <HI>Henrique,</HI> who, he
told her, he knew lay somewhere absconded in
<HI>Toledo,</HI> and whom he had resolv'd, as he as∣sur'd
her, to sacrifice to her injur'd Honour,
and his Resentments; she oppos'd that his vin∣dictive
Resolution with all the forcible Argu∣ments
in a Virtuous and Pious Lady's Capacity,
but in vain; so that immediately, upon his
retreat from the Convent, she took the oppor∣tunity
of writing to Don <HI>Henrique</HI> as follows,
the fatal Hour not being then Seven Nights
distant.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Don HENRIQUE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Brother is now in Town, in pur∣suit
of your Life; nay, more, of
your Mistress, who has consented to make her
Escape from the Convent, at the same Place
of it, and by the same Means on which she
had agreed to give her self entirely to you,
but the Hour is Eleven. I know, <HI>Henrique,</HI>
your <HI>Ardelia</HI> is dearer to you than your Life;
but your Life, your dear Life is more desir'd
than any thing in this World, by</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Injur'd and Forsaken
ELVIRA.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="29" REF="278"/>
This she deliver'd to <HI>Richardo</HI>'s Servant,
whom <HI>Henrique</HI> had gain'd that Night, as
soon as she came to visit <HI>Ardelia,</HI> at her
usual Hour, just as she went out of the
Cloister.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Henrique</HI> was not a little surpriz'd with
this <HI>Billette;</HI> however, he cou'd hardly resolve
to forbear his accustom'd Visits to <HI>Ardelia,</HI>
at first; but upon more mature Consideration,
he only chose to converse with her by Let∣ters,
which still press'd her to be mindful of
her Promise, and of the Hour, not taking no∣tice
of any Caution that he had receiv'd of
her Treachery. To which she still return'd,
in Words that might assure him of her Con∣stancy.</P>
<P>The Dreadful Hour wanted not a Quarter
of being perfect when Don <HI>Henrique</HI> came;
and having fix'd his Rope-Ladder to that part
of the Garden-Wall where he was expected,
<HI>Ardelia,</HI> who had not stir'd from that very
Place for a quarter of an hour before, pre∣par'd
to ascend by it; which she did, as soon
as his Servant had turn'd and fix'd it on the
inner side of the Wall; on the top of which,
at a little distance, she found another fasten'd,
for her to descend on the out-side; whilst
Don <HI>Henrique</HI> eagerly waited to receive her.
She came at last and flew into his Arms;
which made <HI>Henrique</HI> cry out in a Rapture,
<HI>Am I atlast once more happy, in having my</HI> Ardelia
<HI>in my possession!</HI> She, who knew his Voice,
and now found she was betray'd, but knew not
by whom, shriek'd out, <HI>I am Ruin'd! Help!
Help!—Loose me, I charge you,</HI> Henrique!
<PB N="30" REF="279"/>
<HI>Loose me!</HI> At that very moment, and at those
very words came <HI>Sebastian,</HI> attended only by
one Servant, and hearing <HI>Henrique</HI> reply, <HI>Not
all the Powers of Hell shall snatch you from me;</HI>
drawing his Sword, without one word, made
a furious Pass at him; but his Rage and Haste
misguided his Arm, for his Sword went quite
through <HI>Ardelia</HI>'s Body, who only said, <HI>Ah,
wretched Maid!</HI> and dropt from <HI>Henrique</HI>'s
Arms, who then was oblig'd to quit her, to
preserve his own Life, if possible; however, he
had not had so much time as to Draw, had
not <HI>Sebastian</HI> been amaz'd at this dreadful mi∣stake
of his Sword: but presently recollecting
himself, he flew with redoubl'd Rage to attack
<HI>Henrique;</HI> and his Servant had seconded him,
had not <HI>Henrique</HI>'s, who was now descended,
otherwise diverted him. They fought with
the greatest Animosity on both sides, and with
equal Advantage; for they both fell together.
<HI>Ah, my</HI> Ardelia, <HI>I come to thee now, (Sebastian</HI>
groan'd out;) <HI>'Twas this unlucky Arm, which
now embraces thee, that kill'd thee. Just Hea∣ven!</HI>
(she sigh'd out;)—<HI>Oh, yet have mercy!</HI>
[Here they both dy'd.] <HI>Amen,</HI> (cry'd <HI>Hen∣rique,</HI>
dying, <HI>I want it most:—Oh,</HI> Antonio!
<HI>Oh,</HI> Elvira! Elvira! <HI>Ay, there's the Weight
that sinks me down:—And yet I wish Forgive∣ness:
—Once more, Sweet Heaven have-mercy!</HI>
He cou'd not out-live that last word; which
was Echo'd by <HI>Elvira,</HI> who all this while stood
weeping, and calling out for Help, as she stood
close to the Wall in the Garden.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="279"/>
This alarm'd the rest of the Sisters, who
rising, caus'd the Bell to be Rung-out, as upon
dangerous Occasions it us'd to be; which
rais'd the Neighbourhood, who came time
enough to remove the dead Bodies of the
<HI>two Rivals,</HI> and of the late <HI>Fallen Angel, Ar∣delia.</HI>
The Injur'd and Neglected <HI>Elvira,</HI> whose
Piety design'd quite contrary Effects, was im∣mediately
seiz'd with a violent Fever; which,
as it was <HI>violent,</HI> did not last long; for she
dy'd within Four and twenty Hours, with all
the happy Symptoms of a <HI>Departing Saint.</HI></P>

ADVENTURE
OF THE
Black Lady.</HEAD>
<P>ABout the beginning of last <HI>June</HI> (as
near as I can remember) <HI>Bellamora</HI>
came to Town from <HI>Hampshire;</HI> and
was oblig'd to lodge the first Night
at the same Inn where the Stage-Coach set up.
The next Day she took Coach for <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI>
where she thought to find Madam <HI>Brightly,</HI> a
Relation of her's; with whom she design'd to
continue for about half a Year undiscover'd, if
possible, by her Friends in the Country: And
order'd therefore her Trunk, with her Cloaths,
and most of her Money and Jewels, to be brought
after her to Madam <HI>Brightly</HI>'s, by a strange Por∣ter
whom she spoke to in the Street as she was
taking Coach; being utterly unacquainted with
the neat Practices of this fine City. When she
came to <HI>Bridges-street,</HI> where indeed her Cou∣sin
had lodged near three or four Years since;
<PB N="4" REF="282"/>
she was strangely surpriz'd that she cou'd not
learn any thing of her; no, nor so much as
meet with any one that had ever heard of her
Cousin's Name. Till, at last, describing Ma∣dam
<HI>Brightly</HI> to one of the House-keepers in that
place, he told her, that there was such a kind
of Lady, whom he had sometimes seen there
about a Year and a half ago; but that he be∣liev'd,
she was married and remov'd towards
<HI>So-ho.</HI> In this Perplexity she quite forgot her
Trunk and Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and wander'd in her
Hackney-Coach all over St. <HI>Ann</HI>'s Parish; in∣quiring
for Madam <HI>Brightly,</HI> still describing her
Person, but in vain; for no Soul cou'd give
her any Tale or Tidings of such a Lady. After
she had thus fruitlesly rambled, till she, the
Coachman, and the very Horses were e'en tir'd,
by good Fortune for her, she happen'd on a
private-House, were lived a good, discreet,
ancient Gentlewoman, who was fallen a little
to decay, and was forc'd to let Lodgings for
the best part of her Livelihood: From whom
she understood, that there was such a kind of
a Lady who had lain there somewhat more
than a Twelve-month, being near three Months
after she was married: But that she was now
gone abroad with the Gentleman her Husband;
either to the Play, or to take the fresh Air;
and she believ'd, wou'd not return till Night.
This Discourse of the good Gentlewoman's so
elevated <HI>Bellamora</HI>'s drooping Spirits, that
after she had begg'd the Liberty of staying
there till they came home, she discharg'd
the Coachman in all haste, still forgetting
<PB N="5" REF="282"/>
her Trunk, and the more valuable Furniture
of it.</P>
<P>When they were alone, <HI>Bellamora</HI> desired she
might be permitted the Freedom to send for a
Pint of Sack; which, with some little Diffi∣culty,
was at last allow'd her. They began
then to chat for a matter of half an hour of
things indifferent: And, at length the ancient
Gentlewoman ask'd the Fair Innocent (I must
not say Foolish) one, of what Country, and
what her Name was: To both which she an∣swer'd
very <HI>directly</HI> and <HI>truly;</HI> tho' it might
have prov'd, not <HI>discreetly.</HI> She then inquir'd
of <HI>Bellamora</HI> if her Parents were living, and the
Occasion of her coming to Town. The Fair
Unthinking Creature replied, That her Father
and Mother were both dead: And that she had
escap'd from her Uncle, under pretence of ma∣king
a Visit to a young Lady, her Cousin who
was lately married, and liv'd above Twenty
Miles from her Uncle's in the Road to <HI>London;</HI>
and, that the Cause of her quitting the Coun∣try,
was to avoid the hated Importunities of a
Gentleman, whose pretended Love to her she
fear'd had been her eternal Ruine. At which she
wept and sigh'd most extravagantly. The dis∣creet
Gentlewoman endeavour'd to comfort
her by all the softest and most powerful Argu∣ment
in her Capacity; promising her all the
friendly Assistance that she cou'd expect from
her, during <HI>Bellamora</HI>'s stay in Town; which
she did with so much Earnestness and visible
Integrity, that the pretty innocent Creature
was going to make her a full and real Discovery
<PB N="6" REF="283"/>
of her imaginary, insupportable Misfortunes;
and (doubtless) had done it; had she not been
prevented by the Return of the Lady, whom
she hop'd to have found her Cousin <HI>Brightly.</HI>
The Gentleman her Husband just saw her with∣in
Doors, and order'd the Coach to drive to
some of his Bottle-Companions; which gave
the Women the better Opportunity of enter∣taining
one another, which happen'd to be
with some Surprize on all sides. As the Lady
was going up to her Apartment, the Gentle∣woman
of the House told her there was a young
Lady in the Parlour, who came out o' the
Country that very Day on purpose to visit her:
The Lady stept immediately to see who it was,
and <HI>Bellamora</HI> approaching to receive her hop'd
for Cousin, stopp'd on the the suddain just as she
came to her; and sigh'd out aloud, Ah, Madam
I am lost.—It is not your Ladyship I seek.
No, Madam (return'd t'other) I am apt to
think you did not intend me this Honour. But
you are as welcome to me, as you could be to the
dearest of your Acquaintance: Have you forgot
me, Madam <HI>Bellamora?</HI> (continued she) that
Name startled both the other: However, It
was with a kind of Joy. Alas! Madam, (re∣plied
the young one) I now remember that I
have been so happy to have seen you: But
where, and when, my Memory can't shew me.
'Tis indeed some Years since: (return'd the
Lady) But of that another time.—Mean
while, if you are unprovided of a Lodging, I dare
undertake, you shall be welcome to this Gentle∣woman.
The Fair Unfortunate return'd her
<PB N="7" REF="283"/>
Thanks; and whilst a Chamber was preparing
for her, the Lady entertain'd her in her own.
About Ten a Clock they parted, <HI>Bellamora</HI> be∣ing
conducted to her new Lodging by the Mi∣stress
of the House, who then left her to take
what Rest she cou'd amidst her so many seem∣ing
Misfortunes; returning to the other Lady,
who desir'd her to search into the Cause of
<HI>Bellamora</HI>'s Retreat to Town.</P>
<P>The next Morning the good Gentlewoman
of the House coming up to her, found <HI>Bellamora</HI>
almost drown'd in Tears, which by many kind
and sweet Words she at last stopp'd; and asking
whence so great Signs of Sorrow shou'd pro∣ceed,
vow'd a most profound Secrecy if she
wou'd discover to her their Occasion; which,
after some little Reluctancy, she did, in this
manner:</P>
<P>I was courted (said she) above three Years
ago, when my Mother was yet living, by one
Mr. <HI>Fondlove,</HI> a Gentleman of a good Estate, and
true Worth; and one who, I dare believe, did
then really love me: He continu'd his Passion
for me, with all the earnest and honest Sollicitati∣ons
imaginable, till some Month's before my Mo∣ther's
Death; who at that time, was most desirous
to see me dispos'd of in Marriage to another Gen∣tleman,
of a much better Estate than Mr. <HI>Fond-love:</HI>
But one, whose Person and Humour did
by no means hit with my Inclinations: And this
gave <HI>Fondlove</HI> the unhappy Advantage over me.
For, finding me one Day all alone in my Cham∣ber,
and lying on my Bed, in as mournful and
wretched a Condition, to my <HI>then</HI> foolish Ap∣prehension,
<PB N="8" REF="284"/>
as <HI>now</HI> I am; He urg'd his Passion
with such Violence and accursed Success for
me, with reiterated Promises of Marriage,
whenever I pleas'd to challenge 'em, which he
bound with the most sacred Oaths and most
dreadful Execrations; that partly with my
Aversion to the other, and partly with my In∣clinations
to <HI>pity him,</HI> I <HI>ruin'd my self.</HI>—Here
she relaps'd into a greater Extravagance of
Grief than before; which was so extreme,
that it did not continue long. When therefore,
she was pretty well come to her self, the an∣cient
Gentlewoman ask'd her, why she ima∣gin'd
her self ruin'd? To which she answer'd,
I am great with Child by him (Madam) and
wonder you did not perceive it last Night.
Alas! I have not a Month to go: I am sham'd,
ruin'd, and damn'd, I fear, for ever lost. O,
fie, Madam, think not so: (said t'other) For
the Gentleman may yet prove true, and marry
you. Ay, Madam, (replied <HI>Bellamora</HI>) I doubt
not that he wou'd marry me; for, soon after
my Mother's Death, when I came to be at my
own Disposal, which happen'd about two
Months after, he offer'd, nay, most earnestly
sollicited me to it, which still he perserveres to
do. This is strange! (return'd 'tother) And
it appears to me to be your own Fault, that
you are yet miserable. Why did you not, or
why will you not consent to your own Happi∣ness?
Alas! alas! (cry'd <HI>Bellamora</HI>) 'Tis the
only thing I <HI>dread</HI> in <HI>this</HI> World: For, I am cer∣tain
he can never love me after: Besides, ever
since, I have abhorr'd the Sight of him: And
<PB N="9" REF="284"/>
this is the only Cause that obliges me to for∣sake
my Uncle, and all my Friends and Rela∣tions
in the Country, hoping this <HI>populous</HI> and
<HI>publick</HI> Place to be most <HI>private,</HI> especially, (Ma∣dam)
in your House, and in your Fidelity and
Discretion. Of the last you may assure your
self, Madam, (said t'other:) But what Provi∣sion
have you made for the Reception of the
young Stranger that you carry about you. Ah,
Madam! (cry'd <HI>Bellamora</HI>) you have brought
to mind another Misfortune: Then she ac∣quainted
her with the suppos'd Loss of her
Money and Jewels, telling her withal, that she
had but three Guinea's and some Silver left, and
the Rings she wore, in her present Possession.
The good Gentlewoman of the House told her,
she wou'd send to inquire at the Inn where she
lay the first Night she came to Town; for,
(happily) they might give some account of the
Porter to whom she had intrusted her Trunk;
and withal repeated her Promise of all the
Help in her Power, and for that time left her
much more compos'd than she found her. The
good Gentlewoman went directly to the other
Lady, her Lodger, to whom she recounted
<HI>Bellamora</HI>'s mournful Confession: At which the
Lady appear'd mightily concern'd: And at
last, she told her Land-lady, that she wou'd
take Care that <HI>Bellamora</HI> should lie in according
to her Quality: For, (added she) the Child (it
seems) is my own Brothers.</P>
<P>Assoon as she had din'd, she went to the Ex∣change
and bought Child-bed Linen; but de∣sir'd
that <HI>Bellamora</HI> might not have the least No∣tice
<PB N="10" REF="285"/>
of it: And at her Return dispatch'd a Let∣ter
to her Brother <HI>Fondlove</HI> in <HI>Hantshire,</HI> with
an Account of every particular; which soon
brought him up to Town, without satisfying
any of his or her Friends with the Reason of
his sudden Departure; mean while, the good
Gentlewoman of the House had sent to the <HI>Star-Inn</HI>
on <HI>Fish-street-hill,</HI> to demand the Trunk;
which she rightly suppos'd to have been carried
back thither: For, by good Luck, it was a Fel∣low
that plyed thereabouts who brought it to
<HI>Bellamora</HI>'s Lodgings that very Night, but un∣known
to her. <HI>Fondlove</HI> no sooner got to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
but he posts to his Sister's Lodgings,
where he was advis'd not to be seen of <HI>Bel∣lamora</HI>
till they had work'd farther upon her,
which the Land-Lady began in this manner;
she told her that her things were miscarried,
and she fear'd lost; that she had but little Mo∣ney
her self, and if the Overseers of the poor
(justly so call'd from their over-looking 'em)
shou'd have the least Suspicion of a strange and
unmarried Person, who was entertain'd in her
House big with Child and so near her time as
<HI>Bellamora</HI> was, she shou'd be troubled, if they
cou'd not give Security to the Parish of twenty
or thirty Pound that they shou'd not suffer by
her, which she cou'd not; or otherwise, she
must be sent to the House of Correction, and
her Child to a Parish-Nurse. This Discourse
one may imagine, was very dreadful to a Per∣son
of her Youth, Beauty, Education, Family
and Estate: However, she resolutely protested,
that she had rather undergo all this, than be
<PB N="11" REF="285"/>
expos'd to the Scorn of her Friends and Rela∣tions
in the Country. The other told her then,
that she must write down to her Uncle a fare∣well
Letter, as if she were just going aboard
to <HI>Pacquet-boat</HI> for <HI>Holland;</HI> that he might not
send to inquire for her in Town, when he shou'd
understand she was not at her new-married
Cousin's in the Country, which accordingly she
did, keeping her self a close Prisoner to her
Chamber; where she was daily visited by <HI>Fond∣love</HI>'s
Sister and the Land-Lady, but by no Soul
else, the first dissembling the Knowledge she
had of her Misfortunes. Thus she continued
for above three Weeks; not a Servant being
suffer'd to enter her Chamber, so much as to
make her Bed, lest they shou'd take Notice of
her great Belly: But for all this Caution, the
Secret had taken Wind, by the means of an At∣tendant
of the other Lady below, who had
over-heard her speaking of it to her Husband.
This soon got out 'o Doors and spread abroad,
till it reach'd the long Ears of the Wolves
of the Parish; who next day design'd to give
her an ungrateful Visit: But <HI>Fondlove,</HI> by good
Providence, prevented it; who, the Night be∣fore,
was usher'd into <HI>Bellamora</HI>'s Chamber by
his Sister, his Brother-in-Law, and the Land-Lady.
At the sight of him she had like to have
swoon'd away: But he taking her in his Arms,
began again, as he was wont to do, with Tears in
his Eyes, to beg that she wou'd marry him e'er
she was delivered; if not for his, nor her own,
yet for the Child's sake, which she hourly ex∣pected;
that it might not be born out of Wed∣lock,
<PB N="12" REF="286"/>
and so be made uncapable of inheriting
either of their Estates; with a great many more
pressing Arguments on all sides: To which at
last she consented; and an honest officious Gen∣tleman,
whom they had before provided, was
call'd up, who made an end of the Dispute:
So to Bed they went together that Night; and
next Day to the Exchange, for several pretty
Businesses that Ladies in her Condition want.
Whilst they were abroad, came the Vermin
of the Parish, (I mean, the Overseers of the
poor, who eat the Bread from 'em) to search
for a young Black-hair'd Lady (for so was <HI>Bel∣lomora</HI>)
who was either brought to bed, or just
ready to lie down. The Land-Lady shew'd
'em all the Rooms in her House, but no such
Lady cou'd be found. At last she bethought her
self, and led 'em into her Parlour, where she
open'd a little Closet-door, and shew'd 'em her
Black Cat that had just kitten'd; assuring 'em,
that <HI>she</HI> shou'd never trouble the Parish as long
as she had Rats or Mice in the House, and so
dismiss'd 'em like Logger-heads as they came.</P>
