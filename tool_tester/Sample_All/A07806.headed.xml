is (as the sequell did interprete) till you waxe stronger:

when he doubteth his faction shall be ouermatched, then

<P>When as it is demanded of Priests (a necessarie ar∣ticle

<P>Now secondly their delaying. When the question is

<HI>Pius Quintus,</HI> and others) haue <Q>absolued subiects

euer any of that kinde gaue hope vnto vs, it was the Se∣cular
Priests: who for a fit did write many things very
truly against Iesuiticall rebellious practises: but after,
perceiuing the Recusants to withdraw their beneuo∣lence,
as rather deuoted to the Iesuites; and that the
Pope also took part against them, they searing their con∣sciences,
wholy submitted themselues vnto the Arch-priest,
whose command, vpon occasion, is counterman∣ded

we may pronounce [<NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg">Woe be vnto you Scribes and Pharisies, for you do &amp;c.</NOTE><HI>Woe, &amp;c.</HI>] a condemnation
against them: in as much as all such sinnes haue
a brand of impietie in their forehead, whereby
any may discerne them, as the Apostle teacheth:
<Q><NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 20.</NOTE>The workes of the flesh are <HI>manifest,</HI> which are these;
Adulterie, hatred, contentions, <HI>seditions,</HI> murders, and

at this time be you exhorted (my brethren) to
<PB N="53" REF="29"/>
take this antidote and preseruatiue against all such
poysonable positions and practises; it is com∣pounded
but of two simples, simplicitie of Apo∣stolike
precept, &amp; practise of primitiue examples.
The blessed Apostle and true <HI>Peter,</HI> farre differing
from this personate, doth thus admonish all Chri∣stians:
<Q><NOTE N="6" PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 4. 15.</NOTE>But let none of you suffer as a murtherer, an euill
doer, or as a busie bodie, in other mens matters: but if
any suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but
glorifie God in this behalfe.</Q> So then Christians suffe∣ring
for murders, may happily become martyrers,
but neuer be martyrs. Secondly, the Primitiue
example is plainly recorded by <HI>Tertullian</HI> in his
Apologie, in behalfe of zealous Christians, who
being in his daies persecuted of Tyrants for the
profession of the holie Faith, yet auouched al∣waies
their faithfull allegeance after this tenour:
<Q><NOTE N="7" PLACE="marg">Tert. Apolog. <HI>Nos precamur, pro omnibus Imperatoribus vitam prolixā, imperium secu∣rum, domum tutam, exerci∣tus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortes, po∣pulum probum, orbem quietā.</HI></NOTE>Our humble prayers to God, in the behalfe of all Em∣perours,
are, that he would vouchsafe them long life, se∣cure
reigne, safe guard, powerfull armies, faithfull
Counsellors, godly people, and a peaceable world.</Q> And
to remoue all ielousies of Princes, though Apo∣states
from Christ, holy <HI>Nazianzen</HI> is bold in de∣fence
of Christian loyaltie to stand at defiance (as
it were) against all calumnious accusations, say∣ing:
