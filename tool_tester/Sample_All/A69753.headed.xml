<HEAD>REPLY.</HEAD>
<P>VVE have, <HI>Reverend Brethren,</HI> sufficiently considered and exa∣mined your Answeres to our Demandes, by which we expect∣ed full satisfaction to all our Scruples and doubts concerning the late <HI>Covenant:</HI> But truelie, in Modestie and Brotherlie Love, we tell you, that your Answeres (what-so-ever you thinke of them your selves) have not given us that satisfaction which we expected. We know that some who rashly condemne every thing which is said or written contrary to the cause which they maintaine, will boldly say of us, that


<PB N="5" REF="3"/>
we have closed our eyes against a cleare and ingyring Light: But first, we say with <HI>Iob, Our witnesse is in Heaven, and our recorde is on high.</HI> That LORD who only seeth the secrets of hearts, knoweth, that we love His Trueth, and are ready so soone as it shall be shown unto us, to embrace and professe it before the World. Next, we appeale to the Consciences of all impartiall Readers, who shall have occasion to weygh and consider maturelie the weight of our Arguments, and of these Answeres which it hath pleased you to give us: wishing them, yea, most humblie and earnestly intreating them, to judge both of your writtings and ours, without prejudice, or any partiall respect. Yea, we are confident, that ye also, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whose love to the Trueth of GOD we are perswaded, will after better advysement, and more mature consideration of the matters debated, acknowledge, that we are not against the Trueth, but for it. The LORD open your eyes, that you may clearly see, that Trueth for which we stand.</P>
<P>WEE objected to you, <HI>Reverend Brethren,</HI> that you had not a Cal∣ling to urge us to the subscription of the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> from anie ac∣knowledged Authority, or lawfull Judica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rie established in this Church or Kingdome: to which Objection ye answere no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> here par∣ticularlie, as we expected. And whereas you say, That you are come to exhort us, and our People, in all humilitie, to joyne with you; how is it, that without our consent, and against our will, not having law∣full Authoritie, which you seeme here not to acclaime to your selves, you have publicklie preached to our People, within our Congregation? which is a thing rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt to those places of Scripture, in the which the Spirit of GOD recommendeth to Elders, or Pastors, the care of those Flockes, <HI>Over which the holy Ghost hath made them overseers, Acts</HI> 20. 28. 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 5. 2 as also telleth us, That the Pastors whom the Flocke must <HI>know,</HI> and to whom they must <HI>submit themselves,</HI> doe <HI>watch over the Soules of that Flock, and must give account for them,</HI> 1. <HI>Thessal.</HI> 5. 12 <HI>Hebr.</HI> 13. 17. It is also con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rarie to the lawes of the Christian Church in all ages. For by the ancient <HI>Canons,</HI> Pastors are commanded, to containe themselves within the limites of their own Charge; and not to presume to exercise Pastorall Office


<PB N="6" REF="4"/>

We did not without reason say, That you, and others of your Confederation, enforce your In∣terpretation of the Negative <HI>Confession</HI> upon others; seeing we heare, that some Pastors and Prelates are forced to flee to forraygne Coun∣treyes, for fear of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> because they have refused the said <HI>In∣terpretation;</HI> and those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>ave stayed in the Countrey, dare scarce∣lie appear in the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, or streets, and are threatned, that their Stipends shall not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto them, untill they subscrive your <HI>Covenant.</HI> † 3. Whereas you doe in Brotherly love exhort, and en∣treat us, to contribute our best endeavours for extinguishing the com∣mon Combustion, we praysing GOD, for your pious zeale, and for the lovingnesse and modesty of your speeches, (wherein, by GOD'S help, we shall labour to keep correspondence with you; that both we and you may show <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> selves, to have learned of CHRIST, <HI>Meek∣nesse, and lowlinesse of heart</HI>) we most willingly promise to doe so, by all means which our consciences will permit us to use, as also to joine our most humble and hearty Prayers with yours, that it may please GOD in this dangerous exigent, to <HI>doe good in His good plea∣sure, to our Sion, and to builde up the walls of our Ierusalem.</HI> † 4. We may justly say, that this new <HI>Covenant</HI> is substantially different from the <HI>Old,</HI> which was made <HI>Anno</HI> 1581. in respect it not onlie containeth that <HI>Old Covenant,</HI> or <HI>Confession,</HI> which was allowed by two Generall <HI>Assemblies,</HI> but also your interpretation of it, which, as yet, hath no such Authoritie, or Approbation. † 5. No Band of Mu∣tuall Defence, <HI>Against all persons what-so-ever,</HI> is expressed in the <HI>Covenant</HI> made 1581. And altho it were, yet the case is very unlike: For Subjects may make such a <HI>Covenant</HI> of Mutuall Defence, by Armes, with the consent of the King, who only, under GOD, hath the power of Armes, or of the Sword, in this Kingdome. But they who made this late <HI>Covenant,</HI> had not his consent, as that former or


<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
olde <HI>Covenant</HI> had: which is a thing so evident, that no man can call it in question. † 6. As for that which you affirme here, that my Lord Commissioner his Grace was well satisfied with your <HI>Declaration,</HI> it becommeth not us, to pry narrowlie into his Graces doings: but truely we have more then reason, to pry most narrowlie into the words of a <HI>Covenant,</HI> which is offered unto us, to be sworne, and sub∣scrybed, lest we abuse, and prophane the Sacred Name of GOD, and tye our selves to the doing of any thing which is displeasing unto him. Last of all; whereas ye desire us, to joyne our selves to you, and to the rest of your Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ederacie, who are (as you affirme) <HI>almost the whole Church and Kingdome,</HI> truely we cannot but reverence such a multitude of our Reverend Brethren, and deare Countrey-men, and are ready to be <HI>followers of them, in so farre as they are followers of CHRIST:</HI> But neither can we <HI>doe any thing agaynst the Trueth,</HI> nei∣ther can we attribute so much Authoritie to their multitude, as other∣wise we would, in respect there hath been so much dealing for <HI>Sub∣scriptions,</HI> in all quarters of this Kingdome, and so manie have beene threatned, to give their consent, as we are most credibly informed.</P>

<HEAD>The Second Demand.</HEAD>
<P>Whether or no we ought to subscryve the foresaid Covenant, see∣ing all Covenants of mutuall Defence, by force of Armes, made a∣mongst Subjects of any degree, upon whatsoever colour or pretence, without the King's Majestie or his Successoures privitie and con∣sent, are expreslie forbidden by King JAMES of blessed Memorie, and the three Estates of this Kingdome, in the Parliament holden at <HI>Linlithgow, Anno</HI> 1585?</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>ANSWERE.</HEAD>
<P>The Act of Parliament forbiddeth in the first part, Leagues and Bands of maintenance privilie made, such as are called Bands of Man∣rent, as the act in Queen <HI>MARIES</HI> time, to which it hath relation,


<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
doeth beare. And in the second part, only such, as tend to the publick▪ disturbance of the peace of the Realme, by moving sedition. But no act of Parliament doeth discharge, nor can any just Law forbid, Conven∣tions or Covenants in the generall; or such Covenants in speciall as are made with GOD, and amongst our selves; not for any mans particu∣lar, but for the common benefite of all; not to move Sedition, but to preserve Peace, and to prevent trouble: which by all probabilitie had been to many, before this time, too sensible, if this course had not been taken. <HI>Conventions</HI> and <HI>Covenants</HI> (in the judgement of <HI>Juriscon∣sults</HI>) are to be esteemed and judged of, according to their diverse ends, good or bad: which made King JAMES of happy memory to take it for an undoubted maxime, That <HI>pro aris &amp; focis, &amp; pro pa∣tre patriae,</HI> the whole body of the Common-wealth should stirre at once: not any more as divided members, but as one consolidate lumpe.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="reply">
<HEAD>Replye.</HEAD>
<P>In that second part of that Act of Parliament holden at <HI>Linlithgo, Anno</HI> 1585. are forbidden, <HI>All Leagues or Bands of Mutuall De∣fence, which are made without the privitie and consent of the KING, under the pain to be holden and execute as movers of sedition and un∣quietnesse,</HI> &amp;c. Wherefore we can no wayes thinke, that any Bands or Leagues of <HI>Mutuall Defence, by force of Armes,</HI> are there per∣mitted, (that is, not forbidden) seeing first the words of the Act are so generall, for in it are discharged <HI>All Bands made among Sub∣jects of any degree, upon any colour what soever, without his Highnes, or his Successours, privitie and consent had and obtained thereunto.</HI> Next; All such Bands are declared to be <HI>Seditious,</HI> and perturbative of the publicke Peace of the Realme: or, which is all one, are ap∣pointed to be esteemed so. And therefore, we can not see how any Bands of that kynde can be excepted, as if they were not seditious. 2. We doubt not, but the late <HI>Covenant</HI> being considered, according to the maine intention of those Pious and Generous Gentle-men, Bar∣rons and others our dear Countrey men, who made it, especially our Reverend Brethren of the holy Ministery, is a <HI>Covenant</HI> made with


<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
GOD, and proceeding from a zealous respect to GOD His Glory, and to the preservation of the puritie of the Gospell in this Church and Kingdome: But we cannot finde a Warrand in our Consciences, to grant, that such <HI>Covenants,</HI> in so farre as they import <HI>mutuall De∣fence, against all persons what-so-ever,</HI> none being excepted, no, not the KING, (as it seemeth unto us, by the words of your <HI>Covenant,</HI> but farre more by the words of your late <HI>Protestation,</HI> the 28 of <HI>Iune;</HI> wherein you promise, <HI>mutuall Defence, against all externall or inter∣nall Invasion,</HI> menaced in his Majesties last Proclamation) are not forbidden by any Band, nor justlie yet can be forbidden. For, first, we have already showne, that they are forbidden in the foresaid Act of Parliament, <HI>Anno</HI> 1585. 2. No Warrefare; and consequentlie, no <HI>Covenant,</HI> importing Warrefare, is lawfull, without just Authori∣tie, which, we are perswaded, is only in the supreame Magistrate, and and in those who have power and employment from him, to take Armes: Yea, so farre as we know, all moderate men, who duely respect Authoritie, will say, that it is so in all <HI>Kingdomes,</HI> and <HI>Mo∣narchies, properly so called:</HI> (Of which nature is this his Majesties most Ancient Kingdome,) And, that it is altogether unlawfull to Subjects in such Kingdomes, to take Armes against their Prince. For which cause, that famous and most learned Doctor <HI>Rivetus,</HI> in a late Treatise called <HI>Iesuita vapulans,</HI> speaking of the judgement of <HI>Bu∣channan,</HI> and others, who taught, that Subjects might take Armes a∣gainst their Prince, in extraordinary Cases, and extreame dangers, of the Religion, and Common-wealth, professeth first, that he, and all other <HI>Protestants,</HI> condemne such doctrine. <HI>Secondly;</HI> That this Er∣rour did proceed from a mistaking of the Governement of the Sco∣tish Kingdome, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s if it were not truely &amp; properly <HI>monarchical. Third∣ly</HI> That the rashness of those wrytters, is to be ascrybed partlie to the hard and perilous times of persecution, wherein they lived, and part∣lie <HI>Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m praef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>do ingenio, et ad audendum prompto.</HI> Thus he wry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h in the 13. Chap. of the said Booke, Pag. 274. and 275. answering to the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rimination of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Iesuit,</HI> who had affirmed, that <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Knox,</HI> and <HI>Goodman,</HI> had written as boldlie, for the Re∣bellion of Subjects against Princes, as any of their Order at any time load done. A thing much to be noted by us at this time, lest we any


<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
more give that advantage to <HI>Iesuites,</HI> to make Apologie for their rebellious Doctrines and Practises. 3. Not only making of <HI>Cove∣nants,</HI> but also all other actions, are to be esteemed and judged of, first, by the equitie of the subject, and matter; then, by the ende: For if the matter pactioned (that is, which the parties mutuallie doe promise) be justlie forbidden, by a lawfull Authoritie; and conse∣quentlie be unlawfull in it selfe; then the goodnesse of the ende, or project, can not make the paction, or <HI>Covenant,</HI> to be good, or lawfull.</P>

<P>If it be alleadged, that in extream and most dangerous cases, such Acts of Parliament may be contraveened, <HI>Quaeritur,</HI> whether there be now such extream case, seeing we have his Majestie, in his former Proclamations, avowing, protesting, declaring, and in this last Pro∣clamation taking God to witnesse, that he never intended any Inno∣vation of Religion; and also seeing He hath removed already all that which made men feare Novations, to wit, Service Booke, Booke of Canons, and the alleadged exorbitancie of the new high Commission.</P>

<P>If the removing of the <HI>Service Booke, Booke of Canons,</HI> and the limitation of the vast power of the <HI>high Commission,</HI> contayning so much superstition, and tyrrannie of Prelates, be a benefite to this Kirke and Kingdome, we ought, under GOD, to ascrybe the same to the peac∣able Meettings, humble Supplications, and religious Covenanting of the Subjects; which have given information to his Majestie, and have procured from his justice and goodnesse, so great favour, as is thank∣fullie acknowledged in the last <HI>Protestation:</HI> which doeth also expresse the many particulars, wherein his Majesties late <HI>Proclamation</HI> is not satisfactorie.

<P>The subscrybers are here misinterpreted in two poyntes, very mate∣riall: One is, that they presume upon power, or Authority, which they have to give out a judiciall interpretation of the Articles of the <HI>Con∣fession,</HI> and to enforce the same upon others: whereas they onelie inten∣ded, to make knowne their own meaning, according to the minde of our Reformers; and in charity to propound and recommend the same to o∣thers, who might be made willing to embrace it: Although it be true also, that very great numbers of Ministers were conveened, and te∣stified their consent at that time: and although the private judgement of those who are called <HI>Laicks,</HI> ought not to be mis-regarded: for it is confessed, that an Interpretation, which is private <HI>ratione personae,</HI> may be more then privat <HI>ratione medii.</HI> The other, which being ob∣served, will answere diverse of the following <HI>Demands,</HI> that the Ar∣ticles of <HI>Pearth,</HI> and of <HI>Episcopal Government,</HI> are declared to be abju∣red, as points of <HI>Popery,</HI> or as <HI>Popish Novations:</HI> wheras the words of the <HI>Covenant</HI> put a difference betwixt two sorts of <HI>Novations:</HI> one is of such, as are already introduced in the Worship of GOD and concer∣ning those, whatsoever be the judgement of the Subscryvers, which to every one is left free, by the words of the <HI>Covenant</HI> they are onelie bound, to forbear the practise of them, by reason of the present exi∣gence of the <HI>Kirke,</HI> till they be tryed, and allowed, in a free <HI>Generall</HI>

<P>As for the first of these two miss-takings: If you have not given out that interpretation of the <HI>Negative Confession</HI> judicially, but on∣ly have made known your own meaning, according to the minde of the Reformers, as you alleadge, then, first, your Interpretation hath no obligatory power over others; and consequently you ought not to obtrude your Interpretation upon us more then we doe our Interpre∣tation thereof upon you. Neither ought any man to be molested, or threatned, for not receiving your Interpretation; chiefly seeing all who are of your Confederation have so solemnly vowed, and promi∣sed, to be <HI>good examples to others of all Godlinesse, Sobernes, &amp; Righ∣teousnesse, and of every duty which you owe to GOD and Man.</HI> Se∣condly, as for the minde or judgement of our Reformers, we know no evidencie of it, having publicke Authoritie, to obliedge the Sub∣jects of this Kingdom, except that which is expressed in our <HI>Natio∣nall confession of Faith,</HI> ratified in Parliament twentie yeares before the <HI>Negative Confession</HI> was penned: wherein we finde no warrand or ground of such Interpretation as you bring. Thirdly, The Inter∣pretation of the <HI>Negative Confession,</HI> set down in your <HI>Covenant,</HI> as it is not publicke <HI>ratione Personae,</HI> so also not <HI>ratione medii:</HI> for it hath no Warrand, for ought we could ever perceive, either from the Word of GOD, or from the Testimony of the Ancient Church, or from the consent of other reformed Churches, or from our <HI>Nationall Con∣fession,</HI> registrated in Parliament. As for the second Misstaking, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Miss-interpretation of the words of the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> first, We mar∣vell, that a <HI>Generall Covenant</HI> appointed to be subscrived by all, lear∣ned and unlearned, should have been set down by you in such ambi∣guous


<PB N="14" REF="8"/>
tearmes. For, truely, all men here, even the most judi∣cious, doe so take your words, as if the Articles of PEARTH were in them abjured. 2. Wee have again more attentively examined the words of the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> and doe evidently perceive by them, That in the said <HI>Covenant,</HI> the Articles of PEARTH, and <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> are condemned, and abjured, as erronious, and damnable corruptions. For where you professe, <HI>and before GOD, and his Angels, and the World, solemnlie declare, that you shall labour, by all means lawfull, to recover the Liberty and purity, of the GOSPELL, as it was esta∣blished and professed before the foresaid Novations:</HI> We aske you, what is that period of time, to which your words have reference, when you promise to <HI>labour, to recover the Puritie and Liberty of the Gospell, as it was professed &amp; established before the foresaid novations?</HI> If you mean that period of time, when the <HI>Service-Booke,</HI> and <HI>Book of Canons,</HI> were urged upon you; to wit, the last year by-past in Sum∣mer, then you acknowledge, that all that time you enjoined the <HI>Pu∣rity and Liberty of the GOSPELL;</HI> and consequently, that you yet enjoy it; for no new thing hath since that time been publicklie recei∣ved, and practised in this CHURCH. If you meane (as undoubt∣edlie we thinke you doe) the time preceeding the bringing in of <HI>E∣piscopacie,</HI> and the Acts of <HI>Pearth,</HI> then you comprehend both <HI>Epis∣copacie</HI> and the Acts of PEARTH, under these <HI>Novations; for the removing whereof, you promise, to labour, according to your power:</HI> and consequentlie doe dis-allow and condemne them, even before they be tryed in a <HI>Free Assemblie,</HI> and before they be heard who maintain &amp; approve them as lawfull. 3. We may evidentlie demon∣strate this, <HI>argumento ad hominem,</HI> as we say in the Schooles: For those <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> which are abjured in the <HI>Negative Con∣fession,</HI> are also abjured in your late <HI>Covenant;</HI> which, as you say, is all one with the <HI>Negative Confession,</HI> or with the <HI>Covenant</HI> made 1581. But the <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies</HI> which were concluded in <HI>Pearth As∣semblie,</HI> are abjured, as you say, in the <HI>Covenant</HI> made 1581. and therefore they are also abjured in this your late <HI>Covenant.</HI> The first Proposition is evident: for in your late <HI>Covenant,</HI> speaking of the Oath contained in that olde <HI>Covenant,</HI> which was made <HI>Anno</HI> 1581. you professe, <HI>That the present and succeeding Generations in this Land,</HI>


<PB N="15" REF="8"/>
<HI>are bound to keep the foresaid Nationall Oath,</HI> as you call it, <HI>and Sub∣scription, unviolable.</HI> The second Proposition also cannot be deny∣ed by you: For, these twentie yeares by-bast, you have accused those who conformed themselves to the Ordinances of <HI>Pearth,</HI> of Perju∣rie; and that because they had violated the Oath made <HI>Anno</HI> 1581. in the which those Articles (as you alleadge) were abjured. But perhaps you will say to us, that wee thinke those things not to be ab∣jured in that Oath made <HI>Anno</HI> 1581. and therefore wee may swear, and subscrive your late <HI>Covenant;</HI> and, not-with-standing of our Oath and Subscription, be tyed onely to the Forbearance of the practise of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles for a time. We answere, first: The words of an Oath should be cleare, and plain: or, if they be any wayes ambigu∣ous, the true sense of them should be so declared, and manifested, that all may know it. 2. An Oath is to be given, according to the minde and judgement of him that requireth it. And therefore, seeing you who require this Oath of us, thinke the <HI>Rites</HI> or <HI>Ceremonies</HI> con∣cluded at <HI>Pearth,</HI> to be abjured in that Oath made <HI>Anno</HI> 1581. how can we sweare and sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rive your <HI>Covenant,</HI> which reneweth the fore∣said Oath, and bindeth us to it? 3. If we should sweare, and sub∣scrive the <HI>Negative Confession,</HI> as it is included in your <HI>Covenant;</HI> then ye, who thinke the Articles of <HI>Pearth</HI> to be abjured, and con∣demned in the <HI>Negative Confession,</HI> will thinke us tyed, by our own Personall Oath, to condemne the Articles of <HI>Pearth.</HI> 4. Seeing this <HI>Covenant</HI> was penned by you, who have hitherto not conformed your selves to <HI>Pearth</HI> Assemblie, and have opposed <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> and seeing you all condemn <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> as if it were that <HI>Popish</HI> or wicked <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Negative Confessiō;</HI> as also esteeme the thinges concluded in <HI>Pearth</HI> Assemblie, to be <HI>Idolatrous,</HI> or <HI>Supersti∣tious,</HI> how can we thinke, that you in your solemne vow made to God, for reformation of this Church, and resisting, in times to come, the <HI>Novations</HI> &amp; <HI>Corruptions</HI> of it, have passed by these things, which are the onely <HI>Novations</HI> already introduced by Authority, and from which, as you affirme, the Church hath so great need to be purged: chiefly, seeing ye think them as <HI>Popish Superstitious</HI> &amp; <HI>Idolatrous,</HI> as ye doe these other <HI>Novations,</HI> which are not as yet introduced. 5. If in all your Supplications, Plaints, and Protestations, ye have onelie

sought the removing and discharging of the <HI>Service Booke, Booke</HI> of <HI>Canons,</HI> and the new high Commission, not complaining of any other Novations; and seeing his Majestie hath discharged the first two, &amp; hath promised to rectifie the third, or last of them; Then, what rea∣son have ye to thinke, that his Majesty hath not satisfied your Suppli∣cations? For, all the Novations, upon which you complained, are re∣moved by his Majestie, and ye have his Princely Promise, that no further shall be urged upon us, but by such a faire and Legall way, as may fatisfie all his Subjects. 6. As for that which your <HI>Covenant,</HI> by your own Confession, requireth of us, to wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>The forbearance, and abstinence, for a time, from the practising the Articles of</HI> PEARTH; We professe sincerelie, and in the sight of GOD, that our Conscience will not suffer us, to subscrive that part of your <HI>Covenant;</HI> and that because Lawes being standing for them, and our lawfull Superioures requyring Obedience from us, by practising them, to sweare <HI>Forbea∣rance of the practise of them,</HI> is to sweare <HI>Disobedience,</HI> and, <HI>to wrong their Authority.</HI> 7.

No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that we thinke, that GOD hath tyed Himself, or His Grace, to the Sacraments; but because He hath tyed us unto them, by His Precept: and, not to use the means appoynted by GOD, when our People, or their Children stand in need of them, is a contempt of the meanes, and a tempting of GOD.</P>

<P>First, we have already told you, that we can not subscrive your Oath of Forbearance of the practise of the Articles already introdu∣ced, without violation of Authority, and of wronging our own Con∣sciences, who thinke private Baptisme and Communion, not to be indifferent, but also necessarie, in some cases, not indeed, <HI>necessitate medii,</HI> as if GOD'S Grace were tyed to the externall means, but, as we say in the Schooles, <HI>necessitate praecepti,</HI> because we are comman∣ded to use these means. 2. This late <HI>Covenant</HI> leadeth and bindeth us to the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> made 1581▪ and that old <HI>Covenant</HI> bindeth us perpetually to that <HI>Discipline</HI> which was then; that is, (as ye al∣leadge) to the whole Policie of the Church, comprehending all the externall Rites of it: and so, <HI>à primo ad ultimum,</HI> this late <HI>Covenant</HI> bindeth us to the whole Policie of the Church, which was then; and consequentlie maketh a perpetuall Law, concerning externall Rites of the Church, as if they were unchangable, All partes of this Argu∣ment are sure: for by your late <HI>Covenant,</HI> you professe your selves bound, to keepe the foresaid Nationall <HI>Oath</HI> (as you call it) invio∣lable: and that <HI>Oath,</HI> or <HI>Covenant,</HI> bindeth us, to continue <HI>In the obedience not only of the Doctrine,</HI> but also <HI>of the Discipline of this Kirke.</HI> Where by <HI>the Discipline of the Kirke,</HI> ye understand (as ye have in all your wrytings professed, especialie of late, in your Booke enti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uled, <HI>A dispute, against the English Popish Ceremonies.

Whereas by that distinction mentioned in your Answere, of things necessary to be observed, and of things variable in particular Congregations, ye insinuate that by the <HI>Keeping of the Discipline of the Kirke as it was then,</HI> to which we are bound in the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> ye understand the observation of those things which are necessary to be observed in e∣very Kirke, and not of thinges variable in particular Congregations: We aske, Into which of the Members of this distinction ye referre <HI>Episcopacie</HI> and the Articles of <HI>Pearth?</HI> that is, whether they most necessarilie be omitted in all Churches, and at all times, or not? If ye say, that they must be necessarilie omitted, and that the Negative <HI>Confession,</HI> confirmed with an <HI>Oath,</HI> doth tye us to the omission of them; then both ye would make us to sweare, and subscrive against our Consciences, (for we are perswaded, that these things are law∣full) as also ye would make us to abjure <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> and the Articles of <HI>Pearth, in perpetuum;</HI> which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>latlie contrary to your▪ Declaration in your Answeres, 1. 5. &amp;c.

<P>Your <HI>Covenant</HI> requireth more of us, then the forbearance of the practise of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, as we have often times declared. 2. We have also showne, that the forbearance of Obedience, to standing Lawes, without licience of Superiours, and contrarie to their com∣mandement, especially if it be done by deliberation, and if men tye themselves, by an Oath, to do so, is manifest Disobedience. 3. The Article of <HI>Pearth,</HI> anent Kneeling, was not grounded onelie, nor yet principally, upon that Narrative which ye mention; but rather upon the conveniencie and decencie of the gesture of Kneeling, in the re∣ceiving of the holie <HI>SACRAMENT:</HI> which reason doeth yet con∣tinue; as also the other reason which ye mention, holdeth yet: for the bodie of the People of this Church, were never <HI>Papists;</HI> and,


<PB N="25" REF="13"/>
consequently, have no memorie of Popish Superstition, as those who lived in time of Reformation. 4. We can not see, nor conceive, how a Vow and Band, of maintaining the meanest Subject of this Kingdom, against all persons whatsoever; and consequently, against the KING himself, as we have showne in our second Replye, in dis∣obedience of his Lawes, can consist with that love, reverence, and subjection, which we owe to our KING. Neither have ye brought any thing in your Answere, to satisfie us in this point. And because ye alleadge, as we heare, that ye are mistaken in this point, and doe vindicate your selves, by those words of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> wherein ye promise to maintain the KINGS Authority; we pray you to expresse your minde more fully, concerning it; and to showe us, 1. What ye meane by mantaining the KINGS Authority, in that part of your <HI>Co∣venant,</HI> wherein ye expresse your loyall Intention, To maintain the KINGS Person and Authority; and in speciall, Whether or no the maintaining of the KINGS Authoritie, be taken by you, as it exclu∣deth all resisting of his Authority, by force of Armes, even although he should command thinges unlawfull, and contrarie to the Trueth? For so we thinke it should be taken: and that it should be so taken, we are ready to demonstrate. Neither can we sweare it in anie other sense. 2. Whether your promise, of <HI>mutuall defence, In the same cause of maintayning the true Religion, and his Majesties Authori∣ty,</HI> &amp;c. ought to be understood, of <HI>the maintaining the Kings Autho∣rity absolu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elie:</HI> that is, <HI>Whether he maintaine the true Religion, or no?</HI> Or, on the contrarie; if it ought to be understood, of <HI>the main∣taining the Kings Authority conditionally, in so farre as he maintaineth the true Religion,</HI> and not any other wayes? If you say, that it is to be understoode the first way, we assent to that part of your <HI>Covenant,</HI> and have no more scruple anent it, except that one, which we men∣tioned in our <HI>Reply</HI> to your second <HI>Answere:</HI> to wit, that the words of your Protestation, seeme to import more; and, that your <HI>Paction,</HI> or <HI>Covenant,</HI> is made without the Kings privitie, and consent. If ye say, that it is to be understood the second way, then we continue urging our foresaid <HI>Demand:</HI> to wit, how a man can maintaine the Kings Authority, and withall maintaine the meanest of His Subjects, in resisting His Authority?

On the LORDS Day following, we desired to expresse our selves to the People in presence of the Ministe∣rie, but the Pulpits and Kirks were altogether refused; and therefore in the most convenient place we could have, <HI>sub dio,</HI> and at such houres as were vacant from the ordinary exercises of publicke Wor∣ship, we delivered our Message in the audience of many. After our last Sermon, towards Evening, we found that our labour was not in vain in the LORD: for dyverse persones, of speciall note, both for place and wisdome, with willing heart, and great readinesse of minde, did publicklie put their hands to the <HI>Covenant.</HI> Having the weeke following seene some parts of the Countrey, [where besides the Pres∣byteries <HI>Alforde</HI> and <HI>Deere,</HI> who had subscrived before, the Modera∣tor, and dyverse of the Presbyterie of <HI>ABERDENE,</HI> the Presbyterie and People of <HI>Turreff,</HI> after they were satisfied in some scruples, did also subscrive] we returned the next Saturnday to <HI>ABERDENE:</HI> where finding that some others had subscrived that weeke, we resolved to preach upon the morne.

<HEAD>To our Reverend Brethren, <HI>The Doctors and Ministers of</HI> Aberdene.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat our Answeres (reverend and beloved Bre∣thren) have not given you full satisfaction, as it may be imputed to our weaknesse, in the de∣fence of so good a cause, so it may proceed also from your own prejudice against what could be said by us which we have some reason to suspect for two causes, one is, that your <HI>Demands</HI> which we conceived to have been intended meerly for us, and were sent un∣to us from you in write, were published before our comming, in Print, like as ye have now printed and published your <HI>Replies</HI> before ye had seen our <HI>Answeres</HI> unto that which we received from you last in write; we having promised to the bearer, to returne an Answere shortly ere we departed the Countrey. This may seem rather to be a seek∣ing of victory from prejudice, then a search of veritie for satisfaction. The other cause of our suspicion, is, that the groundes of our <HI>An∣sweres</HI> to you, have proven satisfactorie to others, who for Age and gifts of Learning and Understanding, are pryme men in this Kirke and Kingdome, and to whom modestly will not suffer you to preferre your selves. But whether our weaknesse or your prejudice be the cause, must be now judged by others, to whose view ye have brought us: whom therefore we with you heartilie desire unpartially to con∣sider our first and second <HI>Answeres;</HI> wishing and hoping that partia∣lity, prejudice, and all worldly respects and feares, laide aside, the naked Trueth shall be seen of all her lovers.

of us, as we in love judge, that ye thinke not your selves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be stryving against the Trueth; so may ye conceive, that we can no more bee brought to your mynde, then wee can bee drawne from the profession of our Religion, as it hath been reformed, sworne, and confirmed by the late and preceeding <HI>Covenants,</HI> and from following the example of our religious Reformers, and the ma∣nie Worthies succeeding them in this Kirke, who would have been glad to have seen the dayes which we now doe see: and for which we pray, that both yee and wee may be thankefull▪ so shall it not be imputed unto us, that we have not discerned and used the day of the LORDS visitation: so shall we all rejoice together in the Day of the LORD.</P>

<HEAD>To the First Replye.</HEAD>
<P>YOur experience in your Disputes against the common Adver∣sary, wherein ye say ye are so frequent, hath (no doubt) taught you, how easie a matter it is to multiply Objections against the Trueth, and Cause of GOD: and your selves knowe, that your Objection against our Calling, and the Warrand of our comming to you, was framed, and published in Print, before it was propounded unto us, and ere our Answere could be had; but so soone as we did heare your Demands, we answered incontinent, in the humilitie and trueth of our mindes, that we were to obtrude nothing upon you, or your flock, by any particular Authority, Civill or Ecclesiasticke; but that we did come, in all meeknesse, to represent unto you the present case of this Kirke, and in love to intreat you, to joine with us, for the peace thereof; for which we trust, without wronging any lawfull Authority, we may claim the warrand of the highest and greatest Au∣thority, although we had not been sent from almost the whole Kirke and Kingdom, lawfully conveened at this time, for the preservation of Religion, and of the Liberties and Lawes of this Kingdom, so sore shaken, by the usurpation of the Prelates, and their Favourers. Let us consider one another, to provoke unto love, and to good works, &amp;c. sayeth the Apostle, <HI>Hebr.</HI> 10. 24. And where ye object,


<PB N="41" REF="21"/>
that without your leave we preached within your congregation; which is aggravated by you, as a heinous fault, both against Scripture, and against the Canons of ancient Counsels, which ye have laboriously quoted against us; we intreat you, to be more sparing, lest the guilti∣nesse, if there be any, reflex upon your selves: For your Pulpits and Kirks being denyed us (not from any injurie done by us, but by your own determination, before our comming) a necessity was laid upon us, to deliver our message in such places, as your courtesie did per∣mit; wherein no man will find, that we have failed, if he consider, first, That there is as wyde difference betwixt <HI>Ecclesia turbata &amp; pa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ata,</HI> the troubled and peaceable estate of a Kirk, as is betwixt <HI>Ec∣clesia constituenda, &amp; constituta,</HI> and many things are necessary in the one, which perhaps are not expedient in the other. Ye speake of the Constitution of the Kirke this yeare, as if ye had beene speak∣ing thereof many yeares before this time. 2. That the Word of GOD, and the Canons of Counsels, will have Pastors so to care for their owne flockes, that they forbid them not, to care for the whole Kirke, especially in the time of a common Combustion. When the house is on fire, every man ought to runne to all rowms, where hee may quench it: when a laik stricketh up in a Ship, every Mariner, yea, every Passenger, ought to labour to stop it. Even he who is not universall Pastor of the Kirke, is Pastor of the universall Kirke: &amp; the Apostle hath taught us, That we are members one of another, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 4. As all the members of one bodie being many, are one body; so also is CHRIST, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 12. That the members should have the same care, one for another, <HI>vers.</HI> 25. If some members of this Kirk had not cared more kindly, in this time of cōmon danger, then other some have done, the whole body had been ere now dan∣gerously, if not desparatly diseased. 3. That we made choise of such houres, for delivering our Message, that the people might attend your ordinary times of publick worship; which maketh your charge, of the peoples contempt, or ours, of your Ministery, to be most unjust.</P>
<P>In the second part of your <HI>Replye</HI> to our <HI>Answere</HI> to your first <HI>Demand,</HI> ye might have made choise of words witnessing more re∣spect to the most part of the Kingdom now, 'and to the Kirke in for∣mer times, then of a Confederation, and negative <HI>Confession:</HI> we


<PB N="42" REF="22"/>
know no other Confederation at this time, but this same Laudable <HI>Covenant,</HI> which our Progenitors, and many yet living, made with GOD, and amongst themselves, at the Commandement of Autho∣rity, and according to the example of the people of GOD in former times. Neither is that short <HI>Confession</HI> meerly Negative, since the beginning thereof is affirmative, and doeth virtually containe the first large <HI>Confession</HI> ratisied in Parliament, 1567. 2. No Pastors, in our knowledge, have either been forced to flee to foraigne countreys, or have been threatned with the want of their Stipends, for the re∣fusing their Subscription: but this we have heard, that some of them have of their owne accord, gone to Court, for procuring of protecti∣ons against their Creditors, and against the Lawes, and duety of good Subjects, have made lies between the KING and his People. Others we know have wilfully refused, to abide with their flock; and being earnestly intreated by them, to attend their Charge, have left them, and have gone out of the Countrey, for no reason, but because the people had subscrived; and, as ye knowe, that Arguments have been taken from augmentation of Stipends, to hinder Subscription: so ye may knowe, That fear of worldly losse, rather hindereth men to subscrive, then scruple of Conscience. The Prelates flight, seem∣eth rather to have proceeded from inward furies of accusing Consci∣ences, or for fear of a storme, (which being procured by their owne doing, may be easily prognosticated by them) then from the inforc∣ing of subscription of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> which in our knowledge was ne∣ver required of any of the Prelates, although they be grossly guilty of the breach of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> which they did sweare &amp; subscrive before. 3. Your help, by your prayers, and other means, for extinguishing of the present Combustion, we still desire, but with all intreat, that you would both joyn with the rest of the Kirkes of the Kingdome, in publicke humiliation and fasting, which the LORD himselfe doeth proclaime and call for at this time; so should your prayers be the more effectuall, and also ye be good instruments, according to your power, with your own people, and the countrey about, to joine in the <HI>Covenant,</HI> so should ye finde the worke of Pacification the more easie. 4. The reasons which we touched in our <HI>Answere,</HI> for prov∣ing, that ye might, without just offence to any, joine with us, in sub∣sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iving,


<PB N="43" REF="22"/>
are not yet answered: for, first, a sound interpretation of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> although proceeding from a private person, and alto∣gether voide of externall Authority, can not make a substantiall dif∣ference: and if the interpretation be unsound, although it were con∣firmed by Authority, it maketh not a substantiall coincidence. 2. Why is it denyed, that the former <HI>Covenant</HI> containeth mutuall defence, since all are obliedged thereby to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end Religion, according to their vocation and power, and the KINGS person and Authority, which can not possiblie be done, without mutuall defence: and since that clause of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> is so expounded, and applied upon grounds of perpetual reason, in the general Band drawn up, &amp; Printed by Authori∣ty, <HI>An.</HI> 1590. 3. Ye must either prove this <HI>Covenant</HI> to be substantially different from the former, which is impossible, or ye must acknow∣ledge this to have the same Authority with the former, since we are really obliedged in the former <HI>Covenant,</HI> and virtually the same war∣rand of KING, Counsell, and assemblie, remaineth, and was never yet discharged: by vertue whereof the <HI>Covenant</HI> might have beene renewed yearly, by all the subjects of the Kingdome, no lesse then it hath beene subscrived yearly by such as passe degrees in Colledges, and such as were suspect of Papistrie, from time to time. 4. What was done by his Majesties Commissioner, was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> done in a corner, that it needeth to be pryed into, or doubted of, and what was allowed by his Grace, who had so great power from his Majesty, to declare his Majesties will, and to receive Declarations from his subjects, and who was in every poynt so zealous and tender of his Majesties ser∣vice and honour: who are ye, that it should be dissallowed by you? Ye will have the Kingdome guilty of combination against Authority, and will not have the KING to be satisfied, when they have decla∣red themselves to the contrary, and their Declaration is accepted by his Majesties Commissioner. This manner of dealing, is more sutable to Papists, and such Incendaries, then for you, who desire to prove good Patriots, in using all means of Pacification. 5. We are sory, that ye should be the first, who have accounted our <HI>Covenant</HI> to be a confederacie against the Trueth, since some of your selves, and all every where have been constrained, to acknowledge, that they aime <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the same end with us, to maintaine the Trueth. And for that


<PB N="44" REF="23"/>
which displeaseth you in our way, that we deale after such a manner with people, to come in, we answere, that we have seen in this Land, the Day of the LORDS Power, wherein his people have most wil∣lingly offered themselves in multitudes, like the dew of the morning: that others of no small Note, have offered their subscriptions, and have been refused, till tyme should try, that they joine in sincerity, from love to the cause, and not from the feare of men: and that no threatnings have been used, except of the deserved judgement of GOD; nor force, except the force of reason, from the high respects which we owe to Religion, to our KING, to our native Countrey, to our selves, and to the Posterity; which hath been to some a grea∣ter constraint, then any externall violence; and we wish, may pre∣vaile also with you.</P>

<HEAD>To the Second.</HEAD>
<P>VVEE perceive, that ye passe in silence, that which we an∣swered concerning the preventing of trouble, which by all appearance had been too sensible to many before this time, if the Conventions censured by you, had not been kept; we desire, that ye would here declare your selves, whether ye would have rather recei∣ved the <HI>Service Booke, Booke</HI> of <HI>Canons,</HI> and other trash of that kind, tending to the subversion of Religion, and to the prejudice of the Liberties of the Kingdom, then to have conveened in a peaceable manner, to present Supplications to his Majestie, for averting of so great evils. Neither doe ye speak a word of the saying of K. <HI>Iames,</HI> which ought to be regarded, both for the witnesse sake, who is of so great authority, and for the testimony which containeth so great rea∣son. For, shall not the whole body of a Kingdom stirre <HI>pro aris &amp; focis?</HI> or shall our Religion be ruined, and our Light be put out, and all men holde their peace? We told you also, that the first part of the Act of Parliament, 1585, is relative to another Act in Queen <HI>Maries</HI> time, which specifieth, what sort of Leagues and Bands are forbidden, and setteth us free from the breach of the Act: but yee


<PB N="45" REF="23"/>
have answered nothing to this, and still dispute from the Act of Par∣liament, rather then from other grounds, better beseeming your Profession, and ours; and in this will so precisely adhere to the letter of the Law, that you will have no meetings, without the KINGS consent, even in the case of the preservation of Religion, of his Ma∣jesties Authority, and of the liberties of the Kingdome, which we are sure must be contrary to the reason and life of the Law; since the safetie of the People is, the Soveraigne Law. Although it be true also that for our <HI>Covenant,</HI> we have the consent of Authority pres∣sing upon all the subjects in the generall Band, and confession of Faith, formerly subscrived for maintenance of the Religion, their subscrip∣tion and Oath as a note of their soundnesse in Religion, and of their loyaltie and fidelitie to the KING, and his Crown, wherein <HI>Iuris∣consults,</HI> more skilled in this kinde, then we need to be, have given their <HI>Responses</HI> and <HI>Verdicts,</HI> in favours of us, and of our cause.</P>
<P N="2">2. The poynt touching Authority, is so full of Thornes and Rockes, useth to be so vehemently urged, to procure envye against the Gos∣pell of CHRIST, and can so hardly be disputed and discussed, ex∣cept in a large Treatise, to the satisfaction of Kings and Kingdomes; and all having interest, that for the present we only wish you to heare the testimonies of two grave Divynes, the one is <HI>Whittaker,</HI> in his Answere to Master <HI>Reynolds</HI> preface, <HI>pag.</HI> 6. Stirres and Tumults for matter of Religion, <HI>Reynold</HI> rehearseth, that hath been in <HI>Ger∣manie, France, Bohemia,</HI> as though it were sufficient for their con∣demnation, that they once resisted, and did not by and by admit whatsover violence was offered, either to GODS Trueth, or to them∣selves, contrary to Promise, to Oath, to publicke Edicts, to Law, whereby they were warranded to doe as they did: more of this mat∣ter, will I not answere, being of another nature, and cleared long since from the cryme of Rebellion, not only by just defence of their doe∣ing, but also by the Proclamations and Edicts of Princes themselves. The other is <HI>Bilson,</HI> in his Booke of Christian subjecton, in defence of the Protestants in other Countreys, against the objection of the <HI>Iesuit, Pag.</HI> 332. affirming, that subjects may defend their ancient and Christian liberties covenanted and agreed upon by those Princes to whom they first submitted themselves, and were ever since con∣firmed


<PB N="46" REF="24"/>
and allowed by the Kings that have succeeded, they may re∣quyre their own right, save their own lives, beseech, that they be not used as slaves, but like subjects; like men, not like beasts; that they may be convented by Lawes, before judges; not murdered in corners, by Inqusitors. This is also the judgement of <HI>Rivetus</HI> in his Commentarie, <HI>Psal.</HI> 68. which being looked upon by you, will furnish a full answere to what ye have cited at length from his <HI>Ie∣suita Vapulans.</HI> For betwixt Jesuiticall treasonable and pernitious doctrine, and practises against Princes and Magistrats, refuted by him, and the loyall and sound doctrine of Protestants, your selves know the difference and opposition, like as it is cleare as the Sunne, by that short Confession, by the Application thereof, to the times in this present Confession, by our publicke Protestation, and by the De∣claration exhibited to his Majesties Commissioner, that we meane not only mutuall concurrence, and asistance in the cause of Religion, but also to the uttermost of our power, to defend the KINGS Ma∣jestie his Person and Authority. We would be glade, that ye and others were witnesses to our private Prayers, and the most secret of our thoughts and affections, concerning our loyaltie to our dread Soveraigne; so should ye either cease to write in this sort against us, or be forced to write against your own Consciences.</P>
<P N="3">3. When we justifie our <HI>Conventions</HI> and <HI>Covenants,</HI> from their purposed ends, we meane not only the last and most remote ends, but the nearest and immediate, and if nothing in these can merite just censure, the <HI>Conventions</HI> and <HI>Covenants</HI> no more in that which ye call the Object, nor in their ends, can be culpable: what Aspersions have been put upon our Reformation, and Reformers, by the malice of our Adversaries, can not be unknown to you.

<P>YEE doe well and wisely, that ye search not curiously into the myndes of Princes, and Reasons of State: but whether all his


<PB N="47" REF="24"/>
Majesties subjects be satisfied with the last Proclamation, needeth, no deep search. For although possiblie some had been more pleased with a Proclamation, commanding the <HI>Service Booke,</HI> such especially who neither will see no errours in it, or have publickly professed, that they have been groaning for it, yet the Protestation of the Suppli∣cants against it, as it giveth most humble and hearty thanks to His gracious Majestie, for what is granted; so it testifieth upon undeny∣able evidences, that the Proclamation is not a satisfaction of our just desires: for, first, the Proclamation supposeth the <HI>Service Booke</HI> to be no Innovation of Religion. 2. That it is not contrary to the Pro∣testant Religion. 3. That the Proclamation giveth not order for discharging all the Acts made in favours of the <HI>Service Booke,</HI> espe∣cially that of the 19 of <HI>February,</HI> which giveth unto it so high Appro∣bation, as serving for mantaining the true Religion, and to beat out all Superstition, and no wayes to be contrary to the Lawes of this Kingdom; but to be compyled and approved for the universall use and edification of all His Majesties Subjects. 4. It is so farre from disallowing the said Booke, that it putteth us in feare, that it shall be prest in a faire and legal way, and therefore, notwithstanding the Pro∣clamation, the necessity of Covenanting, which containeth nothing contrary to the Acts of Parliament, nor to the duety of good Subjects▪ but is the largest Testimony of our Fidelity to GOD, and loyaltie to our KING, (whatsoever it may seem to you to import) doeth yet continue, that His Majestie may be pleased, to grant the full satis∣faction of our reasonable Petitions, and that our Religion, and Liber∣ties, may be preserved for afterwards. Whosoever professe them∣selves, to be perfectly satisfied with the Proclamation, doe proclaim in the ears of all the Kingdom, that they are better pleased with the <HI>Service Booke</HI> and <HI>Canons,</HI> then with the Religion, as it hath beene professed in this Land since the Reformation.</P>

<HEAD>To the Fourth.</HEAD>
<P>VVEE were assured, that your <HI>Demand</HI> proceeded from a Mistaking, and therefore, according to our knowledge,


<PB N="48" REF="25"/>
did ingenuously, for your satisfaction, expound unto you the minde of the Subscrivers; but finde now, that we have laboured in vain, at your hands, from which we have received this <HI>Reply;</HI> unto which, concerning the first Miss-interpretation, we answere: 1. That al∣though we doe neither use threatnings, nor obtrude our Interpretati∣on upon you, as bearing any obligatory Power, yet pardon us, that we march you not, and put you not in the Ballance with the greatest part of the Kingdom, both Ministers, and others, in whose name we recommend this Interpretation unto you, by all faire Means, and force of Reason: and in so doing, wee are so farre from the breach of our Solemne Vow, and Promise, that we esteeme this to be no small proofe of that godlinesse, and righteousnesse, wherein we are bound, by our <HI>Covenant,</HI> to walke. 2. The autori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ative judgement of our Reformers, and Predicessors, is evidenced, not onely by the <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI> ratified in Parliament, but also by the Books of Discipline, Acts of Generall Assemblies, and their own Writs; where∣in, if ye will, ye may find warr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd for this Interpretation; and in re∣spect whereof, it is publick <HI>ratione medii,</HI> besides those midses of Scripture, of Antiquity, and of the Consent of the Reformed Kirks, which are named for midses by you.</P>
<P>Concerning the 2 Missconstruction, it is no marvell that Pre∣judices, and Preconceived Opinions, possessing the minde, make men to fall upon Interpretations of their own; but in the South parts of the Kingdom, where many learned and judicious men, both Pa∣stors, and Professors, were assembled, at the first subscriving thereof, we remember of none that did fall into that Misstake. And the two sorts of Novations, such as are already introduced, and such as are supplicated against, are so punctually distinguished, that there is no place left to Ambiguitie: but on the contrary, the Novations which we promise to forbeare for a time onely, cannot be supposed in the following words, to be abjured for ever, as Popish Novations. 2. U∣pon a new examination of the words, ye perceive, that the Articles of <HI>Pearth,</HI> and Episcopacy, are condemned as erronious Corrupti∣ons, because we promise, to labour, to recover the former purity &amp; libertie of the Gospell: unto which our Answere is, that it appeareth, that you will have all the <HI>Covenanters</HI> against their intention, and


<PB N="49" REF="25"/>
whether they will or not, to disallow, and condemn, the Articles of <HI>Pearth,</HI> and Episcopall Government, lest they be tryed in a Gene∣rall Assembly: but it is knowne to many hundreds, that the words were purposelie conceived, for satisfaction of such as were of your judgement, that we might all joine in one heart, and <HI>Covenant,</HI> for establishing Religion, and opposing Erroures. And for your Argu∣ment, whether the Articles of <HI>Pearth,</HI> and Episcopacy, be against the purity and liberty of the Gospel, or not, which is not determined by these words of the <HI>Covenant:</HI> but it cannot be denyed, first, That if in a Free Assembly, they be found to be against the purity and liber∣ty of the Gospell, they ought to be abolished: in the meane time, it being left free, by the words of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> to all, who will, to stand to the defence of their lawfulnesse. Secondly, how can it be denied, that many corruptions, contrary to the purity and liberty of the Gospell, were they never so innocent in themselves, have accom∣panyed these Novations, such as the superstious observation of Daies, feriation and cessation from worke, on those dayes, Feasting, Guysing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> many grosse abusses have entered in the Sa∣crament, upon Kneeling before the Elements, and upon the lawlesse usurpation of Prelates: in respect whereof, even they who allow of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacy, may swear to recover the purity of the Gospell. And thirdly, who can be so great a stranger at home, as to deny, that many corruptions of Popery, and Arminianism, have entred in, in the Kirke, and have been vented, and defended, in schooles, and Pulpits; by reason whereof, we are bound, every one of us, according to the measure of our light, to labour for recovery of our former Purity? And therefore, if you had cast your eyes upon the condition of this poore Kirke, as ye have pryed narrowly, into the ex∣pressions of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> ye might have spared both your owne la∣bour, and ours, and not laboured to skarre both your selves and others, with this shadow.</P>
<P>In your Argument, <HI>ad hominem,</HI> you should have considered, that whatsoever be our judgement, as we are particular persons, yet, at this time, we were to be taken, as Commissioners, from the whole company of Subscrivers, who, about this point, are of different judge∣ments: and if some of your own judgement, had either come alone


<PB N="50" REF="26"/>
in our place, or had been joined in Commission with us, we had anti∣cipate your Objection: and this ye have been forced to see; and so your selves, in propounding your Objection, have answered your own Syllogisme, in making us to say, that ye may sweare and sub∣scrive seeing ye thinke not these things to be abjured in that Oath made <HI>Anno</HI> 1581: neither was it for you, to inquire in our private Opinion, nor necessary for us, to make it knowne, but to have con∣ceived of our minds, according to our Commission, and the will of those who sent us. Your Arguments need to be no impediments un∣to your swearing of the <HI>Covenant.</HI> For upon your grounds, ye would not have sworne the short <HI>Confession,</HI> any time bypast: yea, ye can not sweare the Confession of any Kirke; nay, not the Articles of the <HI>Creed,</HI> because of the diverse Interpretations of the Article of <HI>Christs descent into Hell;</HI> or swearing them in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> ye be∣hoved to sweare them in diverse senses. There be some words of the <HI>Lords Prayer,</HI> as <HI>Give us this day our daily bread;</HI> and of the ten <HI>Com∣mands,</HI> as the words of the fourth Command, which are diversly un∣derstood; must Christians, therefore, forbeare to joine in saying the Prayer, or swearing Obedience to the Commandements? Neither for this doe we admit any Ambiguity, or Equivocation: the words certainly have but one true sense, and signification, but diverse per∣sons conceive and understand them, according to the different mea∣sures of their light. Since then your Disputation is builded upon such a Supposition, it must either fall to the ground, or hardly can any <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI> or religious <HI>Covenant,</HI> be sworne. Offend not, therefore, if we in modesty, present unto you, a dish of your owne dressing; we meane, the like Argument, <HI>ad hominem.</HI> The Rites and Ceremonies, which are not abjured in the negative <HI>Confession,</HI> are not abjured in this late <HI>Covenant.</HI> But the Rites and Ceremonies, which were concluded in <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly, are not abjured, as ye say, in the negative <HI>Confession,</HI> made <HI>Anno</HI> 1581: therefore, they are not ab∣jured in this late <HI>Covenant.</HI> The first Proposition is evident, because in the late <HI>Covenant</HI> we are bound no furder, concerning the nega∣tive <HI>Confession,</HI> but to keep it inviolable: and therefore, what Rites are not abjured there, are not abjured here.

thouhgt your selves free of Perjury, notwithstanding of the Oath in 1581, and of your conforming your selves, to the Ordinances of <HI>Pearth.</HI> And whereas ye alleadge, afterward, as before, that our Supplications are satisfied, the contrary is knowne, by our publicke Protestation, and by our last Supplication, and Complaint, presented to his Majesties Commissioner. And urging of the <HI>Service Booke,</HI> was a sufficient reason, for forbearance of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, till an As∣sembly; at which time it may be determined, whether it be expedi∣ent, that this Kirke be any more troubled with them. Neither nee∣deth your Conscience to hinder you to subscrive the forbearance of these Novations, as if swearing of forbearance, were a swearing disobedience to Authority: first, Because the swearing of forbearance of a thing in your opinion, indifferent, in the case of Scandall, and of sensible feare in others, of Superstition, is the swearing of Obedi∣ence the Commandement of GOD, which forbiddeth us, to destroy him, for whom Christ died, although man should cōmand the contrary. 2. Because the Articles of <HI>Pearth</HI> were concluded, for satisfying the KING, and not to presse any man with the practise of them, as was openly professed unto the Opponents, before the face of the whole Assembly: and because the Act it selfe giveth warrand, to forbeare the practise at this time, when the memory of superstition is revived which maketh us to thinke, that they who have forborne the pra∣ctise of these Articles, since the superstitious service Booke was com∣plained upon, make most truelie conscience of obedience of the Act of <HI>Pearth,</HI> and Parliament, ratifying the same, and are most conforme unto the Confession of Faith, ratified in Parliament, declaring, that Ceremonies ought to be changed, when they rather foster su∣perstition, then edifie the Kirke, using the same. Last of all; Ye say, ye can not sweare forbearance, because ye can not abstaine from private Baptisme, and private Communion; where we perceive, that in your judgement, private Baptisme and Communion, are not any more things indifferent, but necessary, <HI>necessitate praecepti,</HI> in so farre, that the not using of them, is a contempt of the means, and a tempt∣ing of GOD. By this your Doctrine, first, The state of the Que∣stion, anent <HI>Pearth</HI> Arricles, is quite altered▪ for ye, and your Asso∣ciates, did ever, to this time, alleadge the Question, to be of thinges


<PB N="52" REF="27"/>
indifferent: but now ye finde some of them so necessary, that altho the generall Assembly of the Kirk, should discharge them, yet ye be∣hoved still, for conscience of the Commandement of GOD, to pra∣ctise them. If ye have the same judgement of kneeling before the Elements, and of festivall dayes, it commeth to passe amongst us, which hath been incident to the Kirke, informer Ages, that thinges have been first brought in, as indifferent, then urged as necessary. If confirmation also in your judgement, be not indifferent, but ne∣cessary, we desire to understand, with what conscience it hath beene slighted, and utterly neglected by the Prelates, these 20 yeares past? and how it is, that ye have carried so small regard to the Canon of the Kirke, and Act of Parliament, and to the benefite of young Children, as not to requyre, urge, and presse the practise thereof, both in your own charge, and throughout the whole Kirke? This would seem to be partiall dealing, to presse some Ceremonies, and neglect other some; while both by the same Canon of the Kirke, and Act of Parliament, are appointed. 2. Ye doe hereby condemne the practise of the Kirke of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the time of Reformation, till <HI>Pearth</HI> Assemblie, and put no small guiltinesse upon other refor∣med Kirkes, who use not that at all, but rather abstaine from it, as dangerous, which ye now doe professe, to be so necessary. 3. We wish you wisely to consider, whence it is, and what can be the true cause, that ye living in that part of the Kingdome, should be more pressed by the people, with the practise of private Baptisme, and Communion, then all the Kirkes in the Kingdome beside, where these twenty yeares past, rarely any such motion hath been made: is it not because that Popery prevaileth there, and the people have a superstitious conceat of Baptisme and Communion, as absolutely ne∣cessary to Salvation; as if GOD had tyed his grace to the Sacra∣ments; and children dying without Baptisme, and others without their last <HI>Viaticum,</HI> did perish? Thus ye minister the Sacraments in private, as necessary, <HI>Necessitate praecepti;</HI> and the people seeme to desire, and receive them, as necessary, <HI>Necessitate medii:</HI> an Evill very curable, in that citie where the Assemblies of the people, for publicke worship, are frequent, wherein the Sacraments might be ministred frequently enough, with great solemnity, and edification,


<PB N="53" REF="27"/>
4. And though we doe not deny, but Baptisme privatlie ministred, by the Minister of CHRIST, according to the Institution, be true Bap∣tisme, and, that a childe thus privately baptized, be not to be baptized againe, (although it be true also, that private Baptisme maketh way to this Errour of Re-baptizing:) yet we hold, that the necessitie of the Commandement, standeth only for Baptisme in publick, since no precept requyreth Baptisme, but when the ministration thereof can be had orderly, with all the circumstances requisite; whereof this is one, that it be ministred in the presence of that visible kirke, where∣of the children are to be members: for not only the minister of Baptisme, and the parents of the children, but the Congregation also hath interest in the baptisme of every member that entereth in their communion: which therefore, ought to be a publick action, no lesse then the cutting off of a rotten member, by Excommunication, ought to be done publickly. 5. It is known, that private Baptisme hath bred, and fostred the opinion of absolute necessitie of Baptisme, of Baptisme by Women, and private persons, of Baptisme by supposi∣tion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and, that the ministration of the Sacraments, in private places, hath been, and is, the ready way to bring people to the con∣tempt and neglect of the Sacraments in publicke, and to the propha∣nation thereof in private. 6. When all the forms of ministration of Baptisme, shall be compared, both that of the ancient Kirke, keeping <HI>Easter,</HI> and <HI>Pentecost,</HI> for the solemne times of Baptisme, and the other of the Popish kirke, and other kirkes, not well purged of the dregs of Popery, ministring Baptisme and Communion at all times, in private places, and before few persons; it shall be found, that no better course could be taken, then that which hath been wisely ap∣pointed and observed, in the Kirke of <HI>Scotland,</HI> since the Reforma∣tion; that the Sacraments be ministred in the ordinary meetings of GODS People; unto which they had regard, and not unto the places of materiall Kirkes: which we adde, lest any should thinke, that we entertained any superstitious conceat of places.</P>

<P>TO the first Exception, we have even now answered, and need to adde no farder, concerning private Baptisme and Commu∣nion. 2. We looked, that your Argument, <HI>ad hominem,</HI> had beene closed in the fourth <HI>Reply,</HI> and wish, what ye had to say, against the Dispute, of Popish <HI>English</HI> Ceremonies, or any other Treatise of that kinde, or any of us in particular, had been keept to another time: for, would any of us, refuse to sweare the short <HI>Confession,</HI> because ye have expounded some Articles thereof, contrary to our minde? Our desire is, that ye keep your own meaning of the negative <HI>Confession,</HI> and we keep ours, according to our diverse measures of light; and, that both sides promise, Forbearance, as is required in the <HI>Covenant,</HI> which may very well stand both with your meaning, and ours: of ours, there is no question; and of yours, there needeth none to be moved by you, since ye thinke them indifferent: and therefore, in such a case, may promise, to forbeare them. From this ground, and from the diffe∣rent use of the word Discipline, and Policy, it is easie to answere, both your <HI>Sorites,</HI> and <HI>Dilemma:</HI> for the late <HI>Covenant</HI> bindeth you to keep the former, according to the common meaning of the Sub∣scrivers; and not according to your Interpretation or ours, in parti∣cular: and the horns of your <HI>Dilemma,</HI> may be turned about against your selves: for we aske of you, Unto which of the members of the Distinction doe ye referre Episcopacy, and the Articles of <HI>Pearth?</HI> if they were abjured for ever, before <HI>Pearth▪</HI> Assembly, how is it that ye have admitted and practised them, since that time; for this were Perjury? And if they were not abjured, but by the short <HI>Confession</HI> were left indifferent, why may ye not, for any impediment ye have from that <HI>Confession,</HI> forbeare now the practise of them? We look∣ed not for Velitations of this sort, which the change of Commissio∣ners sent unto you, might have prevented, but for some solide and grave reasons, why ye could not subscrive the <HI>Covenant,</HI> whether pre∣sented from our hands, or the hands of others, our Learned and reve∣rend <HI>Brethren,</HI> of your practise and judgement, who might have


<PB N="55" REF="28"/>
beene sent unto you in our place. In the meane time, because ma∣nie are intangled with the word of Discipline, and Policie, we desire the Reader to remember, that sometime the word is taken for the Rule of Government of the Kirke, and censure of Manners, by Of∣fice bearers appointed by Christ; and thus it is unchangeable: some∣times for the constitutions of Counsels, and Acts of Parliament, a∣bout matters of Religion; and thus it is alterable, or constant, accor∣ding to the nature of particular Obiects: and thirdly, it is taken for the ordering of the circumstances, to be observed in all actions Di∣vine, and Humane; and thus it is variable. We appeale with you, to the indifferent Reader, who is judicious, whether it be necessarie for your Subscription, to know our Opinion of such Rites and Cere∣monies, as are not of Divine institution. We have reason, [for any thing that ever we heard to the contrary, these twenty years past] to cleave unto the words of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> concerning such Rites as are brought into the Kirke without, or against the word of GOD. The Blessing of Marriage (now the second time instanced) we conceive, neither to be circumstance, it being neither time, place, order of doing, nor any such thing, nor a Ceremony properly so called, more then the Blessing of the People, commanded in the Law, and practi∣sed before the Law, or praying for a Blessing upon the Ordinance of GOD, that it may be sanctified unto His People: we neither exalt Marriage so high, as with the Papists, to thinke it a Sacrament; nor doe we abase it so low, as to thinke it a paction or contract, meerely Civill, it being the Covenant of GOD, which cannot be disolved by consent of the parties, as other civill Contracts may be: and there∣fore, as we will not use it superstitiously, according to the prescript of the <HI>Service Booke;</HI> so will we not for the abuse of Popery, although it were a Paction meerely civill, it being so important, with-holde Ecclesiasticke Benediction from it.</P>

We deny not, but Divines, both ancient and moderne, are against us, concerning the lawfulnesse of the thinges contraverted: but we withall affirme, first, that Divines, both ancient and moderne, are against you also; and both may be true, for both are but proposi∣tions indefinite, in a matter contingent. 2.

This other that ye propound, con∣cerning our conception and meaning of the short <HI>Confession,</HI> may be as easily removed, if ye will once believe, that we urge not upon you our meaning but leave you to your own, till the matter be examined in an Assemblie. 2. Ye call some of those Novarions, necessarie; but without warrand of that Assembly which concluded then, as in∣different, and all the rest you will have to be laud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble: thus by pro∣gresse of time, things formerly indifferent, become necessary; and what was but lawfull before, and had much adoe to gaine that repu∣tation,

is now become laudable; where ye plainly discover the cause of your unwillingnesse to subscrive, not so much to be the commande∣ment of Authority, as the necessity and excellency of the things com∣manded.

We observe, that ye have not answered our Argument, for our swearing the de∣fence of the KING, and his Authority, with a specification, which ye call a limitation; wherein we have followed the Confession of Faith, ratified in Parliament, the KINGS Confession, and act of Parlia∣ment; upon which ye will not doe well, to fasten so foule Imputa∣tions, and put so hard constructions, as ye doe, upon us, for inserting in our <HI>Covenant,</HI> what they have said before us. If our specification be right, why censure you it? If it be wrong, why fasten ye not your censures upon the fountaine from which it is derived? the loyalty of our intentions, to maintain the KINGS Person, and Honour, is so fully expressed, that it hath given content to those who are nearest his Majesty: and we should wrong, not only them, but also the <HI>Cove∣nant,</HI> and the subscrivers thereof, if we should make new Declara∣tions to others, of greater distance, who wrong both the KING, and themselves, in craving them. 3.

<P>FIrst, We are ashamed, to draw this Rug-saw of contention, to and fro, in a continuall Reciprocation, concerning the forbea∣rance of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles: and therefore, forbearing to doe so any more, we referre the Reader to our former Answeres. 2. We doe not affirme, that the only reason, why kneeling was appointed, was because all memory of superstition was past. There be indeed other reasons expressed in the Act, but such as the Authors thereof may be ashamed of, as both perverting the Text, <HI>Psal.</HI> 95. as making kneel∣ing to be necessary, in every part of GODS Worship, and as giving matter to many Treatises, proving kneeling before the Elements, to be Idolatrie, according to the Act, unto which we now referre you: but this we say, (which is manifest by the Act it selfe) that in the case of present superstition, or feare thereof, all other reasons had not beene forcible, to enforce kneeling then, nor can have force to con∣tinue kneeling now. This feare hath beene great, this year by past, throughout the Kingdom, by reason of the many superstitions of the <HI>Service Booke,</HI> which, it may be, ye no more acknowledge, then ye doe the superstitious dispositiō of the people, because they are not that which they were at the time of Reformation. 3. We would heare what malice it selfe can say against the words of the Protestation, <HI>That it shall be lawfull unto us, to defend Religion, and the</HI> KINGS <HI>Authority, in defence thereof, and every one of us of another, in that cause of maintaining Religion, and the</HI> KINGS <HI>foresaid Authority, and to appoynt, and hold meetings, to that end;</HI> like as our Proceedings have beene in themselves most necessary and orderly means, agreable to the lawes and practise of this Kirke and Kingdom, to be comen∣ded, as reall duties of faithfull Christians, loyall subjects, and sensible members of the body of the Kirke and Kingdome, and tende to no other end, but to the preservation of Religion, and maintainance of the KINGS Authority. To your interrogatoures, (which ye seeme to propone, rather to be snares to us, then for satisfaction to your selves) we answere once for all in generall, that if this were the op∣portunitie


<PB N="59" REF="30"/>
of that disputation, we shall be found to deny nothing unto Authority of that which the word of GOD, the law of Nature, and Nations, the Acts of Parliament, these Royalists, sound Divines, and loyall Subjects, give unto Kings and Princes GODS <HI>Vice-Gerents</HI> on Earth; and that not from respect to our selves, but to the Ordinance of GOD, by whom Kings reigne. But seeing so oft and so instantly, you presse us in this point, ye force us mutually to propone to you such Questions, as, it may be, ye will have no great delight to answere. 1. We desire to understand of you, whether ye allow, or disallow, the <HI>Service Booke,</HI> and booke of <HI>Canons?</HI> if ye disallow them, as an in∣novation of Religion, why have ye not either joined in supplication with the rest of the Kingdome, or made a supplication of your own, against them, or some other way testified your Dislike? Next; whether it be pertinent for men of your place and Qualitie, to move Questions of State, touching the Power of Princes, and Li∣berties of Subjects, after His Majesties Commissioner, and wise States-men, have received Satisfaction of the Subjects, for suppres∣sing such motions as yours? 3. Whether doe the Subscrivers more tender His Majesties honour, by supposing his constancy, in professi∣on of Religion, and equitable Disposition, in ministration of Justice; or ye, who suppose he shall fall upon his Religious and Loyall Sub∣jects, with force of Armes, contrary to both? 4. Whether the joyn∣ing of the whole Kingdom, in the Subscription of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> or the entertaining of Division, by your writing, preaching, and threat∣ning of your People, otherwise willing to joine, be a more readie meane to settle the present Commotions of the Kirke, and King∣dom? 5. If the Prelates, and their Followers, labouring to intro∣duce Popery in the Land, make a Faction by themselves, or as the <HI>Guisians</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> did abuse His Majesties name, in execution of the bloody Decrees of <HI>Trent,</HI> (which GOD forbid) we aske, Whether in such a Case, the lawfull defence of the body of the Kingdom, a∣gainst such a Faction, be a resisting of the Magistrate, and a taking Armes against the KING? If ye affirme it to be, is not this to take part with a Faction, seeking their own ends, against the common∣wealth of the Kirke, and Kingdom, and honour of the KING? If ye say not, Why then sinde ye fault with our Protestation, of defending


<PB N="60" REF="31" MS="y"/>
the Religion, Liberties, and Lawes of the Kingdom, of the Kings Au∣thority, in defence thereof, and every one of us of another, and in that cause, as if it were an unlawfull Combination against Authority? 6. Whether doe ye think Christian Magistrats to be of so absolute &amp; unbounded power, notwithstanding of any promise or paction made with the Subjects at their Coronation, or of any Law made for esta∣blishing their Religion and Liberties, that there is nothing left, but suffering of Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yrdome, in the case of publick Invasion, of their Religion and Liberties? If ye thinke, that any defence, is lawfull, why misconstrue yee the Subscrivers of the <HI>Covenant?</HI> If not, how can ye be free of Flattery, and of stirring up Princes against their loy∣all Subjects, for such ends as your selves know best? We verily be∣lieve, that ye shall report small thanks, either of so good and just a KING, or of so duetifull Subjects, for entering within these Lists.

The laudable means of Preaching, Praying, &amp;c. which we wish may be still in all faithfulnesse used by you, may very well agree with the renewing of our <HI>Covenant</HI> with GOD; and both being joined, have, in a short time past, produced more powerfull effects, to the comfort of many thousands, then all our Prayers and Preach∣ing hath done for a long time before: which testifie, That, as it is

<P>FIrst; we have ever preached according to our measure, and have given example of reverence to Authority, and the LORDS Service: but we neither acknowledge the usurped Authority of prelates, for lawfull Authority, nor the <HI>Service Booke,</HI> for the Lords Service. And therefore, it was so much the more intollerable for the Prelates, without Authority from the Kirke, or Parliament, to bring in the <HI>Service Booke</HI> into GODS own house, upon the LORDS own Day. Which maketh it nothing strange, that people zealous of the Trueth, and of the Service of GOD, were stirred up, to oppose: and we are very confident, that these who have opposed, doe beare as loyall respect to the KINGS Majesty, and will be as loath to provoke him to just wrath, as their opposites are. In the meane time, why doe ye not acknowledge, that the children were higher provoked to wrath, by the Prelates, whom ye account reverend and holy Fathers? 2. As the preservation of our own private Possession, from Invasion of o∣thers, belongeth to our selves, under the KINGS Protection; so the keeping of GODS House, from Pollution, and Superstition, belong∣eth to Authority, to the community of the Faithfull, and to every one in his own place, and order. 3. We told you before, that we did no more allow violences of that kinde, nor we did allow the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oule asper∣sions of Rebellion, Heresie, Schisme and Perjury, put upon the Noble∣men, (and remnant Covenanters.) And where ye aske of us, Why these tumults are not publickly by us condemned, and rebuked? we


<PB N="63" REF="32"/>
aske againe of you, why ye did not condemne and rebuke such dealing, since that is no lesse transgression, both against the sixt and nynth Command, then the other is against the sixt? And whereas ye are now so peremptorie, in drawing a Declaration from us, answearable to that which ye have given concerning the foresaid Aspersions and Calumnies, we having no commission, to declare the mindes of o∣thers in this point, or to give Documents, for our own private judge∣ment, doe heartily disallow every wrong of that kynde. As for the Apologie of D. JOHN FORBES of <HI>Corse,</HI> seeing the wrong hath been done not unto some few particular persons, such as ye say have been wronged by some of the people; but unto the body of the King∣dome, consisting of Noble-men, Barons▪ <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who are highly offended thereby, it were in us Presumption, and without the bounds of our Calling, to take upon us, to receive any Declaration of that kinde, especially wherein so many thinges are reprovable; as first, That his bitter speaches were occasioned by some printed Bookes, affirming, that Episcopacy, and <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, were Anti∣christian, and abominable. Supposing it were true, did he thinke the Noblemen, and whole Covenanters, to be the Authors of those Books? And was this dealing agreable to that Christian meeknesse so much required of us before? The Writers of those printed Books, are not the first who have spoken so: For Master KNOX spared not, (in a Letter of his) to call this kneeling, <HI>A Diabolicall Invention.</HI> Se∣condly; The swearing of Forbearance of the practise of <HI>Pearth</HI> Ar∣ticles, and the Confirmation of the said Doctrine, which we neither deny, nor affirme, to be imported in the olde <HI>Covenant,</HI> but only in the Interpretation thereof, we declare, That Promise is only made, to forbeare for a time, doth not deserve so bitter a Censure as this a∣pologie beareth upon us. 3.

<P>YEE pretended a threefolde Scandall, which should follow upon your Subscription: 1. The Scandall of Dissenting from other Reformed Kirks, and famous Divynes. 2. The Scandall of Dissenting from Authority. 3. The Scandall of Perjury. We an∣swered, That the contraverted words of the <HI>Covenant</HI> being rightly conceived, and interpreted according to their true meaning, and not after the glosse which ye have put upon them, doe put you out of dan∣ger of all the three Scandalls, which ye seem to acknowledge of the first two, and may by the like reason acknowledge of the third, of Perjury. We dispute not of the lawfulnesse of the Oath given at your Admission, by what Authority it was exacted, with what conscience it was given, nor how ye can answere for the Scandall risen thereu∣pon: but conceiving it according to your own grounds, none of you will say, that ye have sworne the perpetuall approbation and practise of these things which ye esteeme to be indifferent, whatsoever bad


<PB N="65" REF="33"/>
consequent of Popery, and Idolatrie, Superstition, or Scandall should follow thereupon: we speake here only of things indifferent, in your own judgement; for ye have declared before, that ye thinke the Mini∣stration of the Sacraments in private places, no more indifferent: &amp; therefore, can not forbeare the practise of these, although your Or∣dinary, and other lawfull Superiours, should will you to doe so; where∣in <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly, for which you stand, is wronged by you two wayes: 1. That ye differ in judgement from them, about the indif∣ferencie of the five Articles: and next, that at the will of your Or∣dinary, and we know not what other lawfull Superiours, ye are ready to forbeare the practise of these things which the Assembly hath ap∣pointed to be observed. What Oaths ye have given at your admis∣sion, we know not, because there is no Ordinance made, Civill, or Ecclesiastick, appointing any such Oath, and because the Prelats, who arrogated that power, presented to the intrants diverse models of Ar∣ticles, to be subscrived, dealing with some more hardlie, and with o∣thers more favourably, according to their own diverse motivs, &amp; con∣siderations. For some immediatly after <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly, without any warrand from the Kirke or Parliament, were made to sweare at their Admission, that they should both in private and publick maintaine Episcopall Jurisdiction, and in their private and publicke Prayers, commend the Prelates to GODS mercifull Protection; that they should subject themselves to the Orders that presently were in the Kirke, or by the consent of the said Kirke, should be lawfully esta∣blished. The word lawfully, was not in the Principall first subscri∣ved, [as we have learned] and if it had been exprest, it is all one, for the Superiours were judges to this lawfulnesse and unlawfulnesse. We will not labour to reconcile every Oath given by Ministers, at their entry with the present <HI>Covenant;</HI> but wish, and exhort rather, that they may be recalled, and repented of, as thinges for which they can not answere before a generall Assembly.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>To the Fourteenth.</HEAD>
<P>IF the words of the <HI>Covenant</HI> be plaine, concerning the meere for∣bearance, and speake nothing of the unlawfulnesse, no mans


<PB N="66" REF="34"/>
thoughts can make a change. 2. By this <HI>Reply</HI> ye wrong your selves, in forging from the words of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> impediments, and draw∣ing stumbling blockes in your own way, to hinder your subscription: ye wrong the subscryvers, in changing the state of the question, and in making a divorce betwixt Religion and the KINGS Authority, which the <HI>Covenant</HI> joineth together, hand in hand: and, most of all, ye wrong the KINGS Majesty, in bringing him upon the stage, before his Subjects, in whose mindes ye would beget, and breed, suspicions of opposing the trueth, of making innovation of Religion, and of deal∣ing with his Subjects, contrary to his Lawes and Proclamations, and contrary to the Oath at his Coronation. We are not here seeking <HI>inscitiae</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or starting hole of ignorance, or of the smallest disloyalty of affection; but would willingly decline that for the pre∣sent, which neither his Majesties wisdome, nor the prudence of Stats∣men, nor the modesty of good subjects, will allow you or us to dis∣pute. The Crowns and Scepters of Kings, would be more tenderly touched, then the ordinary subjects of Schoole disputes. The naked naming, and bare proposall of certaine suppositions, such (as some are made by you) can not but reflex upon Authority, and sound harsh in the eares of all his Majesties good subjects, who wish, that he may long and prosperously reigne over us. 3. His Majesties most honou∣rable privy Counsell, hath proven more favourable to this cause of maintaining the reformed Religion, then many Pastors, whom by reason of their place and Calling, it beseemed to goe before others; and although according to their wonted custome, they gave warrand, to make his Majesties Proclamation, yet on good groundes, remon∣strated unto them by the Supplicants, they willingly refused their approbation thereof; hoping that his Majesty should be moved to give greater satisfaction thereafter: and this is not our saying, but a publicke doing, before many honorable witnesses; of which number some were directed unto you; whose report ye have no reason to call in question. 4. It becometh us, to judge charitably of the intentions of our Superiours; and most of all, of the intentions of our dread So∣veraigne. Yet, if that hold good which the supplicants have offred to prove, that the <HI>Service Booke,</HI> and <HI>Canons,</HI> containe a reall inno∣vation of Religion, we must judge otherwise, <HI>de conditione operis,</HI> of


<PB N="67" REF="34"/>
the matters contained in the Booke, then <HI>de intentione operantis,</HI> of his Majesties intention; although the intention of the Prelates, &amp; their Associates, the Authors &amp; contrivers of the Bookes, be most justly sus∣pected by us. 5. It is no delight to us, and can be but small comfort to you, to mention the wrongs, which by you are done to us all who have joined in this <HI>Covenant,</HI> and doe adhere to the Religion as it was re∣formed in this land; in your estimation &amp; writings, we are Rebellious, perjured, hereticks, schismaticks, blind guydes, seducers, miserable in∣terpreters, ignorants: shal such men as these be your <HI>reverēd Brethren.</HI> Is this your meeknesse and charity? Is this the duety ye expect from us? But setting these aside, ye have wronged us, in with-holding your hand and help from so good a Cause, of purging Religion, and refor∣ming the Kirke, from so many grosse abuses, and opposing all those who have modestly laboured for Reformation. Your speaches in pri∣vate, in your chambers, beds of sicknesse, and in your missives, and in publicke, at tables, and in Synods, which are come to our know∣ledge; we wish rather should be remembred, and repented of, by your selves, then be recited by us, who desire not to worke you any trouble. 6. Although there be a perpetuall harmony betwixt the Word and Works of GOD, far contrary to that which we finde to be amongst the Children of men; yet often it commeth to passe, that the Word and Warnings of GOD, which we heare with our ears, are not believed, till we behold with our eyes, the plaine Cō∣mentaries thereof, in His Works. Many Proofs, and notable Do∣cuments, have been observed of the Finger of GOD, in the Worke in hand, the Characters of the great Works of GODS, more then ordinary Providence, since the beginning, are legible here. Then did the LORD begin this work, when the Adversary was raised to a great hight, and become intollerably insolent. The beginnings were small, and in the eyes of the World, contemptible; such as use to be the beginnings not of the works of men, but of the Magnificke works of GOD: the power of GOD sensible in the hearts of many, and manifested by the joy; the tears and cries of many thousands, at the solemne renewing of this <HI>Covenant,</HI> hath been a matter of admira∣tion, and amazement, never to be forgotten, to many wise and an∣cient Pastors, and Professors, who did also finde an unwonted flame,


<PB N="68" REF="35"/>
warming their own breasts; the plots, and workings of the Adversa∣ry, have wrought against their own Projects, and have served for our ends, more then all that have been thought, or done by our selves; that we may justly say, what they devised, for evill, the LORD hath turned to good; many thousands conveened, diverse times, in one place, have been keept in such order, and quietnesse, without the smallest trouble, in such sobernesse, and temperance without excesse or ryot, that hardly can History furnish a Paralell: and what effects there be already throughout the Land, of Piety in Domesticke wor∣ship, in observing the exercises of Religion, in publick, of soberness in dyet and apparell, and of Righteousnesse and Concord, we trust shall be sensible by the Blessings of GOD upon us, and shall be ex∣amplary to the Posterity. These we present unto you, and unto all, as a Commentary, written by the LORDS own Hand; wishing a∣gain, that neither ye nor others, be found fighting against GOD. <HI>Who so is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall under∣stand the loving kindnesse of the LORD,</HI> Psal. 107. 43. <HI>LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see; but they shall see, and be ashamed, for their envy at the People,</HI> Isai. 26. 11.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T may be you have not, as yet, heard the true relation of our proceedings, and carriage, towards those two re∣verend Brethren, who came lately hither, to recom∣mend to us, and our People, the late <HI>Covenant:</HI> We declare therefore to you, that we hearing of their com∣ming, and intention, and being of a contrary minde, resolved, that before we should give consent, that they should preach to our people, we would propone to them, by way of certaine <HI>De∣mands,</HI> the chiefe reasons which made us to be averse from their pro∣ceedings; promising to admit them to our pulpits, if they should give us satisfaction, concerning the late <HI>Covenant.</HI> We intended not to print these <HI>Demands</HI> at the first; but afterwards considering how much our people might be confirmed by them, in that pious resolu∣tion which they have, to continue in the obedience of the Lawes of this Church and Kingdome, concerning <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> and those things which were concluded in <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly; we thought good to put them to the Presse, but determined not to make use of them, by di∣vulgating them, except we saw that our people stood in present need of them; which indeed came to passe: for upon Fryday, the twenty of <HI>Iullie</HI> last, these reverend Brethren came to this Town, and hav∣ing that same night received our <HI>Demands</HI> in writ, they returned their <HI>Answeres</HI> unto them on Saturday following, late in the evening: but they came no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to our hands, who replyed unto them, untill Sun∣day in the morning. Neither had we leasure to reade, or consider, untill both the Sermons were ended in our Churches. Wherefore we did meet together that day, at foure houres afternoone, that we might peruse them. And at that same time, hearing that these reverend Brethren had preached in audience of dyverse of our people, con∣veened in the court of a Noble-man his lodging, not having obtained our consent thereto, and in their Sermons had used a forme of answer∣ing to our <HI>Demandes,</HI> which they did publickly reade, affirming, that they had given full satisfaction to us, in a written copie of their <HI>An∣sweres,</HI> which they had sent to us: and by that means, had laboured


<PB N="72" REF="37"/>
to disswade and draw our People from their obedience unto the Ar∣ticles of <HI>Pearth,</HI> and the Lawes of this Kingdome ratifying them: we knowing how insufficient their <HI>Answeres</HI> were, to give satisfaction to any, who would duely ponder our <HI>Demands,</HI> gave licence to the Printer to devulgate them, and the next day did write our <HI>Replyes</HI> to their <HI>Answeres,</HI> intending to put them to the Presse on tuesday. But we were earnestly entreated by a noble Man, to send backe to them the copie of their <HI>Answeres,</HI> that they might revise and perfect them, and also to delay the printing of our <HI>Replyes</HI> untill Fryday following. Which we willingly granted. But wherefore this was desired of us, you may conjecture; seeing they neither added, nor diminished, nor altered any thing in their <HI>Answeres.</HI> Upon the next Friday at night, we gave our <HI>Replyes</HI> to the Printer: and to these reverend Brethren, who returned not to this Citie, untill Saturday following, we sent a copie of our <HI>Replyes</HI> in write, on the LORDS Day: unto which we received not their <HI>Answeres,</HI> untill they came from the Presse, to wit, on Tuesday the fourteenth of <HI>August:</HI> that is, eyghteene dayes after they had received our <HI>Replyes.</HI> What successe these Brethren had in their Sermons, which they preached here, upon two severall LORDS Dayes, it is sufficiently known: neither have they reason to talke so much of it as they doe, in their Preface to the Reader. The first of these dayes, some few who were thought to be that way in∣clined before, subscryved their <HI>Covenant:</HI> But the next LORDS Day, they scarce prevailed with any at all. And a great many, who heard them both these dayes, professed, that they returned from their Ser∣mons, more averse from the <HI>Covenant,</HI> then they were before. Now good Reader, we present to thee our <HI>Replyes,</HI> to their second <HI>An∣sweres;</HI> which for shortnesse cause, we have called <HI>Duplyes:</HI> we pray you consider them unpartially. And if you reap any benefite by per∣using them, let it no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be ascrived unto us, but to the invincible force of divine Trueth. We conclude with <HI>Zer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>babell,</HI> saying, <HI>Blessed be the GOD of Trueth:</HI> And let all the People shout, and say, <HI>Great is Trueth, and mighty above all thinges.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To our Reverend Brethren Mr. ALEXANDER HENDERSON▪ <HI>And</HI> Mr. DAVID DICKSON.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat your <HI>Answeres,</HI> Reverend and Deare Brethren; have not in any degree satisfied us, we impute it not to your weaknesse, whom we know to be able Men, and much ex∣ercised in the matters debated betwixt us: but we impute it to the weaknesse of your cause, and to that inabilitie which is in all men, as well as in you, to beare out against the Trueth. We are sory that ye are not so respective, and favourable, in your judgement of us: for ye plainly declare in your Preface, that ye suspect us of prejudice: and that for two reasons. The first is, that our <HI>Demands,</HI> which yee conceived had been meerely intended for you, were published before your comming in Print: as also, that our <HI>REPLYES</HI> were Printed before we received your last <HI>Answeres</HI> to them. When<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ye conclude, that wee were rather aiming at victory, moved thereto by prejudice, then at sa∣tisfaction by searching of the Trueth. This reason is grounded upon a mistaking: for although our <HI>Demands</HI> at the first, were intended for you onely, yet afterwards we resolved to Print them, as also our <HI>RE∣PLYES,</HI> (the Printing whereof did nowayes depend upon your second <HI>Answeres.</HI>) not for love of contention, nor desire of vict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry (GOD knoweth) but for such reasons, as we have expressed in our Preface to the unpartiall Reader, whom we hope we have satisfied in this point.


<PB N="74" REF="38"/>
Your other reason is, that the grounds of your <HI>Answers</HI> to us, have proven satisfactory to others; who for Age and Learning, are prime men of this Kingdom: and to whome our modestie will not suffer us, to preferre our selves. Farre be it from us to be so presumptuous, as to preferre our selves to so many Learned and worthy Divines: and as farre be it from us, to measure the soliditie, and sufficiencie of your <HI>Answeres,</HI> by the Habilities or Induments of these, who have acqui∣esced in them. If this your reason were good, the <HI>Papists</HI> might more probablie accuse us of prejudice, (as indeed they unjustlie doe) be∣cause their <HI>Answeres</HI> to our <HI>Arguments,</HI> have proven satisfactorie to many thousands of those, who for profunditie, and subtilitie of wit, are inferiour to none of the World: but we regarde not this slender mo∣tive, remembring these words of our Saviour, <HI>I thanke Thee, O Fa∣ther, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the Wise and Prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes: even so, O Father, for so it seemed good in Thy sight.</HI> Besides, if ye compare the Divines, Ancient and Moderne, who are of our judge∣ment, with these who favour your opinion, either in number, or in the excellency of their gifts, ye shall finde that in this, the advantage is greatlie ours. In the meane time ye shall know, that we can bring far better reasons to free our selves of prejudice, then these which ye have brought against us, to wit, the soliditie of our <HI>Arguments,</HI> which have put you to such straits, (pardon us to say that, which every one who have eyes may see) that oft times ye doe not so much, as attempt to answere them, being glad to passe them by, with the show of an <HI>Argument</HI> in <HI>contrarium,</HI> or some other like shift: our humble &amp; earnest attestations, in calling GOD, the onelie competent Iudge; as witnesse of our sinceri∣ty, in the inmost thoughts of our soul; our seriously professed Resolution, to concurre with you, if we should get satisfaction from you, the modes∣tie, ingenuitie, and peaceablenesse of our writings to you, and on the contrarie, your too great disdainfulnesse and asperitie in your second <HI>Answeres;</HI> bewraying not onelie the weaknesse of your mindes, farre by our expectation, but also the weaknesse of your cause to unpartiall Readers, who ascrive this to the pungent force of our <HI>Arguments;</HI> judg∣ing, that they have made you somewhat more cholerike then you were before. To this wee will adde the great reluctance, which some of the


<PB N="75" REF="38"/>
most Iudicious Subscribents did finde in their Consciences, before they subscrived your <HI>Covenant;</HI> together with the Limitations, and Re∣servations, wherewith they subscrived it; evidently arguing their▪ strong apprehension, of the dangerous ambiguitie and haske sounding of the words of the late <HI>Covenant:</HI> so that even these who are now joined with you, have been much affrighted with those things which terrifie us. As for your <HI>Protestation</HI> in the end of your Epistle, that ye can no more be brought to our minde, then ye can be drawn from the profession of our Religion, as it hath been reformed, sworne, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Al∣though this importeth no small prejudice, possessing and over-ruling your minds; yet looking to the invincible force of that Trueth which we mantaine, we even yet hope that at last it shall prevaile with you; espe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iallie considering that our con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roversie is not concerning the Re∣formed Religion; whereunto we as sincerelie adheare as any whatsoever, but concerning the equitie of that forme of <HI>Covenant</HI> which ye lateli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made. Wishing you and all others, to adheare truelie and sincerelie, to the same true Religion; and to all the dueties which in it are recom∣mended to you: we most humblie, and earnestlie pray the Almightie GOD, to pitie his Church in this Kingdom, and to unite all our hearts in Trueth and Peace, in these most dangerous dayes: which although they be to you dayes of gladnesse, as ye professe, yet to those who love the peace of <HI>Sion,</HI> and the tranquilitie of this Kingdome, they are sad and melancholious dayes, in respect of the blacke clowdes of GODS wrath, hanging over our heads, and threatning us with stormes of fear∣full Calamities: which we pray the Almightie GOD▪ to avert.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N our Disputes against the Papists, (which have been frequent, and by GODS grace not unfruit∣full,) as we have learned, that to multiply obje∣ctions against the Trueth, is a thing easie, as ye say, but fruitlesse and vain: so also we have learned, that to multiply Evasions, against solide Argu∣ments brought for the Trueth, is a thing no lesse easie, but altogether unprofitable: which we pray you take heed to. <HI>How forcible are right words? but what doth your arguing reprove?</HI> JOB 6. 25.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ye say, that our objection, against your calling, and the war∣rand of your comming to us, was framed and published in Print, be∣fore it was proponed unto you, and ere your <HI>Answere</HI> could be had. Indeed our <HI>Demands</HI> were at the Presse at your comming, that they might be in readinesse; but were not published, before your selves in your Sermons did publickly read them, and dispute against them, in audience of such of our People as were there present for the time; albeit that written copie of them was delivered to you onely, and not at that time communicated by us to any other.</P>

As for your

multitude, (which ye call almost the whole Kirke and Kingdom) it being destitute of Authority foresaid, maketh no warrand of ordinary calling. Therfore, ye seeme to pretend an extraordinary calling from GOD, alleadging an extraordinary necessitie at this time, which truely we see not in any such degree, as may deserve and warrand so great a change from the received order, which is publickly by Lawes established in this Kirke and Kingdom. That saying of the Apostle▪ <HI>Let us consider one another, to provoke unto love, and to good workes,</HI> which ye alleadge for your extraordinary imployment, importeth not an extraordinary calling, but an ordinary duety, to be performed by all Christians, according to their Callings.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Word of GOD, and the Canons of Counsells, doe so per∣mit to Pastors, the care of the whole Kirke, as they must remember to doe all things, decently and in order, and not to interpone them∣selves in their Brethrens charges, and against their will. And prais∣ed be GOD, there was not any Combustion, Errour or Confusion, in these places of our charges, as ye doe alleadge: Neither did our People stand in need, of such helpe from you. And if ye meane the Combustion of our Nationall Kirke, we doe thinke your remeed not convenient; as being, in our judgement, not agreable to the right way of Trueth and Peace.</P>
<P N="5">5. Whereas ye alleadge, that if some members of this Kirke, had not cared more kindly, in this time of common danger, then others have done, the whole body had been ere now dangerously, if not des∣perately, diseased; we answere, that we most heartily wish, any disease of this Church, to be rymously prevented and cured. But with all we wish this to be done without a rupture, and such a dangerous division: chiefly seeing our Church is not infected with any such Er∣rours, nor is in such dangers, as may give just occasion, of so fearfull a division: which in it selfe is a sore disease, and from which in holy Scripture, we are often, and very earnestly dehorted. <HI>Dionysius</HI> Bi∣shop of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in his Epistle to <HI>Novatian,</HI> recorded by <HI>Eusebi∣us, Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>Historiae</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Cap</HI> 37. worthily sayeth, <HI>You ought rather to have suffered any thing whatsoever, for avoyding of cutting as under the Kirke of GOD: and Martyrdome for keeping the Kirke from</HI> Schisme, <HI>is no lesse glorious, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which is suffered, for not com∣mitting</HI>

<P N="6">6. Ye affirme, that we have no reason to complaine of your car∣riage, here towards us, in respect ye for your Sermons preached to our People, made choise of vacant houres, that they might attend the ordinary times of Worship. But indeed this satisfieth not our com∣plaint: for we justly complained of your preaching to our People, without our consent, at any houre; and of your labouring, to make them subscrive the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> before ye had given satisfaction to us, concerning the equity of it.</P>
<P N="7">7. Ye reprove us for these harmlesse wordes of a confederation, &amp; negative Confession. That little Confession, was long agoe called ne∣gative, <HI>à parte majore.</HI> And as for that other word, it is well knowne to al those who are expert in our Mother tongue, &amp; in the Latine, that covenanting, and confederation, doe signifie one, and the same thing: and therefore, both these wordes are alike respectfull, in our judge∣ment. Whereas ye say, that your <HI>Covenant</HI> is made with GOD, and doe call it his <HI>Covenant:</HI> and likewise for justifying your swearing, and subscriving thereof, doe bring some places of Scripture, wherein mention is made of a <HI>Covenant,</HI> and <HI>Oath,</HI> betwixt GOD and his People; we shall then allow the same name, and respect unto your <HI>Covenant,</HI> when ye shall make it manifest, that your <HI>Covenant</HI> in all points therein contained, hath no lesse warrand from the written word of GOD, then that <HI>Covenant</HI> which the Israelites did swear in the days of JOSHUA, <HI>Ioshua</HI> 24. <HI>verse</HI> 25. and in the dayes of JEHOIADA the Priest, 2. <HI>Kings</HI> 11. <HI>v.</HI> 17. and in the dayes of King ASA, 2. <HI>Chron.</HI> 15. <HI>v.</HI> 15. and that which is mentioned by <HI>Isaiah,</HI> 44. <HI>v.</HI> 5.</P>
<P N="8">8. As we are still informed, that some have fled the Countrey, and some have subscrived for feare; so no Pastors in our knowledge have gone to Court, for the causes alleadged by you. We doe not presume to judge of the Consciences of men, and we wish you to judge more charitably, of these reverend Prelates, then ye doe. The occasion of this present storme was pretended to be the introduction of the <HI>Bookes</HI> of <HI>Service,</HI> and <HI>Canons,</HI> and the high Commission.


<PB N="79" REF="40"/>
These causes are now removed; and yet the storme continueth so ve∣hement, (as ye seeme to grant) that the Bishops have just feares warranding their flight, to save their persons; which we judge to be too great violence, for any such cause, against persons in so sacred a calling.</P>
<P N="9">9. We shall assuredly, (by the grace of GOD) still contribute, as ye desire, our prayers, and all other means agreable to our con∣sciences, for extinguishing of the present combustion. And for that effect, every one of us shall secretly, and humbly, mourne before the LORD, and shall search and trye our wayes, and turne unto the Lord. And as we have already humbled our selves publickly, with Fasting and Mourning for that effect, so are we readie in time to come, to doe the like, when it shall be indicted or allowed by Authority, ac∣cording to the established order in this Kirke and Kingdome. Yea, also we are ready to joine with you in the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> so soone as we shall receive satisfaction to our consciences, concerning the law∣fulnesse thereof; which as we have protested before, so doe we yet protest, and professe.</P>
<P N="10">10. The Reasons which ye touch in your first <HI>Answere,</HI> for prov∣ing that we might without just offence to any, joine with you in sub∣scriving the <HI>Covenant,</HI> are sufficiently answered in our first <HI>Replye.</HI> For, First, It is not yet decerned in a Nationall Assembly, whether your Interpretation added to the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> be in all points sound or unsound; and therefore we have reason to think, that this new <HI>Covenant,</HI> is not substantially one with the old: chiefly seeing it ad∣deth to the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> not onely your Interpretation of it, but also a promise of forbearance of the practise of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, untill they be tryed in an Assembly; and like-wise a Band of Mutuall Defence, by force of Armes, made without the KINGS privity and consent. Secondly, Your inference of Mutuall Defence, against all persones whatsoever, drawne from the words of the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> is meerly invalide. For nothing was pactioned or promised in the old <HI>Covenāt,</HI> without the KINGS Majesty his privity; but the Band of Mutuall Defence, against all persons whatsoever, in this your new <HI>Covenant,</HI> is without the command or consent of the KING, to whom only the Sword is given in this Kingdom, immediatly by GOD.

That which ye adde concerning the Generall Band, is also little to the purpose, for that Band had the KINGS warrand, whereas his Ma∣jesty doeth now forbid your <HI>Covenant.</HI> Thirdly, Although the for∣mer Oath subscrived, did appertain onely to the persons of the sub∣scrivers, all the dayes of their lives; yet you have in your Interpre∣tation, extended the Obligation thereof, to the present and succeed∣ing Generations in this land, without any warrand either from pub∣lick Lawes, or from the words of the Oath it self: which also is a sub∣stantiall Difference betwixt that Oath, &amp; your late <HI>Covenant.</HI> Where∣as ye alleadge, that the warrand which the old <HI>Covenant</HI> had from KING, Counsell, and Assembly, remaineth virtually, and was never yet discharged; we answere, it remaineth not, and that because KING <HI>Iames</HI> of blessed Memory, disalowed that little <HI>Confession,</HI> in respect of the inconveniency of the multitude of Negatives, as is cleare by his Majesties words, published in the printed summe of the confe∣rence holden at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, <HI>Anno</HI> 1603.

And as for the Acts of these two Assem∣blies, which did enjoine subscription to the said little <HI>Confession,</HI> they were relative to the KINGS Mandate, which is now expired by his own Declaration, and with his Royall breath, according to that cō∣mon Maxime: <HI>Morte mandatoris expirat mandatum.

We strive not what causes may lead Christian Princes to make Warre on their Neighboures, but whether it be lawfull or tollorable for the Subject, to beare Armes against his naturall and absolute Prince.

<P N="8">8.

But of the absolute principality speaking in that same place, he recommendeth to Sub∣jects, rather suffering of martyrdome. And this to be his meaning, appeareth more clearly by his last declaration concerning this ques∣tion, in his late treatise entituled, <HI>Iesuita Vapula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s:</HI> where being


<PB N="89" REF="45"/>
pressed by an advesary, he handleth this question of purpose. In the mean time, we wonder very much, that ye have not directly answe∣red to these remarkable wordes of Doctor <HI>Rivet,</HI> alleadged by us in our <HI>Reply,</HI> wherein he plainly averreth, that the doctrine of <HI>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, Knox,</HI> and <HI>Goodman,</HI> concerning Subjects resisting their lawfull Princes, is not approved by any sound Protestant. We expected from you, a full and particular <HI>Answere,</HI> and now againe we would gladly heare, whether ye approve the judgement of <HI>Rivet,</HI> concerning that doctrine of these writers, or not.</P>
<P N="9">9. Thus having vindicated these three divynes, which ye alleadge for you, we come now to those testimonies which we promised, for clearing of the plainness of the way touching Authority. First, it is evident by holy Scripture, that it is unlawfull for Subjects in a Mo∣narchicall estate, (such as is this Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI>) to take Armes for Religion, or for any other pretence, without warrand and power from the Prince, and Supreame Migistrate. For the Scripture teach∣eth us, that the Sword belongeth onely to the KING, and to them who are sent by him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 13. 14. That <HI>we ought to keep the</HI> KINGS <HI>commandement,</HI> and that <HI>in regarde of the Oath of GOD, Eccles.</HI> 8. 2. And, <HI>that we should be subject, not only for wrath but also for conscience sake; because the powers that be, are ordained of GOD: whosoever therefore,</HI> sayeth S. Paul, <HI>resisteth the power, resist∣eth the ordinance of GOD, And they that resist, shall receive to them∣selves damnation, Rom.</HI> 13. In the words of the Apostle S. <HI>Paul,</HI> there is a remarkable opposition betwixt subjection and resistance, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; implying, that all militarie <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, whether defensive, or offensive, if it be against the superiour Power, which GOD hath set over us, is forbidden. In like manner we reade <HI>Matth.</HI> 26. 52. <HI>that all they that take the Sword, shall perish with the Sword.</HI> Now certaine it is, that in a free Monarchie, Subjects have not the Sword from GOD, except by the hand of the KING, to whom only GOD hath immediately given it. And therefore whosoever taketh the Sword without his warrand, hath just reason to feare the foresaid warning of our SAVIOVR. Many other places of Scripture might be adduced to this purpose, which for brevity we omit, and doe pro∣ceed in the next rowme to some testimonies of ancient Fathers, and

other writers.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtullian,</HI> in his Apologeticke, <HI>chap.</HI> 30. and 33. and 37. telleth vs, that the ancient Christians in his time, although having a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heathen and persecuting Emperour, did honour him, as chosen of God, and second from GOD, and first after GOD, and did choose rather to suffer, then to make resistance by force of Armes, although they lacked not number, and strength to doe it.</P>
<P N="11">11. The like example have we in that renowned <HI>Thebean</HI> Legion of 6666 Christian Souldiers, called <HI>Agaunenses,</HI> from the place of their suffering, who without making resistance, as they had strength of hand to have done, suffered themselves rather to be slain, for their Christian profession, by the Officers of <HI>Maximian</HI> the Emperour, executors of his cruell commandement against them. This fell out in the 18 yeare of <HI>Diocletian,</HI> as <HI>Ado Viennensis</HI> writeth in his Chronicle, which was the yeare of GOD 297, as Cardinall <HI>Baronius</HI> reckoneth in his Annalls.

Where understand, that Fleing is a sort of Suffering. Neither are his words subjoined in the 31 <HI>Sect.</HI> to wit, I speake alwise of private men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contrary to this. For first <HI>Calvin</HI> in this Dispute, indifferently useth the names of private men, and Subjects: And therefore, in the 22 <HI>Sect.</HI> at the beginning of it, he termeth those of whose duety he disputeth, Sub∣jects.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hugo Gro∣rius,</HI> de ju∣re belli &amp; pacis, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b. 1 cap. 4. num. 6.</NOTE> And indeed, whosoever is a Subject, is also, in respect of the supream Ruler, a private man. Although Magistrats, who are under the KING, be publick persons, in respect of their Inferiours; yet be∣ing considered, with relation to him that is Supream, 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 13. they are but private. As in <HI>Dialecticke,</HI> an intermediate <HI>genus,</HI> al∣though in respect of the inferiour <HI>species,</HI> it be a <HI>genus;</HI> yet in rela∣tion to the superiour <HI>genus,</HI> it is but a <HI>species.</HI> All Power of Govern∣ing, is so subjected to the Supream Power, that whatsoever is done


<PB N="93" REF="47"/>
against the will of the supream Ruler, is destitute of that Power; and consequently, is to be esteemed for a private act. For, as we are taught by the Philosophers, Order can not be, but with a reference to that which is first. Hence King JAMES, in his Book of <HI>The true</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Averroe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 5. <HI>Meta∣phys. com∣ment.</HI> 6.</NOTE> <HI>Law of free Monarchies, Pag.</HI> 206. affirmeth, that <HI>all the People are but private men, the authority being alwise with the Magistrate.</HI> Se∣condly, this is manifest from the very words of <HI>Calvin,</HI> in that same 31 <HI>Sect.</HI> for there he excepteth none from the necessity of obeying, or suffering, when Kings command things unjust; but onely popular Magistrats, appointed for restraining the licentiousnesse of Kings. Now, where such Magistrats are erected, it is certain, that a King, in such a Common-wealth, hath not the supream power: For if he had the supream power, none could force him, since an Inferiour can not force his Superiour. This can not be done, but onely by him, who is Superiour, or at least equall. Thirdly, this is clear also by the ex∣amples adduced by <HI>Calvin;</HI> namely, the <HI>Lacedamonian Ephori,</HI> the <HI>Roman Tribunes,</HI> and the <HI>Athenian Demarchi.</HI> When the <HI>Ephori</HI> were set up in <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> were but Kings<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Hugo Grotius,</HI> de Iure belli &amp; pacis, Pag. 66. <HI>where he citeth sun∣dry anciēt Authors.</HI></NOTE> in name, and had not the Supream power, as it is confessed by the Learned. So when the <HI>Tribunes</HI> had their full power in <HI>Rome,</HI> the Supream power was in the People: and in like manner it was in <HI>A∣thens,</HI> when the <HI>Demarchi</HI> had power. Therefore, from this nothing can be inferred for the lawfull resistance of Subjects, to a Monarch, or King, properly so called. Fourthly, <HI>Calvin</HI> applying this to the King∣domes that now are, sayeth no more, but that peradventure the three Estates assembled in Parliament, have that same power, which the fore-mentioned <HI>Ephori,</HI> &amp;c. had. Here it is to be marked, that he sayeth onely, <HI>peradventure it is so;</HI> which can be no warrand to a mans conscience, in a matter of so great importance. For he that re∣sisteth his Superiour by force of Armes, should not onely thinke, that peradventure he hath power, but should be assuredly perswaded, that he hath power so to doe. When there is no more said, but that <HI>per∣adventure such a thing is,</HI> it may be as reasonablie said, <HI>Peradven∣ture such a thing is not.</HI> Neither doeth he give this power even per∣adventure, but to the three Estates assembled in Parliament. Hence the learned <HI>Rivet,</HI> speaking of <HI>Calvin</HI> his minde in this place, sayeth,

But concerning these faire meanes, and that force of reason whereby, ye say, ye recommend your Interpretation of the old <HI>Co∣venant</HI> to us, pardon us, if the experience we have, both of your writings and proceedings, make us to oppose this your assertion. For in your writings we expected indeed, but have not found that force of reason, whereof ye speake: and as for the proceedings of those who have subscrived your <HI>Covenant,</HI> we of all men have least reason to believe that they use no threatnings, seeing we hear daylie so much their threatnings against our selves.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whereas for clearing of that which ye said before, concerning the minde of our reformers, ye affirme, that <HI>The authoritative judge∣ment of our reformers is evident, not only by the confession of Faith ra∣tified in Parliament, but also by the books of Discipline, Acts of Gene∣rall Assemblies, and by their own writes:</HI> First, we marvell, how ye can say, that the private writings of Master <HI>Knox,</HI> and others, who with him were instruments of that great worke of Reformation, have publicke Authority to obliedge the Subjects of this Kingdom. The legislative, and obligatory power of the Church, is only in Synods or


<PB N="98" REF="50"/>
conventions of Bishops and Presbyters, and not in particular per∣sons expressing their minds apart. Next, this Church in the former age, by abrogating the office of Superintendants, established in the first book of Discipline, hath declared, that the statuts and ordinances contained in those books, are not of an authority perpetually obliga∣tory, but may be altered or abrogated by the Church, according to the exigencie of tyme. The same likewise is manifest by the abroga∣tion of summary excomunication, which this Church did abolish, al∣though it was established in Generall Assemblies, wherein Master <HI>Knox,</HI> and other Reformers were present. We need not to insist much in this, seeing so many of you, who are Subscribents, mis-re∣gard the ordinances of our Reformers, prefixed to the <HI>Psalm Book,</HI> concerning the office of Superintendants, or Bishops, Funerall Ser∣mons, and set formes of Prayer, which they appointed, to be pub∣lickly read in the Church. Hence the Reader may perceive, that ye have no warrand for your Interpretation of the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> from the authoritative, and obligatory judgement, of the Reformers; fee∣ing ye can not ground it upon the Confession of Faith ratified in Par∣liament. As for those other meanes mentioned by us, to wit, Scrip∣ture, Antiquitie, and consent of the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormed Churches, that they tru∣ly make for us, and against you, the unpartiall Reader may perceive by these our Disputs.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Whether or not Episcopacie and <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, be abjured in the late <HI>Covenant.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="3">3. As for the second mistaking mentioned by you in your <HI>An∣swere,</HI> we did show in our <HI>Replye,</HI> that in your <HI>Covenant, Pearth</HI> Ar∣ticles, and Episcopacy, are abjured. And for proving of this, we asked of you, what ye meaned by the recovery and liberty of the Gos∣pell, as it was established and professed before the foresaid Novati∣ons? and what is that period of tyme, to which your words there have reference? that is, Whether it be that period of time, when the <HI>Service Book,</HI> and Book of <HI>Canons,</HI> were urged upon you? or if it be the time, when <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacy, were received


<PB N="99" REF="50"/>
in this Church? But, truely, your <HI>Answere</HI> to this, is nowise satis∣factory, nor hath so much as a show of satisfaction. For ye are afraid to expresse that period of time, lest ye beforced to grant, that which we before objected. And yet your speach bewrayeth you: For seeing ye answere onely to that which we said concerning the last of these two periods, we collect, that by the recovery of the liberty and puri∣ty of the Gospell, as it was established before the fore-said Novati∣ons, ye mean the reducing of the Policy of this Church, unto that e∣state in which it was, before <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacy, were established. And hence we inferre, as we did before, that in that part of your <HI>Covenant,</HI> ye condemne and abjure <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacy, as contrary to the Purity and Liberty of the Gospell.</P>
<P N="4">4. Ye seeme to answere, that in that part of your <HI>Covenant,</HI> ye condemne not, <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacy, but those abuses &amp; corruptions, which have accompanyed them; such as the Superstiti∣ous observing of dayes, cessation from work on those dayes, Feasting, Guysing, and the grosse abuses, which have entered in the Sacramēt, upon kneeling before the Elements: and, that in respect of these a∣buses, we who allow <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacy, may sweare without prejudice of our cause, to recover the Purity and Liberty of the Gospell, as it was established, and professed, before these Novations.</P>
<P N="5">5. But, first, let any indifferent, or unpartiall man, who knoweth the state of our Church, judge, whether or not it be lykely, that your Vowe, of the recovering the Liberty and Purity of the Gospell, as it was before Episcopacy, and <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, were introduced, im∣porteth onely an intention of removing of the consequents of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacie, and not of the removing of those things themselves? Truely we are perswaded, that they who know the state of this Church, and your mind, concerning these things, will think this your Glosse of your own words, to be violent, and excogitated for eluding our Argument.</P>
<P N="6">6. Secondly: Who can thinke, that ye, and others, contryvers of the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> who condemne <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacie, as much as ye doe the consequents of them, have only vowed, to re∣move their consequents, and not remove themselves?</P>
<P N="7">

<PB N="100" REF="51"/>7. Thirdly, is it possible, that any can promise and vow, to labour for the curing of so many, and so great pretended deseases of this Church, (we meane these abuses which ye say, have accompanyed <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles and Episcopacie,) and in the mean time promise, and intend nothing concerning the removing of the causes of them?</P>
<P N="8">8. Fourthly, how can we, without great prejudice of our cause, acknowledge, that these grosse abuses mentioned by you, have en∣tred in the Sacrament, by kneeling before the Elements (ye should have said at the receiving of the Elements) for seeing kneeling at the receiving of the Sacrament, is confessed by us to be a mat∣ter indifferent; if in our Oath, we acknowledge these grosse abuses to have entred in upon kneeling, it will probably follow in the judge∣ment of some, and in our judgement, who recommend this Oath un∣to us, it will follow infallibly, that kneeling for the evill consequences thereof, ought to be removed. Doe ye not here cunningly deale with us? For although ye urge us not, as ye say, to sweare and promise the removing of kneeling, yet ye urge us, by your own confession, to promise the removing of these abuses occasioned by kneeling: which being acknowledged by us, ye will then take upon you to demonstrate, that kneeling it selfe ought to be removed: for ye hold it for a <HI>Max∣ime,</HI> that things indifferent, being abused and polluted with Supersti∣tion, should be abolished. We cannot sufficiently marvell, how yee who are of this minde, can say to us, that we who allow <HI>Pearth</HI> Ar∣ticles and Episcopacie, may sweare to recover the liberty and purity of the Gospell, as it was before, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For ye meane, that we may doe so, without prejudice of our cause. But we have already shown, that according to your judgement and doctrine, if we sweare that which ye would have us to sweare, our cause shall be much prejudged, yea, utterly lost.</P>
<P N="9">9. Fiftly: How can we sweare, to remove those grosse abuses en∣tered in upon kneeling, as ye alleadge; seeing we thinke, that no such abuses have entered in upon it? Yea, our People, try them who please, will show, that they are as free from all erronious conceits, concerning that holy Sacrament, as any living in these Congregations where kneeling is daylie cryed down.</P>
<P N="10">10. Sixtlie, as for these abuses and corruptions, reckoned up by


<PB N="101" REF="51"/>
you, as the consequents of the observation of Festivall dayes▪ to pass by that which before we marked concerning Kneeling, to wit, that the granting of this were a great prejudice to our cause, some of these are not abuses at all, as, cessation from work. Again, some of them have not come in upon the observation of the Articles of <HI>Pearth,</HI> as Guysing, and Feasting, (ye mean excessive Feasting, for otherwise it is not an abuse) which onely fall forth on <HI>Christmas Festivitie.</HI> For sure we are, that these abuses have not come by the anniversary com∣memoration of <HI>CHRISTS Nativitie,</HI> in the which by the ordinance of <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly, all Superstitions observation, and Prophanation of that day, or any other day, is prohibited, and appoynted to be re∣buked. This the reverend and learned Bishop of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in his defence of the Act of <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly, concerning Festivities, <HI>Pag.</HI> 63. proveth, because (sayeth he) we have lacked preaching upon Christ-mas-day, these fifty seven years bygone, in our Church, yet Ryot, Prophannesse, Surfet, and Drunkennesse, have not beene wanting.</P>
<P N="11">11. Seventhly, as for Superstitious observation of dayes, (whereof hitherto we have had no experience) we marvell, that ye can reckon it, amongst the consequents of the observation of dayes: see∣ing in your judgement, it is all one with the observation of dayes. For ye think the observation of any day, except the LORDS Day, to be, in the own nature of it, Superstitious, and Will-worship.</P>
<P N="12">12. As for the last part of your <HI>Answere</HI> to our <HI>Argument,</HI> con∣cerning the foresaid period of time; where ye alleadge, that many corruptions of Popish and Arminian doctrine, have entered in the Kirke, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we aske you, Whether ye designe here another period of time, then ye did before? or if ye design onely this self same pe∣riod of time, in the which both the foresaid practicall abuses, and these Doctrinall corruptions, have entered into this Church, accom∣panying, as ye alleadge, <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacy?) Or, last of all, If ye design no period of time at all? If ye take you to this last, professing, that ye have here designed no period of time; then ye an∣swere not our Argument, wherein we particularly, and expresly po∣sed you, concerning that period of time, unto which your words cited oft before, have reference. If ye design the same period of time, then


<PB N="102" REF="52"/>
look how ye can escape our preceeding Arguments, concerning that period of time.</P>
<P N="13">13. But if ye design an other period of time, then we aske you, Whether it be <HI>prior</HI> or <HI>posterior,</HI> to the period of time already men∣tioned; to wit, the time preceeding the bringing in of the Articles of <HI>Pearth?</HI> Ye can not say, that it is <HI>posterior</HI> to it: for ye complained of <HI>Arminian</HI> corruptions, even before <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly; bran∣ding some of the most learned of our Church, with that Aspersion. And of Popish corruptions of Doctrine, ye complained, when <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacy were established. For the Doctrins, of the lawfulnesse and expediency of these things, are, in your judgement, meerly Popish, and Antichristian. Neither can ye say, that it is <HI>pri∣or</HI> to the foresaid period of time: for the time preceeding the inbring∣ing of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, comprehendeth all that tract of time which interveened betwixt the Reformation, and <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly.</P>
<P N="14">14. But we will yet more evidently convince you, by two other Arguments, drawn from that part of your <HI>Covenant,</HI> of which we are now speaking, and from the words of this your <HI>Answere</HI> to our fourth <HI>Replye;</HI> for first in your <HI>Covenant</HI> ye promise, and also will have us to promise with you, To forbeare for a time, the practise of <HI>Pearth</HI> Ar∣ticles, untill they be tryed, as ye say, in a free Assembly. But this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or∣bearance importeth a manifest prejudice, and wronging of our cause: for this is a fore-acknowledgement, either of the unlawfulnesse, or else of the inexpediency of the matters, concluded in <HI>Pearth</HI> Assem∣bly. For wherefore ought we in this exigence of the Church, to for∣bear the practise of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, rather then of other Rites of the Church, except for some greater evill comprehended in them? This will appear more evident, if we shall consider the reason alleadged by you, <HI>Pag.</HI> 17, wherefore we ought now to forbear the practise of these Articles: to wit, because in the case of Scandall, and sensible fear of Superstition, we ought to doe so. Now this case of Scandall is not in your judgement, a temporary, but a perpetuall consequent of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles. For ye think it will ever Scandalize the Papists, as if we were approaching to them: Likewise ye think every one of them, and especially Kneeling, to be inductive to sinne, <HI>ex conditi∣one operis,</HI> by the very nature and quality of the work it self. Whence


<PB N="103" REF="52"/>
it followeth, that they are necessarily and immutablie scandalous; for whatsoever agreeth to any thing, in respect of the nature of it, it agreeth necessarily and immu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ably. If therefore we in this respect, swear the forbearance of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, we shall be holden to for∣bear <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, not for a time, but for ever.</P>
<P N="15">15. Next, we pray you consider, what is meaned by the foresaid Novations, in that part of your <HI>Covenant,</HI> wherein ye promise to la∣bour to recover the liberty and purity of the Gospell, as it was before the foresaid Novations. Certainly these words cannot be understood of Novations to be introduced, and which have not as yet entred un∣to our Church. For the liberty and purity of the Church is not as yet lost, yea, not impared by them, and so needeth not to be recovered by the removing of them. They must then be understood of the No∣vations mentioned in the Paren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hesis of your <HI>Covenant;</HI> that, is of all innovations already introduced by Authority, and their alleadged con∣sequents, which ye promise to forbeare, untill they be allowed, and tryed by a free Assembly. Hence any man may conclude, that although in your Parenthesis, ye promise only to forebeare these Novations for a time, yet in the words immediatly following, ye condemne and abjure them. For the recovering of the liberty and purity of the Gospell, as it was established before the foresaid Novations, impor∣teth manifestly a removing of all these Novations, which either in themselves, or in respect of their consequents, are contrary to the purity and liberty of the Gospell. But all Novations already intro∣duced, are in your judgement of this kinde, and therefore your vow, of the recovering the liberty and purity of the Gospell, importeth a removing of all the foresaid Novations.</P>
<P N="16">16. To conclude this Argument: Ye may see, that we have pryed no more narrowly into the expressions of your <HI>Covenant,</HI> then we had reason; and have laboured, not to scarre our selves, and others, with meere shadowes, as ye affirme.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Of our Argument, <HI>Ad hominem,</HI> and the weak Retorsion of it, by the <HI>Answeres.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="17">17. Now we come to our Argument, or Syllogisme, <HI>Ad hominem,</HI>


<PB N="104" REF="53"/>
which hath so pinched you, that ye have not attempted to answer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to any of the propositions of it. Our intention in that Argument, was to prove, that whether <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles be abjured in the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> or not; yet ye [who came hither, to give us satisfaction concerning the <HI>Covenant</HI>] can not, with a safe conscience, averre, or declare to us, that they are not abjured in it. This we did evident∣ly prove, reasoning thus: Whatsoever Rites are abjured in the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> they are also, in your judgment, abjured in the late <HI>Cove∣nant.</HI> But <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopocie, are, in your judgement, abjured in the old <HI>Covenant: Ergo,</HI> they are, in your judgement, ab∣jured in the late <HI>Covenant:</HI> and, consequently, if ye deale sincerely with us, ye must averre, that they are also abjured in the late <HI>Covenant.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. To this ye say, first, that whatsoever be your judgement, as ye are particular persons, yet, at this time, ye were to be taken, as Commissioners from the whole company of Subscrivers. Truely we did take you so; and did think, that ye who were Commissioners from such a multitude of good Christians, would have tolde us your minde sincerely, concerning the full extent of the late <HI>Covenant;</HI> and, that ye would neither have affirmed any thing as Commissioners, which ye doe not think to be true, as ye are particular persons; nor yet would have laboured, so to insnare us, as to have bidden us subscrive a <HI>Co∣venant,</HI> really, and indeed, in your judgement, abjuring those things, which we, with a safe conscience, can not abjure. For, in your judge∣ment, <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacie, are most really abjured in the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> although ye plainly affirme the contrary, in your <HI>Answeres</HI> to our fourth, fifth, and sixth <HI>Demand.</HI> And (which is much to be noted) in your <HI>Answeres</HI> to our tenth <HI>Demand,</HI> ye affirme, concerning your selves, that ye, in this late <HI>Covenant,</HI> have promised only forbearance of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles. We wonder much, how ye can say so. For whosoever by their Oath have tyed themselves to a Con∣fession, in the which they firmly believe <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episco∣pacy, to be abjured, those have indeed abjured <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacy. But ye in the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> have tyed your selves by your Oath, to the little Confession, or old <HI>Covenant,</HI> in the which ye firmly believe, Episcopacy, and <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, to be abjured: <HI>Ergo,</HI> in your late <HI>Covenant</HI> ye have abjured <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, &amp; Episcopacy:


<PB N="105" REF="53"/>
And not only ye, but all those who are of that same minde with you. Whence we inferred, in that tenth <HI>Demand,</HI> that none of you can vote freely in the intended Assembly, concerning <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacie.</P>
<P N="19">19. Secondly, ye say, that if others of the subscribents, who are of our judgement, (that is, who are not perswaded that <HI>Pearth</HI> Ar∣ticles, and Episcopacie, are abjured in the old <HI>Covenant,</HI>) had come as Commissioners at this time to us, our Argument <HI>ad hominem,</HI> had beene anticipated, because it would not have been pertinent for them. But ye are deceived, for we have ever looked principally to these, who were the first contryvers of the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> or had speciall hand in it, that is, to your selves, and to others, who these many years bygone, have opposed <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacie, as Popish corruptions, abjured in the old <HI>Covenant;</HI> and consequently have, in this late <HI>Covenant,</HI> [in the which that former <HI>Covenant</HI> is renewed] by your own personall Oath, abjured <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopa∣cie. If then that other sort of Commissioners had come unto us, we would have said to them, that we can not swear the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> because <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacie are in it abjured. And this we would have proved by the like Argument <HI>ad hominem,</HI> that is, by an Argument grounded upon the judgement of the contrivers of the late <HI>Covenant:</HI> as ye may easily perceive.</P>
<P N="20">20. Thirdly, ye say, that we have perceived the insufficiencie of our Argument, because we objected this to our selves: that seeing we think <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacie, not to be abjured in the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> we may subscrive the new <HI>Covenant,</HI> in the which that old <HI>Covenant</HI> is reuewed. Truely ye might have alleadged this, if we had propounded that objection, and had left it unanswered. But we an∣swered it, and brought some reasons [which ye wisely did passe by, perceiving the force of them] to show, that we can not convenient∣ly subscrive your late <HI>Covenant,</HI> notwithstanding of our judgement, of rather opinion of the meaning of the old <HI>Covenant.</HI> We say opinion: for to speak truely what we thinke, we doubt, and so doe others with us, concerning the meaning of some parts of the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> touch∣ing matters of Ecclesiasticall policy, and have not so full a perswasion in our mindes concerning those parts, as may be to us a warrand of our Oath.</P>
<P N="21">

<PB N="106" REF="54"/>21. Fourthly, whereas ye say, that it was not for us to inquire in your private opinion, concerning the meaning of the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> in that part of it, where it tyeth us to the inviolable observation of the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was it necessary for you, to make it known to us; We answere, that we inquired not your private opinion, but the com∣mon judgement of all those, who with you these twenty years bypast, have accused us of Perjury, for the alleadged violation of the old <HI>Co∣venant,</HI> sworne by our Predecessours. And truely we had more then reason to doe so; because we most justly feared, that ye, who have so oft accused us of Perjury, for practising Rites and Ceremonies abjured as ye alleadge, in the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> sworn by our Predecessours, would much more vehemently; yea, also with a greater show of probability, accuse us of Perjury, for violation of the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> sworn and ra∣tified by our selves in this late <HI>Covenant,</HI> if we should stand to the de∣fence of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles in time to come. It became us therefore, for eschewing of this inconvenient, to inquire of you, and you also sincerely and plainly to declare to us, whether or not we may subscrive and sweare the new <HI>Covenant,</HI> as it includeth and ratifieth the old, and yet be really free from all abjuration, or condemning of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacie? And likewise whether or not ye, and all others who are of your minde, will hold and esteem us free from ab∣juration of them, notwithstanding of our subscriving of your <HI>Cove∣nant.</HI> These Questions require a punctuall <HI>Answere.</HI> For if our sub∣scriving of your <HI>Covenant,</HI> may either import a real abjuratiō of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, or if it may make you to think, that by vertue of our sub∣scription, we are really, and indeed, bound to reject them for ever; neither can we, with a good conscience, subscrive your <HI>Covenant;</HI> nei∣ther can ye, with a good conscience, require it of us.</P>
<P N="22">22. Fiftly, from our refusing to subscrive the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> in so far as it reneweth the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> or little <HI>Confession;</HI> because that <HI>Con∣fessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> according to your Interpretation, or conception of it, importeth an abjuration of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, ye collect, first, that upon this ground we would not have subscrived the late <HI>Confession</HI> any time bypast. Se∣condly, that we can not sweat the Confession of any Church, no, not the Articles of the CREED, Petitions of the LORDS PRAYER, nor Pre∣cepts of the ten COMMANDEMENTS, in respect of the diverse In∣terpretations,


<PB N="107" REF="54"/>
which men give of them. We answere, first, that since the little <HI>Confession,</HI> is not of Divine Authority, and since the Humane Authority which it had, hath these many years bygone ceassed, (as <HI>The Peaceable Warning,</HI> lately given to the Subjects in <HI>Scotland,</HI> prov∣eth) we would have refused our Subscription unto it, ever since we heard, that it importeth an Abjuration of all Rites, and Ceremonies, which were not received in our Church in the year 1681; except we had gotten some evidence to the contrary, sufficiently satisfying our minds. Secondly: As for the <HI>Creed, LORDS Prayer,</HI> and ten <HI>Commandements,</HI> your Argument taken from the varietie of mens Expositions of them, is far from the purpose. For, since we are per∣swaded, that the Author, or Pen-men of them, neither intended, nor yet delivered any thing in them, but Trueth: and that their expres∣sion is authentick, we are bound to embrace, and receive them, not∣withstanding of the varietie of Interpretations, which men give of them: neither is it lawfull to us, to refuse our Subscription, or assent, to them, whatsoever be the judgement or assent of those who require it of us: being alwise bound to acknowledge the infallible Authority of them, even when we doubt of the true meaning of them. Thirdly: As for any of these later <HI>Confessions</HI> of Churches, if the case be such, as now it is in this particular of this late <HI>Covenant,</HI> that is, if we be not bound by any standing Law, to subscrive it, and if it be so lyable to the variety of Interpretatiōs, that it may probablie import that which we think to be contrary to the Trueth, and if these who require our Subscription, be, in our judgement, Opposers of the Trueth, in any point contained in that <HI>Confession,</HI> and may make advantage of our Subscription, alleadgeing, that we are tyed by it, to consent to their Doctrines, or Practises: we may justly, in such a case, deny our sub∣scription to that <HI>Confession,</HI> for the ambiguitie of it; and much more may desire those who urge us to subscrive it, to declare unto us, be∣fore we give our Subscription, Whether or not, that <HI>Confession,</HI> in their judgement, will tye us to their Doctrines and Practises.</P>
<P N="23">23. Last of all: In modestie, as ye say, but with a jesting comple∣ment, ye present unto us, a Dish of our own dressing: ye mean, the lyke Argument, <HI>Ad hominem;</HI> which is this: The Rites and Cere∣monies which are not abjured in the negative <HI>Confession,</HI> are not ab∣jured


<PB N="108" REF="55"/>
in this late <HI>Covenant:</HI> But the Rites and Ceremonies, which were concluded in <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly, are not abjured, as ye say, in the negative <HI>Confession,</HI> made <HI>Ann</HI> 1581; therefore they are not abju∣red in this late <HI>Covenant.</HI> The first Proposition, as ye say, is evident, because in the late <HI>Covenant</HI> we are bound no farther, concerning the negative <HI>Confession,</HI> but to keep it inviolable: And therefore, what Rites are not abjured there, are not abjured here. Likewise ye say, that the second Proposition, can no be denyed by us, in respect these twenty years bygone, we have thought our selves free of Perjurie, notwithstanding the of Oath made 1581, and of our conforming our selves to the Ordinance of <HI>Pearth.</HI> Good Brethren, ye have retorted this Argument very weakly upon us. For, first, we flatly denye the <HI>Major</HI> of your Syllogisme; and withall doe repell the confirmation of it. For although <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, were not abjured in the late <HI>Co∣venant,</HI> in so far as it reneweth the negative <HI>Confession;</HI> yet they may be, and, as it is already proven, they are abjured in that other part of your late <HI>Covenant,</HI> where ye vow and promise, To recover the Liberty and Purity of the Gospell, as it was established and profes∣sed before the foresaid Novations. Next, as for your <HI>Minor,</HI> or Second Proposition, wee suspend our Judgement of it, untill wee bee better informed and advised: doubting, as we said before concerning the meaning of those parts of the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> which concerne matters of Rite or Ceremonie. Neither doeth the confir∣mation of your <HI>minor</HI> trouble us; for we have thought our selves free of Perjury these twenty years bygone, not for any certain perswasion which we had, that <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles are not abjured in the old <HI>Cove∣nant;</HI> but because we did not personally swear that <HI>Covenant,</HI> and are not tyed to it, by the Oath of those who did subscrive it: which we are ready to demonstrate by irrefragable Arguments. Ye see then your Argument retorted upon us, pearceth us not at all: and the Reader, may perceive that our argument hath been so forcibly thrown upon you, that ye have not taken upon you to answere any part of it. If ye had had evidence of the trueth for you, ye would not only have retorted our Argument, but also by answering it punctually, shown, that it straiteth not you: and if ye had been exact Resolvers, ye would not have gone about to have satisfied us with a naked Argument <HI>in contrarium.</HI></P>
<P N="24">

<PB N="109" REF="55"/>24. Before we leave this point, that it may be known to all, what reason we have to insist in this our Argument, <HI>ad hominem,</HI> and that we have proponed it, not to catch advantage of you, but to get satis∣faction to our own mindes, concerning the <HI>Covenant,</HI> and your sin∣cerity in urging us to subscrive it, we will collect out of that which hath beene already said, some interrogatories, which we pray you to answer punctually, if ye intend to give us satisfaction. The first is, whether or not your declaration of the extent of the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> to wit, that it extendeth not it self to the abjuration of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, be not only <HI>vera,</HI> true in it self, but also <HI>verax,</HI> that is, consonant to your minde, and to the minde of the chief contrivers of it? The reason wherefore we propone this question, ye will perceive by these that follow. Secondly, seeing ye and others the chief recommenders of the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> have been ever of this minde, that <HI>Pearth</HI> Ar∣ticles, and Episcopacy, are abjured in it; we aske, whether ye all tying your selves by this late <HI>Covenant,</HI> to the inviolable observation of the old <HI>Covenant;</HI> have tyed your selves to it in all the particular points, which ye conceived to be contained in it, or only in some of them? did ye by mentall reservation, except any part of that old <HI>Covenant,</HI> or in particular did ye except that part of it, in the which perpetuall continuance in the doctrine and discipline of this Church is promised? Or if that part was not excepted, did ye put any new glosse upon it which it had not before? And if ye did not, whether or not ye re∣newing the Oath of perpetuall observation, of the doctrine and dis∣cipline of this Church, as it was <HI>Anno</HI> 1581, have not only really, but also according to your own conception of that part of the old <HI>Cove∣nant,</HI> abjured all Rites and Ceremonies, added to the discipline of this Church, since the foresaid year; and consequently, the Articles of <HI>Pearth,</HI> and Episcopacie? Thirdly, seeing ye so confidently averre, that <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles are abjured in the old <HI>Covenant,</HI> how can ye de∣ny them to be abjured in the new <HI>Covenant,</HI> except ye acknowledge a substantiall difference, betwixt the old and new <HI>Covenant?</HI> Fourthly, if ye grant that they are really and indeed abjured in the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> how can ye faithfully and sincerely say to us, or to any other, that they are not abjured in it? Fiftly, how can ye, and all others, (who with you have really, and also according to your own conception of the old


<PB N="110" REF="56"/>
<HI>Covenant,</HI> abjured <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacie, by renewing of it) voice freely, in the intended Assembly, concerning these▪ things; seeing ye are tyed by your Oath, to condemn and abrogate them? Sixtly, How can we concurre with you in an Oath, wherein we are in∣fallibly perswaded that ye have abjured <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episco∣pacie? Seventhly, If we concurre with you in that Oath, will ye not (as we objected in our <HI>Reply,</HI> but ye have not answered it) think us bound by our Oath, to condemn <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacie? and will not ye thinke your selves bound in conscience to tell us, and all others, that which ye think to be trueth, and may make much for your cause, to wit, that the words of the <HI>Covenant</HI> have but one sense, and that in that one sense <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles are abjured?</P>
<P N="25">25. Ye, and all others, may now see, how injustly ye said, that we would have the <HI>Covenanters,</HI> against their intention, and whether they will or not, to disallow, and condemn <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Epis∣copall Government, lest they be tryed in a free Assembly. GOD knoweth, how far we detest all such dealing, and this vindication of our two Arguments [we added also a third, but ye have swallowed it] brought by us, to prove, that <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacie, are abjured in your late <HI>Covenant,</HI> will sufficiently cleare us of this im∣putation, to all unpartiall Readers.</P>
<P N="26">26. We did not only alleadge, as ye say, that your supplications to his Majesty were fully satisfied by the last Proclamation; but ground∣ing an Argument upon your <HI>Answere,</HI> to our fourth <HI>Demand,</HI> we rea∣soned thus: If in all your supplications, ye have only sought the re∣moving of the <HI>Service Book,</HI> book of <HI>Canons,</HI> and new high Com∣mission; not complaining of any other Novations, already introduced: and, seeing his Majesty hath granted this unto you, what reason have ye to say, that his Majesty hath not satisfied your supplications? this our Argument, ye have turned to a meere alleadgeance, lest ye should have troubled your selves, with answering it.</P>

<PB N="111" REF="56"/>
<HEAD>Whether, or not, we may forbeare the practise of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, untill they be tryed in a free Assembly.</HEAD>
<P N="27">27. We come now to the consideration of that, which your <HI>Cove∣nant,</HI> by your own confession, tyeth us to; to wit, The forbearance of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, untill they be tryed in a free Assembly. And first, whereas ye say, That the urging of the <HI>Service Book,</HI> is a sufficient reason for forbearance of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, till an Assembly; we pro∣fesse, that we can not see the equity, and force of this reason. For the <HI>Service Book</HI> may be holden out, albeit <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles were not forborne at this time; yea, although they should never be removed. And the more obedient, Subjects were at this time, to his Majesties lawes already established, the greater hope might they have of obtain∣ing their desires.</P>
<P N="28">28. Ye bring two Arguments, to prove the lawfulnesse of the forbearance of Novations already introduced. One is, that the Ar∣ticles of <HI>Pearth</HI> establishing them, were concluded onely for satisfy∣ing the KING, and not to presse any man with the practise of them: And because the Act it selfe (ye mean the Act concerning Kneel∣ing) giveth warrand, to forbear the practise of them at this time, when the memory of Superstition is revived. But this reason doeth nowise satisfie our consciences. For, to begin with the last part of your <HI>Answere; The Memory of Superstitious Celebration of the LORDS Supper,</HI> is not renewed in this Kingdom, for ought we know. And, if ye mean, that it is renewed by the <HI>Service Book;</HI> suppone that were true, yet, ye know, the <HI>Service Book</HI> is discharged, by the Act of Counsell, at his Majesties commandement. Secondly, the Act of <HI>Pearth,</HI> giveth no warrand to forbear Kneeling▪ upon every suspition or apprehensiō of Superstition, re-entring unto this Church. Your Argument, which ye brought to prove this, from the narrative of that Act, in your Answere to our ninth <HI>Demand,</HI> is confuted most plainly by us in our <HI>Replye</HI> to your <HI>Answere:</HI> and we shall again speak of it in our <HI>Duplye,</HI> to your second <HI>Answere</HI> concerning that <HI>Demād.</HI></P>
<P N="29">

<PB N="112" REF="57"/>29. As for the other two parts of your reason, they are contrary to the very words of the Acts of <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly. The first part is contrary to the Narrative of all these Acts, wherein no mention is made of satisfying the KING, but of other motives taken from the expediencie, or utility of the matters themselves. The second part is contrary to the tenor of the Decision, or Determination of these Acts: in the which by these formall words, The Assembly thinketh good: the Assembly ordaineth: Kneeling in the celebration of the Sacrament, Festival dayes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are enjoined.</P>
<P N="30">30. We hear of a childish, and rediculous concept of some, who think that these words, The Assembly thinketh good, import not an Ecclesiastick constitution, but a meere advice or Counsell. This ap∣prehension proceedeth from ignorance: for that phrase is most fre∣quently used by Counsells, in their decrees. In that Apostolick Coun∣sell, mentioned <HI>Acts</HI> 15, the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, are expres∣ly used, <HI>verse</HI> 22. 25. 28. In the Counsell of <HI>Ancyra, Can.</HI> 1. <HI>&amp;</HI> 2. the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is used. In that great and first <HI>OEcumenick</HI> Counsell of <HI>Nice, Can.</HI> 5. ye have these words; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Can.</HI> 8. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Can.</HI> 11. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. In the third Counsell of <HI>Carthage, Can.</HI> 1. 2. and 3. the word <HI>placuit</HI> is used, <HI>&amp; in codice Ca∣nonum Ecclesiae Africanae Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>co Latino, passim habetur vox Placuit</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And from the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Decrees of the Aposto∣lick Counsell were called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 4. Yea, also the civill Decree of <HI>Caesar Augustus, Luke</HI> 2. <HI>verse</HI> 1. is called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>edictum, placitum.</HI> And in the Civill Law, the Constitutions of Emperours, are called <HI>Principum placita, Instit. de Iure naturali,</HI> §. 6. <HI>&amp;</HI> 9. <HI>Quod Principi placuit, Legis habet vigorem,</HI> sayeth <HI>Ulpianus, ff. de Constit. Principum, Lege</HI> 1: Where <HI>Quod Principi placuit,</HI> signifi∣eth as much, as <HI>Quod Princeps constituit.</HI></P>
<P N="31">31. Your other reason, [which ye bring to prove the lawfulness of the forbearance of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles] is, that it is lawfull to swear the forbearance of a thing indifferent, in the case of scandall, and sen∣sible fear of superstition, in others. Yea, ye think, that by doing so, ye have sworn obedience to the commandement of GOD, which for∣biddeth the doing of that whereby others may be scandalized. This reason moveth us no more then the first: for, as for your fear of farther


<PB N="113" REF="57"/>
superstition, it is now groundlesse, and causelesse, in respect of the gracious promises contained in his Majesties Proclamation. But al∣though it were a fear justly conceived, and although the eschewing of an Evill justly feared, be a thing good and desirable; yet we ought not▪ for the eschewing of it, disobey the lawfull commandements of our Superioures. For this were to doe Evill, that good might come of it; which the Apostle condemneth, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. <HI>verse</HI> 8.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Of Scandall; and whether or not we may de∣ny obedience to the Lawes of our Superi∣ours, for fear of scandal causelesly taken?</HEAD>
<P N="32">32. As for that other motive of scandall, for which ye alleadge, that we who think the matters concluded in <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly, to be indifferent, and lawfull, may swear the forbearance of them; we pray you, tell us, what kynd of scandall it is, which, as ye alleadge, is taken at the practise of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles? Ye know, that passive scandall, is either procured by the enormitie or irregularitie of the fact it self, [to wit, when either it is a sin, or else hath a manifest show of sin] or else it is not procured, but causelesly taken by some, either through malice, or else through weakness. Now, which of these two sorts of scandall would ye have us to acknowledge, in the practise of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles? If the first, then ye would have us to condemne <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, be∣fore they be tryed in a free Assembly: which is contrary to your protestation, and no lesse contrary to our resolution. For, if we ac∣knowledge any enormitie in the practise of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, <HI>ex ipsa conditione operis,</HI> we shall be holden to condemne them, and abstaine from them for ever.</P>
<P N="33">33. If ye will have us to acknowledge, that the scandall following upon the practise of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, is of the second sort, that is, is causelesly taken; and▪ that for such a scandall, whether it be taken through weaknesse, or malice, we ought to abstaine from the doing of a thing indifferent, although it be enjoined by a lawfull Authority▪ (for ye generally affirme, that all things, which are not necessary, and directly commanded by GOD himself, ought to be omitted, for


<PB N="114" REF="58"/>
any scandall whatsoever, although it be causelesly, yea, and most mali∣ciously taken, and that notwithstanding of any humane precept, or law, enjoyning them. See the <HI>Dispute against the English Popish Ceremonies, Part.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 8. <HI>Sect.</HI> 5. <HI>&amp;</HI> 6. <HI>Item Cap</HI> 9. <HI>Sect.</HI> 10.) then we protest, that we differ so far from you in this point, that we think, that for no scandall, causelesly taken, can we swear such a for∣bearance of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, as ye would have us. And we marvell from whence ye have learned this strange, and most haske doctrine, that for scandall, causelesly, yea, maliciously taken, a man may totally, and absolutely, deny obedience, to the lawes of Superioures.</P>
<P N="34">34. The Author of the dispute even now cited, alleadgeth for his opinion, some Schoole-men, acknowledging the trueth of it: and he nameth <HI>Cajetane,</HI> and <HI>Bennez,</HI> who (sayeth he) affirme, that we should abstain, even <HI>à spiritualibus non necessariis,</HI> when scandall a∣riseth out of them. He might have cited for this tenet, <HI>Thomas,</HI> and all his interpreters, [even although he had been but slenderly acquaint with them] as well as these two: for they all doe say so. But truely he much mistaketh them, when he alleadgeth them for his opinion. For, first, none of them▪ ever taught, that we ought to abstaine totally and altogether, from any spirituall duety for the scandall, either of the weak, or malicious. Secondly, when <HI>Thomas</HI> and others following him, say, That <HI>bona spiritualia non necessaria sunt dimittenda propter scandalum,</HI> they speak directly <HI>de eis quae sunt sub concilio non vero sub praecepto,</HI> of matters of Councell, and not commanded by any Authority, divine or humane: and the most which they say of them, is, that such things <HI>sunt interdum occultanda, vel ad tempus differenda,</HI> that is, may at some times, and in some places, be omitted, for es∣chewing the scandall of the weak. Thirdly, the most accurate Ca∣suists, and interpreters of <HI>Thomas,</HI> differ much about this question, <HI>Whether or not, things that are commanded by positive Lawes, Civil, and Ecclesiasticall, may be omitted at any time, for eschewing</HI> Scanda∣lum pusillorum, <HI>the scandal of the weak.</HI> Dyverse of them deny this, to wit, <HI>Navarrus, in Manual.

<HI>Thomae, Tract. de Charitate, Quaest.</HI> 19. <HI>Art.</HI> 5. And for their judgemēt they cite <HI>Thomas, Durandus, Almainus, Anton. Florent.</HI> and many others. Fourthly: Those of them who think, that things commanded by humane Lawes, may be omitted in the case of scandall, admit not as ye doe, such an omission of the thing commanded in the case of scandall, as is conjoined with a flatte disclaiming of the Authority of the Law. For they tell us, that we ought not, for any scandall of the weak, deny obedience to the Precepts, or Lawes, of our superioures, whensoever all other circumstances being considered, we are tyed, or obliedged, to the obedience of them. The omission, then, of the thing commanded, which they allow, is only a partiall and occasionall for∣bearance, and not a totall abstinence from obedience, or disclaiming the Authority of the Law. See <HI>Valentia, Tom.</HI> 3. <HI>Disp.</HI> 3. <HI>Quaest.</HI> 18. <HI>Punct.</HI> 4. <HI>&amp; Suarez. de triplici Virtute, Tract.</HI> 3. <HI>Disp.</HI> 10. <HI>Sect.</HI> 3. §. 9.</P>
<P N="35">35. But the forbearance of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, which ye require of us, is conjoined with a flatte disclaiming of the Authority of all the Lawes which established them. And ye will have us to forbear these Articles, at this time, when all the particular circumstances, which we ought to regard, being considered, we are tyed to obedience of them, especially, if we look to the will and minde of the Lawgivers, and of our present Superioures. We justly say, that you will have us to disclaime, altogether, the Authority of these Lawes. For whosoe∣ver resolve and determine, not to practise <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, untill they be tryed in a new Assembly, &amp; established by a new Parliament; these are purposed, never to obey them, except they be tyed by new Lawes and Acts, concluded in a new Assembly, and Parliament: And, consequently, are resolved, never to regard and obey the lawes or Acts of <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly, and the Parliament 1621, which esta∣blished these things. But so it is, ye would have us to resolve, yea, to promise, and sweare, not to practise <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, untill they be tryed in a new assembly, and established by a new Parliament: <HI>Ergo,</HI> ye would have us to promise, not to practise <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, except we be tyed, or obliedged, by new Lawes, to practise them: and, consequently, would have us, never to regard, or obey, the Acts of <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly, and Parliament 1621.</P>
<P N="36">

<PB N="116" REF="59"/>36. This kinde of forbearance, to wit, which is conjoined with a plaine disclaiming of the authority of the Lawes made by our Superiours, can not be excused with your pretence of scandall causelesly taken. This we prove: First, by a position granted by your selves, and so evidently true, that no man can deny it. The Author of the Dispute, against <HI>English</HI> Popish Ceremonies, <HI>Part.</HI> 1. <HI>Cap.</HI> 4. <HI>Sect.</HI> 4. sayeth, That it were Scandall, not to obey the Lawes of the Church, when they prescrive things necessary, or expedient for the eschewing of Scandall: And, that it were contempt, to refuse obedi∣ence to the Lawes of the Church, when we are not certainly perswad∣ed, of the unlawfulnesse or inexpediency of things commanded. Now, if such a refusing of obedience, be both a Contempt, and a Scandall, it followeth manifestly, that no man for eschewing of Scandall cause∣lesly taken, ought in such a case to refuse obedience. Hence we reason thus: whosoever are not perswaded of the unlawfulnesse or inexpe∣diency, of the things commanded by their Superiours; and on the con∣trare think them to be expedient <HI>ad vitandum Scandalum;</HI> these ought not for eschewing of Scandall, refuse obedience to the Lawes and or∣dinances of their Superiours. But so it is, we are neither perswaded of the unlawfulnesse, nor of the inexpediency of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles: yea, on the contrarie, we think that the Acts of <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly, enjoin∣eth things very expedient for eschewing of Scandall: <HI>Ergo,</HI> we ought not for eschewing of Scandall causelesly taken, to refuse obedience to them. The <HI>Major</HI> of this our first Argument, is already proven. The <HI>Minor</HI> is conforme to the light of our own consciences, as GOD knoweth: and therefore so long as we are of this minde, we can not deny obedience to the ordinances of our Superiours, for any fear of Scandall causelesly taken.</P>
<P N="37">37. Secondly, that which may be removed by information or in∣struction, can not be warrand to us, of a totall abstinence from the obedience of Lawes, or, which is all one, of an avowed disclaiming of the Authority of them. But the Scandall of the weake, taken by the practise of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, may be removed by information, or in∣struction: <HI>Ergo,</HI> it can not be a warrand to us, of a totall disclaiming of the Authority of the Lawes, whereby these Articles were esta∣blished.</P>
<P N="38">

<PB N="117" REF="59"/>38. Thirdly: If for scandalls taken, especially by the malicious, we may disclaime the Authority of a Law, then we may ever disclaim the Authority of all Lawes, of the Church or Estate. For there is nothing commanded by Lawes, but some either through weaknesse, or through malice, may take offence at it.</P>
<P N="39">39. Fourthly, we ought not for eschewing scandal causelesly taken, to injure or offend any man, by denying to him, that which is due to him, and therefore we ought not, for eschewing scandall causelesly ta∣ken, to offend and injure our superioures, in Church and Policy, by denying to them that obedience which is due to them. The antece∣dent is clear by many examples. For if a man be excommunicated, shall his Wife, Children, and servants slee his company, and so deny to him these dueties which they ow to him, for fear that others be scandalized, by their keeping of company with an excommunicate Person? And if they may not for eschewing of scandall, abstaine from these dueties, which they ow to a private person, much lesse may we abstaine from that obedience, which we ow to our superioures, having publicke charges in Church and Policy, for eschewing of scandalls causelesly taken by others.</P>
<P N="40">40. Fiftly, what if the thing commanded, be enjoined by the ci∣vill Magistrate, under paine of death, and by Ecclesiasticall Authority, under paine of excommunication, shall we for fear of a scandall cause∣lesly taken, which may be removed by information, or for the scandall of the malicious, who will not be informed at all, abstaine from the doing of a thing lawfull and expedient, enjoined by Authority, and by so doing, incurre these most grievous punishments of Death tempo∣rall, and spirituall? We believe, that your selves, who speak most of scandall, would be loath to take such a yoke upon you.</P>
<P N="41">41. Sixtly, The denying of obedience, to the lawfull commande∣ments of our superioures, is forbidden in the fift Commandement, and consequently it is a sin. Shall we then for a scandall causelesly taken, deny obedience to our superioures, and so incurre the guilti∣nesse of sin? Ye commonly answere to this, that the negative part of the fift Commandement, which forbideth <HI>the resisting of the power, Rom.</HI> 13. <HI>verse</HI> 2. and in generall the denying of obedience to supe∣rioures, is to be understood with the exception of the case of any scan∣dall


<PB N="118" REF="60"/>
taken by others. For if we see, (say ye) that any may, or will take offence, at the doing of that which is cōmanded by our supe∣rioures, we are not holden to obey them: and our denying of obedi∣ence to them in such a case, is not forbidden in that Commandement.</P>
<P N="42">42. But, first, we aske, what warrand ye have to say, that the ne∣gative part of the fift Commandement, is to be understood with the exception of the case of scandall, more then other negative precepts of the second Table? Secondly: As men may take offence, either through weaknesse, or malice, at our doing of the thing commanded; so they are most ready to stumble at our denying of obedience to the lawfull commandements of our superioures: for they will take occa∣sion, by our carriage, to doe that, unto which by nature, they are most enclined; to wit, to vilipend Lawes, and the Authority of their supe∣rioures. Shall we, then, for the eschewing of a scandall causelesly taken, not only refuse to our superioures, the duety of obedience, which they crave of us; but also incurre an other scandall, and that a farre more perilous one. Thirdly: we have already shown, that the negative part of the fift Commandement, is not all wayes to be understood with the exception of the case of scandall causelesly taken. For, Wives, Chil∣dren, and Servants, must not deny obedience, and familiar conver∣sation to their Husbands, Parents, and Masters, which are excommu∣nicated, for fear that others, through weaknesse, or malice, be scan∣dalized thereat. Fourthly: As ye say, that the precept concerning obedience to superioures, is to be understood with the exception of the case of scandall causelesly taken; so we, with farre better reason, say, that the precept, of eschewing scandall causelesly taken, is to be understood with the exception of the case of obedience peremptorly required, by our lawfull superioures, as we shall show in our next Argument.</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>Whether the Precept of Obedience to Su∣perioures, or the Precept of eschewing scandall, be more obligatory?</HEAD>
<P N="43">43. Last of all: when a man is peremptorly urged by his supe∣rioures, to obey their lawfull Commandements, and in the mean time

feareth, that if he doe the thing commanded by them, some, through weakness, shall be scandalized, by his carriage; in this case, he is not only in a difficulty, or strait, betwixt the commandement of Man, and the Commandement of GOD, who forbiddeth us to doe that whereby our weak Brother may be offended; but also he seemeth to be in a strait betwixt two of GODS Commandements; to wit, be∣twixt that precept which forbiddeth the doing of any thing, whereby the weake may be scandalized, and that other precept which forbid∣deth the resisting of Authority; and telleth us, that whosoever resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of GOD. Now, seeing GODS Precepts are not repugnant one to another, neither doeth GOD by his Lawes lay upon us a necessity of sinning, out of all question, in this case, we are fred from the obligation of one of these precepts: and that which doeth not so strictly tye us, or is lesse obligatory, must needs give place to the other, which is of greater obligation. Ye com∣monly say, that the precept of obedience to humane Authority, must give place to the precept of eschewing scandall, although it be cause∣lesly taken: And, to confirme your Assertion, ye say, that the ordi∣nance of a superiour, can not make that fact to be free of scandall, which otherwise would be scandalous; and, that a fact, upon which any scandall followeth, ought not to be done for the commandement of Man. Whence ye collect, that, in such a case, we ought not to re∣gard, or obey the Commandement of our Superiours.</P>

This your Reason can not be good, because we can easily retort the Argument, and say to you, that in such a case we ought not to regard the scandall causelesly taken by our weak Brethren, so far, as to deny simplie, and absolutely, Obedience to our Superiours for it: and that because the sin of Disobedience ought to be eschewed and no Scandall of weak brethren causelesly taken, can make that fact, not to be the sin of disobedience, which otherwise, that is, <HI>ex∣tra casum scandali,</HI> would bee the sin of disobedience. For it is cer∣tain, that (laying aside the case of scandall) to deny obedience to the ordinance of our Superiours, enjoining, and peremptorly requiring of us, things lawfull, and expedient, is really the sin of disobedience. Ye will say, that the scandall of weak brethren, may make that Fact, or Omission, not to be disobedience, which otherwise would be dis∣obedience;


<PB N="120" REF="61"/>
because we ought not for the Commandement of man, doe that whereby our weak brother may be offended: and so the pre∣cept of obedience bindeth not, when offence of a weak brother may be feared. On the contrary we say, that the lawfull commandement of Superiours, may make that scandall of our weake brethren, not to be imputed unto us, which otherwise would be imputed unto us, as a matter of our guiltinesse; because we ought not, for fear of scandal causelesly taken, deny obedience to the lawfull Commandements of our Superiours.</P>
<P N="45">45. Again, ye say, that when scandall of weak brethren may be feared, the precept of Obedience is not obligatory, in respect the thing commanded by our Superiours, although it be in it self law∣full, yet it becometh unexpedient, in respect of the Scandall which may follow upon it. Now, (say ye) the ordinances of our Superi∣ours are not obligatory, when the things commanded by them are unexpedient. We, on the contrary, say, that when our Superiours require of us obedience to their lawfull commandements, the pre∣cept of eschewing scandall, is not obligatory; in respect we ought not, for Scandall causelesly taken, omit necessary dueties, which GOD in His Law requireth of us: In which number, we most justly doe reckon, <HI>The duety of Obedience.</HI> which we owe to the lawfull Com∣mandements of our Superiours.</P>
<P N="46">46. As for that which ye say, that when Scandall may be taken at the doing of the thing commanded, then the thing commanded be∣commeth inexpedient, and so ought not to be obeyed; that ye be not more deceived by this errour, we pray you marke, that a thing com∣comanded by our Superiours, in Church, or Policy, may be two wayes inexpedient, to wit, either in respect of some particular Persons, who through weaknesse or malice doe stumble at it, or else in respect of the body in generall, because it is contrary to Order, Decency, and E∣dification. If the thing commanded be inexpedient the first way on∣ly, we may indeed, in such a case, for eschewing the scandall of the weak, forbear the practise of the thing commanded <HI>hîc, &amp; nunc,</HI> in some particular places, and times: providing alwise we doe this▪ Without offence of our Superiours, and without the scandal of others▪ who by our forbearance may be made to vilipend the Authority of


<PB N="121" REF="61"/>
Lawes. But we can not in such a case totally and absolutely, deny o∣bedience to a Law, as we have already proven. Neither is your Argu∣ment brought to the contrary valide, in respect we ought more to look to the utilitie and benefite, which the body of the Church may receive by the thing commanded, and by our obedience to our Supe∣rioures, then to the harme which some particular Persons may re∣ceive thereby.</P>
<P N="47">47. If the thing commanded, be in our private judgement inex∣pedient the second way, we ought not for that to deny obedience to the Lawes of the Church; for when the inexpediency of a thing is questionable, and probable Arguments may be brought <HI>pro and contrae,</HI> concerning the expediencie of it, we have sufficient warrand to pra∣ctise it, if the Church by her publick decree hath declared, that she thinketh it expedient. Your errour, who are of the contrary minde, is very dangerous, and may prove most pernicious to the Church, for it maketh the Church obnoxious to perpetuall Schisme, and discon∣formity in matters of externall Policy: in respect men ordinarily are divyded in judgement, concerning the expediencie of these things Suppon, then, that in a Synode consisting of an hundreth Pastors, three∣score of them think this, or that particular Ceremony to be expedient for the good of the Church; and in respect of the plurality of their voices, make an Act to be concluded for the establishing of it, shall the remnant four<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, who are of the contrary judgement, deny obe∣dience to the Act of the Synode, because they are perswaded, that the thing concluded is inexpedient, and shal they by doing so, rent the bo∣dy of the Church? Truely, if we were all of your minde, we should ne∣ver have Peace nor Unity in this Church. Ye will say, perhaps, that this our Argument, is Popish, and leadeth men to acquiesce, with∣out tryall, or examination, in the decrees of the Church. We answere, that in matters of faith, the trueth whereof may be in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allibly conclud∣ed out of GODS word, we ought not, without tryall, to acquiesce into the decrees of the Church. And in this respect we dissent from the Papists, who ascrive too much to the Authority of counsells, as if their decrees were infallible. But in matters of Policy, if we be certaine, that in their own nature they are indifferent, and if the expediencie of them only be called in question, seeing no certaine conclusion, con∣cerning


<PB N="122" REF="62"/>
their expediency, can be infallibly drawn out of GODS word, which hath not determined, whether this or that particular Rite be agreable to order, decency, and edification; we ought to acquiesoe in∣to the decree or constitution of the Church, although it be not of in∣fallible Authority: and that partly because it is impossible, that other∣wise we can agree in one conclusion, concerning matters of this na∣ture, and partly, because if we deny obedience to the decrees of the Church in such matters, our disobedience shall prove far more unex∣pedient, and hurtfull to the Church, then our obedience can be.</P>
<P N="48">48. Seeing, then, whatsoever ye have hitherto said, concerning the question proponed by us, may be easily answered, with a retortion of the Argument, upon your selves; that we may eschew all such <HI>Lo∣gomachie,</HI> we must take some other course, and try which of these two precepts is in it self of greater moment, and obligation: for thence we may collect, which of these two precepts doeth obliedge us in the case foresaid; the other giving place to it, and not obliedging us at all, in that case. If ye say, that the precept which forbiddeth us to doe that whereby our weak Brother may be scandalized, is in it selfe more obligatory, or doeth more strictly ty us to the obedience of it, as being of greater moment, ye must bring a solide reason for you, which we think ye will hardly find. We know ye say, that the pre∣cept concerning Scandall, is more obligatory, and of greater moment; because it concerneth the losse of the soule of a Brother: But this rea∣son is not valide; first, in respect our Brother, if he be scandalized, by our obedience to our superioures, sinneth not by our default, who doe obey: for our carriage in giving obedience, is such, as may rather edifie our Brother. Secondly: the precept which forbiddeth disobe∣dience, concerneth the losse both of our own soules, and of the soules of others, who may be entysed to that sin, by our denying obedience, to the lawfull commandements of our superioures. Thirdly, if that pre∣cept of eschewing scandall, causelesly taken, doe so strictly obliedge us, when our superioures require obedience of us, it may happen, that a man shall be in an inextricable perplexity, not knowing whether he shall obey, or deny obedience to the cōmandements of his superioures: in respect he may fear the scandall of the weak, whether he obey, or deny obedience. For, as we said before, many are most ready to be


<PB N="123" REF="62"/>
scandalized by our denying obedience to our superioures, in thinges lawfull, and otherwise expedient: and that because we by nature are most unwilling to be curbed, and to have our liberty restrained, by the lawes of our superioures. For this cause (as <HI>Calvin</HI> judiciously not∣eth, <HI>Instit. Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 8. §. 35.) GOD to allure us to the duety of obedience to our superioures, called all superioures, Parents, in the fift Commandement.</P>
<P N="49">49. But we, with good warrand, doe averre, that the precept which forbiddeth resisting of the Civil power, and in generall the de∣nying of obedience to the lawfull commandements of our Superiours, is of greater obligation and moment. And, first, we prove this by an Argument taken from the diverse degrees of that care, which we ought to have of the Salvation of others: for this care tyeth us to three things; to wit, first, to the doing of that which may be edificative, and may give a good example to all. Secondly, to the eschewing of that which may be scandalous, or an evill example to all; that is, to the eschewing of every thing, which is either sin, or hath a manifest show of sin. Thirdly: to abstain even from that, which although it be lawfull, yet it may be, to some particular persons, an occasion of sin. Of these, the first two are most to be regarded, in respect they concern the good of all, which is to be preferred to the good of particular persons. Hence we inferre that the precept of obedience to Superiours, which pre∣scriveth an Act edificative to all, because it is an exercise of a most eminent and necessary vertue, is more obligatory, and of greater mo∣ment, then the precept of eschewing scandall, causelesly taken, by some particular persons.</P>
<P N="50">50. Secondly: That the precept of obedience to our superiours, is of greater moment, &amp; consequently more obligatory, then the precept of eschewing scandal, is evident by these reasons which are brought by our Divines, to show wherefore the fifth Commandement, hath the first place in the second Table: to wit, first, because it cōmeth near∣est to the nature of Religion or Piety, commanded in the first Table, whence (as your own <HI>Amesius</HI> noteth in his <HI>Medulla, Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 17. §. 13.) the honouring and obeying of Parents, is called by pro∣phane Authors Religion and Piety. Secondly: This precept, is the


<PB N="124" REF="63"/>
ground and sinewe, (sayeth <HI>Pareus,</HI> in his Catechetick explication of the fift precept,) of the obedience which is to be givē to al the rest of the precepts, of the second Table. Two reasons are cōmonly brought of this: one is, that all Societies, oeconomick, Civill and Ecclesia∣sticall, doe consist and are conserved, by the submission or subjection of Inferiours to Superiours, which being removed, confusion necessa∣rily followeth. The other is, that the obedience of this precept, maketh way to the obediēce of all the rest. For our superiours are set over us, to the end, that they may make us to doe our duety to all others. And consequently our obedience to them, is a mean instituted by GOD, to procure our obedience to all the rest of the Precepts of the second Table. Now, would ye know what followeth out of this, let your own <HI>Amesius,</HI> whose words are more gracious unto you, then ours, tell you it: Seeing (sayeth he, <HI>Cap. citato,</HI> §. 6.) <HI>humane societie hath the place of a foundation or ground, in respect of other dueties, of Iu∣stice and Charitie, which are commanded in the second Table of the Law: therfore these crimes which directly procure the perturbation, confusion, and eversion of it, are more grievous then the violation of the singular Precepts.</HI> Now we subsume: the denying of obedience to Superiours, enjoining such things as in themselves are lawfull and expedient, directly procureth the perturbation and confusion of hu∣mane society. And therefore it is a crime greater then the violation of other particular precepts of the second Table. For this cause, <HI>Dionysius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in his Epistle <HI>ad Novatum,</HI> cited before, declaring how much the unity of the Church (which is most frequently marred by the disobedience of Inferiours to their Superi∣ours,) ought to be regarded, sayeth, <HI>that Martyrdom suffered for es∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hewing of Schism<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, is more glorious, then Martyrdom suffered for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wing▪ Idolatrie.</HI></P>
<P N="51">51. Thirdly: These offices, or dueties, which we owe to others by way of Justice, are more strickly obligatory, then these which we owe to them, onely by way of charity. And consequently, these pre∣cepts which prescrive dueties of justice, are of greater obligation, then these which prescrive dueties of charity onely. But we owe the duety of obedience to our Superiours, by way of Justice, and therefore it is more obligatory, then the duety of eschewing Scandall causelesly ta∣ken,


<PB N="125" REF="63"/>
which is a duety onely of charity. The <HI>Major,</HI> or first proposi∣tion of this Argument, is clear of it self, as being a <HI>Maxime</HI> not onely received by the Scholasticks and Popish Casuists, but also by our Divines. See your own <HI>Amesius,</HI> in his <HI>Medulla, Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 16. §. 58. 59. 60. 61. 62. 63. where he not onely proponeth this <HI>Max∣ime,</HI> but also proveth it by two most evident examples. The <HI>Minor</HI> is likewise clear: For, first, the duety of obedience, which we owe to the publick Lawes of the Church and Kingdom, belongeth to that Generall Justice, which is called <HI>Iustitia legalis.</HI> For the legall Ju∣stice, as it is in Inferiours, or subjects, it is a vertue inclining them to the obedience of all Lawes, made for the benefite of the Common∣wealth, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> declareth in his fift book of the <HI>Ethicks, Cap.</HI> 1. Secondly: <HI>Debitum obedientiae,</HI> the debt of obedience, which we ow to our superioures, is not only <HI>debitum morale;</HI> a debt or duety, unto which we are tyed by morall honesty, and GODS Commandement, but also <HI>debitum legale,</HI> or <HI>debitum justitiae,</HI> (<HI>quod viz. fundatur in propriojure alterius</HI>) a debt grounded upon the true and proper right, which our superioures have to exact this duety of us; so that they may accuse us of injury, and censure us, if we performe it not. There is a great difference betwixt these two sorts of debt; and the last is far more obligatory, then the first: As for example, a man oweth moneys to the poor, by a morall debt, but to his creditor he oweth them by a legall debt, or debt of justice: and therefore, he is more strictly obliedged to pay his creditor, then to give almes. Such∣like, by morall honesty, and GODS precept also, a man oweth to his neighbour, a pious carefullnesse, to impede sin in him, by admonition, instruction, good example, and by ommission even of things lawfull, when he foreseeth that his neighbour in respect of his weaknesse, will be scandalized by them. But his neighbour hath not such a right to exact these things of him, neither can he have action against him, for not performing of them, as our lawfull superioures have for our due obedience.</P>

<HEAD>In what sense the administration of the Sacraments, in private places, was thought indifferent▪ in <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly.</HEAD>
<P N="52">52. In our <HI>Reply</HI> we professed, that we can not abstaine presently

from private Baptisme, and private communion, being required t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> administrate these Sacraments to such persons, as can not come, or be brought to the Church. Hence, first, ye take occasion to object to us, that the state of the question concerning <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, is quite al∣tered, in respect we and our associates, did ever before alleadge the question to be of things indifferent, but now we think them to be so necessary, that although the generall Assembly of the Church should discharge them, we behoved still to practise them: We answere, first, that the Assembly of <HI>Pearth</HI> hath determined nothing, of the indifferencie or necessity of these things. Secondly: If any who al∣lowed these Articles, did at that time in their discourses and speaches call them indifferent, they meaned only, that in the celebration of these Sacraments, the circumstances of place and time are things in∣different of their own nature: or, which is all one, that we are not so tyed to the administration of them in the Church, and at tymes ap∣pointed for Sermon, but we may celebrate them in private houses, and at other times. But judicious and learned men, even then thought the denying of these Sacraments to persons, who can not come, or be brought to the Church, to be a restraining of the means of grace, al∣together unwarrandable by GODS word. Whence ye may collect, whether or not they thought it to be unlawfull. Thirdly: Ye have no warrand from our <HI>Reply,</HI> to say, that we would not abstaine from private Baptisme, and Communion, although our nationall Assembly should discharge them. For as we are very unwilling to omit any necessary duety of our Calling: so we cary a singular respect to law∣full Authority, and to the Peace, and Unity of the Church, abhorring Schisme, as the very Pest of the Church. But of this we shall speak hereafter in the thirteenth <HI>Duply.</HI></P>
<P N="53">53, Next, ye say, if we have the same judgement of kneeling, in the receiving of the Communion, and of Feastivall dayes, it com∣meth to passe among us which hath been incident to the Church in former ages, that things have been first brought in as indifferent, then urged as necessary. Certainly, Brethren, none are so guilty of this, as your selves, and your associates: for ye have now made some things to be esteemed necessary by your followers, which have been accoun∣ted indifferent, not only since the Reformation, but these fifteene


<PB N="127" REF="64"/>
hundreth years bygone. And in some other things, which the ancient Church did wisely forbid, ye doe now make the Liberty of the Gos∣pel to consist. As for us, we stand as we stood before, and doe yet think kneeling in the receiving of the Sacrament, and the five Festi∣vall dayes, to be Rites indifferent in their own nature; but indeed very profitable, and edificative, if Pastors would doe their duety in making their people sensible, of the lawfulness &amp; expediency of them.</P>
<P N="54">54. We are of the same judgement concerning Confirmation, which <HI>Calvin,</HI> writting upon <HI>Hebr.</HI> 6. 2. acknowledgeth, <HI>To have been undoubtedly delivered to the Church by the Apostles:</HI> and with the same Author, in the fourth book of his Institut. <HI>Cap.</HI> 19, §. 14. we wish, that the use of it were again restored: so far are we from that partiall dealing with the Articles of <HI>Pearth,</HI> which ye object un∣to us. What hath moved our most reverend Prelats, to abstain hi∣ther<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o from the practising of it, we know not: they can themselves best satisfie you in this point. And we modestly judge, that this o∣mission hath proceeded from weighty and regardable causes. It was sufficient for us, to have a care of our own dueties, in our particular stations. But the urging and pressing of that practise upon the Bi∣shops, requireth higher Authority, then ours. In the mean time, ye know the Bishops never disclaimed the Authority of the act of <HI>Pearth,</HI> concerning Confirmation, or of any other of these Acts, as ye have done, who have been hitherto professed and avowed disobeyers of them all. Wherefore we wish you, hereafter not to bring this omis∣sion of the Bishops, in the matter of Confirmation, as an Argument for that forbearance of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, which ye require of us: for there is a great difference betwixt the omission of a duety comman∣ded by a Law, and an avowed, or professed, yea, sworne disobedience of the Law.</P>
<P N="55">55. Last of all, whereas ye say, that we, by mantaining the ne∣cessity of private Baptisme and Communion, doe condemne the practise of this our Church, from the Reformation, till <HI>Pearth</HI> As∣sembly, and put no small guiltinesse upon other reformed Churches, who use not private Baptism and Communion at all, but abstain from them as dangerous: we answere, that we have, in all modesty, pro∣poned our own judgement, concerning private Baptism, and private

<HEAD>A Defence of our Doctrine and Practise, concerning the Celebration of Baptism and the LORDS Supper in private places.</HEAD>
<P N="56">56. Ye desire us, wisely to consider, whether the desire which our people have of Baptism and Communion, in time of sicknesse, be not occasioned by prevailing of Popery, and through a superstitious conceit that people have of these Sacraments, as necessary to Salvatiō. We are loath to come short of you in dueties of charity, especially in good wishes; and therefore, we likewise wish you, wisely to con∣sider, whether the neglect of these Sacraments in the time of sick∣nesse, which is in many parts of the Kingdom, proceed not from some want of a sufficient knowledge, and due esteem of the fruits of these high and Heavenly Mysteries.</P>
<P N="57">57. It is well that ye acknowledge, that we minister these Sacraments in private, as necessary onely by the necessity of the Cōmandement of GOD; but withall ye conceive, that our people imagine, or seem to i∣magine them to be so necessary means, as that God hath tyed his grace to them. We desire you to judge charitably of those who are unknown to you; and withall we declare, that neither we doe teach our People, nor doe they think, for ought we did ever know, that Baptism is so necessary a mean unto Salvation, that without it GOD can not, or will not saye any: yea, on the contrary, we are confident, that when Baptism is earnestly sought for, or unfeignedly desired, and yet can not be had, the Prayers of the Parents, and of the Church, are ac∣cepted by GOD, in stead of the ordinary mean, the use whereof is


<PB N="129" REF="65"/>
hindred, by unavoidable necessity: and so in this we depart from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambrose in obitum Val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinia∣ni. <HI>See Do∣ctor</HI> Field <HI>in his</HI> 3. <HI>book of the Church.</HI> Cap. 32.</NOTE> rigid tenet of Papists. On the other part, we likewise teach, and ac∣cordingly our People learn, that Baptism is the ordinary mean of our enterance into the Church, and of our Regeneration; to the use whereof, GOD, by his Commandement, hath tyed us.</P>
<P N="58">58. If the commandement of our Saviour, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 19. <HI>Goe ye, therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost,</HI> tye not Parents to seek Baptism to their Children, and Pastors to administer, when it is sought, then have we no commandement at all, for baptizing of Infants, which is an Anabaptisticall absurdity: But if Parents and Pastors, are tyed by this Commandement, then Parents ought to seek Baptism, to their dying Children, not baptized before (for then, or never) and Pastors must accordingly performe that duety then, which is incumbent upon them. This is that which KING <HI>Iames</HI> of blessed memory, in a conference at <HI>Hampton</HI>-court, <HI>Pag.</HI> 17, reporteth himself, to have answered to a <HI>Scotish</HI> Minister, while he was in <HI>Scotland:</HI> The Minister asked, <HI>If he thought Baptism so ne∣cessarie, that if it be omitted, the child should be damned? No,</HI> said the KING; <HI>but if you being called to baptize the child, though pri∣vatlie, should refuse to come, I think you should be damned.</HI></P>
<P N="59">59. Ye say, (to avoide the strength of this Argument) that the necessity of the commandement, standeth onely for Baptism in pub∣lick; and, that no precept requireth Baptism, but when it can be had orderly, with all the circumstances thereof: whereof ye say this is one, that it be administred in the presence of that visible Kirk, wher∣of the Children are to be members. Thus, first, ye condemne as un∣lawfull the administration of Baptism even in the Church, God-fa∣thers, and God-mothers, being present, if the whole Congregation<NOTE PLACE="marg">Altare Da mascen, p. 828. and 853. <HI>Re-examina∣tion of the Assemblie of</HI> Pearth, pag. 227.</NOTE> be not present there; and the like doctrine we find in others, also cited on the Margin, which soundeth so harshly in the ears of some of your own adherents, that they can not be perswaded that this is your doctrine. Secondly: the Commandement of CHRIST tying us to Baptisme, hath no such addition either of the presence of the Con∣gregation, or yet of the materiall Kirk. This belongeth but to the solemnity, and not to the necessary lawfull use of Baptisme. Where


<PB N="130" REF="66"/>
GOD hath tyed this solemnity to Baptism, ye can not show by holy Scripture: but where GOD hath tyed us to Baptism, we have already shown. It is true, solemnities should not be lightly omitted: but the Law sayeth, <HI>When evident equity requireth, they may be dispensed withe</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In regulis juris in sexto Reg.</HI> 42.</NOTE> for according to that same Law, <HI>That which is chief and principall, should not be ruled by that which is accessory,</HI> but contrariwise. As for the place of Baptism, we may say of it, as <HI>Tertullian</HI> sayeth of the time thereof, in the 19 chapter of his Book of Baptism, <HI>Every day is the LORDS, every houre, day, and time, is fit for Baptism: it may want of the solemnity, but nothing of the grace.</HI> Neither is such a num∣ber, as ye require to be present, necessary in this case. Our Saviour hath taught us, <HI>Matth.</HI> 18. 19. <HI>That if two shall agree on Earth, as touching any thing that they shall aske, it shall be done for them, of his Father which is in Heaven: For</HI> sayeth he, <HI>where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</HI> We beseech you, therefore, Brethren, to take heed, that ye prescribe not to mens consciences, Rites of necessity, without clear warrand from GODS word, by which ye will never be able to prove the necessity of this circumstance required by you in Baptism.</P>
<P N="60">60. The practise of the primitive Church, both in the Apostles times, and thereafter, agreeth with this doctrine and practise of ours. Sainct <HI>Philip</HI> baptised the <HI>Eunuch</HI> on the way, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. <HI>Anantas</HI> bap∣tized <HI>Saul</HI> in a private house, <HI>Acts</HI> 9. Sainct <HI>Paul</HI> baptized the Jay∣lour in his house, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. If ye answere as others doe, that the ne∣cessity of the infancy of▪ the Church, excused the want of the presence of a Congregation: we reply, that the same necessity is found in the cases whereof we speak: for as unpossible it is for a dying insant, who about mid-night is at the last gaspe, to enjoy the presence of the congregation, as it was impossible for any of the afore mentioned, the <HI>Eunuch, Saul,</HI> or the <HI>Iailor,</HI> to have had a Congregation present at their Baptism, yea, more impossible; and why should there not be the same effect, where there is the same reason?</P>
<P N="61">61. The practise of the ancient Church, in this, is also clear for us. This is manifest from the 76▪ Epistle of S. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> from the Ora∣tion<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gregorie Nazianz.

<P N="63">63. As for the administring of the Sacrament of the LORDS Supper, we say it is most profitable, for comforting of the Soules of men, sighting with the terrous of death; and that the case may fall out, wherein they most ardently desire it, and consequently, that Pa∣stors who are the Stewards of GODS House, ought not to deny to his Children, so hungring and thristing in this conflict, that heavenly re∣freshment: which we are not ashamed, with the ancient Fathers, to call, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>Viaticum,</HI> though ye seem to condemne this. It is ma∣nifest by the writtings of the ancient Fathers: <HI>Iustine</HI> Martyr, in his 2. Apology: <HI>Eusebius,</HI> in the 6 Booke of his Story, 36. Chapter, and others, that the Sacrament was administred to sick persons privatly.

The ancient Fathers also call this Sacrament <HI>viaticum,</HI> or a provision for our journey. So the Fathers, in the fourth counsell of <HI>Carthage,</HI> speak, <HI>Canon</HI> 78. So <HI>Gaudentius</HI> in his second Treatise on <HI>Exodus.</HI> So in S. <HI>Basill</HI> his <HI>Liturgie,</HI> we find this Prayer, that the participation of these sacred things, may be the <HI>viaticum</HI> of eternall life.

<P N="64">64. Learned <HI>Calvin</HI> was of this mind: <HI>Many and weightie rea∣sons,</HI> sayeth he, <HI>Epist.</HI> 361. <HI>move me to think, that the Communion should not be denyed to sick persons. Zepperus,</HI> in his first Book of Ecclesiasticall policy, and 12. Chapter, hath these words of this mat∣ter, <HI>One thing rema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neth yet to be resolved,</HI> to wit, <HI>concerning the cōm∣union of sick persons. Albeit some think otherwise, yet it seemeth, that the holy Supper may not, nor ought not, to be denyed to them that seek it. For if it was appointed for the confirming of our faith, and increase of our Comunion with</HI> Christ; <HI>if we ought by the use of it to testifie our faith &amp; studie of repentance; why should they be deprived of so great a good, who fight with long diseases, or are in danger of their life? When doeth Satan labour more stronglie to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d brangle our faith, then when we are exercised with bodily diseases? When dó our consciences tremble more, and stand in need, of the most ample corroboration of faith, then when we find that death is knocking at the doore, and that we are cal∣led to compear before the Tribunall of GOD? Hieronymus Zanchius,</HI> is of the same mind. Thus he writeth in an Epistle of his to <HI>Iohn Crato,</HI> Physician to the Emperour, <HI>I have nothing to say of the que∣stion proponed by you, but that I subscrive to your judgement, provid∣ing this be done when necessitie requireth, and it be administred to them, who through sicknesse, cannot come forth with others in publick. For since CHRIST denyeth this to none of his D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sciples, how can we refuse it to sick persons, who desire it before they depart hence, and that not out of any superstition, but that their minds may be the more comfor∣ted, and raised up? Martin Bucer,</HI> in the 22. Chapter of his fore∣mentioned censure, considering that part of the <HI>Liturgie,</HI> wherein the administrating of the Communion to sick persons is ser down, sayeth, <HI>Things here commanded, are agreeable enough to holie Scrip∣ture: for it availeth not a little, to the comforting of troubled Soules,</HI>

<HI>to receive the Communion of the LORD.</HI> Yea, he hath written a particular and most devote Treatise, directing Pastors how to admi∣nister the Communion to sick persons: and yet we trust, ye will not call him a Papist, since he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o hatefull to Papists, that after he was dead, they raised up his bones and burnt them. <HI>Peter Martyr,</HI> writ∣ting upon the 10. Chapter of the 1. Epistle to the <HI>Corinth.</HI> speaking of the LORDS Supper, hath these words, <HI>They say it most be given to sick persons: I confesse</HI> sayeth he, <HI>but the mystery may be celebra∣ted before the sick persons.</HI> It is to be remarked also, that often times it falleth out, that some persons are affixed to their beds by sickness, for the space of five or six, yea, ten yeares, or more: And how can we deny the comfort of this holy Sacrament to those all that space, especially when they earnestly long for it?</P>
<P N="65">65. This doctrine and practise of ours, tendeth not to the con∣tempt of the Sacraments, (as ye would bear upon it) it is plaine contrary: for by this practise, we show, how much we reverence the Commandement of GOD, and how highly we esteem of his ordi∣nances, which we so earnestly seek after; whereas on the other parr, the practise of others, leadeth people to the contempt of the Sacra∣ments, because they are moved the reby, to thinke, that there is no such necessity and efficacy in them, as Scripture, and the consent of Christians, hath ascribed thereunto. As for other abuses, rehea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed by you, as fruites of private Baptism, since you bring no proofe for what ye say in this, we oppone our just denyall, to your bare and unjust as∣sertion.</P>

Lastly, ye advertise the Reader, that ye think not the mate∣riall Churches, but the ordinary meetings, necessary to the lawfull administration of the Sacraments, lest any should conceive that ye entertaine a superstitious conceit of places.

So from the first, to the last, the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Covenant</HI> bindeth us to the po∣licy which was then; and consequently, maketh a perpetuall Law, concerning the Rites of the Church, as if they were unchangeable.</P>
<P N="3">3. Your Answere to this Argument, is not sufficient, nor to the


<PB N="136" REF="69"/>
purpose. 1. Ye put off, without any Answere, that which we alleadge out of a Dispute, against the <HI>English</HI> Popish Ceremonies; and, in stead of answering, wish, that what we have thence, or from any o∣ther Treatise of that kind, were keeped to another time. Pardon us, that we wish greater ingenuity, and a more direct Answere. Con∣sider the words of that Treatise before cited, <HI>Part.</HI> 4. <HI>Cap.</HI> 8. <HI>Sect.</HI> 8. <HI>No man amongst us can certainly know, that the Discipline meaned and spoken of in the Oath, by those that swear it, comprehendeth not under it those points of Discipline, for which we now contend, and which this Church had in use at the swearing of the Oath. Shall we, then, put the breach of the Oath in a fair hazard? GOD forbid.</HI> The same we find to be the judgement of others also, who have opposed the Articles of <HI>Pearth,</HI> and Episcopall Government. Since, there∣fore, we desire to be resolved, concerning the right meaning of the negative Confession, lest by it we condradict the positive Confession, approved in Parliament: Had we not reason to propone this difficul∣ty to you, who require our subscription, and came hither, to resolve our Scruples? If ye condemn the judgement of these your Brethren, who were Authors of these Treatises, why doe ye not openly profess, that ye, and the rest of the Authors of the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> disallow it? If ye doe approve it, as we have great reason to think ye doe, since ye have still opposed the Articles of <HI>Pearth,</HI> and Episcopacy, and doe expresly referre us to those Treatises in your ninth <HI>Answere:</HI> How doe ye not see, that, with a good conscience, ye can not require us, to swear, and subscrive, that which ye know to be contrary to our minde? Remember, we pray you, the words of the former Treatise, in the place before cited, put the case, it were doubtfull and question∣able, what is meaned by the word Discipline in the Oath; yet <HI>pars tutior,</HI> the safer way were to be chosen; which is affirmed there to be this: that the points practised by us, are abjured in the negative Confession.</P>
<P N="4">4. Secondly: whereas ye say, That none of you would refuse to swear the short Confession, because we have expounded some Ar∣ticles of it contrary to your minde: we reply, that this answere sa∣tisfieth not: for you swearing the negative Confession, notwithstan∣ding of the contrary Interpretation of them who differ in judgement


<PB N="137" REF="69"/>
from you, showeth not, how the apparent contradiction betwixt it, and the positive Confession, objected by us, is reconciled by you the pro∣pounders and urgers of it. Moreover, if we did urge you to subscrive the negative Confession, when in the mean time we were perswaded, that our interpretation of the Articles thereof, were contrary to your judgement; we were bound to labour to informe your judgement, before we did exact your Oath: and, consequently, by the law of Charity and Equity, ye are obliedged, not to require our Oath, till first ye doe that, which is sufficient, to make our judgement conforme to yours: which as yet ye have not done.</P>
<P N="5">5. Thirdly: ye say, your desire is, that both of us keep our mean∣ing of the negative Confession, according to our diverse measures of light, and only promise forbearance: which, ye say, we may doe, be∣cause that we think the points controverted, to be indifferent: we an∣swere, that ye still flee the point in question: for it is another thing for us, to keep our meanings, and another thing for us, to swear a <HI>Co∣venant,</HI> when we are not perswaded of the trueth thereof. Ye might, and may still enjoy your meaning for us: but how we can keep our meaning, and subscrive your <HI>Covenant,</HI> we see not; since we think the one repugnant to the other. Neither is it forbearance only that is re∣quired, as we have shown before; nor yet can we swear forbearance, the Law standing still in vigour, and Authority requyring obedience. Lastly: we think not all the points contraverted, to be indifferent, as was before declared.</P>
<P N="6">6. Thus it may appear, how ye have dealt with our <HI>Sorites,</HI> as ye call it. The like dealing we find anent our <HI>Dilemma;</HI> the hornes whereof, (as ye speak) ye labour to turn against our selves, by asking. To which of the members of the distinction, we referre <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles and Episcopacy? <HI>If</HI> say ye, <HI>they were abjured in the negative Confession, we are perjured for the practising of them: and if left indifferent▪ by that Confession, we may, notwithstanding of that Confession, forbear the practise of them.</HI> First, Your <HI>Question</HI> is not pertinent: For the distinction is not ours, but yours. And to what purpose is it to you, to know, to what member of your distinction, we referre the Articles of <HI>Pearth,</HI> and Episcopacy? Secondly: There is no strength in either of the Hornes of your <HI>Dilemma:</HI> For, by turn∣ing


<PB N="138" REF="70"/>
it wrong, you have made it your own. The one horne is, That if the Articles of <HI>Pearth,</HI> and Episcopacy, be left indifferent, by the short Confession, we may forbear the practise of them. First, This meeteth not the horne of our <HI>Dilemma,</HI> which was, if we be not tyed, by the negative Confession, to the ommission of these things; then why have ye, in all your writings against us, exprobrated to us, Perjury, for violating of the Oath contained in that Confession? To this no word by you is answered here. Secondly: Suppone these things were left indifferent by the negative Confession; yet may we not forbear the practise of them: because, since that Confession, Lawes have passed on them; which remaining in vigour, require our Obedience as we said before.</P>
<P N="7">7. The other horne of your <HI>Dilemma,</HI> is, that if these points were abjured for ever, before <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly, then wee, who practise them, are perjured. To which we answere, That it followeth not: for we never did swear to that negative Confession. And therefore, though these points were abjured therein, yet are we free from all guiltinesse of Perjury. And in the mean time, ye have not resolved, how he who is perswaded, of the lawfulnesse of those points, can swear the negative Confession, if by it the Swearer be tyed, to the abjuring of those points, which was the other part of our <HI>Dilemma.</HI> Thus if ye will consider rightly, ye may perceive, that, our <HI>Dilemma</HI> standeth unmoved, with the hornes of it still towards you. Ye farther insinu∣ate, that our Reasons, are not solide and grave, but velitations of such a sort as ye looked not for. Let the judicious Reader, pronounce his sentence of this; only we wish, that ye had chosen rather to satisfie, then to contemn our reasons. That which ye here againe adde, con∣cerning the change of Cōmissioners▪ is answered in our fourth <HI>Duply.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. To give light to your former discourse, ye subjoine a distinction of discipline, into three members: First, ye say, it is taken for the rule of Government of the Church, and censure of manners, by office bearers appointed by CHRIST: and thus, ye say, it is unchangeable. Secondly, for constitutions of counsells, and Acts of Parliament, about matters of Religion: And thus, ye say, it is alterable, or constant, according to the nature of particular objects. Thirdly: for the or∣dering of circumstances, to be observed in all actions, divyne, and


<PB N="139" REF="70"/>
humane: and so ye say it is variable. First, by these distinctions, the matter seemeth rather to be obscured, then cleared. For ye doe not expresse, in which of these senses the discipline mentioned in the ne∣gative Confession, is to be taken, which was the point required of you.</P>
<P N="9">9. Secondly: ye seem by this distinction, to intangle your selves yet more. For, first, if ye take the name of discipline, in any one, or any two of these senses, what say ye to these following words of your <HI>dispute against the English Popish ceremmies, Parte</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 8. <HI>Sect.</HI> 8. <HI>The Bishop doeth but needlesly question, what is meaned by the discipline whereof the Oath speaketh. For howsoever in Ecclesiasti∣call use, it signifieth often times, that Policie, which standeth in the censuring of manners; yet in the Oath it must be taken in the largest sense; namely, for the whole Policy of the Church. For,</HI> 1. <HI>The whole Policy of this Church, did, at that time▪ goe under the name of discipline: and those two Books wherein this Policy is contained, were called</HI> the Books of discipline. <HI>And without all doubt, they who swore the Oath, meaned by discipline, that whole Policy of the Church which is contain∣ed in those Books.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Secondly, when that little Confession was framed, the go∣vernment of the Church was only by Presbyters, and not by Bishops: and, therefore, if ye think, that the name of discipline, in that Con∣fession, comprehendeth under it the first part of your distinction, (which, as we conceive, ye will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deny) ye may easily perceive, that we are urged by you, to sweare, and subscrive against our Con∣sciences; since we think the rule of the government of the Church, which then was to be changeable; and, that the Government was law∣fully changed, by following Assemblies, and Parliaments, from Pres∣byters, to Bishops.</P>
<P N="11">11. Thirdly: If these Constitutions of Counsells, concerning objects alterable, mentioned in the second member of your distinction, be one, &amp; the same, with ordering of variable circumstā<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es▪ mentioned in the third member; why have ye distinguished the one from the other? But, if they be different, then ye grant, that Ecclesiastick constitutions, may<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See thē</HI> Dispute a∣gainst the English Popish Ce∣remonies, part. 3. cap 7. sect. 5.</NOTE> be made concerning some alterable matters of Religion, which are not bare circumstances; which is repugnant to your ordinary doctrine; whereby ye mantain, that nothing changeable, is left to the deter∣mination


<PB N="140" REF="71"/>
of the Church, in matters of Religion; but onely circum∣stances of Actions. We can not see, how ye can mantain this do∣ctrine, and yet oppose the determinations of the Church, concern∣ing Ceremonies, which are indifferent.</P>
<P N="12">12. We had reason to inquire your judgement, concerning Rites or Ceremonies, which are not of divine Institution, whether they be lawfull, or not, though ye still shun the declaring of it. Since by your <HI>Covenant,</HI> ye intend a reformation of Religion, and a reco∣vering of the Liberty and Purity of the Gospell, as ye speak; if ye in your judgement, condemne such Ceremonies, (as ye insinuate) we can not expect, but that, if ye obtain your desires, all such Rites shall be expelled and condemned, especially since by this your late <HI>Cove∣nant,</HI> ye tye your selves to that old <HI>Covenant,</HI> wherein ye disclaim and detest all Rites brought into the Church, without the word of GOD.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The late</HI> Confession of Helve∣tia, cap. 27 Confession of Bohem. cap. 15.

But if ye be of the same mind with us, and think, that there are some Rites of that kind lawfull, why doe you hide your minde from us, and others, since the acknowledgement and manifesting of this Trueth, would be no small advancement to your cause, by removing this great offence?</P>

If ye say, there is not a neces∣sity, then there is no Commandement of GOD there-anent, for it is necessary to obey GODS Commandement. If ye say, there is a necessity, what say ye then to your friend <HI>Didoclave,</HI> who in his Al∣tar of <HI>Damascus, pag.</HI> 866, affirmeth, that neither the presence of the Congregation, nor blessing of the Minister, is necessary to this action? And if ye dissent herein from him, ye are holden to prove your opinion, by a necessary consequence from holy Scripture, which we are perswaded ye are not able to doe.</P>
<P N="15">15. Thirdly: the commandement, to blesse the people, is no lesse, if not more generall, then that, 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 40. <HI>Let all thinges be done decently, and in order:</HI> on the which words, both ancient and recent Divynes, doe ground the lawfulnesse of the Ceremonies which we allow.</P>
<P N="16">16. Fourthly: Since that commandement, of blessing the people, is generall, what reason have ye, for not including other civill im∣portant Contracts, especially that are performed with a Vow, or


<PB N="142" REF="72"/>
promissorie Oath? A vow made to GOD, is a <HI>Covenant</HI> with GOD▪ as well as the Matrimoniall Oath. All Vows and Oaths, are Acts of religious Worship, although they be joined to civill Contracts: and, therefore, if because of the <HI>Covenant</HI> with GOD, ye blesse Marriage solemnly, ye ought to doe the same, to other civill Contracts, wherein there is the like <HI>Covenant,</HI> by vertue of an Oath or Vow.</P>
<P N="17">17. Fiftly: Whereas ye say, that though Marriage were a paction, meerly Civill, yet because it is so important, ye would not with-hold Ecclesiastick Benediction from it, notwithstanding of the abuse of Poperie: we would understand, how this agreeth with the current Doctrine of those that are of your minde: for we read in the Abridge∣ment of <HI>Lincolne, pag.</HI> 17. <HI>that we should cast away even such things, as had a good originall, (if they be not still necessary, and commanded of GOD) when once they are known to be defiled with Idolatry, or a∣bused by it. So in the dispute against the English Popish ceremonies, Parte</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 2. <HI>Sect.</HI> 2. it is affirmed, <HI>that Rites, ancient, lawfull, and agreable to GODS Word, should, notwithstanding, necessarily be abolished, because of their superstition, and wicked abuse.</HI> Ye adde, <HI>that ye will not use Marriage superstitiously, according to the prescript of the Service Book.</HI> Ye did not find the <HI>Service Book,</HI> neither in our <HI>Demands,</HI> nor in our <HI>Replyes;</HI> yet we know not, how ye so often reach unto it.</P>
<P N="18">18. Lastly: of the stipulation of God-fathers in Baptism, instan∣ced by us, in our fift <HI>Demand,</HI> ye have spoken nothing particularly, either in your first or second <HI>Answeres.</HI> We have no precept, or ex∣ample<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Peter Mart. <HI>on the</HI> 6. chap <HI>of the</HI> E∣pistle <HI>to the</HI> Rom. &amp; Gerar∣dus, <HI>in</HI> Loc Theolog. Tom. 4.</NOTE> of it in holy Scripture: yea, some of our learned Divynes af∣firme, that it was instituted by Pope <HI>Higynus:</HI> and ye will not deny, that it hath been much abused in Popery. How commeth it to passe, then, that this Ceremony is allowed, and used by some of you? we say, some; for we are informed, that some of your minde, doe not use it at all. See <HI>D.

<HEAD>The VI. DUPLY.</HEAD>
<P>IN your first <HI>Answere</HI> to our sixt <HI>Demand,</HI> ye answered nothing to


<PB N="143" REF="72"/>
that, which we affirmed concerning the judgement of Divynes, an∣cient and moderne, who either have absolutely allowed these Rites, which were concluded in <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly, or else have thought them tolerable, &amp; such as ought not to make a stirre in the Church: neither did ye touch that, which we objected, cōcerning the venerable custom, and practise of the ancient Church, and the most eminent lights of it, which ye condemn in your interpretation of the negative Confes∣sion, contained in the late <HI>Covenant.</HI> Wherefore, in our <HI>Reply</HI> to that <HI>Answere</HI> of yours, we did hold your silence, for a granting of the trueth of that which we said, concerning so many Divynes, ancient and modern, who stand for us. Now in your second <HI>Answere</HI> to that <HI>De∣mand,</HI> ye labour to bereave us of this advantage, and granting that Divynes, both ancient and modern, are against you, concerning the lawfulness of things controverted, (a thing to be noted by the Reader, and which should make you more sparing in your speaches of us who favour <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, then ye are) ye say, first, that Divines, an∣cient, and modern, are against us also: and that both these proposi∣tions may be true, in respect they are both indefinite in a matter cō∣tingent. But our proposition concerning the judgement of Divines who stand for us, was more then indefinite. For albeit we said, not, that all are for us; yet we said, that many, yea, so many; meaning, that a great many are for us, and against you, in matters of lawful∣nesse, and unlawfulnesse, and, consequently, in matters of faith. This expression of the number, ye were glad to passe by: because ye can not say the like of these, who favour your judgement, concerning the unlawfulnesse of those things. For, scarce know we any modern Di∣vines, without his Majesties Dominions, that peremptorly condemn these Rites, as unlawfull, which were concluded in <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly: and of Ancients, we mean the Fathers of the Ancient Church, wee know none at all, who are of your minde. How is it, then, that for these your new positions, ye make such stirre, and doe take such dangerous courses in hand.</P>
<P>Secondly: Ye say, that almost all Divines allow of such a forbea∣rance, of things indifferent, as ye require of us. But ye will not be able to make this good: For, who of our Divines, have any-where allowed, in subjects such a forbearance of things indifferent, and law∣full,


<PB N="144" REF="73"/>
as is conjoined with a totall and sworn disobedience to standing Lawes, against the Prohibition of their Superiours.</P>
<P>Thirdly: That which ye say, concerning Innovations already in∣troduced; to wit, that nothing is required of us, concerning them, but a Forbearance of them for a time; and, that we may condescend to it, without either disobedience to Authority, or wronging of our Flock; it is already refuted, in the two former <HI>Duplyes.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="duply">
<HEAD>The VII DUPLY.</HEAD>
<P>OUr Reason proponed in the seventh <HI>Demand,</HI> is not suffici∣ently answered, neither the impediment removed, as we have formerly made manifest, especially in our fourth <HI>Duply.</HI> Whereas, for removing of our scruple, concerning your interpreta∣tion of the short Confession, ye tell us, that ye urge not upon us your meaning, but leave us to our own, till the matter be examined in an Assembly: We answere; we love not the swearing of an Oath, without clear interpretation thereof; and we approve not subscription of such a Covenant, with diverse, or doubtfull meanings: neither doe wee think that a convenient mean, for solide Pacification. And as wee are free, in professing our meaning, concerning the <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacy; so we require of you the like plainnesse, or then the reason of your tetyrednesse.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles ye doe unjustly call Novations, if by this name ye understand, things repugnant to our reformed Religion, or forbidden by our publick Lawes: for these Articles are not of this sort. Those of them which we call necessary, the Assembly of <HI>Pearth</HI> did not conclude as indifferent, (as ye alleadge) neither can any such thing be inferred from the words of the Acts of that Assembly. Therefore, we have no reason to change this opinion, as ye would have us to doe. We hold all the five points, to be lawfull, and lau∣dable, and some of them more then indifferent, which also the words of the Synod it self doe imply: so that, without just reason, it hath pleased you to say, that things formerly indifferent, are become ne∣cessary; and what was but lawfull before, and had much adoe to gain


<PB N="145" REF="73"/>
that Reputation, is now become laudable. Thus again, we do plainly declare unto you, that the cause of our unwillingnesse to subscrive, or promise forbearance, is both the commandement of Authority, and also the necessity and excellency of some of the things commanded: besides that, we think them all lawfull, and laudable. What we would doe, at the commandement of Authority, in the forbearance of the practise of those things, for the peace of the Church, and Kingdom, shall be declared in our <HI>Duply</HI> to your thirteenth <HI>Answere,</HI> wherein ye urge this point again.</P>

<HEAD>The VIII DUPLY.</HEAD>
<P>VVHereas ye doe remit the Reader, to your former An∣swere, and our Reply; we also remit him thereto, and to our first Duply; hoping that he shall rest satis∣fied therewith.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have, in those places, answered your Argument, concer∣ning your swearing, the defence of the KING, and his Authority, with a specification, as ye call it; and have shown, that what hath not been looked to so narrowly, in this matter heretofore, is requisite now, for the reasons expressed in our eight <HI>Reply,</HI> and first <HI>Duply.</HI> Concerning the full expression, of the loyalty of your intentions, to mantain the KINGS Person, and honour; whether, or not, ye have given just satisfaction, to those who are nearest to the KINGS Ma∣jesty, (as ye say) we referre you, and the Readers, to that, which ye, and they, will find near the end of our first <HI>Duply.</HI> We wonder greatly, ye should affirme, that we, by craving resolution, doe wrong the KING, and our selves; or that ye, by giving of it, should wrong them who are nearest his Majestie, and also the <HI>Covenant,</HI> and the sub∣scrivers thereof. For our requiring of resolution, in this matter of so great importance, is a pregnant Argument of our loyalty towards our dread Soveraigne, and of our care, to have alwise our own conscien∣ces voide of offence, towards GOD, and towards Men. And your giving of satisfaction unto us, would have served for farther clearing of your <HI>Covenant,</HI> and the subscriptions thereof. Your pretence, that


<PB N="146" REF="74"/>
by giving us satisfaction, ye should wrong them who are nearest his Majesty, is grounded upon a wrong supposition, as if they had already received satisfaction by your Declaration.</P>
<P N="3">3. GOD is witnesse, we doe not wittingly and willingly multiply doubts, for hindring a good worke, or to oppose against a shining light, (as ye would have the Reader to thinke of us) but in all humility, and uprightnesse of heart, doe declare our minde, and doe intimate our unaffected scruples. And we thinke it very pertinent, at this time, to crave resolution of them, and to desire your answere, concerning this maine duety, which is not fully expressed in your <HI>Covenant;</HI> wher∣as a more full expression of it, had been very needfull, at this time.</P>
<P N="4">4. Lastly: Whereas ye complaine, that we took not sufficient notice of you, while ye were amongst us; ye may easily consider, that our publick charges, and imployments, together with the shortnesse of the time of your abode here, doe sufficiently vindicate us, from a∣ny imputation of neglect in that kinde: and our doores were not closed, if it had pleased you, in Brotherly kindenesse, to have visited us: which we ought rather to have expected of you, seeing ye came undesired, to the place of our Stations, to deal with us, and also to deal with our people, against our will, before we had received satisfaction.</P>

<P>AS ye doe referre the Reader, to your former <HI>Answers;</HI> so doe we referre him to our former <HI>Replyes,</HI> and <HI>Duplyes.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The meaning of the Act of the Assembly of <HI>Pearth,</HI> cit∣ing the wordes of the <HI>Psalm.</HI> 95. is not (as ye doe interpret it) any perverting of the Text, neither tendeth it to inferr thereupon, abso∣lute necessity of kneeling, in all worshipping of GOD, or in this part of his Worship, in the celebration of the holy Communion: but only to inserr the lawfullnesse, and commendable decency of kneeling, in divyne worship; and that it is such a gesture, as our lawfull superiours may enjoine to be used, in GODS worship; and that religious adora∣tion, and kneeling, is to be done to GOD only, although they sin not, who use another gesture, where this is not required by Authority, but


<PB N="147" REF="74"/>
another appointed, or permitted.</P>
<P N="3">3. We doe not kneel before the Sacramentall Elements, making them the object of our Adoration, either mediate, or immediate: neither doeth the Act of <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly import any such thing. But all our Adoration, both outward, and inward, is immediately directed to GOD only, with Prayer, and thanksgiving, at the receiving of so great a benefite. Wherefore, your objecting of Idolatry, against us here, and in your other Treatises, is most unjust. We marvell also, how ye doe here refer us, to those Treatises, which in your twelfth <HI>Answer,</HI> ye seem to disclaime, finding fault, that any of us should lay hold on them, or build any thing upon them. As likewise ye here al∣leadge, that the Assembly of <HI>Pearth</HI> made Kneeling necessary in all points of GODS Worship; and, consequently, in receiving the holy Eucharist: not remembering, that in your seventh <HI>Answere,</HI> ye said, the Assembly had concluded the five Articles as indifferent.</P>
<P N="4">4. Concerning the <HI>Service-Book,</HI> (which now is not urged) we have already answered. Neither find we any reason, of your uncha∣ritable construction of us, or of the disposition of the people, as if they were now become superstitious. Nor doeth this time give any just cause of such feares, as are sufficient to overthrow the reasons of that Act of <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly.</P>
<P N="5">5. We did not in malice, but in love, say, that such a defence as ye professe here, according to your Protestation, and such meetings and conventions doe require the KINGS consent, and Authority, to make them lawfull, according to our judgement: whereof some rea∣sons we have expressed before in our second <HI>Reply,</HI> which as yet ye have not satisfied.</P>
<P N="6">6. It seemeth, that ye are either not able, or not willing, to an∣swere particullarly and plainly, to our interrogatories proponed in our ninth <HI>Reply:</HI> and we would understand some reason, why ye doe so, in such a free and brotherly conference; seeing although ye doe other∣wise interpret our meaning, yet truely we did not propone them to be snares to you, but to obtain satisfaction to our selves and others, for a peaceable end. As for your Questions, which ye throw against us, with plain profession to work us discontentment thereby, we shal here make an answere to them in meekness, and evident demonstra∣tion

<HEAD>Questions Answered.</HEAD>
<P N="7">7. YOur first Question, concerning the <HI>Service-Book,</HI> and book of <HI>Canons,</HI> is nowise pertinently proponed to us. If we did urge upon you the said books of <HI>Service</HI> and <HI>Canons,</HI> as ye doe now the <HI>Covenant</HI> upon us, we should particularly and punctualy, declare our mind concerning them.</P>
<P N="8">8. To your second Question, we answere, that it is our duety to enquire carefully, what is incumbent upon us by the Law of GOD, and man, towards our Prince. We doe not move questions of state, but doe answere to your propositions, resulting upon matters of state, and we doe labour, as it well becommeth all good Subjects, to be well in∣formed, before we put our hand to any thing, which concerneth our due obedience to our Prince. As for that which here again ye alleadge, of his Majesties Commissioner, and wise States-men, as having re∣ceived satisfaction from you, we referre you, as before, to our An∣swere made thereto, in our first <HI>Duply.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. To your third Question, we answer; our assertion concerning the unlawfulnesse of Subjects their resisting the Authority, of free Monarchs, by force of Arms, even although they were enemies to the Trueth, and persecuters of the professors thereof, can not in the judgement of any reasonable man, import that we have the least sus∣pition of our KING, that either he shall change his Religion, or shall fall upon his religious and loyall Subjects with force of Armes. We have often declared in these our Disputs, that we are fully perswaded of our KINGS Majesties constancy, in profession of the true Reli∣gion, and equitable disposition in ministration of Justice. And in te∣stification hereof, we rest satisfied with his Majesties Proclamation, against which ye have protested.</P>
<P N="10">10. To your fourth Question, we answere, because that we doe esteem subscription to your <HI>Covenant,</HI> neither to be warrantable by GODS word, nor to be a convenient mean for pacification, we hold it our duety, both to with-hold our hands from it, and to dehort our people from it.</P>
<P N="11">

<PB N="149" REF="75"/>11. To your fift Question, we answere: 1. We hold it a wrong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upposition which ye make, that the Prelates and their followers, are labouring to introduce Popery, and to make a faction. 2. We know our gracious KING, to be so just, and so wise, and so ripe in yeares and experience, that he will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suffer any of his Subjects, to abuse his Majesties name, in the execution of any injustice. 3. To make resistance by force of Arms, against the KINGS publick standing Lawes, and against his Majesties publick Proclamations, is not (in our judgement) a convenient or lawfull way, for defending of the Religion, of the Liberties, and Lawes of the Kingdom, and of the KINGS Authority; but on the contrary it bringeth scandall upon our profession. See our Reasons in our second <HI>Duply.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. To your sixt Question, we answer, that in all free Monarchies, there is nothing left to subjects, in the case of persecution, by their own Soveraigne Princes, but patient suffering, with Prayers and Tears to GOD, or fleeing from their wrath, as we have at length proved in our second <HI>Duply.</HI> This doctrine did the people of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> learne of their holy Bishop <HI>Athanasius,</HI> as is evident by their own words, in their Protestation, subjoined to the Epistle of <HI>Athanasius, ad vitam solitariam agentes.

<P>ALthough we take you to be of the number of those who penned the late <HI>Covenant,</HI> yet pardon us, to call your Glosses of it in question, so long as ye doe not satisfie our Arguments, which prove them to be contrary to the very words of your <HI>Covenant.</HI> We have shown, in our <HI>Replyes,</HI> and now again in our fourth <HI>Duply,</HI> that the words of the <HI>Covenant</HI> import a perpetual adherance, to the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e externall Policy of the Church, as it was <HI>Anno</HI> 1581; and the remo∣ving of <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacy, as of things contrary to the Liberty and Purity of the Gospell. Whence we still inferre, that these who have sworn the <HI>Covenant,</HI> are tyed by their Oath, to vote against <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacy: and, consequently, can not, without prejudice, either dispute, or give out a decisive sentence con∣cerning them, in the intended Assembly.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ye say, ye will not judge so uncharitable of us, as to think us so corrupt, that, in our opinion, since the time designed by us, nothing hath entered into the Church▪ beside Episcopacy, and the Articles of <HI>Pearth,</HI> which can be prejudiciall to the liberty and purity of the Gos∣pell. We are glad, that although ye judge uncharitably of us, yet ye judge not so uncharitably: and, although ye think us corrupt, yet ye think us not so corrupt, as not to be sensible of these things. We told you our minde before, in our fourth <HI>Duply,</HI> concerning these abuses, which ye think to have been occasioned by <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles: and now we tell you, that if <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, and Episcopacy, for these their alleadged consequents, be altogether removed, the benefite which ye think our Church may receive, by removing of them, shall not, in any measure, equall her great losses.</P>

<P>VVEe complained in our <HI>Demand,</HI> of the uncharitablenesse of your Followers, who calumniate us, as if we were favourers of Popery. And to show how unjust this ca∣lumnie


<PB N="151" REF="76"/>
is, we declared, that we are ready, to swear, and subscrive, our nationall Confession of Faith, ratified and registrated in Parliament: to which Declaration, we have now added our Oath, which we did swear, when we received the degree of Doctorate in Theologie, and have solemnly again renewed it, <HI>Pag.</HI> 81. 82. In your <HI>Answer</HI> to that <HI>Demand,</HI> ye slighted our complaint, and did not so much as once mention it; which made us in our <HI>Reply,</HI> to complain also of you, who have shown your selves so unwilling to give us that testimony of our sincerity in professing the Trueth, which all who know us, think to be due to us. We expected, that in your second <HI>Answer</HI> to that <HI>Demand,</HI> this fault should have been amended. But, contrary to our expecta∣tion, we perceive, not only that ye are insensible of the grievous in∣jurie done to us, by the calumnious reportes of others; but also, that ye have busied your own wittes, to enquire, as ye say, in matters, to search, and to try our wayes, and to expisca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e what ye could against us, by the unfriendly testimony of some, who, perhaps, are displeased with us, as <HI>Achab</HI> was with <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ah,</HI> for the freedome of our admo∣nitions. <HI>Charity,</HI> ye know, <HI>thinketh no evill,</HI> 1. Cor. 13. 5. <HI>and co∣vereth a multitude of transgressions,</HI> Prov. 10. 12. 1. Pet. 4. 8. But uncharitable inquisition, and prying into other mens doings, not only discovereth those infirmities, unto which GOD will have every one of us subject, for humbling of us; but also bringeth even upon good men, a multitude of undeserved Aspersions. Brethren, we intend not to give you a meeting in this; for our resolution is, <HI>not to be overcome of evill, but to overcome evill with good, Rom.</HI> 12. 21. And we are glad to suffer this for his cause, whose Trueth we mantaine, pitying in you this great defect of Christian and Brotherly compassion; and praying GOD, not to lay it to your charge. Wherefore, we will not search and try your wayes, as ye have done ours: but we will reflect our thoughts upon our selves, and see whether or not we be guilty of these things, which ye here reprehend in us.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ye say, first, That we have taken an ample testimony to our selves. But what, we pray you, have we testified of our selves; but this onely, that in sincere and zealous profession of the Trueth, we are not inferiour to others; and, according to our measure, have stri∣ven to be faithfull in all the dueties of our Calling? Ye have, indeed,


<PB N="152" REF="77"/>
put more into our Apology, and say, that we have praised our selves, from our frequency of Prayer, extraordinary Humilations, and holy∣nesse of Life, and Conversation, &amp;c. For, as ye are loath to speak any good of us; so ye would have the Reader believe, that we speak too much good of our selves. But in this, as ye wrong us, so ye make the Reader to see, how negligently ye have read and considered our words. For, whereas in the second part of our <HI>Reply,</HI> we told you, that we have other meanes, and more effectuall, then your <HI>Covenant,</HI> to use, for holding out of Popery; mentioning in particular, extraor∣dinary Humiliation, frequency of Prayer, amendement of life, dili∣gence in Preaching, and searching the Scriptures, &amp;c. Ye imagine, that we doe arrogate to our selves, some singularity, in using these means; not considering, that it is one thing to say, that we may and ought to use these means, and another thing, to say, that we are sin∣gular, and eminent, above others, in the diligent use of them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Next: Whereas ye say, that ye were desirous, rather to hear that testimony, at the mouths of others, (as if ye had never heard our Pains and Labours, for the Trueth, commended by any) who know∣eth not, but in this case, in the which we stand for the present, it is lawfull, and most expedient to men, to vindicate themselvs, and their fidelity in their Callings, from the contempt and calumnies of others. We have in the Scriptures, notable examples of GODS dearest Saints, who in such cases, yea, in other cases also, without any dero∣gation, to their singular humility, did fall out into high expressions, of their own vertuous and pious carriage. Who ever spake so hum∣bly of himself as <HI>Paul,</HI> who calleth himself <HI>lesse then the least of all Saints, Ephes.</HI> 3. 8. &amp; yet elsewhere he sayeth, <HI>that he was not a white behind the very chiefest Apostles;</HI> and, <HI>that he laboured more abun∣dantlie then they all,</HI> 1. Cor. 15. 10. 2. Cor. 11. 5.</P>
<P N="4">4. The defects, which by your strict and curious Inquisition, ye think ye have found in us, may be reduced into two points: One is, that we are too sparing in our paines, in Preaching; and, that we often fill our places with Novices. The other is, that the small pains which we have taken, are not fruitfull. And, to prove this, ye say, that Popery hath no lesse increased in our City, under our Ministerie, then any time before since the Reformation. As for the first of these,


<PB N="153" REF="77"/>
to omit that which modesty will not permit us to speak, either of our own paines in teaching, or of yours, it is very well known, that in the case of sickness, and extraordinary imployments in our callings, which but seldom doe fall foorth to us, it is both lawfull, and commendable to see, that our places may be filled, either with some actuall Mini∣ster, or, failing of that, with able students of Divinity, approven by publick Authority, whereof your selves can not be ignorant, in respect of your frequent Peregrinations, from your Stations.</P>
<P N="5">5. As for the next point: Although it were true, yet <HI>the Parable of the seed sowen in diverse sorts of ground,</HI> and the dolorous com∣plaints, which these most painfull and thundering Preachers, <HI>Eliah,</HI> 1. <HI>King.</HI> 19. 10. <HI>Isaiah,</HI> 53. 1. Paul <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 6. and 3. 1. yea, of CHRIST himself, <HI>Matth.</HI> 23. 37. and <HI>Luke</HI> 19. 41. 42. made of the hard successe of their laboures, may learne you to be more be∣ninge in your censures of us, then ye are. In the mean time, it is known to his Majesty, to the Lords of secret Counsell, and to all the Countrey here; as also it is evident, by many publick extant Acts of the said secret Counsell, and of our Diocoesian Assemblies, that we have been as diligently exercised, in opposing of Popery, as any Mi∣nisters in this Kingdom. Neither hath our successe herein been so badde, as ye have given it out: for since our entry to the Ministry here scarce hath any man been diverted from the trueth, to Popery; some Papists have been converted, to the profession of the Trueth, and o∣thers who were incorrigible, have been forced to depart from this Countrey. Yea, we think, that our successe, in dealing with the Pa∣pists, had been undoubtedly greater, if they had not been hardened in their Errour, by your strange and scandalous Doctrins, repugnant to Scripture, and sound Antiquity.</P>
<P N="6">6. That which ye say in the second part of your <HI>Answer,</HI> concer∣ning the powerfull effects of your <HI>Covenant,</HI> meeteth not with that which we did object, concerning the unlawfulnes of it.

For ought we can perceive, by the Doctrins of those with whome ye joine, ye acknowledge no lawfull Authority at all in Prelats, above your selves, and other Ministers: and ye seem so to insinuate so much here, by blaming us, for calling them, Reverend and holy Fathers. We are perswaded of the law∣fulnesse of their Office, and therefore are not ashamed, with Scrip∣ture, and Godly Antiquity, to call such as are advanced to this sacred Dignity, Fathers, and Reverend Fathers. Neither should personall faults, alleadged by you, hinder our observance, till what is alleadged be clearly proven. For, so long as things are doubtfull, we should<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Favorabi∣liores rei poti{us} quā actores ha bentur. ff.

And it is a rule of Law, that in a doubtfull case, the state of a Possessor, is best; and, consequently, of him that hither-to hath been in a possession of a good name: as also, that in things doubtfull, we should rather favour the person accused, then him that accuseth.</P>

<HEAD>The XIII. DUPLY.</HEAD>
<P>YE repeat your former <HI>Answer,</HI> concerning your interpretation of the clause of forbearance, which we have already refuted in our former <HI>Replyes,</HI> neither doe ye bring here any new confir∣mation thereof: And therefore all the three scandals, mentioned in our 13 <HI>Demand,</HI> doe yet remaine unremoved.</P>
<P N="2">2. Although your interpretation were admitted, which we can not admit, yet at least the third▪ scandall were nowise avoidable ther∣by, (whatsoever may be supposed concerning the other two,) and that because of the reason expressed in our 13 <HI>Reply;</HI> to which your <HI>Answers</HI> here are not satisfactory. 1. Ye doe insinuate, that ye think our Oath of obedience to our ordinary, and <HI>Pearth</HI> constitutions, not lawfull in it self: which we are perswaded is very lawfull. 2. Ye would seem to infer the unlawfullnesse of it, by challenging, the Authority whereby it was exacted; and alleadging that their is no ordinance made Civill or Ecclesiastick, appointing any such Oath. This reason (although it were granted) hath no strength at all, to prove that which ye intend, to wit, that either our Oarh is in it self unlawfull, or that we may now lawfully break it: for our swearing of that Oath is


<PB N="160" REF="81"/>
not against any lawfull Authority, either divyne or humane: and in such a case, Oathes concerning things lawfull, ought to be keeped, whether they be required by appointment of a publick ordinance, or not: which whosoever denyeth, he openeth a patent doore to the breaking of lawfull Oathes, in matrimoniall and civil Contracts, and many other cases, daylie incident in humane conversation. Also the exacting of that Oath, was clearly warranded by two Acts of Parlia∣ment, viz. Parliament 21. of King JAMES the 6. holden at <HI>Edin∣burgh, Anno</HI> 1612. <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. and Parliament 23. of King JAMES the 6. holden at <HI>Edinburgh, Anno</HI> 1621. Act 1.</P>
<P N="3">3. Ye take upon you to call in question, with what conscience that Oath was given. How oft, Brethren, shall we exhort you to forbeare judging of other mens consciences, which are known to GOD onely? <HI>Iudge not, that ye be not judged.</HI> Matth. 7. 1.</P>
<P N="4">4. Ye alleadge, we can not answer before a generall Assembly for our Oath, and the scandall risen thereupon. No man needeth to be ashamed, before a generall Assembly, or any other judicatory, of his lawfull and due obedience, which he hath given to the publick con∣stitutions of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to his Majesties standing Lawes; or of any lawfull Oath, whereby he hath promised that obe∣dience. As for the scandall, it was not given by us, but unnecessarily, and unjustly taken, by you, and some others, upon an erronious opi∣nion, obstinatly mantained against the lawfulnesse of the matters themselves.</P>
<P N="5">5. Ye say, that conceiving the Oath, according to our own grounds, none of us will say, that we have sworn the perpetuall approbation and practise of these things, which we esteem to be indifferent, what∣soever bad consequent of Popery, Idolatry, Superstition, or Scandall, should follow thereupon. We answer, 1. These bad consequents are alleadged by you, but not proven. 2. Evils of that kind should be avoid∣ed, by some lawfull remedy. And we doe not esteem it lawfull for us, to disobey Authority in things lawfull, although in themselves indifferent: for obedience commanded by the fift Precept of the De∣calogue, is not a thing indifferent. There be other means which are lawfull and more effectuall against such evils, as we have specified in our eleventh <HI>Reply:</HI> 3. We did not swear perpetuall approbation,


<PB N="161" REF="81"/>
and practise of indifferent things; but knowing these things in them∣selves, to be approvable, we did swear obedience to the publick Laws, requyring our practise in these thinges, so long as the Law standeth in vigour, and our obedience thereto is required by our lawfull Superi∣oures. 4. This course we hold to be more agreable to our duety, then upon private conceptions of scandalls unnecessarily taken, to break off our due obedience to that Authority which GOD hath set over us.</P>
<P N="6">6. Out of our assertion (<HI>Reply</HI> 4.) concerning the administration of the Sacraments in private places, to sick persons, in case of neces∣sity, ye doe collect, that we cannot forbear the practise of these, al∣though our ordinary, and other lawfull superiours, should will us to doe so. And hence ye infer, that herein <HI>Pearth</HI> Assembly, for which we stand, is wronged by us two wayes: 1. That we differ in judgement from them, about the indifferency of the five Articles: and next, that at the will of our ordinary, and ye know not what other lawfull supe∣rioures, we are ready to forbear the practise of these things, which the Assembly hath appointed to be observed.</P>
<P N="7">7. As for your maine Question, Whether a duety necessary by divyne Law, may be, or may not be omitted, in case, our ordinary, &amp; other lawfull superioures, should will us to omit it? before we answer to it, we must expound what we mean by our other lawfull superiours, because of your jesting pretence of ignorance hereof. We mean here∣by, the Kings Majesty, the Parliament, the secret Counsell, and other Magistrates, and ecclesiasticall Assemblies, whereunto we owe obedi∣ence in our practise required by them, according to publick Lawes.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Question it self ye doe express more clearly in your <HI>Answer</HI> to our 4. <HI>Reply,</HI> wher ye alleadge, that we find some of the <HI>Pearth</HI> Ar∣ticles so necessary, that although the generall Assembly of the Church should discharge them, yet we behoved still, for conscience of the commandement of GOD, to practise them.</P>
<P>Thus are we brought to this generall Question;</P>
<Q>Whether, or no, any thing necessary (or com∣manded) by divine Law, may, in any case, without sin, be omitted when publick humane Authority dischargeth the practise therof?</Q>
<P>For resolving of this question, we desire the Reader to take notice of these Theological <HI>Maximes,</HI> received in the schools, &amp; grounded upon holy Scriptur.</P>

Others lesse weighty, such as are those of the <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles; which we call necessary, and ye doe reject.</P>
<P N="11">11. The exercise of some affirmative necessary dueties, may be some times omitted, by Authority, without sin, for the publick peace, or some pressing necessity. Thus <HI>Moses</HI> permitted repudiation of a mans married wife, not fallen into adultery; neither did he urge strictly the affirmative duety of adherence, and that for the hardnesse of their heart. Wherein <HI>Moses</HI> had respect to the peace and unity of the Tribs of <HI>Israell,</HI> as <HI>Alexander Alensis</HI> observeth in his <HI>Summe of Theologie, Part.</HI> 3. <HI>Qu.</HI> 46. <HI>Membro</HI> 1. <HI>Art.</HI> 1. <HI>&amp; Art.</HI> 2. <HI>David</HI> did not execute, in his own time, judgment against <HI>Ioab,</HI> for his murthering of <HI>Abner,</HI> and <HI>Amasa,</HI> because the sonnes of <HI>Zeruiah</HI> were too hard for him. Circumcision was omitted, because of the uncertainty of their abode in one place, when the people were with <HI>Moses</HI> in the Wildernesse.</P>
<P N="12">12. Exercise of ecclesiasticall Discipline, against open obstinate offenders, is an affirmative duety, incumbent, by divyne Law, upon the Pastors, towards those who are committed to their charge. Yet it may, and ought to be forborn, when it can not be used without an open rupture, and unavoidable Schism.

<P N="14">14. Divine Institution, by the Ministery of the Apostles, craveth Deacons, ordained by imposition of hands, for all their life time, <HI>Acts</HI> 6. Yet in our reformed Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> we have no such


<PB N="164" REF="83"/>
Deacons. Which oecomenicall defect, necessitated by detention of Church mantenance necessary for their sustentation, we hope shall not be imputed to our Church, as sin, so long as she despiseth not that Institution, and acknowledgeth, and lamenteth, this deficiencie, and endeavoureth, by peaceable lawfull means, to have it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emedied.</P>
<P N="15">15. Although some affirmative Dueties, necessary by divine pre∣cept, doe give place, sometimes, to other more weighty, and more pressing dueties, (as the saving of a stranger may be omitted, for sa∣ving my father or my brother, or my son, out of the same danger, when I am able onely to save one of them. And many such like ex∣amples doe occurre:) yet it is never lawfull to condemn or oppugn such Dueties, as evill, or superstitious, or scandalous in themselves, neither to rank them amongst things in themselves indifferent.</P>
<P N="16">16. Hence we doe inferre, that notwithstanding of the necessity of those of the <HI>Pearth</HI> Articles, which we call necessary, yet sometims the practising of them, may become not necessary, and the omission there∣of not sinfull, publick authority, &amp; necessity of the peace of the church, so requiring. Some time indeed, the omission of a thing prescrived by an affirmative Divine or Humane Law, may befaultlesse: But it is ne∣ver lawfull for Subjects, to transgresse the negative part of the divine<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thom.</HI> 2a <HI>2ae qu.</HI> 43 <HI>art.</HI> 7. <HI>prop ter nullum scandalum quod sequi videatur, debet homo praetemissa veritate, falsitatem decore▪</HI></NOTE> Precept, by resisting with force of Arms, that power whereunto GOD hath subjected them, and to which he hath forbidden them, to make such resistance. Neither is it at any time lawfull, for Pastors and Teachers, to teach erronious Doctrine.</P>
<P N="17">17. Ye doe attribute to us, as a great absurdity, that at the will of our ordinary, and other lawfull Superiours, we are ready to forbear the practise of these things which the Assembly hath appointed to be ob∣served. And this ye inferre from the necessity of administration of the Sacraments, sometimes in private places, according to our judgment. Certainlie, ye will have much adoe, to make good, by right Logick, this your inference from such an Antecedant. But to speak of the mat∣ter of the Consequent, for satisfaction to the Reader, we find no such absurdity in it, as ye seem to proclaim. For, if some Dueties appoin∣ted by divyne Law, give place sometimes to other weighty dueties, such as is the keeping of publick peace and good order, as we have al∣ready shown, much more may a thing, notwithstanding of any humane Law appointing it to be observed, befor these respects omitted, at

<P>IF the words of the <HI>Covenant</HI> be plaine, (say ye) concerning the meer forbearance▪ and speak nothing of the unlawfullness, no mans thoughts can make a change. But we have given our rea∣sons, which justly move us to require greater plainness; neither have we as yet received satisfaction, concerning those reasons.</P>
<P N="2">2. In our 14 <HI>Reply,</HI> we said, that your Band of mutuall defence against all persons whatsoever, may draw subjects, perhaps, to take Aimes a∣gainst their King, (which God avert) &amp; cōsequently from that loyaltie of obedience, which they ow to their <HI>Soveraign,</HI> &amp; ours; except ye de∣clare, and explaine your selves better, then ye have hitherto done. To this ye answer, that, by this <HI>Reply</HI> we doe a threefold wrong: one to our selves, another to the subscrivers, the third to the Kings Majesty. But ye have not directly answered to the point proponed by us.</P>
<P N="3">3. The wrong which ye say, we do to our selvs, is in forging from the words of the <HI>Covenāt,</HI> impedimēts, &amp; drawing stumbling blocks in our own way, to hinder our subscriptiō. This your wrongous asseveratiō, we justly deny, protesting, as we have often done, that we do walk sincerly in this matter, according to our light, not forging to our selvs impedi∣mēts, nor drawing stumbling blocks in our own way; but clearly show∣ing the impediments, and stumbling blocks, which the contryvers of the <HI>Covenant</HI> have laide in our way, by their very incommodious ex∣pression, irreconciliable [in our judgement] with your exposition.</P>
<P N="4">4. Ye say, we wrong the subscrivers, in changing the state of the Question, and in making a divorce betwixt Religion, and the KINGS Authority, which the <HI>Covenant</HI> joineth together, hand in hand. We doe nowise wrong the subscrivers, when we propone uprightly our just scruples, as we in our consciences doe conceive them, whereby we are moved to with hold our hands from that <HI>Covenant:</HI> whereof one is, the fear of unlawfull resistance to Authority, if we should hold to that <HI>Covenant;</HI> howsoever ye will not suffer to hear patiently this objecti∣on, because in your <HI>Covenant</HI> ye doe professe, the conjunction of Re∣ligion, and the KINGS Authority: which profession of yours, doeth not sufficiently serve for a full answer to our objection, against those


<PB N="166" REF="84"/>
other words of that same <HI>Covenant,</HI> whereupon our scruple did arise▪ To clear this, we wish you to answere directly (to this our present <HI>Demand:</HI>) whether or no, in case of disagreement, (which Godavert) think ye that the <HI>Covenanters</HI> as obliedged, by vertue of their <HI>Covenāt,</HI> to make open resistāce, by force of Arms? If ye think they are obliedg∣ed to make resistance, then we desire your Answer to the Reasons and testimonies broght in our 2. <HI>Duply,</HI> proving the unlawfulnes of such re∣sistāce. But if ye think that they be not oblidged, thē declare it plainly.</P>
<P N="5">5. But most of all, ye say, we wrong the Kings Majesty, in bringing him upon the stage, before his subjects, in whose minds we wold (as ye do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> alleadge) beget and breed suspitions of opposing the true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>aking innovation in Religion, and of dealing with the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, contrary to his Lawes and Proclamations, and contrary to the Oath at his Coronation. We answer▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e have not brought, but have found his Majesty upon this unpleasant stage, opposing him∣self openly to your <HI>Covenant,</HI> with solemn protestations, against all sus∣pitions of opposing the trueth, or making innovation of religiō, or deal∣ing with the subjects contrary to his lawes &amp; proclamatiōs, or contrary to the oath at his co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>natiō. this his Majesties declaratiō against which ye have protested, we have willingly received, &amp; do truely believe it.</P>
<P N="6">6. What the most honourable Lords, of his Majesties privy Counsell have done, cōcerning his Majesties last proclamation, &amp; upō what mo∣tives, their Hs. themselves do know, &amp; his Majesties high Cōmissio∣ner, hath publickly declared in his printed <HI>Manifesto,</HI> contrary to some of your asseveratiōs, cōcerning the proceeding of that honorable boord.</P>
<P N="7">7. Ye profess here, that, it becōmeth you, to judge charitably of his Majesties intentions, altho ye disallow the <HI>Service Book,</HI> and <HI>Canons,</HI> as containing a reall innovation of Religion; and doe affirme, that the in∣tention of the Prelats, &amp; their associats, the Authors and contrivers of the books, is most justly suspected by you. We have told you already, that, concerning the matters, contained in those books, it is not now time to disput, the books themselvs being discharged by his Majesties proclamation, and a royall promise made, that his Majesty will neither now nor herafter, press the practise of the forsaid <HI>Canōs</HI> &amp; <HI>Service book</HI> nor any thing of that nature, but in such a fair &amp; legall way, as shall sa∣tisfie all his Majesties loving subjects; &amp;, that his Majesty neither in∣tendeth innovation in Religion or Lawes. As for the intentions of his


<PB N="167" REF="84"/>
sacred Majesty, we do heartily &amp; thankfully acknowledge them, to be truely conforme to his Majesties gracious declaration, in that his last Proclamation. And, indeed, it becommeth both you and us, to think s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them. Neither do we take upon us, to harbour in our breasts, any un∣charitable suspition, concerning the intētions of those others of whom ye speak; seeing they stand or fall to their own Master, and the thoughts of their hearts are unknown, both to you and us: and in a matter uncertaine it is surest to judge charitably. Yea, we have ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y pregna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Arguments to perswade us, that those reverend Prelates, and their Associates, had no such intention, as ye judge.</P>
<P N="8">8. Ye make mention of three wrongs, done by us to you: the one, in the <HI>Warning,</HI> whereof ye have an answer already given in our 12. <HI>Duply,</HI> where ye did use great exaggerations, then either the intentiō of the warner did merit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> became your chartiy and profession. And by your repetition of it in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> place, ye show, that ye have too great de∣light to dwell upon such expostulations, wheras theologicall reasons of the matter in controversie, would better become you in such a <HI>Disput.</HI> The second wrong is, that (as ye alleadge) we have wronged you, in with-holding our hand and help from so good a cause, of purging Reli∣gion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hieronym. Apologia adversus Russinum quae incipit <HI>Lectis lite∣ris,</HI> prope si∣nem. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li∣bus institu∣tus es Dis∣ciplinis, ut cui respondere non potueris, caput auferas; &amp; linguam, quae tacere non potest se∣ces?

Quis omissa causa, in superflua criminum objectione versatus est.</NOTE> &amp; reforming the Kirk, from so many gross abuses, and opposing all those who have modestly laboured for Reformation. But certainly, the wrong is done to us by you, in that ye do, without warra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Au∣thority, obtrude upon us, and those cōmitted to our charges, the swear∣ing of an Oath, which is against our own consciences: and because of our just refusall &amp; opposition, ye do wrong us also, in misinterpreting our pious and upright meanings, and in making and stirring up collate∣rall, and personall quarells against us, and threatning us therwith. Thus (if GOD by his special grace did not uphold us) might we be driven, by worldly terrours, to do against the light of our own consciences.</P>
<P N="9">9. The third wrong, wherwith ye charge us, and for the which ye do infinuate, that we may fear trouble, is (as ye alleadge) in our speaches,


<PB N="168" REF="85"/>
in publick, and private, and in our missives, &amp;c. Hereunto we answer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in our former <HI>Replyes,</HI> that whensoever it shall please you, to speci∣fie these speaches, we hope to give you, and all peaceably disposed chri∣stians, full satisfaction, and to clear our selves of that imputation; so that none shall have just reason, to work us any trouble. In the mean time, if our ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nuity would permit us, (as it dothnot) to think it a decent course, to make use of hearkeners, and catchers of words, and to wait for the haulting of our Brethren, some of your own speaches might be represented unto you, wherein ye would finde weaknesse.</P>
<P N="10">10. As for these owtward, or externall Arguments, which ye bring here, to prove your <HI>Covenanting,</HI> to be the work of God, from the suc∣cess of your enterprize, from the multitude of subscrivers, and from their contentment, &amp; from their good carriage, (which we wold wish, in many of them, to be more charitable, and peaceable, and so more christian, then it is) we cannot acknowledge, to be a Cōmentary writ∣ten by the Lords own hand, (as ye pretend) in approbation of your <HI>Co∣venant;</HI> unless ye first clearly show us the text or substance of your <HI>Co∣venant,</HI> to be written in the holy Scriptures, in all points therof; espe∣cially in those points, wherin ye and we do controvert, and which only, at this time, can be pretended against us, seeing we make oppsition only in those points. And we wish heartily, that leaving these weak nots of Trueth, to the Papists, chief acclaimers of them, amongst chri∣stians, (that we speak nothing of aliens from christianity) ye would be pleased to adhere, with us into the holy Scriptures, as the only sure &amp; perfect rule of true Religion, and the heavenly Lamp, which God hath given us, to show us the way of trueth &amp; peace: wherin the GOD of Trueth and Peace direct all our steps, for JESUS CHRIST our Saviour, who is our Peace: To him be Glory for ever: Amen.</P>
