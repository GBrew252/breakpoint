<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THere was a Book lately publish'd
against Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI> and my Self,
which not only treats us with Pe∣dantick
Scorn, like those that
are to Cap the Author within his Colledge:
but its seems, to trample on the best Consti∣tution,
our Government it self, under Co∣lour
of its being <HI>New</HI> in the 49th. of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 110.</NOTE>
when it arose out of the indigested Matter
of Tumults and Rebellion; and so not ha∣ving
a Legitimate Birth, as not born in Wed∣lock
between the King and his People, it
may be turn'd out of Doors, by the Help of
that Maxim.</P>
<P>Quod initio non valet, tractu temporis
non convalescit.</P>
<P>How can a Bastard become a Mulier?</P>
<P>The Treatise which was to prove the <HI>Fact,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jan. &amp;c.</HI> p. 1. Matter of Fact only.</NOTE>
was cried up for unanswerable; and per∣haps,
'twas imagined, that there was no
possibility left for a Reply; since the Writer,
who has render'd himself famous in his Ge∣neration
<PB REF="3"/>
(as if he knew better how to ma∣nage
a Design than an Argument) pass'd
it about, only to such Hands as were obliged
by Promise, if not by Principle, to conceal
it.</P>
<P>But <HI>Mr. Petyt,</HI> and my Self, having by
Accident seen bis Book, and observed some
Heads which we intended to expose to the
World: At last, out comes the happy Birth;
yet 'twas hoped, that by that time, there
might be Proselytes enough to defend it, with
Noise and Acclamations, and Contempt of
all Opposers, Records, Ancient Historians,
and our Ancient or Modern Lawyers.</P>
<P>Though generally, in a Matter of Argu∣ment,
we ought to leave to the Reader, the
Censure of what we think we confute, with∣out
remarking how absurd or criminal it is;
yet when such Reflections are almost the on∣ly
Arguments on the other side, and they,
when pronounc'd, <HI>tanquamè Cathedrâ</HI> must
have some Authority, 'tis fit, that even these
trifles should have their due, provided they be
answered with Decency of Expression: And
we know in what manner the Wise Man
advises us to answer some People.</P>
<P>I should have been glad if this Author'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Civility had obliged me to treat him at ano∣ther
Rate than I do; since I delight not i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="3"/>
this way, nor think thereby to please such
Readers as I would court to be Judges be∣tween
us.</P>
<P>But why should I Apologize for the ma∣naging
of this Controversie in a way whol∣ly
New to me? Since the severest Expres∣sions
are but retorted and transcrib'd from
our Answerer's Original; and indeed it
may well be an Original, for 'tis without
Example.</P>
<P>If in any thing I seem intemperate,
<HI>I may say with an Author well known,</HI> Ex∣cess
of Truth has made me so.</P>
<P>Our Author's very Notions are Satyrs
upon themselves; nor can any thing more
expose a Man, than a seemingly Gigantick
Endeavour to remove the fix'd Stars, the
Lords from the Firmament, where each
shines in his setled Station; and to take
from the <HI>Commons</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> that
Spot of Earth which they enjoy, and tread
on.</P>
<P>While the Sons of <HI>Titan</HI> lay <HI>Pelion</HI> up∣on
<HI>Ossa,</HI> one Mountainous Fiction upon
another, the Mountains have a quick De∣livery,
and bring forth Confusion to the
Giants.</P>
<P>What has been the Product of his
many Years Labours, I think may be
<PB REF="4"/>
shewn in Miniature, under these Heads.</P>
<P>(1.) That the <HI>Norman</HI> Prince, against
his reiterated Promises, and against the
great Obligation of Gratitude to those of the
<HI>English</HI> who assisted him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, so p. 176.</NOTE> took away all
their Lands and Properties, and left them
no Right or Law.</P>
<P>(2.) That from the Reputed Conquest,
and long before, under the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Sa∣xon</HI>
Governments, to the <HI>49th.</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI>
the Third; None came to the Parliaments
or great Councils of the Nation, where
Life and Fortune were disposed of, but the
King's immediate <HI>Tenants in Chief,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ib. p. 39.</NOTE> <HI>by
Knights Service.</HI></P>
<P>(3.) That even they came at the Discre∣tion
of the King and his Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ib. p. 79. &amp; 228.</NOTE> ever af∣ter
the <HI>49th.</HI></P>
<P>(4.) That the House of <HI>Commons</HI> began
by <HI>Rebellion</HI> in that very year;<NOTE PLACE="marg">ib. p. 210. 228. &amp; 229.</NOTE> nay, and
the House of <HI>Lords</HI> too.</P>
<P>(5.) That the Constitution of the <HI>Lord's</HI>
House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ib. p. 227. 228. 229.</NOTE> consists at this very day, in the
King's calling, or leaving out from special
Summons to Parliament, <HI>such Earls and
Barons as he pleases.</HI></P>
<P>(6.) That by vertue of the <HI>New Law
imposed upon the People,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 29.</NOTE> by the Conque∣rour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 39.</NOTE>
none within the Kingdom, were <HI>Free-men</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
or <HI>Legal men,</HI> but <HI>Forreigners,</HI> who
came in with him, being such as <HI>nam'd</HI> and
<HI>chose Juries, and serv'd on Juries them∣selves,
both in the County and Hun∣dred
Courts,</HI> who were all Tenants in <HI>Mi∣litary
Service.</HI></P>
<P>None surely, but such as read without
observing any thing, whose Books can't beat
into their dull Brains, common Reason,
and who never were acquainted with that ex∣cellent
Comentator'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> practise, will think that
I need set my self to argue against every one
of these: 'T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll be enough, if under those
Heads which I go upon to destroy his ill laid
Foundations, I prove them upon him, for
most of them confute themselves.</P>
<P>Truly, I cannot but think Mr. <HI>Petyt,</HI>
and my self, to have gone upon very good
Grounds; since, they who oppose them, are
forc'd to substitute, in their Rooms, such
pernicious ones, as would render the Foun∣dation
both of Lords and Commons, very
tottering and unstable.</P>
<P>Not to mix Lords and Commons to∣gether,
I will endeavour to do right to the
dignity of that Noble Order, and their
Interest in Parliament, apart from the
other.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
The <HI>Constitution</HI> of the House of Lords
our Antagonist, as I shall shew, will not
allow to have been setled, till after the
time of <HI>E.</HI> 1. if it be yet: Whereas, for a
short Answer to his new Conceit, the Earl of
<HI>Norfolk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl. 3. H. 6. n. 12. p. 228.</NOTE> in the third of <HI>H.</HI> 6. lays his
Claim to, and has allowed him the same
Seat in Parliament, that <HI>Roger Bigod</HI> his
Ancestor had in that great Court in the
time of <HI>H.</HI> 3. And, though, on the side of
the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> his Competitor, 'tis
urged, that the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> had the
Precedency by King <HI>H. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Command∣ment.
'Tis answered, <HI>Yat Commande∣ment
yave no Title, ne chaungeth not
the Enheritaunce of the Erle Mareschal;
but if</HI> or unless <HI>hit hadde be done by
Auctorite of Parlement.</HI> And, if Pre∣cedency
were a setled Inheritance, which
could not be alter'd, but by Act of Parlia∣ment,
how can a fixt Right of coming to
Parliament, be taken away otherwise?
Though our Author supposes it to be at the
meer Will and Pleasure of the King.</P>
<P>I take leave to observe, that the Right of
Precedency from within the Reign of <HI>H.</HI> 3.
nay, though before the <HI>49th.</HI> is no way in∣consistent
with the Belief, that many Lords
who had Right, till a Settlement then
<PB REF="5"/>
made, were left out afterwards, at the
King's Pleasure, that is, had no special
Summons; yet tbey could not be denied
their Right of being there in Representa∣tion.</P>
<P>Be it that the Heires of <HI>Bigod,</HI> and
himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. Angl. faci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s nova p. 257. &amp; 262.</NOTE> were Tenants in chief, which, as
I thought at least, I shew'd formerly, could
not, since the <HI>49th.</HI> have Right to come to
Parliament; <HI>quatenus,</HI> Tenants in chief;
yet, when any of the Heirs came upon par∣ticular
Summons to Parliament,
that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 <HI>R. 2. cap.</HI> 4. All Singular Persons and Commonalties which shall from henceforth have the Summons of Parliament. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> the King's Calling them
out, as <HI>Singular Persons,</HI> they
were to come as Tenants in <HI>Ca∣pite,
in the manner as they be
bounden, and have been of
old time accustomed.</HI> And they that re∣fused,
shouldbe amerc'd as is the Penalty.</P>
<P>By <HI>Manner</HI> is meant, (1.) in the same
Quality, Lords as Lords; and (2.) in
that Degree of the same Quality, which of
old time had been accustomed.</P>
<P>(3.) The <HI>Manner</HI> also implies the man∣ner
of enjoying any Power in Parliament.
Thus the Lords were of old <HI>accustomed</HI> to
enjoy the ordinary Power, in a <HI>Manner</HI>
properly Judicial; and that the supream
<HI>Manner</HI> too. Whereas the Commons had
<PB REF="6" MS="y"/>
of that, only what was needful to maintain
their Priviledges; as to the Legislature,
the <HI>Manner</HI> was the same, Neither was
above, or could give Law to the other.</P>
<P>But in the judicial Power in Parlia∣ment,
the Commoners were no more to be
joyned with the Lords, than with the Te∣nants
in Chief in the King's ordinary Court
out of it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. infra in the bo∣dy of the Book. p.</NOTE> since the same <HI>Curia Regis,</HI> dele∣gated
from the Lords, and answering to
that which was <HI>pro more,</HI> us'd to exercise
that Power, both in Parliament and out of
it; so that wherever they sate, they were in
the same Court: The Commons could not
exercise this Power with them out of Par∣liament,
therefore not in it.</P>
<P>Some will say, that no more is intended
by this Statute, than that every one who
receives Summons, must come, as was his
Duty and had been of old.</P>
<P>Whereas 'tis certain, they who did not
come as they were bound, were amerceable
before at the Common Law: nor was it
likely, that the King wanted a Law to
make good that Prerogative, which to be
sure he had over his Tenants by their very
Tenures, and could seize upon their Lands
for Contempt of his lawful Power, as the
Bishops were sometimes threatned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust.</NOTE> <HI>Inde se
capiet ad Baronias su.</HI> 8.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
And this is enough against this Author,
since he makes the King's Tenants <HI>in Ca∣pite,</HI>
to have been all that came to Parlia∣ment,
even by Representation, till the
<HI>8th. of Hen.</HI> 6.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 42.</NOTE> which 'tis his setled De∣sign
to prove, though sometimes he contra∣dicts
himself, and yields, that their Te∣nants
by Knights Service came too.</P>
<P>Besides, the genuine Import of the <HI>Man∣ner,</HI>
leads me to this sense, especially, as
'tis joyned with <HI>Bounden:</HI> For he who
was a Commmoner till the Summons, was
not bound to come as a Lord; nay, was
not a Lord when he came; As appears by
the Writs to the Lords Assistants, in
the same Form with those which the Lords
have. So that the Statute; in my sense, is
manifestly in Affirmance of the Common
Law.</P>
<P>I shall lay at the Feet of the Lords my
Sentiments, in relation to their House, ei∣ther
as I agree with, or oppose one, to whom
that High Order, probably will not think
themselves much obliged.</P>
<P>I shake Hands with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against</HI> Petyt. p. 228.</NOTE> and agree, that
King <HI>Hen. 3. a little before his Death,
began to leave out such Earls and Ba∣rons
as he pleased;</HI> but I believe not this
upon his Ground, which is, as if it were
<PB REF="7"/>
meerly from Royal Authority, that is, the
Prerogative which that King had from of
Old,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 229.</NOTE> without the Actual Consent of the
People: For I say, 'twas given him by
Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es Rep. f.</HI> 103. concern∣the Earl∣dom of <HI>Oxford.</HI> Princes Case 8. <HI>Rep.</HI></NOTE> either in the <HI>48th.</HI> or <HI>49th.</HI>
Nor doth <HI>Rex statuit</HI> in the least discou∣rage
me in this Opinion, being many Acts of
Parliament have pass'd with the joint Au∣thority
of King, Lords and Commons;
and yet the Enacting Part has had words
of the same Import with this.</P>
<P>(2.) I differ from my Opponent, when
he would have it believed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 228. supra.</NOTE> that <HI>Ed. 1.
and his Successors observed this con∣stantly;</HI>
or as he exprest the same thing
before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 227.</NOTE> <HI>The Practice was then and ever
since accordingly.</HI></P>
<P>And in this, he has dealt as unfairly by
Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> whom he quotes, as I doubt
not, but 'twill be found, he has done by
Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI> and me: For Mr. <HI>Camden</HI>
tells us, That he has this out of an Author
sufficiently Ancient, and thinks not, that
he differs from the Authority which he re∣ceives,
when he says, 'Twas thus only, <HI>do∣nec,</HI>
till there was a setled Right. And
this he makes 11 <HI>R.</HI> 2. but this the Do∣ctor
vouchsafes not to take notice of.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
But how cheap does he make his applau∣ded
Reasonings, when he would prove it
to be thus, ever to this very time, or the
time, of publishing his Libel, because it
was in the Reigns of <HI>Henry 3. Ed.</HI> 1.
and his Successors, to the time of that Old
Authors Writing; who, if we credit Mr.
<HI>Camden,</HI> wrote before 11 <HI>Richard</HI> 2.
of which he might be assured, by the way
of Writing in several Kings Reigns re∣spectively,
to which Antiquaries are no
Strangers; or else by the Date annex'd
in the same Hand.</P>
<P>But to prove that the Learned <HI>Claren∣ceux</HI>
knew more of these things than this
Pretender, I shall shew, that <HI>Rights</HI> were
setled for coming to the House of Lords
long since.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 175.</NOTE> But he will say, possibly, That
he has <HI>anticipated and evaded</HI> my Proof,
as my Arguments upon the <HI>grand Questi∣on</HI>
were in his Belief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jan.</HI> &amp;c. p. 47.</NOTE> by saying in one
place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 227.</NOTE> <HI>In those times, probably, the
King might omit to summon whom he
would.</HI></P>
<P>I think he swarms with Contradictions,
as a Judgment upon his Vndertaking:
For he says, That by what he calls the
<HI>New Government,</HI> 'twas <HI>appointed and
ordained,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>ib.</HI> p. 110.</NOTE> not only, that the Kings should
<PB REF="8"/>
call whom they pleased: Which cannot pro∣perly
be meant of Calling but once by Patent,
or Writ, and the giving a <HI>Right</HI> from
thenceforth to come afterwards; because
there was and is yet a new Call to every
Lord for every distinct Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>But he is express,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 227.</NOTE> That all those Earl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Barons of the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI>
to which the King thought fit to direct
Writs of Summons, should come to his
Parliament, and no others, unless by
chance.</P>
<P>But pray, what a Reflection is this up∣on
several excellent Monarchs Successors
to <HI>H.</HI> 3. whom he renders Denyers of their
own Acts, though under the Broad Seal?</P>
<P>But there is an Argument in the Par∣liament
Rolls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 H. 6. p. 12.</NOTE> upon the Question of Pre∣cedency
above-mentioned, where 'tis taken
for granted, that our Kings and Queen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had not then such a Prerogative to do
wrong.</P>
<P>If soch commandementz shold make

Writ alone, or only as fortified with Pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cription,
gave the Right, here was what
was not still left to Royal Pleasure on∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</P>
<P>I conceive, that a Writ of special Sum∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons,
of it's self, gave no man Right to
come always after this as a Lord; for, if
it made him not a Lord, it gave him no
Right to come to the Lords House as such.
And this I take to be evident, from the
<PB REF="9"/>
Records of the several Summons of the tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Furnival's,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jan. Angl.</HI> at the lat∣ter end.</NOTE> Father and Son, who had th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

nor obtained that name; which could
not have been, if he was one of the Baron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

a Prescription by the Custom of Parlia∣ment,
which is the Law of it. Besides, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
can be no Objection, that to a Prescription
'tis necessary, that it should have been i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
memorially, so as nothing to the contrary
can be shewn; whereas the very first Wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
may be seen, for this most plainly is diffe∣rent
from common Prescriptions, both in
the manner of it, and in the Reason of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
thing.</P>
<P>(1.) In the manner. We find the Bur∣gesses
of <HI>St. Albans</HI> to lay their Prescripti∣on
<PB REF="9" MS="y"/>
only from the time of the Progenitors of
E. 1. which might be only from within the
time of King <HI>John,</HI> or from the beginning
of his Reign; if but from the later end,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here were an hundred years for a Prescrip∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion.</P>
<P>(2.) But besides, this apparently dif∣fers
in the Reason of the thing; so that it
must needs have a different Law from com∣mon
Prescriptions: For other things, the
Ground of the Right, is the always having
enjoyed either by a man's Ancestors, or by
them whose Estate he has.</P>
<P>And if it were at any time in others,
and it could not appear when they parted
with it, 'twas a manifest Injustice for them
to make such a Claim to have it; so that
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he appearing upon Record, when the first
Writ was, is an Argument, that a Pre∣scription
may lawfully be made in this
Sense.</P>

can't embrace his new Sense.</P>
<P>However, I think it no hard matter to
give a natural Answer: For, the Author

us with no other Alteration, than
what related purely to <HI>Singular Person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

and a Restriction of the Numbers;
provided it might be with a just preservati∣on
of the Rights of every one in particular:
but, those great Bodies which before came
by Representation, could admit of no change
without a tendency to Destruction.</P>
<P>Agreeably to this Observation, the Inha∣bitants
of St. <HI>Albans</HI> plead their Right to
be represented in Parliament: not barely be∣cause
of Tenure in <HI>Capite,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl. 8 <HI>Ed.</HI> 2.</NOTE> but, <HI>Sicut caete∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i

Besides this, I have, in Sincerity, sub∣scribed

of Parliamentary matters.</P>
<P>But in short, to offer at the Flower of
all other Flowers of the Crown, the King
can neither do nor suffer wrong: but, like
God Almighty, dispenses his Blessings
to the inferiour World, while he sits
above, in an impeccable, impassible, im∣mortal
State. God is not the Author of
Evil, nor can he suffer by the Iniquity of
M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nkind; And, whatsoever Act preceeds
from the King's Ministers, or what∣ever
Malice be in the Heart of any of his
Subjects, the Law, that Angel, with
a flaming Sword, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending his Throne,
will not suffer it to affect him. Nay,
if through Misunderstanding of the Law,
it should happen, that a King go con∣trary
to his own Justice, 'tis as if no such
thing had been done.</P>
<P>So,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plowden's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he having an Estate in Taile
Alien, though from a common Person,
it would work a Discontinuance; yet,
from him it has no Effect, because it
would be a wrongful Action: Though he
<PB REF="14"/>
has more Power than any Subject, yet
Subjects may be, and are more able to do
Mischief.</P>
<P>And, for a full Proof, what Confidence
the Law has always had in the King's
doing nothing in his own Person, but
what is highly fitting, though an effect
should follow upon a rigorous Action of
his; as if he should kill an innocent
man, with his own hand, there never
was any Remedy. And this was taken
for Law, as long since, as the Confessor's
time. Nor is it to be imagined, that
<HI>William</HI> the First, and his Successors, re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eded
from this Power, how little soever

<P>In that famous Case where the <HI>Con∣fessor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. of Honour fo. 525.</NOTE>
impeach'd Earl <HI>Godwin</HI> of Trea∣son,
'tis urged by the great men of <HI>God∣win</HI>'s

and that required <HI>Battail:</HI> but a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Death of his nigh Relation, the Reason
holds, and, surely 'twould be very ab∣surd,

<P>But, besides this which I have answer∣ed,
there is a Charge of being an Ene∣my

that the Government, in this Respect,
is made up of the Laws, and the Offi∣cers

<HEAD>SECT. 1.</HEAD>
<P>THE Controversie between us, is
of <HI>Right,</HI> whether or no, the
<HI>Commons,</HI> such as now are represented
by <HI>Knights, Citizens,</HI> and <HI>Burgesses,</HI> had
Right to come to Parliament, any way,
before the 49. of <HI>H.</HI> 3. except, in the
fancy'd way of being represented by
such as they never chose, Tenants in
<HI>Capite,</HI> by <HI>Military Service.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Petyt,</HI> in my Judgment, proves
that <HI>Citizens</HI> and <HI>Burgesses</HI> had <HI>Right</HI> to
come by <HI>Representation;</HI> and I, that
<HI>Proprietors</HI> of <HI>Land,</HI> as such, had a <HI>Right</HI>
to come in <HI>Person,</HI> before that.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="20"/>
The <HI>Fact</HI> is used by both of us, as a
means to prove the <HI>Right: Acts of Par∣liament,</HI>
as now called, and <HI>King's Char∣ters,</HI>
as of old, are also insisted upon;
and even the <HI>Records</HI> and <HI>Histories</HI> pro∣duced
to vouch the <HI>Fact,</HI> are, for the
most part, yielded us; so that the Que∣stion
upon positive Laws and upon Te∣stimony,
is, either whether <HI>Right</HI> can
arise out of any <HI>Fact,</HI> or else, it is mat∣ter
of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Reason;</HI> what Sense
ought to be put on the Words of the
Witnesses to the <HI>Fact,</HI> or any of them,
as is made out by an ordinary In∣stance.</P>
<P>Suppose a Witness in a Cause, swears
to a matter of <HI>Fact,</HI> and his Credit is
not denyed, but the <HI>Question</HI> is, in what
<HI>Sense</HI> we ought to take his Words; here
<HI>Reason</HI> must determine the <HI>Fact,</HI> by
considering the Coherence of his Dis∣course,
and the several Circumstances
which explain it. And, this we are
taught,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Glos.</NOTE> by our <HI>doubtful Oracle,</HI> or ra∣ther,
by <HI>Apollo</HI> himself, when 'tis told
us, that the <HI>meaning of</HI> fideles, &amp;c. <HI>is to
be known from the subject matter;</HI> yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against</HI> Jan. Angl. facies no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a. <HI>p.</HI> 1.</NOTE> for
all this, forsooth, <HI>The Controversie is of
matter of Fact only.</HI> Indeed, an Act of
<PB N="6" REF="21"/>
Parliament is <HI>matter of Fact,</HI> if 'tis dis∣puted
whether 'twas made or no; but
if we argue, that such or such is the In∣tendment
of it, we shan't try this by a
<HI>Jury,</HI> or any <HI>Judge</HI> of <HI>Fact.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Right</HI> which arises from
thence, is from the <HI>Meaning,</HI> and the
<HI>Reason</HI> of the <HI>Statute,</HI> as well as from
<HI>the Fact,</HI> that it was made.</P>
<P>It will be said, Why do you stand
upon Niceties? His meaning is no more
than that he yields the <HI>Right,</HI> if you
prove the <HI>Fact.</HI></P>
<P>But, how can that be, when he de∣nies
a <HI>Right,</HI> even to his <HI>Favourites,</HI> the
<HI>Tenants</HI> in <HI>Capite,</HI> though he supposes,
that <HI>de facto,</HI> they came all along? Tho
they came before the 49 of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. Yet
the <HI>House of Lords</HI> (and the whole <HI>Great
Council,</HI> was before that, but an <HI>House
of Lords)</HI> was a <HI>new Constitution</HI> in the
49th of <HI>H.</HI> 3. and <HI>had it's Origine</HI> from
that King's <HI>Authority.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 228. <HI>&amp;</HI> 229. p. 110. then <HI>a new Go∣vernment.</HI></NOTE> And, after that,
though <HI>de facto, Lords</HI> came as <HI>Lords,</HI>
yet, ever since the 49. <HI>H.</HI> 3. it was not
out of <HI>Right,</HI> for 'twas at the <HI>King's
Pleasure;</HI> and so 'twas with contracted
Bodies of Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> who pre∣scribed
to a <HI>Right</HI> from before the 49
<PB N="7" REF="21"/>
and if they came were Lords (for you
must know, no <HI>Commons</HI> then were ever
at the <HI>Council)</HI> But the <HI>King</HI> and his
Privy-<HI>Council,</HI> might give them a pre∣sent
<HI>Right</HI> if they pleased, or with-hold
from any the Writ of Summons, and
deny their <HI>Rights</HI> in legal Practice, tho
a <HI>Parliament</HI> was to be held.</P>
<P>In fine, the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>England, de fa∣cto,</HI>
used to suffer Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> to
come to their great <HI>Councils;</HI> but, the
<HI>Right</HI> is deny'd even them who only had
that Permission.</P>
<P>But,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jan.</HI> &amp;c. p. 66. and 67.</NOTE> does he not own the <HI>Fact</HI> with
us expressly, in the 48. of <HI>H.</HI> 3. and yet
goeth to set aside the <HI>Right,</HI> by giving
an Account of the <HI>History,</HI> and <HI>Occasion</HI>
of it?</P>
<P><HI>Our Champion</HI> not only denies, that
the Commons <HI>had any Share or Votes,</HI>
&amp;c. <HI>in making of Laws for the Govern∣ment
of the Kingdom,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>unless they were
represented by the Tenants in</HI> Capite; but,
vouches the name of Sir <HI>Henry Spelman,</HI>
to prove, that 'tis of <HI>Right, Ex ipso jure
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eodali,</HI> that the Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI>
should represent the rest. In this Case,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e may admit us all the <HI>Fact</HI> of coming
to the great <HI>Councils;</HI> and yet, the
<PB N="8" REF="22"/>
<HI>Right</HI> would have been against us, as
long as the <HI>Feud</HI> remained; that is, till
the twelfth year of his present Majesty,
when the <HI>Feudal-Right,</HI> as set forth by
<HI>our Opponent,</HI> ceast. So that not only
the <HI>Fact</HI> within the Compass of our

but no <HI>Fact</HI> since, to this very day
could prove any <HI>Right,</HI> the <HI>Right</HI> of sit∣ting
in <HI>Parliament,</HI> having been, ac∣cording

elect, (as I shall shew) since the time
when he places in the King's Tenants in

those very words which we

<P>Is it not granted, that the <HI>Fact</HI> is on

<HI>were devised by the Monks and Cler∣gy-men-Lawyers.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, is not the Right of <HI>Conquest</HI> it
self, as merely such, made a Question
by himself? For, he asks whether <HI>any
man can forfeit,</HI> that is, justly loose <HI>his

<P>Justly to <HI>loose,</HI> and to <HI>forfeit,</HI> must

<P>But, to be sure, none but Tenants

<P><HI>This</HI> Author <HI>is pleased to say,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 99.</NOTE> It can∣not
be thought that the King ever wrote to
all the Knights and Feudataries
of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pat. 15. Jo. p. 2. M. 2. n. 9. <HI>Rex Baronibus mi∣litibus &amp; omnibus fideli∣bus totius Angliae.</HI> These <HI>Fideles</HI> were the Kings Tenants in <HI>Capite.</HI> Glos. p. 16.</NOTE> to meet in a great

the words of the Writ are,
the Design of it was to convene
such only, as had usually in those
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes been called to great Councils, which
were the Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> though no Ba∣rons.</P>
<P>That is, in effect, the King never

yet he did; for he conven'd his
Tenants in <HI>Cheif,</HI> though no <HI>Barons.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis manifest, he speaks here only of
the King's <HI>Feudal Tenants,</HI> for he avoids

Fideles, which, (as he informs us there,

<HI>for Subjects in general,</HI> and restrains
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to such as were Tenants in <HI>Capite.</HI></P>
<P>But, he says, 'tis not to be thought,
that all the <HI>Fideles,</HI> in the restrained
Sense, had the King's Letters or Writs;
yet, in the same page, with an <HI>antick
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
Face,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 99.</NOTE> <HI>he tells us, they, the Tenants in</HI> Ca∣pite,
<HI>though no Barons, were all summon∣ed
by particular Writs.</HI></P>
<P>And this he learnedly proves by the
<HI>irrefragable Authority</HI> of King <HI>John</HI>'s Char∣ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 100.</NOTE>
which gives the Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI>
that were no <HI>Barons,</HI> a general Summon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
only, even as he himself translates the
words.</P>
<P>I'll <HI>appeal</HI> to <HI>all</HI> but <HI>him,</HI> whether he
does not only <HI>yield</HI> the <HI>Right</HI> which he
opposes in the Sense which he puts upon
<HI>Fideles,</HI> but gives more than any reaso∣nable
man will insist upon; for I know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
not that it has been urged for more than
<HI>Free-holders.</HI></P>
<P>But whereas he tells us, That the

make an <HI>Vsurper</HI> of your mighty <HI>Con∣querour,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
who swallowed all the Land
of the Nation, or devoured it between
him and his <HI>Myrmidons?</HI></P>
<P><HI>You,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 35.</NOTE> <HI>in effect, yield that his Title
was by</HI> Election, <HI>by reason</HI> of the Facti∣ons
amongst the <HI>Saxon</HI> and <HI>Danish</HI> Nobi∣lity
and People, the Pope's Encouragement,
and siding with <HI>William,</HI> and the Inclina∣bleness
of the Clergy to his Cause.</P>
<P>You might have added, that before
his Entrance, many <HI>Normans</HI> were set∣led
here, in Power and Property.</P>
<P>It being thus, <HI>William</HI> the Second,
who you say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 51.</NOTE> had a Title by <HI>his own
Sword,</HI> and was chiefly assisted by the
<HI>English,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 54.</NOTE> and <HI>Henry</HI> the First, who <HI>cajold
the great men and the Army,</HI> had the same
kind of Title with your <HI>mighty one.</HI>
Nor is there weight in the Objection,
that there was so small time between the
Death of one, and crowning another
King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 60.</NOTE> that it <HI>was not possible for the Cler∣gy,
or all the People of</HI> England <HI>or any that
represented the People of</HI> England <HI>to be at
the Consecrations and Coronations.</HI> Because
whoever has had the Crown set on his
Head by them that could meet upon the
Occasion, unless there had been a very
powerful Interest or <HI>Faction</HI> against him,
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
has generally been owned for <HI>King,</HI> and
had a tacit universal Consent.</P>
<P>Besides, all the Nation was not pre∣sent,
when <HI>William the first</HI> was crown∣ed,
any more than they were, when
he gain'd the Victory over <HI>Harold;</HI> and
therefore, if these two Coronations are
set aside as <HI>factious,</HI> so many the other, and
so it must be. For,</P>
<P>An Election is or ought to be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 51.</NOTE> a free, so∣lemn,
deliberate, sober, sedate, <HI>and the
Lord knows what</HI> Act of the whole Peo∣ple,
(where they have a Right,) where∣by,
the major part of them do choose this or
that Person, or Thing, for such or such Ends
and Purposes, and not an undermining,
crafty, cheating and forcible Act of a Par∣ty
or Faction, for the setting up this or that
Person, or using this or that means, for the
obtaining their own Designs and Purposes.
Let him, I say, consider, and make a dif∣ference
between these two Acts of the whole
People and a Faction, and he may easily
make a true Judgment of all the pretended
Elections of our <HI>English Usurpers,</HI> and
all other Traitors whatever.</P>
<P>How easily may this Rule be applyed
to the <HI>first William,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 35.</NOTE> whose Success was
facilitated by the <HI>Factions among the</HI> Sa∣xon
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>
<HI>and</HI> Danish <HI>Nobility and People,</HI> as
our Opponent confesses; besides, the <HI>Fa∣ction</HI>
raised by the <HI>Pope</HI> for him, and by
his own Country-men, who were here
before, and could not but be very bu∣sie
for him: if he acquir'd the Crown by
<HI>Election,</HI> these things shew it to have
been as <HI>factious,</HI> as those which are con∣demned.
But we must have Recourse
to the History, to know how he became
King here.</P>
<P><HI>England,</HI> since it had been reduced to
a <HI>Monarchy</HI> by the Conduct and Magna∣nimity
of the great King <HI>Alfred,</HI> found
that benefit of being under <HI>One Head,</HI>
that before <HI>Succession</HI> was setled, when
a King dyed, the <HI>People</HI> voluntarily
pitch'd upon some <HI>One,</HI> to whom they
might pay their <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and from
whom they might expect <HI>Protection,</HI>
when a <HI>King</HI> quitted his mortal Domi∣nion,
to be Assessor with the Principa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ities
and Powers in the highest Orb.
The Question was not whether they
should have a King or no; but who
should be the man.</P>
<P>The <HI>Confessor</HI> through some foolish
Vow, which was void in it's self, having
denyed Marriage-rights to his <HI>Queen,</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>
they had none of his Issue to set their
Hopes upon, and perhaps they were
loth to fall again before a Family which
they had formerly disobliged, and there∣fore
would not think upon <HI>Edgar Ethel∣ing,</HI>
who was Heir to him that wore the
Crown next before the <HI>Confessor.</HI> But,
that <HI>Monarch</HI> of their Choice, and as
'twas believ'd, the <HI>Elect</HI> of Heaven, was
in such esteem with them, that the great∣est
Worth, and the clearest Stream of
Royal Blood, would have signified lit∣tle
in respect of the Deference they paid
to his <HI>sanctified</HI> Judgment; and there∣fore
his Recommendation in such a <HI>su∣perstitious
Age,</HI> was to them a kind of
<HI>Divine Revelation.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Norman Prince,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abrev. Chron. Rad. de dice∣to. fo. 479. Subregulus <HI>Ha∣roldus Godwini,</HI> filius quem Rex, ante suum deces∣sum elegerat, à t tius <HI>Angliae</HI> Primatibus ad regale cul∣men electus.</NOTE> <HI>Wil∣liam,</HI>
pretended a direct
Gift of the <HI>Crown</HI> from him;
but, there is Authority
which tells us, That upon
his <HI>Nomination,</HI> the <HI>chief<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
men</HI> of all <HI>England,</HI> chose <HI>Harold.</HI></P>
<P>Whether this illustrious Son of the
great <HI>Earl Godwin</HI> was design'd by the
<HI>Confessor</HI> or no, is left in Dispute; but
that he arriv'd to his high Trust, by a
<HI>general Election</HI> of those who were able
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
to keep under,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. ex bib. Domini Wild de∣functi.</NOTE> or satisfie the rest, is
certain, and yet an ancient Author calls
him, <HI>Conqueror,</HI> Heraldus <HI>Strenius Dux
Conquestor</HI> Angliae.</P>
<P>If <HI>Harold</HI> has made an absolute <HI>Con∣quest,</HI>
which no man pretends, that I find,
and <HI>William</HI> had <HI>conquer'd</HI> him, perhaps,
there would have been a Devolution of
a <HI>Conquerours Right,</HI> upon him who sub∣dued
<HI>Harold;</HI> but there was only a
Competition between these two Prin∣ces,
for that <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> which
<HI>Election</HI> had vested in <HI>Harold:</HI> 'Twas
this that <HI>William</HI> fought for, not for the
<HI>Lives, Liberties,</HI> and <HI>Fortunes</HI> of the
<HI>People.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>William</HI> himself, upon his Death-bed,
being ask'd to whom he would
devise his Kingdom, makes Answer,
that he would not pretend to dispose of
it, and gives this Reason, which argues,
that he thought he had no Right so to
do. <HI>Non enim tantum decus, haereditario
jure possedi</HI> For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comb. Brit. f. 104.</NOTE> I possess'd not this Ho∣nour
as a Right of Inheritance, which,

<Q><P>But by a direful Conflict, and much
effusion of humane Blood, I took it
from perjur'd King <HI>Harold,</HI> and
brought it under my Dominion,
through the Deaths, or Flight of his
Abettors.</P></Q>
<P>With this agrees <HI>Lex Noricorum,</HI> in the
Confirmation of St. <HI>Edwards</HI> Laws; <HI>Willi∣am
the Bastard, through God's Permissi∣on,
subduing</HI> Harold, <HI>Regnum Anglorum

of <HI>England</HI> by his Victory; but the Vi∣ctory
was over <HI>Harold,</HI> not the whole
Kingdom. I wonder our <HI>Antagonist</HI>
brought not this to prove that <HI>William</HI>
the <HI>Bastard</HI> got all the Lands of the
Kingdom, as he granted all the Lands
of whole Counties, under the word <HI>Co∣mitatus:</HI>
but as 'twill appear, that the
Proceedings of this <HI>Prince</HI> to his being
crowned, prove his <HI>Election;</HI> so his
Transactions with <HI>Harold,</HI> shew, that he
laboured only to have that Power,
which, he said, Harold <HI>maintain'd by
Perjury.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="39"/>
Suppose therefore, <HI>Harold</HI> had not
oppos'd, and without more Turmoils,
<HI>William</HI> had been crown'd; had he in
this Case been a <HI>Conquerour,</HI> in the Sense
contended for? And what makes the
Difference between his having it of <HI>Ha∣rold</HI>
freely or by Force, in relation to
the whole Kingdom? Surely, he would
never have endeavoured to come in by
Treaty, to a limited Dominion; when
with those Advantages that were on
his side, he might expect by turning
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut <HI>Harold,</HI> to jump into the absolute
Disposal of the whole Land.</P>
<P>But, immediately after St. <HI>Edward</HI>'s
Death, he sent an Ambassador to de∣mand
a Resignation from <HI>Harold,</HI> to
which he urged his Obligation by
Oath; the Gift of his Kinsman the <HI>Con∣fessor,</HI>
was likewise pretended. But <HI>Ha∣rold</HI>
argued for the Invalidity both of

because they were,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Selden</HI>'s Review of the Histo∣ry of Tithes. p. 439.</NOTE> <HI>absque generali Sena∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s

<P>This I take to have been between
<HI>October</HI> and <HI>Christmas,</HI> when he was
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rowned; and, that having entred into
Treaty, and concluded on Terms at
<HI>London</HI> (which, however, they tell us that
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e broke) he went towards <HI>Dover, Vt

<P>It seems, <HI>Dover</HI> was then the Strength
of <HI>Kent,</HI> and he thought, by the get∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
of that, he should be able to keep
all that Country under. <Q>Upon this,
Arch-bishop <HI>Stigand,</HI> and Abbot <HI>Egel∣sine,</HI>
and all the great men of <HI>Kent,</HI>
perceiving that an ill Fate lay upon the
whole Kingdom; and that whereas be∣fore,
none of the <HI>English</HI> were Ser∣vants,
<PB N="50" REF="44"/>
now, Nobles as well as Plebeians,
were brought under the Yoke of Sla∣very,
represented to the People assem∣bled
together, the misery of their
Neighbours, the Insolence of the <HI>Nor∣mans,</HI>
and the hardship of a servile
Condition, and animated them all, as
one man, to a resolution of dying or
maintaining their Liberties.</Q></P>
<P>I know, many learned men look up∣on
this part, as suspicious, taking the
Sense to be, that there were no Villains
in <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sylas Tay∣lor</HI> of Ga∣vel. p. 167.</NOTE> in <HI>Kent</HI> especially, before
that time, which they are at pains to
shew that there were: But, I conceive
the meaning of the words is no more,
than that there had ever been in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
a Distinction between Free-men
and Slaves; and therefore, that none of
the <HI>English,</HI> (that is, the People of the
Land, which the Law has ever confin'd
to <HI>Free-holders,</HI> they that depend upon
the Will of others, Villains or Servants
being no <HI>Cives,</HI> any part of the Nation
in that sense) ought to bear that Slave∣ry,
which the Violence of the <HI>Normans,</HI>
threatned to all in common.</P>
<Q><P>Nor wants there Authority for the
Freedom of all the <HI>Kentish</HI>-men in the
<PB N="51" REF="44"/>
largest Extent; for, in an ancient Roll
of the Customs of <HI>Kent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lambert</HI>'s Perambu∣lation of <HI>Kent. 21 Ed.</HI> 1.</NOTE> 'tis said to have
been allowed in <HI>Eire,</HI> before <HI>John</HI> of

in <HI>Eire</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> the 21 of King

be free, as well as the other free-bodies of</HI>

<P>The just value of this Freedom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thorne.</NOTE> made
all the <HI>Free-holders</HI> of <HI>Kent,</HI> with all
that depended upon them, resolve to
put a stop to <HI>William</HI>'s Depredations.
At <HI>Swanscomb</HI> was their general Ran∣dezvouz;
and their numbers were so
great, that as the <HI>Norman</HI> Prince ad∣vanc'd,
he found himself hem'd in with
an armed Wood; for, that they might
secure themselves of his making no Es∣cape,
so confident were they of Victo∣ry,

his hand, to block up the way.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="45"/>
The Arch-bishop and the Abbot, in
the name of the rest, told him, that the
whole People of <HI>Kent</HI> were come out
to meet him, and to acknowledge him
their Leige Lord, if they might enjoy
their Liberties and Laws; otherwise,
they denounc'd War, and bid him
Defiance.</P>
<P>Upon this, <HI>William</HI> calls a Council
of War, and he finds it expedient, to
give them their Terms: they knowing
how he had used those who trusted to
his Generosity or Justice, took Hosta∣ges,
as well as gave, and then in full
Assurance of his Performance, yielded
him their County, <HI>or the Government
of it, not all the Land and Property there,</HI>
and, <HI>as what would secure the Government
there to him,</HI> resigned up the Castle of
<HI>Dover.</HI></P></Q>
<P>To this Relation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perambu∣lation of <HI>Kent,</HI> p. 25.</NOTE> the great and faith∣ful
Antiquary Mr. <HI>Lambart</HI> gives suffi∣cient
Reputation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden'<HI>s Brit.</HI> Ut verè quamvis minùs purè in antiquo libro sit scriptum.</NOTE> that no man before
<HI>Sprot</HI> has told these Circumstances; but
he cites an ancient Authority, which
was a Plea, not oppos'd, and which
could not be taken from <HI>Sprot,</HI> in which
he confesses the Substance of this to be
<PB N="53" REF="45"/>
contained; and though not elegantly
writ, yet with Truth. So that Mr. <HI>Cam∣den</HI>
is on our side, being convinc'd by
the truth of his own quotation. <HI>Dicit
Cantii Comitatus quod in Comitatu ipso de
jure debet de ejusmodi gravamine esse liber,
quia dicit quod Comitatus iste, ut residuum
Angliae, nunquam fuit conquestus, sed pace
facta se reddidit Conquestoris dominatui,
salvis sibi omnibus libertatibus &amp; liberis
consuetudinibus primò habitis &amp; usitatis.</HI></P>
<Q><P>The County of <HI>Kent</HI> says, that in
that County, of right, it ought to be
free from such a Grievance, because
it sayes, that that County was never
conquered, like the rest of <HI>England.</HI>
But, having made a Peace, yielded its
self to the Conquerour's Dominion,
saving to themselves all their Liber∣ties,
and free Customes, at first had,
and from that time us'd.</P></Q>
<P>It seems, in standing up for their own
Rights, they reflected upon the rest, as
an humble conquer'd People.</P>
<P>And indeed, whereas it has past in∣to
a Maxim, <HI>Nemo miser nisi compara∣tus;</HI>
<Q><PB N="54" REF="46"/>
<L>No man's condition is unhappy thought,</L>
<L>But when into the Scales with happier men
he's brought.</L></Q></P>
<P>On the other side, men are apt to
think their Happiness incompleat, with∣out
comparing themselves with those,
whom they look upon as deprived of
the Advantages which they enjoy. Thus
our late Author enhances the value he
puts upon himself, by the Contempt
which he thinks his Adversaries deserve,
though, in truth, how low soever they
lye, he rises no higher, but, it may be,
disgraces his Mastership by the compa∣rison.</P>
<P>But, to return to the Men of <HI>Kent,</HI>
the generality of which, how free soever
they were,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against Mr.</HI> Petyt. p. 39.</NOTE> were, by his Rule, no Free∣men
of the Kingdom: for, <HI>all the Free∣men
of the Kingdom were Tenants in
Military Service.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Feudalibus Legibus non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Spel. Glos. tit. Gavel kind</NOTE> Which was, of the Feu∣dal
Law; whereas their <HI>Gavel-kind</HI> was
exempt from it.</P>
<P>I can imagine no other Reason why
they, above others, constantly maintain∣ed
their old Laws and Customes, than
that they were a sturdy People, more
than ordinary tenacious of their Rights,
<PB N="55" REF="46"/>
and sensible of the least Violation. And
possibly, for a long time they retained
the Power of taking Satisfaction upon
some of his Favourites, who were Pledg∣es
for <HI>William</HI>'s Performances. Sure I
am (as far as my <HI>Authors</HI> can assure me,
after this <HI>Classick Writer</HI> has blasted
their Credit, I will not say with a con∣tagious
Breath) he promis'd as largely
to the rest of the Nation, as he did to
the People of <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>If the men of <HI>Kent</HI> had their Repre∣sentatives
at least, at the <HI>Electing</HI> him
to Rule over them, and were not sub∣jected
to him as a <HI>Conquerour,</HI> nor were
their Lands parcell'd out by him,
though we are taught, <HI>è Cathedra, that
he took away from the English their Estates,
and gave them to his Normans.</HI> So that,
according to his Reasoning, the <HI>Flem∣mings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against Mr.</HI> Petyt. p. 35.</NOTE>
<HI>Anjovins, Brittains, Poictorins,
and People of other Nations, who made up
a great part of his Army, and came with
him under considerable men, their Leaders,
came out of stark love and kindness.</HI> They,
though <HI>Adventurers with him,</HI> being
content he should gratifie onely his
<HI>Normans.</HI> Nay, he divided all the
Lands of the Kingdom amongst his great
<PB N="56" REF="47"/>
<HI>Followers:</HI> even the Lands of those
<HI>Normans</HI> who had Estates here before.</P>
<P>But, if, I say, the men of <HI>Kent</HI> enjoyed
their Right, as abovesaid, what Reason,
beyond what I have assign'd, is there to
think, that it was otherwise with the
rest in general, some of which were Ad∣venturers
with him, but all equally
sharers in the extent of his Promise, to
maintain <HI>rectam legem?</HI></P>
<P>Though he and some of his Succes∣sors
chose Succession, as the most ho∣nourable
Title, yet, that he had none
but <HI>Election,</HI> is evident, in that he was
not Heir to the <HI>Confessor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Domesday</HI> in <HI>Surry, Acstede, Goda</HI> ma∣ter <HI>Heraldi</HI> tenuit <HI>IRE.</HI> In ano∣ther place there cal∣led <HI>Soror Regis Ed∣wardi.</HI></NOTE> but rather
<HI>Harold</HI> was, who was Son to <HI>Goda,</HI> that
King's Sister. Nor could the <HI>Confessor</HI>
and <HI>Harold</HI> lawfully set the Crown up∣on
his Head, without the Consent of
the Kingdom: Nor yet could he gain
a Title by <HI>Conquest,</HI> over those who
vielded upon the Terms of enjoy∣ing
their Laws and Liberties; and,
who, unless those Terms had been
granted, had both Right and Spirit
too to have kept him from Reigning
over them.</P>
<P>Abating the <HI>factious</HI> conspiring to set
him up against <HI>Edgar Etheling,</HI> who,
<PB N="57" REF="47"/>
though he was not, as now the Law
is, actual King before Coronation, yet
ought to have been crowned, the Peo∣ple
had sufficient inducement to chuse
<HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>1. Because he was a Prince of a less
Potent Nation, and therefore would
make an Accession to <HI>England,</HI> and
give them footing upon the <HI>Continent,</HI>
from whence they might spread the
glory of those Arms, which were re∣proach'd
with that necessity of Self-defence,
which makes even Cowards
Valiant.</P>
<P>2. He was a Prince who had govern∣ed
his own Country with great Pru∣dence
and Moderation;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Brevis Re∣latio</HI> Wil∣lielmi <HI>ad finem.</HI> Syl. Taylor. p. 188.</NOTE> nor would at∣tempt
upon that acquisition, to which
many Circumstances invited him, with∣out
the <HI>Consent of his Senate</HI> there.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Harold</HI> being dead, they knew
not any man so likely to defend them
from those Enemies which threatned
and molested them from abroad, or that
could better secure them from the Ty∣ranny
of many Masters at home, and the
Distractions, which, in all probability,
would arise from their Feuds and Com∣petitions
for the Crown; which, every
<PB N="58" REF="48"/>
one that could draw the <HI>Mobile</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
him, would be catching at, till it was
plac'd and setled.</P>
<P>Thus, I think, 'tis made evident, that
<HI>William</HI> the first, his Title was by <HI>Ele∣ction,</HI>
and that the <HI>Election,</HI> according
to the infallible Rule, was <HI>factious,</HI>
since, how unanimous soever they
might be at the crowning him, <HI>Feuds</HI>
and <HI>Factions</HI> wearied them into the
Agreement, more than the Force of his
Arms; but, I shall not give him this
Author's obliging Epithetes. 'Twill be
said, perhaps, if the <HI>Election</HI> be void,
then he is let into a Title by <HI>Conquest,</HI>
yet how can that be, when the very
<HI>Conquest,</HI> or rather Acquisition, what∣ever
it were, was by this means, he be∣ing
<HI>received upon Terms?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foedus pe∣pigit.</NOTE> Besides, if
there were no <HI>Election,</HI> then the People
never yielded, were never <HI>conquered;</HI>
And, there was no more a <HI>Conquest</HI> of
the whole Nation, than an <HI>Election</HI> by
the whole. The actual yielding of some,
and tacit Concurrence of others, made
his Title.</P>

Law</HI> is received,</P>
<P><HI>Or,</HI></P>
<P>(2.) The particular <HI>Feudal Law</HI> of
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>1. Our Author evidently takes this
in the first Sense; being to prove what
was the <HI>Feudal Law</HI> here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Glos p. 4.</NOTE> he cites the
foreign <HI>Feudists,</HI> who acquaint us with
the Law of <HI>Feuds</HI> amongst them; but
this first Sense is not supposable, in that
this Law, upon that account, would
be as much the Law of Nations, as the
Law for the Advantage of Embassadors
wherever they come.</P>
<P>And this could not generally prevail,
but from the Authority of <HI>Catholick
Reason</HI> that should require it; but that
I do not find, since the Lord may have
the <HI>Vtile Dominium,</HI> which the <HI>Feudists</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="51"/>
speak of, as incident to <HI>Feuds,</HI> with∣out
the despotick Power; and the end
or nature of them being answer'd, from
whence will the Argument be brought
that it ought to be so? I will grant,
that it is not a <HI>Feud,</HI> unless there be
<HI>Utile Dominium,</HI> for that distinguishes
it from an <HI>Alodium,</HI> which sometimes
may yield no profit to any Superiour.
But those who well knew the Nature
of <HI>Feuds,</HI> teach us, that 'twas the In∣fancy
of <HI>Feuds</HI> when they wholly de∣pended
on the Lord, and could not
stand without being supported by his
pleasure, then indeed (which was be∣fore
<HI>Feuds</HI> were spread into many Na∣tions.)<NOTE PLACE="marg">cragius de Feudis, <HI>fol.</HI> 20.</NOTE>
<HI>Nec servientibus aliud jus erat

quamdiu is qui concedit patitur eo frui.</HI></P>
<P>This indeed agrees with that Law,
which is supposed to have obtained,
even till the 49 <HI>H.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>Whereas from hence <HI>Feudal Tenure</HI>
advanc'd to an Estate for Life:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Solet usus fructus constitui in personam tantum. <HI>Cujacius de feudis,</HI> Tom. 4. <HI>fo.</HI> 464.</NOTE> and all
this before the year 650, from which

<P>Its state of Maturity was, when it

Inheritance by the Law of <HI>Feuds,</HI> be∣fore
the time of <HI>William the First,</HI> and
above 450 years before the 49th of
<HI>H.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>And, I would rather believe <HI>Cujacius</HI>
for the <HI>Jus Feodale,</HI> or the Nature of it,
than what we find under the Title <HI>Par∣liament</HI>
in the <HI>Glossary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cujacius</HI> defines a <HI>Feud,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cujacius de feudis,</HI> fo. 464. Tom. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Jus praedio

Right in another's Land, which
the Lord gives for a Benefice, upon
condition that the Grantee should be
faithful and true to him, and perform
<HI>Military</HI> or <HI>other Service.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is a perpetual Right, therefore
not to be disposed of by the Lord's
Will, or the Law which he should
give.</P>
<P>'Tis indeed <HI>Vsufructuary,</HI> because the
Lord has the Forfeiture and Escheat,
according to the Laws setled in any
<PB N="66" REF="52"/>
particular place: For, I take it, that in
one place they differ'd from another.</P>
<P>And, in Confutation of this Conje∣cture,
that <HI>ex ipso jure Feodali,</HI> the Lord
<HI>jus dicit,</HI> (take this as the general Law
of <HI>Feuds)</HI> 'tis enough that in any place
where the <HI>Feudal</HI> Law was received
'twas otherwise.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Choppinus</HI> de Juri∣dic. An∣deg.</NOTE> <HI>Choppinus</HI> sayes, that
amongst the <HI>French</HI> a <HI>Feud</HI> implies not
<HI>juridica potestas, nil commune cum juridi∣ca
potestate.</HI> Which, if (as Jurisdiction
is often used, to signifie a Power infe∣rious
to <HI>Jus dicere)</HI> it is but a Judicial
Power; it follows, that the Lord could
not have the greater, where he had not
so much as the less. And farther, <HI>Feuds</HI>
have, in all Countries, been guided by
the Law of Property, their <HI>Common
Law.</HI></P>
<P>Thus sayes <HI>Cujacius, Nos quoque jus

aut moribus nostris.</HI> <Q>We also wil∣lingly
follow the Law of Feuds,
which <HI>Italy</HI> uses, unless in any thing
it fights with our Laws or Customes.</Q></P>
<P>And this is to be observed, that the
end of raising <HI>Feuds</HI> has often prevailed
to introduce a Custome without any
<PB N="67" REF="52"/>
express Law, and beyond the Foreign
Law of <HI>Feuds.</HI></P>
<P>(1.) Without express Law, and thus
to preserve the Head of a <HI>Barony,</HI> that
was never to be divided; whereas, any
other part was often so, in which the
Common Law prevail'd from the end
of raising the <HI>Feud,</HI> which requir'd the
Preservation of that entire, though the

Whereas, I find it in <HI>Cujacius,</HI> payable
only by the Heir female,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cuja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> fo. 498.</NOTE> <HI>Siquis sine filio

<Q><P>If any one dye without Heir male,

<P><HI>That Relief was called Redemption,
appears by the Law of</HI> H. 1.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leges fo. 1. cap. 1.</NOTE> Haeres non

<P>It seems, in King <HI>Rufus</HI> his time, this
payment was so unreasonable, that 'twas
a Redemption, in a strict sense, and a
kind of Purchase of the Land; but now
'twas to be a lawful and just Relief.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>jus feodale,</HI> mentioned in the
<HI>Glossary,</HI> if it be not the Law generally
received where <HI>Feuds</HI> were, must be
the Law of <HI>England</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>But 'tis to be observed, that <HI>Choppi∣nus</HI>
knocks this down, who tells us,
that amongst the <HI>French, Juridica pote∣stas,</HI>
was not imply'd by a <HI>Feud.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 31. in mar∣gin.</NOTE> But
our <HI>Apollo</HI> teacheth us, that <HI>our ancient
Tenures were from</HI> Normandy, and that
<PB N="70" REF="54"/>
was govern'd by the <HI>French Feudal
Law,</HI> being of the <HI>French</HI> King's <HI>Feud.</HI>
Wherefore, the <HI>Juridica Potestas</HI> or <HI>jus
dicere,</HI> was not here, <HI>Ex ipso jure feoda∣li;</HI>
nay, in the same place, the <HI>French
Feudist</HI> tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Choppinus de</HI> Juris∣dict. An∣deg. fo. 455.</NOTE> <HI>Interdum certè Baro Ca∣stellanum
observat superiorem.</HI></P>
<Q><P>'Tis certain, sometimes a Baron is
under a <HI>Castellan</HI>'s <HI>Feud.</HI></P></Q>
<P>And he gives the Reason why it may
be so, which is, that a <HI>Feud</HI> carries not
with it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ib. so. 450.</NOTE> the <HI>Potestas juridica,</HI> which rea∣son
is very apparent, in that a <HI>Castellan</HI>
is of a degree lower than a <HI>Baron.</HI></P>
<P>Take <HI>Juridica potestas</HI> in the same
Sense with <HI>jus dicere</HI> in the Glossary, a
<HI>Baron</HI> was to take Laws from his Infe∣riour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leges H. 1. cap.</NOTE>
and to have his Lands taken from
him without Forfeiture; as it appears
by the Law of <HI>Hen.</HI> 1. that being one
of the Judges in the County Court, was
not upon the Account of Resiance, but
the having <HI>Free land</HI> there; so it must
have been in the great <HI>County Court of
Cheshire,</HI> though they had an extraordi∣nary
Power there. Admit therefore,
that a Lord of another County were
<HI>Feudal Tenant</HI> to a <HI>Commoner</HI> there, (as
'tis not to be doubted but he might
<PB N="71" REF="54"/>
have been) should this Lord have been
represented by his Capital Lord there?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Glos. 2 part. <HI>Consentire quis{que} vid.</HI></NOTE>
Or, admit a Lord there, had no Land,
but what he held of a Commoner, as of
such an one as <HI>Thomas de Furnival,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jani Angl. facies no∣va.</HI> p. <HI>Sed vide</HI> the Record more at large.</NOTE> who
had several very considerable Mannors;
might <HI>Thomas de Furnival</HI> represent the
Lord in the Lord's House?</P>
<P>But farther, taking the <HI>Jus Feodale</HI>
to be as in force with us, unless the po∣sitive
Law, giving so large a Power, be
shewn, 'tis a begging the Question;
for 'tis to prove the <HI>Right,</HI> which our
wise Antagonist would exclude from
the Question, (as being indisputable,
I suppose) by the <HI>Fact;</HI> whereas the
fancied <HI>Right</HI> is used in his Hotch-potch

the <HI>Fact.</HI> But from what Sourse is this

Being then these were the onely

by other Owners than such as held
them in the time of King <HI>Edward,</HI> and
upon other Titles; yet the Lands con∣tinued
for the most part, to hold in the

for so much, either more or less;
according to the Improvement, or Fall
of the Land; and frequently, that
which before paid for a certain number
of Hides, paid nothing at the making of

<P>Here is an <HI>inspeximus,</HI> in effect, of the

<P>Now this was a <HI>Poictovin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against</HI> Petyt. p. 35.</NOTE> many of
which came in with Duke <HI>William,</HI> and
is more to be credited in this matter

done to the Church, as they took it,
was no way to be accounted for, unless

a much lower instance of his Power,

likely, for the Glory of <HI>William</HI>'s and his

<HEAD>CHAP. V. The Socmen enjoyed Estates of Titles prior
to the suppos'd Conquest.</HEAD>
<P>BUT, besides the uncontroulable
Authority of <HI>Domesday-book,</HI> and
the Testimony of Authors, well back'd
with a plain <HI>Record,</HI> with the Doctor's
good leave, I shall add another Argu∣ment,
to prove the continuance of the
<HI>English</HI> Rights, or that <HI>William</HI> govern'd
not as a <HI>Conquerour.</HI> He may know that
there were such men as <HI>Sokemanni,</HI>
whose Lands were partible, and who
held not by <HI>Knights Service.</HI> Whereas
King <HI>William</HI> granted out the whole
Kingdom, as the Doctor fondly ima∣gines,
by <HI>Knights</HI> Service, and the
Lands of such Tenants descended to the
eldest Son; wherefore, the <HI>Sokemanni</HI>
must needs enjoy their Estates upon Ti∣tles
prior to King <HI>William</HI>'s, not deriving
under his Grant; since their Lands, to
obtain that Tenure, must have been <HI>an∣ciently
divided</HI> before the time of <HI>H.</HI> 2.
But,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vil, lib. 7. cap. 2. in∣fra.</NOTE> if there were any Evidence to the
contrary, there could have been no Pre∣scription
<PB N="118" REF="78"/>
to the Tenure. And surely,
if it was no ancienter than King <HI>Willi∣am</HI>'s
Title, the Evidences of the con∣trary
could not be lost.</P>
<P>Suppose Lands holden in <HI>Free-socage,</HI>
were forfeited to the King, (in which
Case,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lambert</HI>'s Peramb. of <HI>Kent.</HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>Lambert</HI> yields, that the Te∣nure
may be alter'd) and he granted it
out, to hold by <HI>Knights Service:</HI> how
could a Custom prevail to alter this Te∣nure,
contrary to the very Grant? If
they could produce their Deeds, they
shew'd themselves to be Tenants by
<HI>Knights</HI> Service. And, there were so
many <HI>Sockemanni,</HI> even in one County,
that of <HI>Kent,</HI> that though some Gran∣tees
might lose their Deeds, yet not so
many as there were distinct Estates in
<HI>Socage.</HI> For Proof of the Premisses to
my Conclusion.</P>
<P>(1.) That there were <HI>Sokemanni</HI> be∣fore
<HI>William;</HI> nay, that for the most
part at least, Land-owners were such,
appears from St. <HI>Edward's</HI> Law.
This obliged all men to bear
Arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leges <HI>Sancti Ed∣wardi</HI> de Hereto∣chiis, habeant Hae∣redes ejus pecuniam &amp; terram ejus sine aliquâ diminutione &amp; rectè divident inter se.</NOTE> proportionably to their
<HI>real</HI> or <HI>personal</HI> Estate, which last,
together with the Land of him
that dyed in the Wars, was to
<PB N="119" REF="78"/>
be divided among his Heirs. And sure∣ly,
the Law does not suppose that they
must always be female Heirs.</P>
<P>Such as dy'd in the Wars, who were
Tenants by <HI>Knights Service,</HI> according
to our Authors Sense of <HI>Qui militare ser∣vitium
debebant,</HI> were <HI>Sokemanni,</HI> hold∣ing
in <HI>free Socage,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Glanvil. lib. 7. cap. 2.</NOTE> as <HI>Glanvil</HI> explains it,
<HI>Si fuerit liber Sokemannus, tunc quidem
dividetur haereditas inter omnes filios quot∣quot
sunt per partes equales, si fuerit Soca∣gium
&amp; id antiquitus divisum.</HI> <Q>If a man
be a free Sokeman, then indeed his In∣heritance
shall be divided amongst all
the Sons, if it be <HI>Socage,</HI> and that an∣ciently
divided.</Q></P>
<P>It was not improper to say, if it be
<HI>Socage,</HI> because a <HI>Sokeman,</HI> in respect of
some Lands, might have others, not
held in <HI>free Socage.</HI> This is sufficient
Evidence, that such there were, after
the Noise of Conquest, and that the
Lands were to be <HI>anciently divided.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) The Estates deriv'd from the
Conquest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Glos. Tit. Parl. Ter∣ram totam ita disposu∣it ut suum quisque pa∣trimonium de Rege te∣neret in Capite.</NOTE> were, according to our bul∣ky
Author, held by <HI>Knights Service.</HI>
Nay, the second part of the Glossary,
which the Dr. invidiously imputes to
Sir <HI>Henry Spelman,</HI> tells us, that <HI>though
<PB N="120" REF="79"/>
William was no Conquerour, yet he divided
out, and disposed of all the Land to his
great men:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against</HI> Jan. &amp;c. p. 99.</NOTE> so that even the <HI>Normans</HI>
Estates were taken away too. And this,
that erroneous <HI>Glossary</HI> makes under the
<HI>Feudal Law</HI> too; for, from thence 'tis
inferr'd, that the great Tenants in <HI>Ca∣pite,</HI>
had Right to impose Laws upon
them that held of them, and to exclude
the whole Kingdom besides, from the
<HI>Great Councils.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>(though no Conquerour)</HI> the Dr.
left out, either as being ashamed of it,
being 'tis little less than a Contradiction,
to say, a man was no <HI>Conquerour,</HI> and
yet seized upon all the Lands of the
Kingdom, and forc'd them to submit to
such Seizure; so that he conquer'd the
Land: or, because it contradicts his No∣tion
of <HI>William</HI>'s being a <HI>Conquerour;</HI> so
that he himself had as much reason to
exeept against this Book, as others; but,
it seems,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 35.</NOTE> <HI>out of a stark Love and Kind∣ness</HI>
to Truth, he left only what was
against him, but took what was for his
Purpose. And for the Support of it's
Credit, tells us a formal Story; the At∣testation
to which, from outward Cir∣cumstances,
I never thought it worth
<PB N="121" REF="79"/>
the while to examine, since I have so
much Reason from within it self, to be∣lieve
it to be <HI>spurious,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 13.</NOTE> and so ought he.
For, if he have any respect to that great
<HI>man</HI>'s Memory, he will not suffer him
to say, that <HI>William</HI> divided out the
whole Kingdom, to hold under the
<HI>Feudal Law;</HI> when before he had ob∣serv'd
of <HI>Gavelkind,</HI> the general Tenure
of the Lands in <HI>Kent, Feudalibus legibus
non coercetur.</HI></P>
<P>(3.) The Lands of all these Grantees
of King <HI>William</HI> the First, descended to
the eldest, being held in <HI>Knights Service.
Si miles fuerit vel per militiam tenens,
tunc secundum jus regni</HI> Angliae <HI>primoge∣nitus
filius patri succedit in totum.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Glanvil.</HI> lib. 7. c. 2.</NOTE><Q> If a
man be a Knight, or holding by mili∣tary
Service, then, according to the
Law of the Kingdom, the Eldest shall
succeed his Father to the whole. </Q>But
for the greatest Authority, we have an
Act of <HI>Parliament;</HI> which, having full
Power to alter the Tenure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">31 H. 8. c. 3.</NOTE> enacts, that
certain Lands in <HI>Kent, shall descend as
Lands at Common Law, and as other
Lands in the said County, which never
were holden by Knights Service us'd to de∣scend.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="80"/>
Here the Descent of <HI>Knights Service</HI>
is the same with Descent at the Com∣mon
Law, which was to the Eldest;
and this is oppos'd to the Descent of
Lands in <HI>Gavelkind,</HI> which was <HI>Socage.</HI></P>
<P>And thus have I proved every thing,
which upon this Head was needful, to
vindicate the Right of the <HI>English,</HI> and
to prove that their Rights were own'd
in Practice, notwithstanding the vain
Flourish of a <HI>Conquest.</HI></P>
<P>It may be objected, perhaps, that the
<HI>Feudal Law,</HI> which <HI>was exacted and ob∣served
by, and upon only the</HI> Normans,
might have related only to such as held
immediately of the King; for that his
Grantees might and did often grant out
to others and their Heirs for ever, to
hold in <HI>free Socage.</HI> Yet, this will not
do, because such Grantees would have
been <HI>Free-men;</HI> but, all the <HI>Free-men</HI>
of the Kingdom, were Tenants by <HI>mi∣litary
Service,</HI> though by their Tenure,
any of them were only to pay a Rose,
a Spur, a Sum of Money, or any other
thing.</P>
<P>Therefore, hereby is my Argument
inforc'd, if <HI>William</HI> had been a <HI>Conque∣rour</HI>
in the Sense strove for, as disseizing
<PB N="123" REF="80"/>

<P>THough even the former Head of

to the particular Consideration of
<HI>Domesday book,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Domesday.</NOTE> which might serve in∣stead

being the <HI>Vicecomites</HI> before <HI>Barones,</HI> I
should vehemently suspect, That the

At least,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carta An∣tiqua n. 11.</NOTE> we find the ordinary <HI>Free-holders,</HI>

the Cause the more, we find under

<P>'Tis not improbable that the <HI>Welsh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Tay∣lors Hist. of <HI>Gavel∣kind. Jani Angl.</HI> p. 41.</NOTE>
which were some of his Tenants, were
then all <HI>Socagers:</HI> but then the <HI>Codex

were interested in the Counties, in
the time of <HI>William</HI> the First.</P>

<P>But, of this more, when I come to
shew at large, that others, besides Te∣nants

<P>It farther appears, that by Degrees
the <HI>English</HI> were much <HI>more</HI> considerable

for that they were all lost and swallow'd
up in the great body of the <HI>English:</HI>
and therefore they only are named up∣on
all occasions. And I believe, as far
back as <HI>Henry</HI> the Second's time, the
<HI>French, eo nomine,</HI> will not be found

distinguish'd; but, if however, the Te∣nants
in <HI>Capite,</HI> or such as were their
Tenants by <HI>Knights Service,</HI> which was
laid <HI>upon only the</HI> Normans <HI>themselves,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against</HI> Mr. Petyt. p. 43.</NOTE>

<P>The Government must needs have
been too weak to support it's self, when
the Ballance of Strength, and <HI>Property,</HI>
was in other hands; and therefore 'twas
morally impossible, that only Tenants

<Q><P>And to speak the Truth, the Alder∣men
have also in the Cities of this
Kingdom, within their <HI>Bailiwicks,</HI> and
in Burroughs inclosed and walled a∣bout,
and in Castles, the same <HI>Dignity,
Power,</HI> and <HI>Manner,</HI> under the King's
<PB N="132" REF="85"/>
Sheriff, throughout the Realm: for,
they ought <HI>inviolably,</HI> and without
Fraud or Delay, by all means, to their
Power, to keep the <HI>Laws, Liberties,
Rights, Peace of the King, and the just
and ancient Customs of the Kingdom, ap∣proved
of by their good Predecessors.</HI> But
when any thing unexpected, or doubt∣ful,
happens to fall out of a sudden,
within their Bailiwicks, against the
Kingdom, or against the Crown of our
Lord the King, they ought presently,
by ringing of the Bells, which in <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
they call <HI>MOTBEL,</HI> to call to∣gether
all the People, which in <HI>English</HI>
is called the <HI>Folkmote;</HI> that is, the call∣ing
together, and Assembly of all the
People and Countries, because all
ought to meet there: and all who live
under the Protection, and Peace of
our Lord the King, and live in the said
Kingdom. And there they ought to
take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the Indemnity of the
Crown of this Kingdom, by Common-Council▪
And there Provision is to
be made to repress the Insolence of
Malefactors, for the good of the King∣dom.
For, it was enacted, that there
all People and Counties should meet,
<PB N="133" REF="85"/>
every year, once a year, to wit in the
beginning of the Kalends of <HI>May,</HI> and
there to confederate and consolidate
themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sicut Con∣jurati fra∣tres.</NOTE> with an inviolable Oath
and Faith, as sworn Brethren to defend
the Kingdom against Foreigners, and
against Enemies, together with their
Lord the King, and to keep his Lands
and Honours with all Faithfulness;
and that they will be faithful to him,
as to their Lord, both within and with∣out
the Realm of <HI>Britain.</HI> So ought
all the Princes and Earls to do, and al∣so
to swear before the Bishops of the
Kingdom in the Folkmote, and also,
all the Peers of the Kingdom, and the
<HI>Knights and all the Freemen of the whole
Kingdom of</HI> Britain, <HI>ought, as is afore∣said,
to swear Fealty to their Lord the

<P>Here is not that Provision against Ex∣actions,
which was afterwards necessa∣ry;

<HI>Grand Charter,</HI> is fully express'd.</P>
<P>They were to be sworn Brethren, for
the preservation of the Rights of the
Crown, for the keeping the Peace, and
the Laws and Customs of the Kingdom,
which secured the Interests of private-men,
to the <HI>Liberi homines totius Mo∣narchiae,</HI>
there answers the Folkmote,
or <HI>Vocatio &amp; Congregatio populorum &amp;
gentium omnium,</HI> or <HI>universi qui sub pro∣tectione

<P>These surely were more than Tenants
by <HI>Knights Service,</HI> for they are distin∣guish'd
into <HI>Principes, Comites, Proceres,
Milites, &amp; liberi homines universi totius

they were Tenants by <HI>Knights Service,</HI>
because they were to defend the King∣dom
with Arms, according to their <HI>real</HI>

none ever heard of a Tenant by <HI>Knights

of the <HI>Assize</HI> of <HI>Arms,</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> the

<P>Good Mr. Dr. Were all those who

an ordinary <HI>County Court,</HI> and

<P>And the new convincing Reason for
the former Sense,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Glos. tit. <HI>Geniotum.</HI></NOTE> is, because the Court,
where Causes were determined before
the King's Provost or Officer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Glos. p. 19.</NOTE> is called
<HI>Folkmote</HI> too; but, pray why is not this
the great <HI>Folkmote?</HI> And why may we
not from hence take the Platform of the

of such as <HI>King William</HI> con∣firmed,
together with the Laws of the
Confessor.</P>
<P>Was an ordinary <HI>County Court,</HI> in time
of War or Danger, to act as a Council,
in providing for the Safety of the Crown
and other things, for the profit of the
Kingdom? And were the <HI>Bishops</HI> of such
a spiritual Nature, that they could ani∣mate
the whole Kingdom, as the Soul
does the Body, and be all at the same
<PB N="138" REF="88"/>
time in each distinct County of <HI>Eng∣land?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jani Angl. facies nova. p. 34.</NOTE>
This clears, beyond Exception,
the Charter of <HI>Henry</HI> the First, which
provides for the Assembly of the <HI>Coun∣ties</HI>
and <HI>Hundreds.</HI></P>
<P>If he had look'd but a little farther,
<HI>de Heretoc,</HI> he would have found a <HI>Folk∣mote</HI>
that was held twice a year, when
this was but once; and the <HI>Sciremote</HI> di∣stinct
from that. The first was the She∣riffs
Tourn, the other, the County
Court; and that observed by him, might
have been either the monthly <HI>Sciremote,</HI>
or that <HI>Folkmote</HI> that was held twice a
year. <HI>Ita vero bis Folkmote singulis an∣nis
semper celebrari debet per universos Co∣mitatus,</HI>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>But, to convince him more fully of
the Absurdity of <HI>his Confidence:</HI> He
ought to remember, that the very <HI>Law</HI>
whereby he would prove all the <HI>Free-men</HI>
of the Kingdom to have been Te∣nants
by <HI>Knights Service,</HI> was in Con∣firmation
of the <HI>Confessor</HI>'s Laws, and
that granted to those who had lived un∣der
them, and knew the Benefit of <HI>de∣fending
themselves</HI> and their <HI>Properties</HI> in
the <HI>Great Councils,</HI> and the Nation too,
there, or by their Arms elsewhere, with∣out
<PB N="139" REF="88"/>
out trusting the manage of all, to such
<HI>Thayns</HI> as held immediately of the King.
Nor were they then likely to quit their
former Advantages, when as appears by
the Story, they were in a probable
Condition of gaining more, if they
would: for, the <HI>English</HI> had got toge∣ther,
by the Encouragement of Abbot
<HI>Fretherick, Exercitum numerosum &amp; for∣tissimum,</HI>
a numerous and most potent
Army: and in their Head, was he who
was the only <HI>Heir</HI> to the Crown, and
that a Title above the <HI>Confessor.</HI> Up∣on
this, <HI>Prudentiâ feliciter eruditus,</HI> ha∣ving
the Happiness to follow his Inte∣rest,
and comply with the Occasion,
he granted St. <HI>Edward</HI>'s <HI>Laws,</HI> with some
Additions indeed, but not with such as
would defeat the whole. And I affirm
it, that though in his Additions he pro∣vides
about the Tenures, or other mat∣ters
of his then or future Tenants, yet
there is not any thing which creates a
feud over the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Dr. who understands not,
for it was beyond his Sphere, that Ser∣vice
laid either by Common or Statute

the Conquest, and since, the <HI>Burgh-bote,</HI>

or <HI>Jure haereditario,</HI> enjoy their Lands
free from all Manner of Charge, but
their free Services, (which indeed, tho

provided for the summoning the
lesser Council, the more ordinary <HI>Curia
Regis</HI> only; the Tenants which were
Members of it, standing in need of a
Law, to relieve them from some Hard∣ships
they were under. Whereas, the
constant practise from the Reign of <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
the First, inclusively downwards,
evinces, that they who composed the
<HI>Great Council,</HI> had maintain'd their
<HI>Right, ad habendum commune Concilium
regni,</HI> uninterrupted: for a general
proof of which, the Authority of <HI>Bra∣cton</HI>
was us'd, which shews, that be∣sides
such Payments as lay upon the Kings
Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> or had their Rise
from <HI>Custom,</HI> there were other intro∣duc'd
by the <HI>Common Consent</HI> of the
whole Kingdom; whence 'tis easie to
conclude, that King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter does
not <HI>exhibit,</HI> that is, prrticularly set forth
<HI>the full form of our</HI> English <HI>great and most
general Councils in those days.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jani, &amp;c. <HI>p</HI> 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>Though there is a general Reference
to all the constituent parts of those <HI>Au∣gust
Assemblies,</HI> and to be sure, nothing
to prove that Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> were
the only <HI>Members</HI> of them; yet, what
<PB N="142" REF="90"/>
others have thereby Right <HI>ad habendum
Commune Consilium Regni,</HI> is not exprest,
how strongly soever it may be imply'd
from the words, even without the In∣terpretation
of practise. That others
had Right, is undeniable, from the
words, and 'tis as clear from practise,
who those others were, and whether or
no all the Members of the great Coun∣cils
of the Kingdom, or even all such
as were Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> came to
Council in Person, either upon general
or special Summons, as such Tenants
did to the Conventions, for matters of
their Tenure, is not mentioned, but
left to that ancient <HI>Course</HI> and <HI>Right,</HI>
which the <HI>Practice</HI> or <HI>Fact</HI> explains.</P>
<P>Tho this last be barely of the manner
of Summons, yet it shews, that the manner
is mentioned only in Relation to the form
of an ordinary <HI>Curia Regis,</HI> as I shew the
Council of Tenants to have been.</P>
<P>The words upon which our Dispute
is, are these;</P>

<P>By the partial citation of this <HI>shred</HI>
or <HI>end</HI> of the <HI>Charter,</HI> 'tis a clear case, that
<HI>Et ad habendum Commune Conci∣lium
Regni</HI> is there, in express words
appropriated to Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI>
whatever may have been reserv'd to
others in the general provision for all
their <HI>Liberties</HI> and free <HI>Customes;</HI> and
the Publisher hath so dexterously and
effectually patched the Fragments to∣gether,
that the Reader must be forced,
according to those curious Appearan∣ces,
to assent to the Publisher, and
Doctor's fallacious Assertions, that none
but the Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> made the
<HI>Commune Concilium Regni,</HI> the
City of <HI>London,</HI> and all other Cities, Bur∣roughs,
Ports and Towns, or Parishes,
(whose Rights are there reserved) be∣ing
clearly left out in the <HI>Glossary;</HI>
whereas, 'twill be very difficult to one
that reads the whole together, not to
<PB N="147" REF="92"/>
think that, admitting <HI>ad habendum Com∣mune
Consilium Regni,</HI> be there appro∣priated
to the Kings Tenants in <HI>Chief,</HI>
yet the <HI>Aid</HI> and <HI>Escuage</HI> they are im∣power'd
to assess, must be such as con∣cern'd
them onely. A reservation for
the <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>free Customs</HI> of all the
parts of the Kingdom, following im∣mediately
upon mention of the <HI>Com∣mon
Council of the Kingdom,</HI> which, un∣doubtedly
had, of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Custom,</HI> a
larger Power, than barely the granting
of <HI>Taxes.</HI> But, if <HI>Et ad habendum
Commune Concilium Regni de aux∣iliis
assidendis, aliter quam in tribus casi∣bus
praedictis,</HI> ought to be joyn'd to the
<HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>free Customs</HI> of the whole
Nation, reserved by King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter,
<HI>then</HI> that darling <HI>Notion</HI> of a <HI>Parliament</HI>
of the King's Tenants <HI>only,</HI> (no more
to be prov'd than that we had <HI>Parlia∣ments</HI>
of <HI>Women</HI> as well as others) falls
to the ground.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Jan. p. 239.</NOTE></P>
<P>And, by the Dr's good favour, there
was no need of proving, that, amongst
the other Customs of the Cities, Bur∣roughs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jan. p.</HI> 4.</NOTE>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> this of <HI>enjoying a Right of
being of, or constituting the Common Coun∣cil
of the Kingdom was one of them,</HI> any
otherwise than from the express words
<PB N="148" REF="93"/>
of the Charter: nor could I justly be
blam'd, for not going first to prove that
such were <HI>Members,</HI> before my saying,
that <HI>if they</HI> were so <HI>before, and, at the
making of the Charter their Right is pre∣serv'd
to them by it, and is confirm'd by
the Charter of</HI> H. 3. c. 9. Since in all
mens Logick, but the Dr's, the Ar∣gument
is to be laid down before it can
be made good, and the thing to be prov'd
here is but the <HI>minor</HI> of a <HI>Syllogism.</HI></P>
<P>Which Argument being founded up∣on
<HI>Fact,</HI> which the Dr. would have to
be the <HI>onely Controversie between us,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 1.</NOTE> I
may wave for a while, and yet there's
no doubt but I prove a <HI>Right,</HI> if I shew,
that amongst other <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>free
Customs,</HI> all parts of the Kingdom here
enumerated, were, by the Words of
King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter, to enjoy a <HI>Right
ad habendum Commune Concili∣um
Regni.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Dr. agrees,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>So</HI> Matth. Paris. <HI>Against</HI> Jan. &amp;c. <HI>p.</HI> 62.</NOTE> <HI>that King</HI> John's <HI>Char∣ter,
and that which</HI> H. 3. granted in the
9th of his Reign, were alike in all things.</P>
<P>Wherefore, if I can shew the <HI>likeness,</HI>
I hope 'twill qualifie and abate our Au∣thor's
great <HI>Wrath,</HI> for my proving from
thence a provision for a more <HI>General
Council,</HI> than one made up of Tenants
<HI>onely.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="93"/>
For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 63.</NOTE> being <HI>like,</HI> 'tis not necessary that
the Words should be the <HI>very same,</HI> but
the <HI>Sense;</HI> and, if we are sure by <HI>Record</HI>
that we have the right <HI>words,</HI> we are
certain, if <HI>Records</HI> may explain <HI>Matthew
Paris,</HI> that the <HI>likeness</HI> he meant consist∣ed
in the <HI>Sense.</HI> Since therefore, in the
Great Charter <HI>granted 9 H.</HI> 3. (as I find
also one in <HI>Secundo)</HI> there is in a Chap∣ter
intire by it self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hand∣writing of <HI>E▪ MS.</HI> pe∣ues Dom. <HI>Petyt.</HI></NOTE> as the <HI>Lord Cook</HI> cites
it, <HI>Scutagium de caetero capiatur sicut
capi consuevit tempore</HI> H. <HI>avi nostri,</HI> and
no other provision is in any part of the
Charter made for the <HI>Great Council</HI> of
the Nation, than what is contain'd un∣der
the <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>free Customs</HI> of eve∣ry
particular Place; and yet this whol∣ly
agrees with, and expresses the <HI>Sense</HI>
of King <HI>John</HI>'s. <HI>Et de Scutagiis assi∣dendis</HI>
must be disjoyned from <HI>ad
habendum Commune Concilium
Regni, aliter quam in tribus casibus prae∣dictis.</HI></P>
<P>And if so, then the Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI>
who are under that Division, have no
express provision there made for their
Summons to the <HI>Great Council</HI> of the
Nation, but are, with others, left for
that to the antient Law, as it was in the
time of <HI>H.</HI> 2. whose Laws, both Char∣ters,
<PB N="150" REF="94"/>
that were <HI>in nullo dissimiles,</HI> rein∣forc'd.</P>
<P>And the Charter 9. <HI>H.</HI> 3. being after
a strict Inquisition concerning the Liber∣ties
which were in <HI>England</HI> in the time
of King <HI>H.</HI> that King's Grandfather;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris <HI>ed.</HI> Tiguri <HI>f.</HI> 305.</NOTE>
it appears, that the Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI>
had neither in the time of <HI>H.</HI> 2. nor at
any time after, <HI>Right</HI> to impose any <HI>Tax</HI>
besides <HI>Escuage</HI> only, for the taxing of
which, they were to have Summons, as
is express'd and provided for by King
<HI>John</HI>'s Charter, and if both Charters
were in every thing alike, was the <HI>Cu∣stom</HI>
in the time of <HI>H.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>And though some of the Arguments
in my Book may drive at their being a
<HI>Council</HI> for Tallage too,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> the Additi∣ons.</NOTE> yet 'tis only up∣on
the Advantage is given me from the
Dr's making the Tenants a Council for
all manner of Aid, as well as <HI>Escuage.</HI></P>
<P>This great <HI>Antiquary</HI> keeps a pother
to make us believe that the Records of
<HI>H.</HI> the Third's Charter are of no credit,
compar'd with his interpretation of
<HI>Matth. Paris:</HI> and in answer to the Con∣viction
from the manner in which the
Charter of <HI>H.</HI> 3. expresses the <HI>same thing</HI>
with that of King <HI>John</HI>'s, tells us magi∣sterially,
<PB N="151" REF="94"/>
that <HI>the Great Charter common∣ly
attributed to</HI> H. 3. <HI>was</HI> non of his, <HI>but
properly the Charter of</HI> E. 1. But when he
sayes it was <HI>rather his Explication or En∣largement
of that Charter of King</HI> John
<HI>and</HI> Henry 3.<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 63.</NOTE> He, by an unlucky dash
with his pen, hath spoil'd all, and yields
the Cause, granting that <HI>Et de Scuta∣giis
assidendis</HI> ought, according to the
meaning of King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter, to be
divided; and in another Clause, from
<HI>Et ad habendum Commune Conci∣lium
Regni,</HI> and consequently, that
the <HI>Common Council</HI> of the Kingdom
consisted of more than Tenants in <HI>Capite.</HI></P>
<P>If,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jan. &amp;c.</HI> p. 64.</NOTE> as the Dr. contends, <HI>There is no pro∣vision
made for any Summons to Great
Councils, or Parliaments, in the Charter
confirm'd</HI> 25 E. 1. And yet that Charter,
as appears by Record, is word for word
<HI>the same</HI> with that which was <HI>granted 9
H.</HI> 3. and the Charters of <HI>H.</HI> 3. and King
<HI>John, were not found to disagree in any thing,</HI>
then there was <HI>no Provision made</HI> in King
<HI>John</HI>'s Charter, <HI>for any Summons to Great
Councils,</HI> or <HI>Parliaments;</HI> no, not so much
as a general Provision, which I yield. And
if he will have it, that <HI>the Charter</HI> of E. 1.
was <HI>most properly his Explication, or En∣largement
of that Charter of King</HI> John, <HI>and
<PB N="152" REF="95"/>
H.</HI> 3. Does he not therein yield, that
there was provision made for Summons
to <HI>Great Councils,</HI> in the providing for all
the <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Free Customs</HI> of particu∣lar
places: and if <HI>ad habendum Com∣mune
Concilium Regni,</HI> be taken
in King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter, as joyn'd with
the <HI>Customs,</HI> in the several parts of the
Kingdom, and so that of <HI>being of, or
constituting the great Council,</HI> is exprest a∣mong
other their <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>free Cu∣stoms,</HI>
The Charter of <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. may well be
taken for an <HI>Explication</HI> of the Charter
of King <HI>John,</HI> and if it were doubtfull,
what King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter meant by the
<HI>Commune Concilium Regni,</HI> the
other makes it undeniable, that no other
Common Council is meant in King <HI>John</HI>'s
but such as was provided for, by the Re∣servation
of the <HI>Liberties,</HI> and free <HI>Customs</HI>
even of every Parish; and, as Generals in∣clude
particulars, tho the Charter of <HI>H.</HI> 3.
and <HI>E.</HI> 1. have not the Right <HI>ad haben∣dum
Commune Concilium Regni,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nota,</HI> The provision for raising Escuage is no less ge∣neral in the Char∣ters of <HI>H.</HI> 3. and E. 1.</NOTE>
express'd, yet they do not in <HI>any thing
disagree</HI> from King <HI>John</HI>'s. Whereas,
if the <HI>Council,</HI> which according to the
Charters of <HI>H.</HI> 3. and <HI>E.</HI> 1. and the pra∣ctise
in the time of <HI>H.</HI> 2. was to raise <HI>Es∣cuage,</HI>
was the only <HI>Common Council</HI> of
<PB N="153" REF="95"/>
<HI>the Kingdom,</HI> intended by King <HI>John's</HI>
Charter. 'Tis evident, that there was a
Disagreement between the Charters, for
there is no provision in general, or parti∣cular,
for any such <HI>Common Council of
the Kingdom;</HI> for particular provision,
there can be no pretence, and the same
general expressions which affect them, take
in others with them, unless they were the
only men that had <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>free Cu∣stoms</HI>
in any part of the Kingdom, even as
late as 25 <HI>E.</HI> 1.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 39.</NOTE> which is so ridiculous a
<HI>Whimsey,</HI> that it deserves no answer, tho
it be patroniz'd by the Dr. who supposes,
that Tenants in <HI>Military Service,</HI> and they,
to serve his Turn, must be all Tenants in
<HI>Capite,</HI> were the <HI>only Free-men of the King∣dom,</HI>
till 49 <HI>H.</HI> 3. But it seems, others had
then a general Enfranchisement procur'd
by the successful Barons, <HI>An. 49 H.</HI> 3. to
lessen their own Power.</P>
<P>'Tis particularly to be observed, that this
so mistaken and controverted part in King
<HI>John</HI>'s Charter, concerning the Summons of
all the Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> was not only left
out in the <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> confirm'd in Par∣liament,
2 <HI>H.</HI> 3. which was but 3 years after
the making of King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter; and in
the <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> confirm'd 9 <HI>H.</HI> 3. which
was but ten years after the making of King
<PB N="154" REF="96"/>
<HI>John</HI>'s; but likewise, in the Confirmation
of the Charter, <HI>An.</HI> 37. of that King <HI>Henry,</HI>
as appears by the Legier book of the Pri∣ory
of <HI>Coventry,</HI> in the hands of that great∣ly
learned Gentleman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS. <HI>Penes dominum</HI> Marsham▪</NOTE> <HI>John Marsham</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
but also, there is not a word of it in the
<HI>Magna Charta,</HI> confirm'd 25 <HI>E. I.</HI> which the
Dr. yields to be an <HI>Explication</HI> of King
<HI>John</HI>'s: and instead thereof; whereas, the
assessing of <HI>Escuage</HI> was mentioned about
the middle of King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter; in those
Charters of <HI>H.</HI> 3. and <HI>E. I.</HI> there is a par∣ticular
and distinct Chapter, <HI>viz.</HI> 37. con∣cerning
<HI>Escuage,</HI> and that the very last, ex∣cept
the saving and reserving to the Arch∣bishops,
Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Templars,
Hospitalers, Earls, Barons, and all others,
as well Ecclesiastical as Secular persons,
all their Liberties and free Customs, which
before they had.</P>
<P>But, as to the way of raising <HI>Escuage</HI> in
an especial manner, it is referr'd to the an∣cient
course of Law, as 'twas in the time
of <HI>H.</HI> 2. whose Laws in general, were
then intended to be confirm'd. I cannot
but make a farther Remark, taking in that
evidence of <HI>Fact,</HI> which for a while I laid
by, that in all those Charters since King
<HI>John</HI>'s, upon the several Confirmations,
the Arch-bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors,
<PB N="155" REF="96"/>
Earls, Barons, Knights, Free-holders, and
all of the Kingdom, are mention'd, as
granting to the Crown, a <HI>15th</HI> of all their
moveable Goods, and these that granted
the Subsidy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Register f. 175.</NOTE> in the old Register of Writs,
an Authority uncontrolable, are called
<HI>Commune Concilium Regni.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, 'tis impossible for any man
of Reason, that considers, to fancy that
King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter, in the sense of the
Dr. and others, could exhibit the full form
of the Common Councils of the Kingdom
or Parliaments, till 49 <HI>H.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>Take my sense of the Council, which
way soever you read it, under the <HI>Liber∣ties</HI>
and <HI>free Customs,</HI> will be comprehend∣ed
their whole Interest in the <HI>Legislature;</HI>
whereas otherwise, according to this
Charter of all their <HI>Liberties,</HI> the King's
<HI>Great Council</HI> had then only Power to
raise <HI>Taxes,</HI> though we find, that all along
they advis'd <HI>de arduis negotiis regni,</HI> and
consented to what passed into a Law.
Wherefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jan.</HI> &amp;c. p. 13.</NOTE> '<HI>tis strange there should not have
been the same care taken that they might have
thier</HI> Rights <HI>in Council</HI> setled, as well as
their <HI>Summons</HI> to it: but if this Charter
setled no other <HI>Right</HI> than this of granting
<HI>Taxes, Quere,</HI> What other power the <HI>Great
Councils</HI> have now, by our Author's Prin∣ciples?
<PB N="156" REF="97"/>
For, admit that by the <HI>New Go∣vernment,</HI>
which, he says, <HI>was fram'd and set
up</HI> in the <HI>49th</HI> of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. a <HI>Right</HI> of coming
to the <HI>Great Council,</HI> was giv'n to a body of
men, who before that had none; yet there
was no additional power given to the
<HI>Council</HI> it self, that he or any man can shew.</P>
<P>Because I would encounter the whole
Force which they raise by colour of this
Charter, I address'd my self chiefly to the
proving, that, admitting that <HI>Et ad haben∣dum
commune consilium Regni aliter quam,</HI>
ought to be joyn'd, as of the same period
with de <HI>Scutagiis assidendis,</HI> 'twill not
make for the purpose of them that urge it,
being, upon strict Inquiry, it cannot be
thought to extend farther than to such
matters as concern'd Tenants in <HI>Chief</HI> only.</P>
<P>That this must be thus confin'd, is
prov'd.</P>
<P>(I.) Because there were <HI>Majores Barones,</HI>
not excluded by this <HI>Charter,</HI> and so their
ancient <HI>Right</HI> continued, tho they are not
within the meaning of that part he insists
upon; for this is only of Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI>
that is, such as were subject to the <HI>Feudal
Law.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Chester</HI> for instance, was
not under it as Earl of <HI>Chester. Wardship</HI>
was a necessary Appendix to that Tenure;
but, even the <HI>Tenants</HI> within that <HI>County,</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="97"/>
though holding other Lands of the
King by <HI>Knights Service,</HI> were howe∣ver
out of the King's Wardship, much
more the <HI>Count Palatine.</HI> And surely,
no body before the Dr. ever took him
for a <HI>Feudal Tenant,</HI> by reason of the
County of <HI>Chester,</HI> though he might be
oblig'd to attend in the Wars, and pay
Escuage in case of Failure, for other
Lands held in <HI>Chief,</HI> in other Coun∣ties.</P>
<P>(2.) There were others came, and
upon other occasions than what are here
mentioned, as <HI>Falcatius de Brent,</HI> who
was to come even without forty days
notice, which was required in the Case
here; and whereas, giving Advice in
great Affairs, and the making of Laws,
were transacted in the <HI>Great Councils,</HI> no
such thing is mention'd in this.</P>
<P>(3.) We have the Resolution of a
whole Parliament, the 40th of <HI>Ed.</HI> 3.
That the <HI>Common Council</HI> of the King∣dom,
of Tenants in <HI>Chief,</HI> was not the
<HI>Great Council</HI> of the Kingdom; for that
King <HI>John</HI> resigned his Crown in the first
<HI>Council,</HI> but as they declare, not in the
last: and this the very Circumstances,
attending the Resignation, evince.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="98"/>
(4.) If the opposite Doctrine be true,
then all the <HI>dignified</HI> and <HI>inferiour Clergy,</HI>
which did not hold in <HI>Capite, Abbots,
Priors,</HI> &amp;c. were excluded.</P>
<P>(5.) This must needs be no more than
a <HI>Common Council</HI> of the Kingdom, for
assessing <HI>Escuage,</HI> and such other <HI>Aid</HI> as
lay upon Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> only; be∣cause,
Tenants only, stood in need of
<HI>Relief</HI> from this Charter, they only be∣ing
concerned in the three things <HI>reser∣ved</HI>
to the King, or in the Additions to
them, none other being charged in that
kind, without <HI>more</HI> general <HI>Consent,</HI> and
more than Tenants being Parties to the
Grant. Besides, not only the advan∣ces
upon Tenants Services, but the or∣dinary
Incidents were called <HI>Auxilia,</HI> as
well as those others, which according
to <HI>Bracton, were not called Services, nor
came from Custom; but were only in case of
Necessity, or when the King met his Peo∣ple,
as</HI> Hydage, Corage, <HI>and</HI> Carvage,
<HI>and many other things, brought in by the
common Consent of the whole Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>Now, where the King reserves Inci∣dents
to Tenure only, 'tis to be suppo∣sed,
that the Reservation is out of the
thing before mentioned, and so that
<PB N="147" REF="98"/>
must be Services because of Tenure,
none but Tenants being named; where∣as,
when others are named, we may
well suppose the <HI>Aids</HI> given by others
too, to be intended.</P>
<P>(6.) We may here divide the benefit
to each sort of Tenant in particular.</P>
<P>I. As the Tenants by <HI>Socage</HI> Te∣nure
only, were <HI>talliable,</HI> and that us'd
to be without their own Consent: here
they have a Consent given them.</P>
<P>2. As Tenants by <HI>Knights Service,</HI>
though not <HI>talliable,</HI> yet had hardship
in the Obligation to sudden Attendance,
convenient Notice is given, and it should
seem, that the want of this for the as∣sessing
of <HI>Escuage,</HI> was their only grie∣vance
proper to be redrest; for their
Attendance in the Wars, was to be go∣vern'd
by Necessity; and, as a Court
of Justice, there was no need of them.</P>
<P>(7.) There is a Difference to be ob∣served
all along, between the <HI>Great
Council,</HI> and such an one as is mention∣ed
in this Charter I. For the Persons
composing the one and the other. 2. The
matters of which they treated. And
3. the times of holding them.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="99"/>
For the <HI>Great Councils,</HI> by his own
way of arguing, there was at least one
<HI>Great Council,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>William</HI>
the First, where, were more than Te∣nants
in <HI>Chief.</HI> The Tenants in <HI>Chief,</HI>
he supposes to have been only the <HI>Nor∣mans</HI>
and <HI>Foreigners,</HI> who were Ene∣mies
to the <HI>English</HI> Laws, and the <HI>only</HI>
great men by his Rule; wherefore, if
the <HI>English</HI> Laws were retained at the
Petition of any great body of men here,
they must be <HI>populus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jani An∣glorum fa∣cies nova. <HI>p.</HI> 55.</NOTE> <HI>inferiour People of</HI>

<P>This was, <HI>Ad preces Communitatis An∣glorum,

as appears in the very Body of
the Laws, then received: but these, as
despicable as they were, had got toge∣ther
a numerous and mighty Army, of
which, they made <HI>Edgar Etheling</HI> Ge∣neral;
these are all called <HI>Primates,

To shew that 'twas matter of Council,
'twas argued <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con</HI> at <HI>Berkham∣sted,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Selden. ad</HI> ead. fo. 171.</NOTE>
where, <HI>post multas disceptationes,</HI> af∣ter

were setled.</P>
<P>I need urge no more in this Reign,
except that which he hath yielded to
<PB N="149" REF="99"/>
my hand, in effect, <HI>viz.</HI> that all the <HI>Free-holders</HI>
of the several <HI>Counties</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
met this King in a <HI>Great Council</HI> at
<HI>Salisbury.</HI> For, he himself tells us, that
all the <HI>Free-men</HI> of the Kingdom, held
by <HI>Knights Service,</HI> and here were all
the <HI>Knights;</HI> so more than Tenants in
<HI>Capite,</HI> and all the <HI>Free-holders</HI> too, as
they were <HI>Knights,</HI> all holding by <HI>Mi∣litary
Service.</HI></P>
<P>But, if there were other <HI>Freemen,</HI>
such as held in <HI>Free and common Socage,
qui militare servitium debebant,</HI> who ow'd
<HI>Military Service</HI> for the defence of the
Kingdom, though they held not by it,
why were not these <HI>Knights,</HI> as well as
the others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Glos. <HI>p.</HI> 10.</NOTE> since Tenure did not alter
the Condition of the Person? Especial∣ly,
some of the Chief must have been
such, with much more Reason, to be
sure, than the Chief <HI>Knights</HI> under Te∣nants
in <HI>Capite,</HI> came to the <HI>Great Coun∣cils,</HI>
or had other <HI>Liberties,</HI> by vertue
of that Law, which he supposes to have
related only to Tenants in <HI>Capite.</HI> Does
he answer the Law of <HI>William the First,</HI>
which it seems, was my idle Invention,
of Common <HI>Free-holders</HI> being made
<HI>Milites</HI> in the County Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jan. p.</HI> 47.</NOTE> by the

that all the <HI>Free-men</HI> of the County
were <HI>Knights?</HI> He has not so much as
told us, the Argument is <HI>unintelligible;</HI> but
he thinks he has me upon the Hip, for ap∣propriating
the <HI>Milites</HI> to the <HI>Sheriffs,
Knights,</HI> since the <HI>Earls</HI> and <HI>Barons</HI> had
their <HI>Knights,</HI> and 'tis <HI>Milites illorum:</HI>
but, admit they had, the <HI>Sheriff</HI> was
their proper <HI>Leader.</HI> Indeed, if the Sum∣mons
had been to the War, every Te∣nant
in <HI>Chief</HI> must have produc'd his
<HI>Quota</HI> of <HI>Knights.</HI> Besides, though 'tis
<HI>Milites illorum,</HI> and others besides <HI>She∣riffs</HI>
were there, yet 'twas before seem∣ingly
limited, <HI>Barones &amp; Vicecomites

we are told, that the <HI>Sheriffs</HI> were some

vouchsafe to take notice, that I before

Yet, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third,

the <HI>Novum,</HI> what was raised to his

<P><HI>Hic labor, hoc opus est.</HI> Upon this, he
belabours me with Reflections, and

<P><HI>The Reflections are these.</HI> 1. That ac∣cording
to constant Practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 76.</NOTE> I recite only
as much of the Record, which I produce to
settle my Notion, as in my own Judgment,
I think fits my Purpose, and conceal the
rest. 2. That I am a Plagiary of this No∣tion,
for that it was another Gentleman's,
that I conceal that too.</P>
<P>To both which, I plead, not guilty.
For, as I shall shew, what I left out of
the Record, was no Concealment, there
being nothing in it, which can make
<PB N="154" REF="102"/>
against me. My own Inspection of the
<HI>Record,</HI> occasioned this Notion, which
I borrowed from no man; not that I
speak this out of Vanity and Ostentati∣on,
but to shew the Freedom of this
Gentleman's Censure, which out-runs
his <HI>Wit</HI> and his <HI>Knowledge.</HI> His <HI>Wit,</HI> for
if I borrowed this of another, and was
a Stranger to the <HI>Record,</HI> as he would
insinuate, more than once; if there were
any material part left out; how does
it appear, that I was guilty of the Con∣cealment?
And he not knowing <HI>the Au∣thor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter to the Earl of <HI>S.</HI></NOTE>
as he tells a noble Peer, could not
tell what Notions, not taken out of
other Authors, were my own, what
Mr.<HI>Petyt</HI>'s; since 'twas impossible, that
I, or the Gentleman, who is to bear
the burthen of them, should have told
him, he being equally a Stranger to both
of us.</P>
<P><HI>But the main Question is, whether I,
or my Instructor; did fairly, in citing
no more than thus much of the Record;</HI>

<P>You must understand, that two Marks

<P>Who were charged in this Writ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i Angl.</HI> &amp;c. p. 77.</NOTE> two
Marks for every Knight's Fee, that was

affixed, but the Tenants in <HI>Ca∣pite?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="103"/>
To which, I answer, That as the
Charge lay upon all that was first grant∣ed
out in <HI>Capite,</HI> it was upon more than
Tenants in <HI>Capite,</HI> because of their Alie∣nations;
nay, and he himself should
have put the Question of more, other∣wise,
their Tenants were not charged:
but 'twill be said, that what was in the
hands of Tenants, was the Lord's own.
What need then was there for the She∣riff
to distrain, without which the Lord
could not raise it by his Bailiff?</P>
<P>But, what Answer has he made to the
<HI>Record,</HI> in the very year in which he
supposes a Charge was laid by the Te∣nants
in <HI>Capite,</HI> upon all their Tenants,
that shews, that both the King and Lords
could not charge the Lords Tenants,
though to relieve the Necessities of the
Tenant in <HI>Capite?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jan. &amp;c.</HI> p. 237.</NOTE> What says he to the
Plea, according to which, the <HI>novum
Feoffamentum</HI> is allowed to be free,
where the <HI>Vetus</HI> was chargeable. Where∣as,
he would have it, that <HI>Omnes alii de
regno,</HI> were only <HI>qui de nobis tenent in
Capite;</HI> How comes it to pass, that where
the <HI>novum Feoffamentum</HI> is expressly
nam'd to be charged,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>ib.</HI> p. 238. <HI>&amp;</HI> 239.</NOTE> there <HI>omnes alii</HI> are
particularly named; otherwise, only Te∣nants
in <HI>Capite?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="104"/>
And what says he to the <HI>Record,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 193. and 196.</NOTE> which
out of marvellous Modesty, he owns him∣self
not to have <HI>so much Knowledge of the

And yet in a few pages after,
<HI>forgetting himself,</HI> pretends to know that
Mr.<HI>Petyt understood not the latter part of
the Plea?</HI> Which he would have to be,
that only two <HI>Knights Fees were in the
Possession of the Prior and Convent,</HI> &amp;c.
Whereas, according to his Notion that
it was not regarded in the Levy, what
Fees were answerable to the King, ac∣cording
to the Original Grant, whether
in the hands of the Tenants in <HI>Chief,</HI> or
their <HI>Subfeudatories;</HI> the Payment was
by this <HI>Record,</HI> to be forc'd only from
those Lands, which were out of their
<HI>Possession. Ideo</HI> &amp;c. <HI>distringas omnes mi∣lites
&amp; liberè tenentes qui de eis tenent per
Servitium Militare,</HI> &amp;c. then besides, if
the King <HI>might distrain in the Fees of the
Subfeudataries,</HI> without Parliamentary
Grant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr.<HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 176.</NOTE> what a ridiculous thing was it,
for the Prior of <HI>Coventry</HI> to plead in dis∣charge
of eight parts of ten, that eight
parts were out of his <HI>Possession?</HI> But
his Plea is, that he was not liable to so
many as Tenent in <HI>Capite;</HI> but in effect,
<PB N="159" REF="104"/>
that indeed he had so many held under
him, who paid their Proporti∣ons
by his hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Record at large, in Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI>'s Appendix, or <HI>inter Communia de Termi∣no Sancti</HI> Hill. <HI>Anno</HI> 17. Ed. 3.</NOTE> as Collector
for the King, under the Sheriff,
who accounted for them, but
such were not chargeable, as ha∣ving
any respect to Service or
Tenure. <HI>Auxilia illa non fuerunt nec cen∣seri

merâ voluntate Regi concessa, et tam

<P>And this is manifestly the same, as if
he had pleaded, that he had eight of the
<HI>Knights Fees, de novo Feoffamento,</HI> and
therefore was not chargeable for them.
For, it appears, that in the <HI>34th</HI> he was
to account for twelve Marks,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> the Record.</NOTE> <HI>Ad Soro∣rem
Regis maritandum;</HI> (this, there be∣ing
then charged two Marks upon eve∣ry
<HI>Knights Fee,</HI> was for Arrears in his

and that, <HI>per Commune Consilium Regni,</HI>
or as he pleads, <HI>per Magnates et Commu∣nitatem

<PB N="160" REF="105"/>
militum tam de novo Feoffamento quam

<P>But, as our Author supposes all man∣ner
of Charges to have been laid by the
<HI>Tenants</HI> in <HI>Chief</HI> only, who were able
to charge more than such, for whose
Services they were answerable to the
King, what thinks he of the <HI>Record,
24 Ed.</HI> 1. which says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Pat. 24 Ed. 1. n. 22. de 12. &amp; 8. Regi con∣cessa.</NOTE> that a twelfth and
eighth were granted to the King by the
<HI>Comites, Barones, Milites et alii de regno</HI>
(when to be sure, more than Tenants
by <HI>Knights Service</HI> gave, it being after
the Doctor's <HI>marvellous</HI> year, 49 <HI>H.</HI> 3.
and more are specified) <HI>as it us'd to be
in the time of the Kings Progenitors;</HI>
which must be beyond the Reign of
<HI>H.</HI> 3. to which, at present, our Dispute
is limited? <HI>Cum Comites, Barones, Mili∣tes,

nostris regibus</HI> Angliae, <HI>concesserunt</HI>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>If all these will not do, however, I
have one <HI>Record,</HI> which is a Demonstra∣tion,
that no more than such as the Te∣nants
in <HI>Capite,</HI> were answerable for,
according to the <HI>Vetus Feoffamentum,</HI> or
original Infeodation from the King,
<PB N="161" REF="105"/>
were in respect of any charge, to be laid
by Tenants in <HI>Chief</HI> only, accounted
their Knights. Though I have a great

To all this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 265.</NOTE> may be added, that
long before, where the <HI>ingenuitas regni</HI>
were consulted.</P>
<P>Here are Instances enough of greater
<HI>Councils,</HI> than such as King <HI>John</HI>'s Char∣ter
settles, as I have observed, those
<PB N="168" REF="109"/>
there were made a <HI>Council</HI> only for the
matters of their Feud; they met ordi∣narily,
three times a Year, and in that
were ordinarily a Court of Justice: and
he <HI>betrays</HI> his <HI>Ignorance,</HI> not to say more,
who affi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms the contrary.</P>
<P>'Tis no Objection to this, that some∣times
we find <HI>Regnum Angliae</HI> at it; for,
still 'twas <HI>ad Curiam pro more.</HI> Not that
the Kingdom used to come of Course,
but then came to that Court which was
ordinary, or of Course.</P>
<P>That the Kings great Officers and
Ministers of Justice were there, I have
always yielded; and that 'twas no Grie∣vance
to the Tenants, to have Justice
administred without them at other
times: and therefore it makes not against
my Sense, that these often sat without
the Tenants. Yet, their sitting was not
at stated times, and therefore they were
not <HI>Curia pro more.</HI> Either way, there
was a great Council distinct from the
less.</P>
<P>(1.) As to the persons composing the
one and the other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Council</HI> had the whole Na∣tion
of <HI>Propriet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs,</HI> or of Representa∣tives,
of their Choice; in the other at the
<PB N="169" REF="109"/>
most, the King had only his Tenants
in <HI>Chief,</HI> and Officers and Ministers of
Justice.</P>
<P>(2.) As to the matters treated of;
the one treated of matters of extraordi∣nary
Justice; the other, but ordinary.</P>
<P>(3.) For time, the great <HI>Council</HI> was
summon'd as often as the State of the
Kingdom required it; the other, as a
Court of Tenants and Officers, had times
ascertain'd: not but that as occasion
might offer it self, they might be sum∣mon'd
according to King <HI>John</HI>'s Char∣ter.
Nay, may be after that, they ne∣ver
met, but upon Summons; the lesser
Court of Officers and Ministers of Ju∣stice,
met oftner than either, but not
of Course.</P>
<P>And, thus have I answered his Argu∣ments
from King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter, by
which, he labours to prove, That Te∣nants
in <HI>Chief</HI> only, composed the <HI>Great
Council,</HI> or were all the <HI>Nobility</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
and have given a clear Account
of that unintelligible piece, as he is
pleased to represent it, leaving out what
I offer'd upon the Question of the Bi∣shops
Voting in <HI>Capital Cases,</HI> since he
had no other way of answering it, than
<PB N="171" REF="110"/>
by calling it <HI>impertinent Rhapsody.</HI> Tho
if 'tis no better to be answer'd, 'tis not
<HI>Rhapsody</HI> and <HI>fancyful Stuff:</HI> and, if the
first ground from our Laws to dispute
their Right, mentions it in relation to
the <HI>Curia Regis,</HI> 'twas not surely <HI>imper∣tinent</HI>
to consider their Right; the <HI>Curia</HI>
from whence 'twas excluded, being so
directly to my purpose.</P>
<P>There are other things incidentally
coming in, which I divide not into
Heads, being they serve but to explain
those which I have rais'd. To which,
may be added, That our Author, by the
Exercise of his Faculty of <HI>Story-telling,</HI>
and setting forth the Power of the great
<HI>rebellious</HI> Barons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 210.</NOTE> has given us to under∣stand,
That the <HI>Commons</HI> were not first
brought into the <HI>Great Councils,</HI> in the
49 of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. unless we believe, that the
great men would co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sent to ballance
and weaken their own Power.</P>
<P>I may put the Question in his own
words, upon another Occasion, <HI>Can it
be reasonably imagined,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 234. <HI>&amp;</HI> 235.</NOTE> <HI>that they should
give way to, or establish such Laws, as
would undoe and destroy their own Settle∣ment</HI>
in Power? Wherefore, the Argu∣ment
is strong, that till then the <HI>Com∣mons</HI>
<PB N="172" REF="110"/>
came in their own Person; but
that then the <HI>Great men,</HI> having the
Power in their hands, clip'd their
Wings. But let us see his weighty Ar∣guments
against my sense of this Charter.</P>
<P>In Answer to my third Head, he puts
me off with the Fallibility of a <HI>Parlia∣liament;</HI>
but, if moral Certainty, with∣out
<HI>Infallibility,</HI> will not satisfie him in
matters of the greatest Concern, we
may know what he would be at. But
forsooth, this was not a full Court of
Tenants, because, as was usual, only
some few attested the Fact.</P>
<P>In Opposition to my Fifth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 10. <HI>&amp;</HI> 11.</NOTE> he tells
us, that even voluntary Gifts to the
Crown, are called <HI>auxilia;</HI> nay, even
such as were more than Advances upon
Services. But, what proof is there, that
such were here meant, when not only
Services, because of Tenure, with the
Advances upon them, but what came
from more than Tenants, are called
<HI>Auxilia</HI> too.</P>
<P>As general Objections against my
Sense.</P>
<P>(1.) If Tenants in <HI>Capite</HI> were a great
Council of the Kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 12.</NOTE> for Aids and
Escuage only, which is hardly reconcileable
<PB N="172" REF="111"/>
to Sense? (<HI>Why so, good Dr.? May there
not be a great</HI> Council, <HI>especially a</HI> Com∣mon-Council,
<HI>to a particular Purpose?
Nay, you your self confine it's Power to
the raising of Taxes.</HI> Why was the Cause of
Summons to be declared? <HI>Because of the
occasion requiring greater or less</HI> Aid.</P>
<P>(2.) <HI>Lastly,</HI> If all Free-men, or, as our
Author saith in other places, all Proprietors
were Members of the Great and General
Council of the Nation?<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 13.</NOTE> 'Tis strange there
should not have been the same Care taken,
that they might be summoned as well as the
Tenants in <HI>Capite;</HI> Certainly they came
not to them by instinct; nor is it scarce pro∣bable,
that they would leave their Ploughs
and Country Business, to travel from one
remote part of <HI>England</HI> to another, to these
great Councils, which seldome continued
above three or four days, if they had had
Right so to do.</P>
<P>This is as <HI>trifling</HI> as the rest, for, if
the <HI>Common</HI> Law took care for their
Coming, and for their <HI>general Summons,</HI>
nor had their Right been denied them,
there was no need of special Provision
by that Charter.</P>
<P><HI>Upon my seventh Head of the Di∣stinction,
between the</HI> Great Council,
<PB N="173" REF="111"/>
<HI>and the</HI> Curia pro more, <HI>he attacks me ve∣ry

perverse Interpretations, Ignorance,
and Confidence; to say no more, monstrous
abusing of History, cheating and abusing my
Readers, and wresting Records and Histo∣ries,
<HI>with a long</HI> Et caetera: <HI>out comes
this gentle Rebuke,</HI></P>
<P>And indeed as he deals with Sir <HI>Henry
Spelman</HI>'s Glossary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 96.</NOTE> in saying, the second
part was not his own; so doth he shuffle off
all Records and Histories, which are directly
against him, by saying, the <HI>Curia</HI> or <HI>Great
Councils</HI> there mention'd, were but an or∣dinary
<HI>Curia</HI> or <HI>Council,</HI> and such as in
his own Judgment, contain any thing that
makes for him: The <HI>Councils</HI> there spoken
of, are <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>General Councils,</HI> to
be sure.</P>
<P>'Tis, doubtless, an hainous thing, to
call that a <HI>Great</HI> or <HI>General Council,</HI>
which is so in my <HI>own Judgment:</HI> But,
if I prove, and that out of himself
too, that there came more to the King's
<HI>Great Councils,</HI> than his Tenants in
<HI>Chief,</HI> and <HI>Officers,</HI> such as compos'd the
<PB N="175" REF="112"/>
<HI>Curia,</HI> held <HI>pro more</HI> thrice a year; sure∣ly,
it lies upon him to shew that at any
one <HI>Council,</HI> where more than Tenants
were charged, Tenants only were pre∣sent.
And I affirm, that he neither has
nor can produce one Authority, which
upon Examination, can signifie any
thing.</P>
<P>And to retort his last Charge, <HI>as he
deals with Sir</HI> Henry Spelman, in put∣ting
upon him his own, or his Friends
Sense, <HI>So he doth</HI> shuffle over <HI>Records,
which are directly against him,</HI> and sup∣plants
them by <HI>History</HI> seemingly for
him: And if the last <HI>contain any thing
which in his own Judgment makes for him,
the Council there</HI> spoken of, <HI>is a Great
and General Council</HI> of Tenants in <HI>Chief</HI>
only, to <HI>be sure,</HI> though the <HI>Record</HI>
mention more.</P>
<P><HI>Our Author says of the</HI> Curia, <HI>which
I contend to have been</HI> pro more, <HI>or or∣dinary,</HI>
If he can make the Court holden
<HI>coram Rege &amp; Consilio,</HI> before the King
and Councel, which he hath made his In∣stance
for his ordinary Court, and be the
same with the <HI>Common Council</HI> of the
Kingdom establish'd by that Charter, <HI>mean∣ing
King</HI> John'<HI>s,</HI> he gains the point; but,
<PB N="176" REF="112"/>
if it cannot be done, he may very well blush
at his own Confidence, to say no more.</P>
<P>Truely, I should rather blush at the
want of Sense in that Paragraph, if it
were mine; for, I cannot well answer
for making the Court, <HI>and be the same.</HI>
But, since he has informed me where
the point lies, I can easily gain it, by
proving that the Court holden <HI>coram
Rege &amp; Consilio,</HI> became the Court of
which our Dispute is; as it had the
same Power, whether held by the same
persons, or at the same times, is not
material, so that it be the Kings <HI>Curia,</HI>
or <HI>Magnum Concilium,</HI> as the Court held
<HI>pro more</HI> was.</P>
<P>In Order to the clearing this, he may
please to understand that the King's
Court had the only Cognizance of the
Kings Grants or Charters; agreeable to
which,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bracton.</HI> lib. 2. cap. 16. p. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Bracton</HI> says, <HI>De chartis verò re∣giis

<P>Here was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Court for these
matters, held before the King, that is,
before him and his Council. And thus,

the Charter of <HI>Richard</HI> the First,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ryley</HI> pla∣cita Parl. <HI>f.</HI> 20.</NOTE>
about the <HI>Advowson</HI> of the Church of

did not do them Right, he Petitions
<PB N="177" REF="113" MS="y"/>
that the King would do him Remedy and
Grace upon it; <HI>because, none but Kings
themselves ought to judge of Kings Charters.</HI></P>
<P>This is received before the King and
his Counsel in Parliament: and because
there was need of a Certificate to be
made in the Case, 'tis referred to the
next Parliament, that is, when it relates
to any Judgment to be given, Coun∣sel
then to sit. But, the Business, as I
find many of the like kind, upon the
Parliament Rolls, was properly brought
before the Kings <HI>Counsel</HI> in Parliament,
who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jani An∣glorum fa∣cies nova. <HI>p.</HI> 190.</NOTE> as I before observed, succeeded
into the places of the Tenants in the
<HI>Curia;</HI> and indeed, I see not what other
Account can be given of the Lords Ju∣risdiction.
As this Counsel acted in
Parliament with the same Power which
the Tenants had exercised before, so
we find them sometimes acting like the
Tenants in the <HI>Curia,</HI> in the Intervals
of Parliament, as in the 33. of <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. after

them, they never undertook to deter∣mine

<P>But there is yet a farther Evidence,
in that, as the same Matters were hand∣led
in the one and the other, sometimes
in conjunction with the great Council,
sometimes separate from it; so 'twas in
the same manner. And thus <HI>Thomas de
Berkley,</HI> who was a Lord in the <HI>4th</HI> of
<HI>Edw.</HI> 3. was Tryed in Parliament by a
Common Jur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl. 4 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3.</NOTE> <HI>De bono &amp; malo ponit se
super Patriam;</HI> upon which, a Jury of
Knights was returned.</P>
<P>And this, to be sure, was according
to the Common-Law, the way of Try∣al
in the ordinary <HI>Curia,</HI> which, doubt∣less,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Glanvil,</HI> lib. 2. c. 7.</NOTE>
was that <HI>Assize</HI> mentioned by <HI>Glan∣vil;
Clementiâ Principis de Concilio Pro∣cerum

was a Jury of twelve at the
least.</P>
<P>Farther, Before the Itinerant Judges
were setled, and before the Courts

<PB N="179" REF="114"/>
he being personally present. And that
the Tenants in Chief <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,
appears by the <HI>Constitution</HI> of <HI>Clarendon,</HI>
which requires it in affirmance of the
Common Law. <HI>Archiepiscopi, Episcopi,

<P><HI>Our Adventurer in Antiquities, who
treats the Author of</HI> Jani Anglorum Fa∣cies
nova <HI>with much contempt, has this
passage;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 26.</NOTE> Notwithstanding he sayes it is
agreed on all hands, the ordinary Curia
was held thrice a year, I never heard of
any one of his opinion but himself; He
would make the great Court held at these
times he mentions, and the great Confluence
of Nobility then to the Kings Court, to
be the King's ordinary Court, for this
Dispatch of ordinary Business, and Con∣troversies
between the King and his Sub∣jects,
or between man and man. I will
not deny, but often Petitions might be put
up, and Complaints made to them about
private matters, such as alwayes have been
to the House of Lords, and many more of
antient times, than have been for a Centu∣ry
or two of years. And that they did de∣termine
and pass Judgment in those Cases.
<PB N="180" REF="115"/>
But, that they were therefore the King's
Ordinary Court, I think no body will say,
but such as never read antient History or
Lawyers, or, at least, never intend to un∣derstand
them.</P>
<P>Truly, he has an excellent Faculty to
bring men's Arguments into the shape
of his own; and then 'tis easie, even
for him, to expose them. He would
have it, that, according to my Notion,
the House of Lords is the King's <HI>ordi∣nary
Court,</HI> because of determining in
matters of <HI>ordinary Justice;</HI> whereas, I
make the Notion of <HI>Ordinary,</HI> not to
consist in that onely, unless it be at
<HI>ordinary,</HI> or stated times. Nor do I say
that the House of Lords is an <HI>Ordinary
Court,</HI> but succeeded into the Jurisdi∣ction
of the <HI>ordinary.</HI></P>
<P>But he does well to serve my <HI>Hypo∣thesis,</HI>
in making the Comparison be∣tween
these two Courts. The one of
which, as I before observed, succeeded
to, and gives an <HI>Idea</HI> of the other,
though it agree not in every particular.
And, as the House of <HI>Lords,</HI> divided
from the <HI>Commons,</HI> never could make
Laws; so neither could the <HI>ordinary
Curia,</HI> unless when joyned to the <HI>great∣er:</HI>
though, both the House of Lords,
<PB N="181" REF="115"/>
and the <HI>Curia</HI> before, were the Supreme
Courts of Judicature. And, if the <HI>Cu∣ria</HI>
was held thrice a year, and confin'd
to Matters of <HI>ordinary Justice,</HI> which,
I think, I have proved, in shewing that
the Legislative Power was vested in
more than the King, and his Tenants
and Officers; then I find not that our
Champion so much as blunders upon
any thing against what I say.</P>
<P>But, to prove more particularly my
Assertion, which he would have to be
my singular Opinion;</P>
<P><HI>Knighton,</HI> to instance in an Author
of the best eredit, tells us of King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
the First,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Knighton,</HI> f. 2354.</NOTE> <HI>In praecipuis Festis profusè

He used to keep his <HI>Christmas</HI> at <HI>Glo∣cester,

Causae in medium duci ex more caeperunt.</HI>
<Q>When therefore the most Festival
dayes were over, they began to treat
of divers Causes, <HI>as was the usual man∣ner.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To these Feasts there us'd to come
onely Tenants, and the King's great
Officers, which I need not go to prove,
since our Author would have Tenants
onely▪ even exclusive of Officers that
were not T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nants, to have come to the
<HI>greatest Councils.</HI></P>
<P>So that the Court being held thrice
a year, the <HI>Members</HI> of it, the same
which I have shewn, and their Business
<HI>ordinary</HI> Tryals, here is that <HI>Ordinary</HI>
Court which I have contended for.
And thus, having given some <HI>reason</HI> for
my <HI>confidence,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 49.</NOTE> I may expect to <HI>be be∣lieved.</HI></P>
<P>This might serve upon this Head,
but, I thank him, he generally gives me
occasion, by reason of his Exceptions,
to confirm the Rules which I take.</P>
<P>He fancies he has a great Advantage
over me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. &amp;c. p. 191.</NOTE> by my saying, that the <HI>Admi∣nistration
of Justice,</HI> (which I mean of
the common or ordinary Administra∣tion,)
<PB N="183" REF="116" MS="y"/>
<HI>was taken from the ordinary Cu∣ria,
and fix'd at the Courts in Westminster
Hall.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Communia placita non sequantur Curiam nostram.</NOTE> And not observing that there
was the same Clause in King <HI>John's</HI>
Charter, I had plac'd it some three
years too late, according to him, though,
in truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Glanvil,</HI> lib. 2. c. 6.</NOTE> there were Justices <HI>in Banco
sedentes,</HI> which seems to be meant of
a fix'd place, in the time of <HI>H.</HI> 2. And
so it must have been, since King <HI>John</HI>'s
Charter was not introductory of any
new Law.</P>
<P>But I understand not the force of
his Argument, <HI>that if this Council sum∣moned,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 46: &amp; 47.</NOTE>
<HI>as is there, were the Curia Regis
Ordinaria, and went off by reason of this
Clause, it certainly went off before it be∣gan.</HI>
Unless he acknowledge, that the
<HI>Curia</HI> there provided for, be it <HI>ordina∣ry</HI>
or extraordinary, was not in Being
before: And truly, I shall not quarrel
with him for this. But I appeal to any
man, that will consider without Byass,
Whether '<HI>tis manifestly prov'd in the
Answer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ib.</NOTE> <HI>that, after the granting of this
Charter by King John, there were many
general and great Councils or Colloquiums
summon'd by Edict, according to the Form,</HI>
which he would have to be <HI>there prescri∣bed?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="117"/>
However, it seems, by him, that there
was no such Form for <HI>general</HI> and <HI>great
Councils</HI> before.</P>
<P>But, how well do's he understand
what I say? I make but part of the
Power of the <HI>Curia</HI> to have been taken
away by <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> (or, be it by the
Law there affirmed) but that of granting
<HI>Aid</HI> and <HI>Escuage,</HI> which onely is mention∣ed
in that part of the Charter which re∣lates
to the <HI>Curia,</HI> whether <HI>ordinary</HI> or
<HI>extraordinary,</HI> I say, continued to the
34. <HI>th</HI> of <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. at least,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 192.</NOTE> of Right it should,
unless swallow'd up in Parliaments, But,
whenever the Court which granted
such Aid as the Charter means, ceas'd to
be held, <HI>pro more,</HI> thrice a year, it ceas'd
to be an <HI>ordinary Curia.</HI> This might
have been either by the pleasure of the
King, who needed not to summon his
Tenants, but when he pleased: Or else
it might have been in the <HI>49th</HI> of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI>
the Third,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt,</HI> p. 110.</NOTE> when, our Author says,
there was a <HI>new Government.</HI></P>
<P>I agree with him, <HI>that the King's or∣dinary
Court continued in the several
Kings Reigns,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Ian. &amp;c.</HI> p. 53.</NOTE> <HI>in all its branches and
divisions, and derivative Jurisdictions;</HI>
and yet not the same, any more than a
<PB N="185" REF="117" MS="y"/>
man is <HI>the same</HI> with his Executor that
represents his Person, and is <HI>the same</HI> in
Law.</P>
<P>The House of Lords had the Jurisdi∣ction
of the ordinary <HI>Curia,</HI> most pro∣perly,
being as he himself yields, 'twas
<HI>ex ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tâ multitudine</HI> of men, holding in
<HI>Capite,</HI> that some had the special Writs,
which made them of the upper House;
and coming in the Degree and Circum∣stances
of Tenants in <HI>Chief,</HI> they had
the same Power. The Justices and
Officers that were not Tenants in <HI>Chief,</HI>
must needs have been but <HI>Assistants</HI> in
the <HI>Ordinary Curia,</HI> as they have ever
been in the House of Lords: and, the
inferiour Tenants, without doubt, were
to serve on Juries, as the <HI>Knights</HI> were
Jurors in <HI>Berklay</HI>'s Case before the
House of Lords; nor do I find, that
these inferiour Tenants had any other
Power or Interest, except that of giving
Taxes, which, is the only Power which
our Author seems to yield to the <HI>greatest
Council.</HI></P>
<P>The Power of the Justices Itenerant,
or of them that were setled at <HI>Westmin∣ster-hall,</HI>
was derived from the King and
his <HI>Curia,</HI> either <HI>ordinary,</HI> or when it
<PB N="186" REF="118"/>
cas'd to be <HI>ordinary;</HI> yet, in effect, con∣tinued
the same Court. And thus, as
late as the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Second,
you shall find the <HI>Curia then,</HI> not only
to have Writs of Error brought thither,
or to impower the Barons of the Ex∣chequer,
who were properly under it,
to determine matters concerning the
King's Revenue, or concerning Tithes,
but, for Causes of all Natures, to be
tryed before any Judges, they awarded
the Writs, and appointed the Judges,
sometimes <HI>mandetur Justiciariis de utro∣que

<P>These Benches were very anciently
fix'd at <HI>Westminster-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all,</HI> but still they
were so dependant upon the King's
more immediate <HI>Curia,</HI> that often they
were only to hear the Cause, and cer∣tifie
to the higher Court, what ap∣pear'd
to them, as was usually done by
those who were assign'd to hear the Pe∣titions
delivered in <HI>Parliament.</HI> Some∣times,
Judges were impowered, <HI>Ad au∣diendum

it is, that where an Estate was de∣riv'd
from the King's Grant, or the
King's Right and Title might be affe∣cted
<PB N="187" REF="118"/>
by any matter in Question, 'twas
usual for the <HI>Curia</HI> to order that Judg∣ment

without any setled Exclusion; which is
enough, if it reach'd to the greatest
part of them, with which the Ballance
was. If I prove that, as such, to wit
merely because of <HI>Property,</HI> be it more
or less, they were <HI>noble,</HI> the proof will
be yet stronger, because, all Authors
and <HI>Records</HI> agree, that no <HI>Nobles</HI> were
excluded till then. Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI> has very

which our Opponent, like a right <HI>So∣phister,</HI>

whereas, that 'twas so <HI>immemo∣rially,</HI>
so as there are <HI>no</HI> Foot-steps to

that all the <HI>Free-holders,</HI> which were in

reach'd to all that held of any by

that bore Arms.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De</HI> Here∣tochiis.</NOTE> <HI>In quolibet comitatu

<P>Whereas the <HI>Thayns</HI> are called <HI>Nobles,</HI>
in the Laws by me cited, and as all Au∣thors

called <HI>Barons,</HI> (not but that in <HI>William

we find in this Law, that they who had
<HI>Free-lands</HI> in any County, and accord∣ing
to the known Law, were, and still
continue Judges in the County Court,
were <HI>Barons.</HI></P>

amonst the Judges of the Laws;
wherefore, they neither forfeit their

<P>'Tis plain, that the Judgments in the

which are here intended; so that the

<P>And the true Sir <HI>Henry Spelman</HI> agrees
that the <HI>Barones Comitatus</HI> were amongst

and these he says were Feudal Ba∣rons,

<P><HI>This of being Suitors to the County and

as often named as <HI>Milites:</HI> sometimes
indeed, <HI>Milites</HI> strictly were required
at the Common Law;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Inst. <HI>f.</HI> 256. a.</NOTE> as where a Peer

<P>1. 'Tis absurd.</P>
<P>2. 'Tis dangerous.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="125"/>
1. We know that the Titles to Estates
from before the reputed <HI>Conquest,</HI> are
allowed upon the Presentments of the
Counties and Hundreds, <HI>Testatur Comi∣tatus,
Testatur Hundredus,</HI> &amp;c. If these
were all Strangers, brought in with the
<HI>Conquerour,</HI> how could they know the
Tithe, and who enjoyed the Land,
<HI>Die quo Rex</HI> Edwardus <HI>fuit vivus &amp;
mortuus;</HI> and by what Services, nay,
who was the third Heir, as we find they
present? Besides, is it supposable, that
they would have allowed the old Inha∣bitants
such large Shares, as we find in
<HI>Domesday-book?</HI> but, if our Author had
read the Tryal between Sheriff <HI>Picot,</HI>
and <HI>William de Chornet,</HI> he would have
found, that the <HI>Meliores</HI> of the County
and Hundred, that present the Right
to be in <HI>Chornet,</HI> were the <HI>English,</HI> who
were not Tenants by <HI>Knights Service;</HI>
since we are told, that they were all
<HI>Normans:</HI> and this appears, in that
they were <HI>Antiqui,</HI> such as were anti∣ent,
and knew how it was in the time
of the <HI>Confessor;</HI> whereas, on the
other side, were Villeins, <HI>vilis plebs,</HI> and
<HI>praepositi,</HI> Bailiffs, all which may be <HI>Nor∣mans,</HI>
if he please.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="126"/>
Farther, when ten Tithings of <HI>Fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pledges</HI>
made an Hundred, to suppose
that these were not Hundredors, legal
men there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Glos. p. 31.</NOTE> but the Knights who were
not <HI>bound with Sureties to their good Be∣haviours,</HI>
is as silly, as to say, two times
two do's not make four.</P>
<P>2. His Notion is dangerous, and that
according to that Improvement of it,
for the sake of which, 'twas broach'd;
<HI>But of these Tenants in</HI> Capite,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against</HI> Jani &amp;c. p. 13.</NOTE> '<HI>tis highly
probable,</HI> (if not without doubt) <HI>that
the two Knights were at first chosen by the
other Tenants in</HI> Capite, <HI>in every County,
to represent them.</HI> And the Reason given
for this, is, That the <HI>Elections were to
be made in the County Court by the Sui∣tors:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 42.</NOTE>
and this he imagines to have con∣tinued
in such Tenants, till the <HI>8th</HI> of
<HI>H. 6. c. 7. by which, any man that had
40 s. per annum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">8 H. 6. c. 7.</NOTE> <HI>of any Tenure, was per∣mitted
to be an Elector.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas, to any one but him, 'twill
be obvious, upon reading the Statute,
that it is restrictive of that Power which
before was in men of lesser Estates, but
is very far from giving any new power.</P>
<P>Whereas the Elections of Knights of
Shires, to come to the Parliaments of our
<PB N="203" REF="126"/>
Lord the King, in many Counties of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

made by very great and outragious, and
excessive number of People, dwelling with∣in
the same Counties of the Realm of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
of the which, most part was of Peo∣ple
of small Substance, and of no value,
whereof, every of them pretended a Voice
equivalent, as to such Elections to be made,
with the most worthy Knights and Esquires,
within the same Counties; whereby, Man∣slaughter,
Riots, Batteries, and Divisions
among the Gentlemen and other people of
the same Counties, shall very likely rise, and
be: therefore, 'tis provided, that the
Choice shall be in every County, by
People dwelling and resident in the same
Counties; whereof, every one of them shall
have Land or Tenement, to the value of
40 s. by Year, above all Charges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Here is manifestly an Exclusion of
some former <HI>Electors,</HI> but no new ones
created; wherefore, the unforc'd Con∣sequence
is, that all Lands being now
held in <HI>Free,</HI> or <HI>common Socage,</HI> and
there being no time for Prescription, or
any new Law, impowring such to chuse
their Representatives, this great Preser∣vative
of the Rights and Liberties of

say, 'tis neither within his Art, or his
Will, to recover it.</P>
<P>Yet, though he would smother it, I
doubt not to find it alive amongst his
<HI>Nobles;</HI> for, whatsoever made a man
<HI>Noble,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jan. &amp;c.</HI> p. 91.</NOTE> secured this Priviledge to him:

<P><HI>Possibly, no man has a better Facul∣ty

clear Proof, which he often brings
against himself:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1244. 28 H. 3. <HI>Against Mr.</HI> Petyt. <HI>p.</HI> 162.</NOTE> <HI>Thus he tells us,</HI> The
great men of the whole Kingdom, the
Arch-bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls and
Barons, were called together, in which
Council, the King, by his own Mouth, in
the Presence of the great men, in the Re∣fectory
at <HI>Westminster,</HI> desired a pecuni∣ary
Aid; to whom it was answered, that
<PB N="207" REF="128"/>
they would treat about that matter. And
the great men retiring out of the Refectory,
the Arch-bishops, Bishops, Abbots, and
Priors, met and treated by themselves.
At length, the Earls and Barons
were asked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dr. omits eng∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng <HI>ex parte eorum,</HI> either not understand∣ing it, or because it <HI>manifestly destroys his Whimsey,</HI> p. 17.</NOTE> if they would unani∣mously
consent to the Resolutions
they had taken, in answering
and making provision for what
had been demanded of them?
Who answered, that without the Common
Vniversity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> universita∣te,</HI> rather the Uni∣versity of the Com∣mons.</NOTE> they would do nothing. Then,
by common Consent, there were elected on

the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln, Winche∣ster,</HI>
and <HI>Worcester.</HI> On behalf of the
Laity, Earl <HI>Richard</HI> the King's Brother,
Earl <HI>Bigod,</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester, Simon

For the Barons, <HI>Richard Montfitchet,</HI>
and <HI>John Baliol,</HI> and the Abbots of <HI>Bury</HI>
and <HI>Ramsey;</HI> that what they twelve should
resolve on, should be recited in Common,
and that no form should be shewn to the

had not the Common Assent of all.</P>
<P>Here is so manifest a Distinction be∣tween

of the <HI>Great Council,</HI> that I dare say, no
<PB N="208" REF="129"/>
man but this Dr. could have united
them into one Order, as he does all the
Laity.</P>
<P>But here 'tis obvious, that when the
Lay Lords, <HI>Earls</HI> and <HI>Barons,</HI> were all
together, and ask'd by the dignify'd
Clergy, then present, whether they
would agree with them? The Lay
Lords answered for themselves, that

from both; and if the Temporal
Lords had concurr'd, here had been
the Consent of the <HI>Common Vniversity</HI>
of Lords, if we may so call it. But be∣sides
the Consent of all the Lords, there
was requir'd the Consent of another
body of men, and these must be the
<HI>Commons,</HI> which might well be of Cler∣gy
and Laity; wherefore, here was <HI>Cle∣rus</HI>
and <HI>Populus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt.</HI> p. 56.</NOTE> and that <HI>such as were
inferiour to Barons, Tenants in</HI> Capite,
<HI>and Noblemen,</HI> that is, to such as now
are acknowledged to be the only No∣bles.</P>
<P>But for a full Proof, both of our

<PB N="209" REF="129"/>
Faculty of answering himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt,</HI> p. 183. <HI>Pat. 8. 9. Joh. n.</HI> 3.</NOTE> as long since

the <HI>Milites,</HI> he yields, that <HI>therefore
they were the King's ordinary Subjects, or o∣ther
Free Tenants, and not Tenants in</HI> Capite.</P>
<P>Thus he stifles his thin Notion with a
<HI>Record,</HI> and yet pretends, by his Chymical
Art, to bring it to Life again, with the Au∣thority
of an Historian; who, though
much to be rely'd on, is surely of less Au∣thority
than a <HI>Record.</HI> Well, but what
says the Historian? Do's he say it was not so
as the Record has it? No, but expresses
himself in general Terms, and tells us, that
there were the <HI>Comites, Barones, Milites,</HI> and
others, <HI>qui ei servitium militare debebant.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps he will smile, at my saying 'tis in

<P>But with his good Leave, he is not clear,
whether 'twas Service because of the King∣dom,
which all men were to perform in
Proportion, even to their personal Estates,
or because of <HI>Tenure.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, he by no means seems to incline
to the last, it being <HI>qui debebant Servitium

<HI>Milites;</HI> but here was another sort of men.
<PB N="210" REF="130"/>
Yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 184.</NOTE> the Dr. very comically tells us, <HI>Here

<P><HI>The place is plain;</HI> yes 'tis very plain, that
the Dr. says so: and as plain, that few men

<P>Pray, Good Sir! Do you know the mean∣ing
of Tenure in <HI>Capite,</HI> by <HI>Knights Service?</HI>
Where lyes the difference between holding
in <HI>Capite</HI> of the King by <HI>Knights Service,</HI> and
<HI>owing the King Military Service,</HI> as Tenant in
<HI>Capite?</HI> If there be no Difference, how comes
it to pass, that one who held in <HI>Capite,</HI> by
<HI>Knights Service,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>ib</HI> p. 39:</NOTE> was no <HI>Knight,</HI> tho <HI>Tenants
in Military Service, in those times, were the on∣ly
Great Freemen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Glos. p. 10.</NOTE> <HI>(as that Service was the on∣ly
free Service)</HI> although <HI>a Bond-man might
hold by free Services, and yet be a Bond-man.</HI></P>
<P>Do not you your self own, that all the
<HI>legalmen</HI> or Jurors that held in <HI>Military Ser∣vice,</HI>
were <HI>Milites,</HI> in referring to <HI>Glanvil,</HI>
where, are some Writs to summon Juries of
<HI>Knights</HI> only, whence you would infer, that
the <HI>Legales homines</HI> mention'd by other
Writs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 40.</NOTE> were all <HI>Knights.</HI> Were they <HI>Bond∣men</HI>
holding in <HI>Military Service,</HI> that were
the <HI>Fideles</HI> at <HI>Council?</HI></P>
<P>But that the <HI>Plebs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. p. 265.</NOTE> <HI>the Ingenuitas Reg∣ni,</HI>

<P>These <HI>alia illa brevia,</HI> he fancies to have

wherefore, as they had the same Writs
with the <HI>Barons,</HI> and were <HI>Barons</HI> before,
being part of the <HI>Baronage</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> 'tis
no more, than that all <HI>Barons</HI> to whom
the King directed his Writs, should come,
and no other <HI>Barons,</HI> but such as he di∣rected
his Writs to, and they who were
<HI>Barons</HI> before, and called by <HI>Barons</HI> Writ,
must, by a strange kind of Metamorpho∣sis,
cease to be such; besides an Altera∣tion
then being made, and the <HI>Commons</HI>
not taken notice of, they must have come
before, otherwise, whence is their Right
at this day? And what other Change
could there have been, but the bringing
in <HI>Representations</HI> instead of <HI>personal Rights,</HI>
and that amongst inferiour <HI>Land Owners,</HI>

<P>But 'twas <HI>nisi forte, unless casually, or

being the times when the <HI>Parliament</HI>

<P>FOR Confirmation of the <HI>Nobility</HI> of

<P>The Design of his Book is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y to

<P>One of his Arguments to prove that

we are to understand, that all the Mem∣bers

that when <HI>Communitas,</HI> or <HI>Fideles</HI> beside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>I Will not say the Dr. has followed

<P><HI>Mr. Speaker,</HI></P>
<P>I Cannot but congratulate our happy
meeting in this Place, where the <HI>Vni∣versity</HI>
will teach <HI>Loyalty</HI> to the most
<HI>Factious,</HI> and dispose them to <HI>swallow</HI>
down that <HI>Remedy,</HI> which, out of a
<PB N="2" REF="139"/>
burning Zeal to bring into the World
something suitable to the <HI>Dignity</HI> of my
<HI>Professor's</HI> place, I am <HI>eager,</HI> and all
<HI>Passion</HI> to communicate. My <HI>Remedy,</HI>
in short, is a <HI>Lenitive</HI> to cure the raging
heats of insolent <HI>Parliaments,</HI> which are
too apt to value themselves upon their
pretended <HI>Antiquity.</HI></P>
<P>Not loving Idleness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter to the Earl of <HI>Shafts∣bury.</HI></NOTE> at vacant times
from study, and Practice in my Profession,
(as a diversion) <HI>I have with great In∣dustry,
and I may say it, some Judg∣ment,
examined</HI> Things done in this Na∣tion
more than a thousand years by past,
with a continuation of them until three or
four hundred years last effluxed.</P>
<P><HI>Though there are several</HI> Lawyers
<HI>here,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt,</HI> p. 29.</NOTE> <HI>yet they have</HI> study'd, and know
onely Popular and Lucrative Law, and not
the Constitutions of the Nation before their
own time. <HI>Concerning</HI> which, <HI>they may
be content to hear my</HI> Reading.</P>
<P>The <HI>Records</HI> which they open, are
of a nature far short of those upon
which I have been poring these sixteen
years:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Par. <HI>set above</HI> Record. <HI>Against Mr.</HI> Petyt, p. 183. No heed to be taken to the old Monks and Historians. <HI>ib. p. 16. in Marg to the same purpose. ib. p.</HI> 43.</NOTE> Nor must they pretend to that
acquaintance which I have with Histo∣rians,
whose Authority, I can, by my

<HI>sagacious Inventions, advance,</HI> or <HI>depress,</HI>
as I see occasion.</P>
<P>Vnder the Saxon Government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 6.</NOTE> the
People were so far from not having their
Votes and shares in these Councils, <HI>as only
they had Uoices in them.</HI></P>
<P>If any more had, <HI>they were the
Priests,</HI> but the Princes, Great Officers,
and Leaders, had no <HI>Voices</HI> at all; for,
if they had, 'twould have spoil'd the
singular <HI>Democracy.</HI></P>
<P>Of the many Councils by Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI> ci∣ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 13.</NOTE>
there is not to be found the word <HI>Po∣pulus,</HI>
in the Title, Preface, or Body of any
of them, except in that spurious one of

<HI>wherein</HI></HI> Plegmund <HI>presided:</HI> Here his
own Author tells us, in few words, the
meaning of the long Title of this Synod,
which just before he had mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI>
That the Bishops, Abbets, Fideles, Proce∣res,

Whence some will infer, that
inferiour</HI> Proprietors <HI>were there as</HI> Nobi∣le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
<HI>but 'tis without</HI> all colour of Reason.</P>

(though it will be objected, I have
<HI>jumpt</HI> over <HI>several</HI> Arguments, and they
<HI>material ones)</HI> concerning <HI>Great Councils</HI>
before the <HI>Conquest.</HI> Upon which, it
follows, that if the <HI>Populus</HI> were ad∣mitted

of the <HI>Conquerour,</HI> who might, at <HI>plea∣sure,</HI>
revoke his <HI>Concessions.</HI> For the

Sir <HI>Edward Coke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ib. p. 30.</NOTE> who, to avoid the

<P>Though some may impertinently ask
me, Whether there were not <HI>Laws</HI> be∣fore

or <HI>divinely</HI> casting <HI>into the hearts of

<P>But that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt,</HI> p. 167.</NOTE> if affirmed, is <HI>a palpable</HI> and

<P>What though that <HI>Clergy-man-Lawyer

<P>William the Conquerour brought in a
New Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt,</HI> p. 29.</NOTE> and imposed it upon the People.
The greatest part of the Antient Law, as it
was brought hither by the Normans, was
exacted and observed <HI>by,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ib. p. 43.</NOTE> <HI>and upon,</HI> only

<P>It's very true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jan. &amp;c.</HI> p. 70.</NOTE> that in our Ancient Par∣liament-Rolls,
the Knights of Shires are
sometimes called <HI>Grantz des Counties,</HI>

they might, for, without doubt, they were
most commonly the greatest Tenants <HI>in Ca∣pite</HI>
under the degree of Barons in each
County.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt;</HI> p. 116. <HI>&amp;</HI> 117.</NOTE> <HI>And, for evidence of this,</HI>

<HI>Barons, Peers</HI> called by the King's
Writ into the Lords House at pleasure, and
omitted at pleasure. <HI>Wherefore, 'tis to
be observed, that the Knight for the
Shires might well be Noble or</HI> Grantz,
<HI>since they were call'd sometimes to sit
in the Lords House; And whether they
that were chose for the Counties, and
did not sit in the Lords House, as</HI> Ba∣rons

yet it was done after, when the King
recovered the <HI>Regality.</HI></P>
<P>I shall come now to the particular
consideration of <HI>Jani Anglorum facies
nova.</HI></P>
<P>The Author of which sufficiently
shews his fantasticalness, in the Title
of his Book, <HI>Jani Anglorum facies no∣va!</HI>
What, because his <HI>Shreds</HI> of <HI>An∣tiquity</HI>
are thought doubtful, by some
taken in one sense, by others in ano∣ther,
do's he therefore make <HI>Janus bi∣frons</HI>
of his Composition? He had as
good call it a <HI>Spread Eagle,</HI> which looks
both wayes too: I am sure it suits
better with my Book, which is an <HI>high
Flyer.</HI></P>
<P>His Allusion to <HI>Selden</HI>'s <HI>Jani Anglo∣rum
facies altera,</HI> will not justifie him,
since that Antiquary was chiefly con∣versant
in <HI>Popular and Lucrative Law.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, the <HI>Title</HI> imports the <HI>Novel∣ty</HI>
of his <HI>Opinion,</HI> though, perhaps, he
would have us believe, that he puts a
<HI>New Face</HI> upon those musty old things,
which have been thought to look with
a different Aspect. Nor can he shrowd
<PB N="18" REF="147"/>
himself under my Title, for mine is
an old <HI>Face,</HI> which has honourable
Scars and Flaws in it, and a <HI>Professor</HI>'s
Aspect; And <HI>they</HI> understand not <HI>Rai∣lery</HI>
and <HI>Figure,</HI> who observe not how
I expose him by the <HI>Allusion.</HI></P>
<P>He will have it, and brings many
Arguments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. Angl. &amp;c. <HI>p.</HI> 22.</NOTE> amongst which, the Judg∣ment
of a whole <HI>Parliament</HI> of that
famous King <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. but that is not <HI>In∣fallible,</HI>
that the <HI>Common Council</HI> of the

onely a Council for <HI>Scutage,</HI> and <HI>Aid</HI>
granted by Tenants in <HI>Capite.</HI> Where∣as
<HI>Aid</HI> sometimes signifies <HI>such</HI> as to be
sure is granted by the greatest <HI>Council,</HI>
and therefore does alwayes.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against</HI> Jani &amp;c. p. 10, 11, 12.</NOTE> Farther,
What need was there to have the <HI>Cause
of Summons declared,</HI> if it were onely
<HI>about Aids and Escuage, or other ordi∣nary
business of course:</HI> though indeed,
whether it was for <HI>Aids,</HI> or <HI>other Bu∣siness,</HI>
might not be known without this
<HI>Declaration.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ib. p. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Lastly, If all</HI> Proprietors <HI>were</HI> Mem∣bers
<HI>of the</HI> Great General Council, 'tis
strange there should not have been the same
care taken that they might be summoned.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="147"/>
Alas! What signifies the <HI>Provision</HI> of
the <HI>Common Law?</HI></P>
<P>But he brings an Argument from the
<HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Chester</HI>'s being a <HI>Count Pala∣tine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jan. &amp;c.</HI> p. 20.</NOTE>
and not subject to the <HI>Feudal
Law;</HI> whereas he was a <HI>feudal Tenant:</HI>
Though,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bracton</HI> lib. 3. ca. 8.</NOTE> I must confess, the old Do∣tard
<HI>Bracton</HI> sayes, <HI>Comites Paleys,</HI>
Counts Palatine, have Regal Jurisdi∣ction,
salvo dominio Domino Regi sicut
<HI>Principi,</HI> saving to the King his Domi∣nion
as Prince, not as Lord of the
<HI>Feud.</HI> Besides, in one of the Quota∣tions
which he brings to prove that
the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Chester</HI> however came to
Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jan. &amp;c.</HI> p. 17.</NOTE> he leaves out <HI>Laici, be∣cause
it manifestly destroys his Whimsey:</HI>
for it shews that all the <HI>Laity</HI> were <HI>Te∣nants</HI>
in <HI>Chief,</HI> in that they, <HI>as a great
Council,</HI> say, that the Tenants in <HI>Chief</HI>
did owe no Service.</P>
<P>But he has another <HI>fantastical</HI> No∣tion,
that this <HI>Council</HI> in King <HI>John</HI>'s

of <HI>ordinary Justice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. <HI>Jan.</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> unless when 'twas

must needs say I take all this to be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
plain that I know not which part
ought to add any light to. Is the diffe∣rence
between <HI>Tallage</HI> and a <HI>Voluntar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

that the Kings Demeasns only were tal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>liated,
and that the City having bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>But perhaps in the two next the <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣scurity</HI>

Art of multiplying faults, they ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="3" REF="154"/>
make <HI>three obscure Paragraphs.</HI></P>
<P>2. This explains that part of the
Charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He adds <HI>such</HI> to Cases, to render it obscure. <HI>Jani,</HI> &amp;c. p. 26.</NOTE> <HI>Simili modo fiat de Civitate
London,</HI> that is as in all Cases besides
those excepted Escuage or Tallage should
not be raised but by a Common-Council
of the Kingdom, that is of all the per∣sons
concerned to pay; so for the City
of <HI>London,</HI> unless the Aid was ordered
in Common-Council, wherein they and
all other Tenants in chief were assembled,
none should be laid upon any Citizens but
by the consent of their own Common-Coun∣cil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Na. So if a sum in gross were laid upon them.</NOTE>
and if the Ordinance were only in
general Terms, that all the Kings De∣measns
should be talliated, the propor∣tions
payable there should be agreed by
the Common-Council of the City.</P>
<P>This consists of two parts; First,
That where there was not the consent
of a <HI>Common-Council</HI> of all the Te∣nents
in chief, the Citizens might of
themselves give a <HI>Tallage,</HI> which is
not in dispute between us, but is with
admirable ingenuity turned into an
assertion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Viz.</HI> To such pay∣ment as T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lage.</NOTE> <HI>that Cities and Burroughs
were not taxed or assessed towards any
payments, but by their own Common-Councils,</HI>
(which is not to be inferred
<PB N="4" REF="155"/>
from the priviledge of one City, sup∣pose
it were so for <HI>London,</HI> nor can be
gathered from my words, which yield
that even <HI>London</HI> might be <HI>Taxt or
Assessed by the consent</HI> of the <HI>Common-Council</HI>
of Tenents) <HI>or that they,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jani,</HI> &amp;c. p. 113.</NOTE> <HI>as
part of the Common-Council of the
Land taxed themselves,</HI> which is true;
but no man of sense can understand that
to be the meaning of this part of the
<HI>Obscure Paragraph,</HI> but that something
farther was intended.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The second I need not explain
since he understands, for all his affected
ignorance,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Indeed he would take in more places.</NOTE> that after a Tax was impos∣ed
upon the City of <HI>London</HI> the Inhabi∣tants
<HI>(or those who composed its
Council)</HI> met to proportion it, so as it
might be paid with as much equality as
could be.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Na. the King did perhaps re∣quire a certain sum after a general Ordinance made by the Council of Tenents for a <HI>Ra∣tionabile auxilium.</HI> Jani, <HI>&amp;c. p.</HI> 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>This he yields to my hand, that <HI>they
always did if they would,</HI> it seems con∣vinced
by that Record, which shews
that when the Council of the City
would not agree to the Sum demanded
by the King, 'twas <HI>de voluntate omnium
Baronum nostrorum Civitatis ejusdem,</HI>
that the King talliated his Tenents <HI>per
se,</HI> or <HI>per Capita,</HI> so much upon every
head.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="155"/>
3. This clears the last <HI>Paragraph</HI>
which I need not recite, it having no
meaning differing from the Record, but
if my Record give not sufficient light
and strength he, I thank him, according
to his usual Curtesie cites one clear
enough.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> p. 115.</NOTE></P>
<P>Et cum praedicti Cives noluissent in∣trare
finem praedict' trium mille marca∣rum
praedicti Thes. &amp; alii voluerint
assidere illud Tal. per Capita.</P>
<P>So that till the Citizens refused the
the Sum in gross, the King did not
Talliate each man in particular.</P>
<P>But I am told that <HI>this is nothing</HI> to
my <HI>purpose,</HI> 'tis strange that he who
blames me in other places for not quot∣ing
more than is <HI>for</HI> my <HI>purpose,</HI> when
nothing behind makes against me,
should now tax me for not skipping
over any part of that Clause which
'twas needful to take and explain entire.</P>
<P>To clear up his understanding if
possible, though I thought to have left
this Task, I will obviate an objection
which such as our Answerer may make,
that 'tis <HI>obscure</HI> how the Record of the
Common-Council of <HI>London</HI>'s concern∣ing
its self about the Charge laid upon
<PB N="6" REF="156"/>
the City should explain that part of
the Charter which sayes <HI>Simili modo
fiat de Civitate London,</HI> but surely pra∣ctice
is a good Interpreter of a Law,
and there is this further evidence that
here is provision for the power of the
<HI>Common-Council</HI> of the City, because
that holding <HI>in Capite,</HI> and being men∣tioned
distinct from all the other Te∣nents
there named in general, it must
be for something else, besides that for
which 'tis joyned with the other Te∣nents.</P>
<P>But <HI>Excedimus tenebris in crepuscu∣lum,</HI>
from this <HI>obscurity</HI> and <HI>darkness</HI>
to be felt by the Doctors <HI>groaping</HI> hand,
we come to broad day light.</P>

fuit per Consilium Regis apud Merton,</HI>
that he should talliate his Demeasns,
though this was after King <HI>John</HI>'s
Charter, which was <HI>intended to restrain
the King from levying publick Taxes with∣out
publick consent;</HI> yet <HI>it seems to
be plain by the Record that the King
by the advice of his Privy Council
taxed the City of</HI> London, even with∣out
the consent of the Common Coun∣cil
of his immediate Tenents, whom
<PB N="7" REF="156"/>
he makes the Common-Council for all
manner of <HI>Aid</HI> and <HI>Escuage.</HI></P>
<P>But it may be said, a Tallage was
no publick Tax, though the Tax here
spoke of, is made no more publick than
the consent required to charge it;
Which consent according to him, was
from immediate Tenents only, so that
<HI>Tallage</HI> might be a <HI>publick Tax</HI> as well
as any other. And to be sure <HI>Scutagium</HI>
concerning the Kings Tenents only,
and the Cases in which the King reserv'd
to himself power of taxing without
publick consent in his sense, relating
only to them; the <HI>Tax</HI> because of <HI>te∣nure</HI>
must be provided for, as well as
other, if any other were there meant
by <HI>Auxilium, vel Scutagium.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, he owns expresly, that <HI>accord∣ing
to the Law in King</HI> John'<HI>s Charter,</HI>
London <HI>and other Cities and Burghs
were to be Assessed and Taxed by the
Common-Council of the Kingdom.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p.</HI> 117. &amp; 118.</NOTE>
And he makes a reason of that provi∣sion,
to be the usage in the time of
<HI>H.</HI> 2. for the King to <HI>Talliate,</HI> or Tax
them without such a Council.</P>
<P>The Doctor has doubtless the most
particular convincing way of reasoning
<PB N="8" REF="157"/>
of any man, he says <HI>that Law in King</HI>
John'<HI>s Charter intended to restrain the
King from levying of publick Taxes
without publick consent:</HI> And <HI>the rea∣son
of this Artice in King</HI> John'<HI>s Char∣ter
is Argument sufficient to prove it:
for,</HI> mark the weighty reason, <HI>H.</HI> the
Third after this was granted, and
<HI>Edw. 1st.</HI> taxed their Demeasns through
<HI>England,</HI> though not the whole King∣dom
by Advice and Consent of their
Privy-Councils only until the <HI>Stat' de
Tallagio non concedendo,</HI> That is (as
<HI>Tallage</HI> is confest to be, a <HI>Publick Tax)</HI>
because some of King <HI>John</HI>'s Successors
Tax't their Demeans without publick
consent. Therefore 'twas provided in
King <HI>John</HI>'s time, by way of Prophesy,
that no publick Tax, Aid, or Escuage
should be raised without publick con∣sent.</P>
<P>So that what was done after, was a
moral cause, or occasion of what pre∣ceded.</P>
<P>'Twill be said, that the thing that
the Doctor went to prove was, that the
Common-Council mentioned in the
Charter was the Great and Common-Council
of the Kingdom, to all intents
<PB N="9" REF="157"/>
and purposes. Not that the King was
restrained from levying a publick Tax
without the consent of the <HI>Great Coun∣cil.</HI>
But surely when he goes to give
the reason why the Charter must be
taken in such a sense, we are to expect
the proof of that, not of something
else, quitting the thing to be proved.</P>
<P>If I can understand his dark mean∣ing,
he was proving that <HI>Nullum Scu∣tagium,
&amp;c.</HI> intended to restrain the
King from levying publick Taxes with∣out
publick Consent. That is (to ex∣plain
what he very obscurely drives at,)
the restraint was only from Taxing the
whole Kingdom; not from Taxing his
Tenants in <HI>Chief.</HI> And the reason of
this Article,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 118.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> as taken in this sense,
is, that several times after this Charter
was granted, <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. and <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. Taxed
their Demeasns through <HI>England,</HI>
though not the whole Kingdom, by
Advice and Consent of their Privy-Councils
only, until the Statute <HI>De
tallagio non concedendo</HI> was made 34 <HI>E.
1.</HI> And both <HI>Richard</HI> the First and King
<HI>John</HI> had Taxed the whole Kingdom
without common Assent, before the
grant of <HI>Magna Charta.</HI> And when
<PB N="10" REF="158"/>
he has made good the Premises in this
Argument for the meaning of the Ar∣ticle,
which will be <HI>ad graecas Calendas,</HI>
then, he may conclude that this Article
intended to restrain the King;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Na. he should have ad∣ded <HI>only.</HI> Nullum Scutagi∣um, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> only
from levying of publick Taxes with∣out
publick Consent, not to provide
about <HI>Escuage,</HI> or <HI>Tallage,</HI> which none
but his immediate Tenants were liable
to. And from hence when prov'd, we
might with some more colour and co∣herence
raise the Consequence that the
Common-Council <HI>mentioned</HI> in King
<HI>John</HI>'s Charter was the Great and Com∣mon-Council
of the Kingdom to all in∣tents
and purposes. But how that
should appear from the mention of <HI>Aid,</HI>
and <HI>Escuage</HI> only, will be a Question.</P>
<P>'<HI>Tis by him observ'd of</HI> Richard <HI>the
First,</HI> Accepit de unaquâque carucatâ
terrae totius Angliae sex solidos.</P>
<P>But what proof is there from the
word <HI>accepit,</HI> or the collecting of a
Tax, <HI>ex praecepto Regis,</HI> that he took
it without publick consent?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bracton</HI> Lib. 1. cap. 16.</NOTE> I am sure
<HI>Bracton,</HI> as good an Author as the Hi∣storian
whom he Vouches, tells us <HI>Car∣vage,</HI>
and such this was, could never be
raised but <HI>Consensu communi totius regni.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="158"/>
But if the King in his Privy-Council
might Tax the Kingdom its self, till
the making King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter, and
was restrain'd then, I wonder our Re∣verend
Author has made the Consti∣tution
of the House of Lords, that is
according to him, the whole great
Council, to have been no earlier than
the <HI>49th.</HI> of <HI>H.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>And unless such a Council as is men∣tioned
in that Charter were Consti∣tuted
before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nay some∣times he Argues that it was not before, <HI>p.</HI> 56.</NOTE> how comes it to pass that
the <HI>Clerus</HI> and <HI>Populus,</HI> which were of
the Kings Council for making Laws,
and giving Taxes, were not till 17. <HI>Jo.</HI>
confin'd to such of them as were of the
Privy-Council, as well as <HI>Communitas

such people as were <HI>Magnates,</HI> and <HI>Mi∣lites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 110.</NOTE>
<HI>&amp; liberè tenentes,</HI> besides Barons,
were the Tenents in <HI>Capite,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">112.</NOTE> who by
their Acts oblig'd all that held of them
by Knights Service:<NOTE PLACE="marg">113.</NOTE> that is all the <HI>Mi∣lites,</HI>
but not the <HI>liberè tenentes.</HI></P>
<P>We are taught that in the 6 of King
<HI>John</HI> Tenents in <HI>Capite</HI> only,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jani,</HI> &amp;c. p. 125, 126, 127.</NOTE> provided
that every nine Knights should find a
tenth for the defence of the Kingdom,
and that they who were to find them
<PB N="12" REF="159"/>
were all Tenents in Military Service.
Though the Record shews, that be∣sides
the <HI>Miles vel Serviens, Alius
terram tenens</HI> was Charged with this.
And he vouchsafes not to take notice of
my Argument, that every Knight be∣ing
bound by his tenure to find a man;
if this had not extended to all that
had to the value of a Knights Fee,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jani,</HI> &amp;c. p. 225.</NOTE>
though not held by Knights Service, it
would have been an abatement of the
Services due, and a weakning of the
Kingdom.</P>
<P>Besides, admit that Tenents in <HI>Ca∣pite</HI>
only laid this Charge, and only
Tenents by Knights Service were bound
by it, here is such a <HI>Commune Con∣cilium</HI>
of Tenents, as I say King <HI>John</HI>'s
Charter Exhibits, and no Charge laid
by them upon others. Whereas he
should have prov'd that they did oblige
others without their consent.</P>
<P>But suppose Tenents only were
Charged, why might not the Charge
have been laid by <HI>Omnes fideles</HI> in my
sense, as we find <HI>Omnes de Regno,</HI> taxing
Knights Fees only?</P>
<P><HI>The Doctor in his Margin gives us
an admirable nota,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 119.</NOTE> <HI>that</HI> Liberi <HI>were</HI>

Tenants in Military Service, or Gentle∣men,
<HI>Rustici</HI> Socagers, possessors or

as much as to say that Freeholders
were not Freemen, unless they held in</HI>

or Possession neither added to,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Glos.</HI> p. 10.</NOTE> or detracted
from the person of any man, if free or
bond <HI>before.</HI></P>
<P>But surely Mr. Professor has some
colourable proof for his remark here:
For that let others judge.</P>
<P><HI>Hoveden</HI> acquaints us with the man∣ner
of collecting a Carvage <HI>in the ninth
of</HI> Richard <HI>the First,</HI> which was, that in
every County the King appointed one
Clergyman, and one Knight, who
with the Sheriff of the County to
which they were sent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Galls M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lites.</NOTE> and lawful
Knights chose, and sworn to execute
this business faithfully, <HI>Fecerunt venire

how many Plough Lands there were in

<P><PB N="14" REF="160"/>
If here <HI>liberi,</HI> and <HI>rustici</HI> are not
meant for two denominations of the
same sort of men, that is ordinary Free∣holders,
I will leave him to fight it out
with <HI>Hoveden,</HI> since he himself is di∣rectly
contrary to the <HI>old Mun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; Ho∣veden</HI>
shews us that these Socagers were
<HI>legales homines,</HI> such as <HI>chose Juries,
and serv'd on Juries themselves,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt, p.</HI> 36.</NOTE> &amp;c.
but our <HI>new light</HI> is positive that <HI>Tenants

<P>I had affirmed for one reason why
the Doctor could have <HI>small</HI> assistance
from <HI>Domesday Book,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 78.</NOTE> that the Titles
whereby men enjoy'd their Estates are
seldom mentioned there. And if I
find by Record a whole County in the
Doctors sense, that is all the Lands of

will he say in justification of his <HI>whymsies</HI>
upon the Conquest, and the authority
he would fetch for it from <HI>Domesday

<P>This was a Judgment upon solemn
Debate and Tryal, and it cannot be
believed but the Judges, and Kings
Council so many hundred years ago,
knew as much of the right of the Con∣quest
<PB N="19" REF="162"/>
as our Doctor can discover. 'Twill
be said notwithstanding this Record,
that <HI>Hugh</HI> had the Confirmation of
his <HI>Kinsman</HI> the Conqueror.</P>
<P>Admit he had, he being his Kinsman
would either thereby wheedle others
in to the like acknowledgment of <HI>Wil∣liams</HI>
power; Or else having the Go∣vernment
of the County, would do this
in complement to the supream Gover∣nour.</P>
<P>But that such Confirmation as to the
Lands he had there, and all appendants
or appurtenances to them was wholly
neeedless, appears in that the Title is
laid only in descent, nor does it in the
least appear that <HI>William</HI> either granted
or confirm'd more than the <HI>Comitatus,</HI>
Government, or Jurisdiction of it, or
that more than that was held by the
Sword, which the Doctor makes <HI>Te∣nure

when they agreed to it, which was no

<P>The Doctor refers us to <HI>p.</HI> 106. and

<HI>Petyt,</HI> to see <HI>what this Assembly was,
and of whom it consisted;</HI> where he
<PB N="21" REF="163"/>
proves my Assertion, being all that he
there shews is, that there was not time
for <HI>Writs to issue</HI> to chuse any <HI>Repre∣sentatives</HI>
of the Commons, but not a
word offer'd against their being there
in their own Persons, having been got
together expecting the Kings Answer

was so numerous, that they made a

of the Charter shews that Tenents by

<P>Besides this, the frequent meetings
in so wide a place as <HI>Runenede</HI> call'd

such as held of Subjects by <HI>Knights ser∣vice</HI>
I see no reason, but wait for the

<P>Besides the Doctor yields that more
than such as are expresly mention'd in
the contested Clause, Tenents <HI>in Mili∣tary
service</HI> of King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter, <HI>viz.</HI>
of Tenents in <HI>Capite</HI> were <HI>Members</HI> of
the Great Councils, (which he does
not always confine to the great Te∣nents)
and some of these were as in∣considerable,
and as unfit for Counsel∣lors
as the generality of the <HI>libere Te∣nentes;</HI>
for though he in his sixteen
years search,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt, p.</HI> 41.</NOTE> could find no less a <HI>part
of a Knights Fee,</HI> than a <HI>twentieth,</HI> yet
in the last recited Record he may meet
with the <HI>sixtieth</HI> part of one <HI>Knights
Fee</HI> in the Mannor of <HI>Norton.</HI></P>
<P>5. Being all that were <HI>Members</HI> of
the <HI>Great Councils</HI> in those times of
which our dispute is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jani, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 32. 35, 36. 40. 57. 62, 63, 64. 66. 185. 219.</NOTE> were <HI>Nobles,</HI> in
which the Doctor and I agree, and the
<PB N="26" REF="166"/>
<HI>Nobles</HI> came in their own Persons▪ the
libere Tenentes, <HI>part of the Nobility</HI>
were personally present.</P>
<P>Indeed Corporations holding <HI>in Ca∣pite</HI>
might well come by Representa∣tion,
being they were but as one <HI>Noble,</HI>
and one Tenent, and would have been
an unweildy body to move to Council
united as their interest was.</P>
<P>(6.) King <HI>John</HI>'s Resignation was
void, because 'twas without the con∣sent
of the Commons, <HI>Sanz leur assent,</HI>
and to say that this is <HI>without the assent
of a general Council,</HI> Colloquium, <HI>or</HI>
Parliament, <HI>in those times when it was
done;</HI> unless he yield the same sort or
degree of men to have been <HI>Members</HI>
of the Great Councils formerly as then,
does not take in the full meaning, but
is to say nothing, being the Commons
manifestly assert their right, as when
they declared that they had <HI>ever been
a Member of Parliament,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt, p.</HI> 133.</NOTE> <HI>and as well
Assenters as Petitioners.</HI> And what
force does it bring to the Doctors Asser∣tion,
that the Commons answer <HI>in the
same form of Speech conceiv'd by the Ba∣rons?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ib. p. 140.</NOTE> Which he thinks worthy of great
Letters, is that an Argument that the
<PB N="27" REF="166"/>
<HI>Commons</HI> did not think that they ought
to have been parties? He himself grants
that King <HI>John</HI> resigned before them
that came upon a <HI>Military Summons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jani,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>p.</HI> 22, 23, 24.</NOTE>
that is (as all who ought to come were
concluded by them that came) before
all his Barons; wherefore nothing
wanted to the Confirmation, but the
Consent of the <HI>Commons.</HI></P>
<P>And if the Commons were then an
essential part of the Great Council they
might come in Person, unless the change
in 49 <HI>H.</HI> 3. can be shewn to have been
any otherwise than in the bringing in
a Representation of them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> the 12th. head.</NOTE></P>
<P>(7.) By the Charter of <HI>H.</HI> 1. for the
King's <HI>dominica necessaria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jani, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 34.</NOTE> or <HI>de arduis
Regni,</HI> all the Counties and Hundreds,
that is the <HI>Freeholders,</HI> the Suitors at
those Courts were to be summon'd to
the <HI>Great Council,</HI> as it had been in the
time of the Confessor, when there re∣paired
to the <HI>Great Folcmote,</HI> or <HI>General
Council</HI> held once a year, all the Peers,
Knights, and Freemen, at least <HI>Free∣holders</HI>
of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>(8.) For demonstration that <HI>libere
tenentes</HI> came to the Great Councils
in their own Persons, and as Members;
<PB N="28" REF="167"/>
King <HI>John</HI> before the passing of his
Charter, writes to the <HI>Milites, &amp; Fi∣deles,</HI>
(the last of which takes in all the
<HI>libere tenentes)</HI> and tells them that <HI>if
it might have been done he would have
sent Letters to every one of them;</HI> where∣fore
these Members whose right is here
acknowledged were single, individual
persons; for they could not have been
summoned to come by Representation
in the case of such particular Writs, or
Letters, unless the Representation were
setled before the Summons, which is
not to be supposed. These Arguments
all but the last, which the Doctor has
supplied me with, arise out of my for∣mer
Treatise, and I take it that this
which the Doctor has occasioned, will
yield a few more without pressing.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V.</HI> Domes∣day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Besides (according to the terms first agreed on) he received the Confes∣sors Laws about this Folcmote. Confutati∣on, p. 33.</NOTE></P>
<P>(9.) Since <HI>William</HI> the First was no
Conqueror, it follows that the <HI>Great
Folcmote,</HI> or <HI>General Council</HI> in the <HI>Saxon</HI>
times, where to be sure all Proprietors
of Land were to be <HI>Members,</HI> could not
have been turn'd into an Assembly of
the Kings Tenents upon the old legal
Title, (and without a Conquest there
was no other.)</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="167"/>
And as there must have been a vast
number of the Proprietors whom the
Kings immediate Tenents could not
oblige; so they must have been <HI>Mem∣bers</HI>
of those <HI>Councils</HI> which laid any
general Charge, and that with the same
priviledges the Tenents <HI>in Capite,</HI> who
came in Person▪ had.</P>
<P>(10.) Though demonstration it self
will not satisfie unreasonable men, yet
not to mention more I shall urge the
Authority of the Legier Book of <HI>Ely</HI>
before cited,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jani, p. 41.</NOTE> (the great Antiquity of
the hand writing of which is beyond
all exception) to persuade the Doctor
that my Notion is far from being <HI>preca∣rious;</HI>
Since that <HI>M. S.</HI> shews that King
<HI>Stephen</HI> consulted about the State of
the Kingdom, not only with the Bi∣shops,
Abbots, Monks, and inferior
Clergy, but with the <HI>Plebs,</HI> and they
in an <HI>infinite number, Concilio adunato
Cleri &amp; populi, Episcoporum, atque Ab∣batum,
Monachorum, &amp; Clericorum,</HI>
Plebisque infinitae multitudinis, <HI>&amp;c. de
statu Regni cum illis tractavit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This single instance is sufficient to
prove</HI> that the <HI>Primates,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against</HI> Jani, p. 62.</NOTE> <HI>Primores, Pro∣ceres,
Magnates,</HI> and <HI>Nobiles,</HI> were not
<PB N="30" REF="168"/>
<HI>the Constituent parts of Great Councils
in the Reigns of</HI> W. <HI>the 1st.</HI> H. <HI>1st. King</HI>
Stephen, H. 2. R. <HI>1st.</HI> according to his
restrictive and limited understanding
and exposition of these words and phra∣ses;
<HI>but that the</HI> CLERUS <HI>and</HI> PO∣PULUS
(the general words which of∣ten
comprehend all the Members) sig∣nifie
as well as Great Men, the <HI>Com∣mon
Freeholders, as at this day; nor
need I examine his Book any farther▪</HI>
but I hope the Doctor, a man of that
known integrity, as his excellent Book
expresses him to be, will now make
good his promise to <HI>be</HI> of my <HI>opinion,</HI>
when I should <HI>evince</HI> that <HI>Common Free∣holders</HI>
had this great priviledge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 62.</NOTE></P>
<P>(11.) The Lords right of answer∣ing
for their Tenents being founded in
the imaginary <HI>feudal right,</HI> which is
made to extend only to Tenents by
<HI>Knights Service,</HI> the <HI>Socagers,</HI> being
free from that Law, could not be charg∣ed
without their own consent, and that
given by word of their own mouths,
if they pleased.</P>
<P>(12.) The Authority cited by Mr.
<HI>Cambden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jani,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>p.</HI> 248.</NOTE> and approved of by our Au∣thor
as well as by me, shews that the

only change in the <HI>Great Council</HI> was
in leaving out of the special Summons
what <HI>Earls and Barons</HI> the King <HI>pleased,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against Mr.</HI> Petyt, p. 226. ib. p. 228. Confutati∣on, p.</NOTE>

<P>(13.) I could bring many Argu∣ments
from the Doctor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt, p.</HI> 183. &amp; 192.</NOTE> as, besides o∣thers,
that the <HI>Vniversitas Militiae,</HI> or

<P><PB N="32" REF="169"/>
(14.) And possibly then amongst
his other <HI>marvellous discoveries,</HI> I may
have time to animadvert a little more
largely upon his fancy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jani,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>p.</HI> 34.</NOTE> that <HI>the Suitors

<P>Though not relating to the founda∣tion
of my Essay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt, p.</HI> 43.</NOTE> according to him
who makes the Question about the Con∣quest
<PB N="33" REF="169"/>
not directly to <HI>reach the Contro∣uersy
between us,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against</HI> Jani, p. 15.</NOTE> I may make a little
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>port with his Arguing that <HI>William</HI> 1st.
gave whole Counties to his Followers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt, p.</HI> 29.</NOTE>

and yet that besides <HI>whole Counties,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Glos. p. 8.</NOTE>
he gave a great proportion of Lands

<P>But since he taxes what I lay for the

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et's see a little whether he does not
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ender his own so, where it opposes
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine. His whole Book in that respect
resolves its self into these three Heads;</P>
<P>1. That King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter in affir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance
of the Law imposed by <HI>William,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r in force before, declares that the Te∣nents

<P>2. That from thence to the 49 <HI>H.</HI> 3.

<P><PB N="34" REF="170"/>
3. That none but Tenents <HI>in Capite</HI>
were <HI>Nobles.</HI></P>
<P>(1.) If he himself yields that ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter there was no such
Council as one made up only of Tenent
<HI>in Capite,</HI> he thereby renders all unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
this head <HI>precarious,</HI> but this he does i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
two places at least. One where h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
urges that if the <HI>Curia Regis Ordinaria</HI>
which I say was the Court of the King
Tenents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <HI>Jani, p.</HI> 46. &amp; 47.</NOTE> and Officers exclusive of o∣thers,
<HI>went off by reason of the Clause</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
King <HI>John</HI>'s Charter, <HI>it certainly wen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
off before it began,</HI> that is, such a Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
began not before; and agreeable to this
he says, that <HI>after the granting of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Charter by King</HI> John <HI>there were man
General, and Great Councils, or</HI> Collo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quiums

the form there prescribed:</HI> that is, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
he will have it, after that the Tenent

<HI>Great Council,</HI> but not before, for the
<HI>began</HI> this <HI>form.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In another place (though he charge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
upon me what are his own words) h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
says</HI> King <HI>John</HI> resigned his Crown the 15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">ib. p. 22. <HI>&amp;</HI> 23.</NOTE>

of <HI>May</HI> in the 14th. of his Reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thus <HI>p. 48. &amp;</HI> 49. he charges Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI> and me for averring that even Servants who are not in a legal sense people of the King∣dom were Members of the Great Council.</NOTE> and
he granted the great Charter of the Li∣berties
three years after on the 15. of
<HI>June</HI> in the 17. of his Reign, and there∣fore
could not resign it in such a Council
as was Constituted three years after his
Resignation. <HI>And 'tis a question whe∣ther
he asserts not this in a third place,
where he affirms that before this Char∣ter</HI>
the Kingdom had been Taxt by our
ancient Kings, and their Privy-Council
only.</P>
<P>(2.) But in truth he not only yields
that the Tenents in <HI>Chief</HI> were first
made the <HI>General Council</HI> by King <HI>John</HI>'s
Charter;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>My words are</HI> in such a Council as this here.</NOTE> but that after that, more than
such were Members,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jani, p. 15. which is as much as to say that there was <HI>such a Council as this</HI> before, p. 118.</NOTE> not only the Te∣nents
in <HI>Military Service,</HI> of Tenents
in Chief, but other <HI>ordinary Freehol∣ders.</HI>
So that he submits himself to be
goard by both the horns of that <HI>Dilem∣ma</HI>
inforc't in my former Treatise, <HI>viz.</HI>
that King <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Charter was either de∣clarative
of the Law as 'twas before,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against</HI> Jani, p. 66. Jani, p. 236.</NOTE> <HI>or
introductive of a new Law.</HI> And yields
the <HI>precariousness</HI> of his own <HI>vagaries.</HI></P>
<P>(3.) But does he not own that the
<PB N="36" REF="171"/>
Notion that Tenents <HI>in Capite</HI> only
were <HI>Noble,</HI> is <HI>precarious?</HI> Since he
yields that no kind of tenure does no∣bilitate,
or so much as make a man
free who was not so before <HI>according to
his Blood or Extraction.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Glos. p. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>Though, according to this, one
that held of the King in Chief might
have been a Subjects Villain, yet none
that held a certain Estate of <HI>Freehold</HI>
could be a Villain, because 'tis contrary
to the nature of a <HI>Freehold,</HI> that it
should be so no longer than another
pleas'd, that is only an Estate at will.</P>
<P>He will have it that Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI> is
guilty of some horrible <HI>Design,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt, p.</HI> 1.</NOTE> from
the effects of which it seems this mighty
Champion is <HI>to rescue</HI> the Government.</P>
<P>And for me I am a Seducer, one who
would <HI>seduce unwary Readers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Against</HI> Jani, p. 71.</NOTE> a mali∣cious
insinuation, as if I would wheedle
to my side a party against Truth and
the Government; but whether he who
would set aside the evidences for the
Rights of the <HI>Lords,</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> or
they who produce them fair, and would
<PB N="37" REF="171"/>
render them unquestioned, is guilty of
the worst <HI>design,</HI> the World will judge;
and I doubt not, but he has at home a
thousand Witnesses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conscien∣tia mill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> testes.</NOTE> who, if he will
hear their unbyast Testimonies, will

<P>But I must confess they are so weak
that <HI>these sacred things</HI> need very little

their Enemies are so far from agreeing
amongst themselves, that 'tis more easie
to conquer than to reconcile them.</P>
<P>As on Mr. <HI>Petyts,</HI> and my side, the
<HI>design</HI> can be no other, than to shew
how deeply rooted the Parliamentary
Rights are; So the Doctors in oppo∣sition
to ours, must be to shew the con∣trary,
(a <HI>design</HI> worthy of a Member

whether he yields these Rights to be
more than <HI>precarious.</HI></P>
<P>For according to him the Tenents <HI>in

others were after, 'twas by Usurping

Consilia,</HI> taken in a sense totally diffe∣rent
<PB N="40" REF="173"/>
from the <HI>Generalia Concilia,</HI> or
<HI>Parliaments,</HI> and all this appears above
the power and subtilty of our learned
Doctors Evasions, in that the Record
cited by himself in the 26 <HI>E.</HI> 3. calls
the Assembly they are Summon'd to,
<HI>Concilium</HI> only, and an Act of Parlia∣ment
in the twenty eight of that King
calls what was done in the twenty seven
<HI>Ordinances,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">28 E. 3. c. 13.</NOTE> and that meeting <HI>a Great
Council, Magnum Concilium;</HI> but such
a Council it was, and its Resolutions
such meer <HI>Ordinances</HI> (the distinction
of which from Acts is well known)
that that very next Parliament finds it
needful to confirm, and give them the
force of a Law. Agreeably to this the
Earl Marshal in that grand Case in the
3 <HI>H.</HI> 6. pleads, that though a deter∣mination
<HI>hadde be made against the said
Earl Marshall in great Council,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Par. 3. H. 6. n. 12.</NOTE> <HI>though
he hadde be of full age, that might not
disherit him without Authority of Par∣liament,</HI>
these are uncontrollable evi∣dences,
and proofs against him, let him
to save the great Credit of his Learning
answer them if he can.</P>
<P>But who is the <HI>new Government-Ma∣ker,
<PB N="41" REF="173"/>
and new Parliament-Maker,</HI> per∣haps
one might know from himself
when he has considered a little better,
and then he may think the <HI>Government,</HI>
as 'tis now establisht, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighly concern'd
in his Errors.</P>
<P>Perhaps 'twill be said I injure this
<HI>good man</HI> in imputing to him a <HI>design</HI>
in relation to the present Government;
Since he owns that the <HI>most excellent
great Council,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Mr. <HI>Petyt. p.</HI> 229.</NOTE> (and goes to prove it
<HI>evidently</HI> from Records) received <HI>its
perfection from the Kings Authority, and
time.</HI> But 'tis obvious that <HI>its Per∣fection,</HI>
must be meant of such <HI>its Per∣fection,</HI>
as his Book allows, and he
would make <HI>evident,</HI> but what is that?
That Lords should, to the time of his
<HI>excellent discoveries,</HI> be Summon'd to
Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ib. p. 227. <HI>&amp;</HI> 228.</NOTE> or past by, at the Kings
pleasure, and that if the King pleas'd,
he might Summon <HI>one Knight for a
County,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ib. p. 249.</NOTE> <HI>one Citizen for a City, one Bur∣gess
for a Burgh, and those nam'd to
the Sheriff.</HI></P>
<P>And this <HI>design</HI> will be very <HI>evident</HI>
if we observe his <HI>aery ambuscade,</HI> to
<PB N="42" REF="174"/>
return his own phrase, and meer juggle
in joyning <HI>the Kings Authority and
time</HI> together; we think we have some∣thing,
but by an Hocus Pocus Trick
'tis gone; for admit that <HI>its Perfection</HI>
were such as we say it has at this day,
<HI>viz.</HI> for Lords to come of Right in
their own Persons, and that the Com∣mons
should send Representatives of
their free Choice. Yet let us see what
setlement he gives this <HI>Great Council,</HI>
for which purpose we must divide the
two Authorities, which sometimes may
differ.</P>
<P>And (1.) Suppose that though time
would preserve that power which the
<HI>Great Council</HI> exercises, a King would
hereafter take it all to himself, and
make Laws by a Council of his own
chusing, or without any. If the Do∣ctor
allows this power, doubtless the
next Parliament will thank him.</P>
<P>(2.) Suppose that without, or a∣gainst
the Kings Authority, <HI>time</HI> only
would establish this Great Council, can
this be done? He that affirms it surely
<PB N="43" REF="174" MS="y"/>
will be no great friend to Prerogative,
nor understands he that Maxim,</P>
<Q><L>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi.</L></Q>
<P>And one of these must be clos'd with.</P>
<P>'Twill be objected that I am as inju∣rious
to Prerogative in arguing that
some Lords may have a Right of Pre∣scription
to come to the Upper-House.</P>
<P>But I think no sober man will deny
that there is a right either from Writs
alone, or from Writs as prescribed to,
and 'tis strange that it should not be
against Prerogative to urge a right from
one Royal Concession, and yet it should
be to urge it from many; but farther,
if they who had no right to come in
Person, or be Represented in Parliament,
should by colour of Prescription put
themselves upon the King for Counsel∣lors,
this were derogatory to the Pre∣rogative.
But if there be a natural right
for <HI>Proprietors</HI> of Land (with whom
some say is the ballance of power with∣in
this Nation) to be interested in the
Legislature, which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not affirm.
<PB N="44" REF="175"/>
Or if there be such a positive right, not
only from the Laws for frequent Parlia∣ments,
which suppose such to be <HI>Mem∣bers</HI>
as had been, but more particularly
from the Law received in the <HI>4th.</HI> of
<HI>William</HI> the First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rex debet omnia rite facere in Regno &amp; per judi∣cium pro∣cerum Re∣gni.</NOTE> and by positive Law
or Custom the King us'd to send special
Writs for some, general for others;
the Prescribing to special Writs, which
is not of Substance as to the Legislative
Interest, is no diminution of Preroga∣tive;
because no more in effect is out
of the King than was before, which is,
that this man should one way or other
have a share in the Legislature.</P>
<P>If this Solution of mine will not pass
I cannot help it, I am sure the Law for
a right grounded upon one or more Spe∣cial
Writs of Summons, stands fast,
though the reason of it should be above
my reach.</P>
<P>Having run through a Book so ill-natur'd
to the Government, and so im∣potent
in its setled anger, as that which
some may think to have no other design,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Above all <HI>vid.</HI> Title page <HI>Against Mr.</HI> Petyt, <HI>&amp;</HI> p. 81.</NOTE>
than that of exposing Mr. <HI>Petyt</HI> and
me, the one for <HI>Artifice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nhandsom
dealing with, and false application of
<PB N="45" REF="175"/>
Records, &amp;c.</HI> the other amongst other
things, for <HI>Ignorance, Confidence, and
Cheating his Readers;</HI> I may hope not∣withstanding
the disparity of years,
and the dignity of his place, to be very
excusable in using our Answerer with
no more respect.</P>
<P>When a man renders himself cheap
by his folly, and yet meers with many
so weak that they are discipled by him,
to notions of dangerous and pernicious
consequence to the State.</P>
<Q><L>—Ridentem dicere verum,</L>
<L>Quis vetat?—</L></Q>
<P>In summing up <HI>the Product of his ma∣ny
years labours,</HI> which my Preface
charges him with, perhaps it may be
thought that I omitted one conside∣rable
Head; however I leave to others
if they think fit to add for a seventh.</P>
<P>That both Lords, and Commons may
be depriv'd of all Shares, or Votes in
making of Laws for the Government of
the Kingdom, when ever any future King
shall please to resume the Regality.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="176" MS="y"/>
<HI>Some perhaps may add an eighth;</HI>
That the Parliaments are nothing but
<HI>Magna Concilia,</HI> such as are called only
to Advise upon what shall be given in
direction, but no consent of theirs re∣quired
to make the Kings determination
a binding Law.</P>
<P><HI>And</HI> Vice Versâ, <HI>every</HI> Great Council,
such as that call'd to <HI>York,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 1640.</NOTE> <HI>is a</HI> Parlia∣ment.</P>
