that he did in no maner of case

haue alledged this most worthy
prince kyng Alexāder, &amp; his excel¦lent

the great truste in the one, &amp; the
fidelitie in the other, not forget∣ting
the shameles condicions of

vnto the disciples of Philippe,
whose venemous stynges can
not hurte them, which euer haue
in store the precious Iewel of pa¦cience,
and arme them selues to
do good to euerye good man, for
the preseruation of their lyues,
by the trewe rules of the gouer∣ment
of health, whiche here I
am so bold to present vnto your
worship. For where as there lac¦keth
gouernement in a common
wealth, the people dooe eftsones
fall into ruyne. The shippes that
lacketh good gouernaunce, oftē∣times
be cast awaie vpon sandes
and rockes. And therefore there
is nothinge vnder heauen, that
hath lyfe, but if it lacke good go∣uernemēt
it wil quickly fal into
vtter decaie. For like as the crea∣ture
of all thinges, haue formed
the bodies of al mē into the good∣liest
<PB REF="4"/>
shapes of euery liuing thing
that euer was, or euer shalbe:
Euē so he hath ordeined for mā:
herbes, frutes, rootes, seedes,
plantes, gūmes, oyles, precious
stones, beasts, foules, fishes, for
the preseruation of health, to be
moderatly vsed with discretion,
whiche preserueth the bodye in
good estate, without whose ver∣tues
the bodies can not lyue, for
they be the noryshers of life. But
misusing or abusing them, brin∣geth
to the body many diseases,
as rumes, catores, dropsies, im∣postumes,
gowtes, flixes, opela∣tions,
vertigos, blyndnes, rup∣tures,
fransies, with many moo¦noysome
diseases, which cometh
thorowe the corruptiō of meates
and ill aire. For what auaileth
ryches, honoures, costly buyl∣dinges,
faire apparell, with all
<PB REF="5"/>
the pompe of this worlde, and to
be honoured of the people, and in
the meane time to be eaten with
wormes in the breaste or in the
belly, consumed with agues, tur¦mented
with gowtes, sorenes,
boneache. &amp;c. Well I thinke, an
hole <HI>Codrus</HI> is better than a sicke
<HI>Mydas.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Codrus. Midas.</NOTE> And seing that to possesse
health is better then to gouerne
golde, in so much that health ma∣keth
men more happier, stronger
and quieter then all maner of ri∣ches,
lacking health: as exāple.
Great princes, noble mē, men of
great substaunce, when they bee
wrapped &amp; enclosed with many &amp;
sundry sickenesses, and in dailye
daungers of death, in their ex∣treme
paynes and passions, they
do more greatly coueit one drope
of health then a whole tunne of
gold, criyng out for the helpe and

counseile of the phisicion. Whom
<HI>Iesus Sirack,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 38.</NOTE> in his godlie boke did
counsell allwyse men to honour,
and whome the almghtie God,
did create and ordeine for the in∣firmitie

greatly differ from the bloude of

fleames, whiche in dede be vnna∣turall,

surphets, coldnes or idel∣nes,

coller, whiche is yellowe, whose
place in the body is y<SUP>e</SUP> gall, which
commeth of the clensing or pury∣fying

behoueth thē that cutteth a dead

the nutramentall members, as

as the harte with y<SUP>e</SUP> artiries, the
thirde is the animall members,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Example.</NOTE>
as the head, braines, &amp; sinewes.
The fourth &amp; last, be exeremētes
of the bodye, as armes, legges,
skyn, heere. &amp;c. Of these sayd mē∣bers,
with the boones, is all the
body compounded. And like as
euery tree and herbe, haue their

fantasie, memory. &amp;c. And
these animall vertues, be placed
as it were heauenly aboue al the

heauenly influences, downe vn∣to
the hart, as to a prince, or chefe

geueth lyfe to euery part therof.
Thou shalt cōsider, that the hart

be noble sences geuē to the body,

foure principall vertues. First
Attractiue, the second Retētiue,
