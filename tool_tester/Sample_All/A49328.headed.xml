</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DIANA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Our parents</L>
<L>Approv'd our love, and the day for our marriage</L>
<L>Already was appointed, when <HI>Nearehus,</HI></L>
<L>Provoked by an infamous desire,</L>
<L>Came to solicit me unlawfully</L>
<L>In favour of his flame; this favourite</L>
<L>Unto the King after a passion painted,</L>
<L>And coloured with sighs, called his presents</L>
<L>To the assistance of his faith; but this</L>
<L>Proving effectless, he resolv'd my ruin;</L>
<L>He came with open force to satisfy</L>
<L>His beastly and unruly appetite;</L>
<L>And to that end would carry me away.</L>
<L>My Mother having notice at that instant</L>
<L>Of his design, made me to take a drink,</L>
<L>To frustrate it, and then, her subt'le policy</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="65"/>Spread through the Town the rumour of my death:</L>
<L>Indeed the vertue of this drink procur'd me</L>
<L>So long a sleep, that it appear'd to be</L>
<L>The sleep of death; <HI>Nearchus</HI> terrified</L>
<L>With this sad news, came to behold it painted</L>
<L>Upon my face; remorse of conscience</L>
<L>Within his heart then, quarrel'd with his love:</L>
<L>His sad despair arm'd him to kill himself:</L>
<L>But whilst his soul was troubled herewith,</L>
<L>I was conveyed secretly into</L>
<L>A Bark; scarce had I yet finish'd my sleep,</L>
<L>But at my first waking I saw my self</L>
<L>Upon the Sea. My Mother then related</L>
<L>The whole adventure to me, and the secret</L>
<L>Imposture of my feigned death, when suddenly</L>
<L>A storm brake the discourse, horrour and death</L>
<L>March'd on the floods: alas, what shall I say?</L>
<L>Our vessel being carried by the fury</L>
<L>O'th' winds and waves, was split upon a rock,</L>
<L>The several pieces floated on the waters;</L>
<L>I know not which o'th' Gods took care of me</L>
<L>In putting one under my trembling hand,</L>
<L>Which making me pass on those moving graves</L>
<L>Through the disturbed empire of the winds,</L>
<L>Carried me to the shore in all apparence</L>
<L>Devoid of life; here in this quiet Island</L>

<L>My body found a receptacle; she</L>
<L>Returning at that instant from the chase,</L>
<L>Perceiv'd it lying, which th'enraged Sea</L>
<L>Yet threatened on its banks, and that same God</L>
<L>Which would compleat his miracle, inclin'd</L>
<L>Her heart to pitty at this spectacle:</L>
<L>She caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d me to be carried to her Court:</L>
<L>It is unto her succour that I owe</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="65"/>The remnant of my dayes: here I first chang'd</L>

<L>Of his redoubled cryes brake not my sleep:</L>
<L>The heat to revenge me dry'd all his tears:</L>
<L>He found his rival, and assaulted him;</L>
<L>They fought on equal terms; <HI>Nearchus</HI> fell</L>
<L>Under his arms for dead; <HI>Cleagenor</HI></L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>THERSANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Quite contrary, this love wherewith thou seest</L>
<L>My heart disturb'd, is a sure testimony</L>
<L>Of my fidelity: 'tis true, alas!</L>
<L>I sometime lov'd an object of such beauty,</L>
<L>That the Gods never fram'd so fair a peece:</L>
<L>The Roses and the Lillies form'd the colour</L>
<L>Which dy'd her cheeks, and in her sparkling eys</L>
<L>The Sun was painted; to express unto thee</L>
<L>Yet better her divine perfections,</L>
<L><HI>Diana</HI> is her Portrait to the life</L>
<L><HI>Celia</HI> is seen in her; she like <HI>Diana</HI></L>
<L>Had a Magestick carriage, she had</L>
<L>A mouth, and eys like her, she had an air,</L>
<L>Fierce too like hers, but amiable; lastly</L>
<L>In every thing she seem'd <HI>Diana's</HI> self:</L>
<L>My heart is constant therefore as before,</L>
<L>Since still I love her in her living Portrait.</L>
<L>I thought at first then, that her death was false,</L>
<L>And that <HI>Diana</HI> was that lovely object;</L>
<L>But when I saw <HI>Diana</HI> entertain</L>
<L>With such contempt the fervent love wherewith</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="71"/>My heart was taken, when I saw her rigours,</L>
<L>And infinite hatred, I perceiv'd my errour,</L>
<L>And said this is not <HI>Celia</HI>; so that</L>
<L>I saw well by her cruelties indeed</L>
<L>That I pursu'd her picture, and had passion</L>
<L>But for a Portrait.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ISMENIA.</SPEAKER>
<L>What! is <HI>Celia</HI> dead then?</L>

<SPEAKER>THERSANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! that's my affliction, I saw her</L>
<L>Stretch'd out upon her death-bed dead, <HI>Ismenia</HI>;</L>
<L>And more dead yet then she, I saw those places</L>
<L>Shine with a certain rest of brightness which</L>
<L>Her eyes had darted: presently on this</L>
<L>I had a Combat with <HI>Nearchus</HI> for</L>
<L>This charming Beauty; that proud favourite</L>
<L>Unto the King by infamous desires,</L>
<L>Form'd him an object to his filthy pleasures,</L>
<L>This outrage was intended to her sweetness:</L>
<L>We fought on this occasion, it was</L>
<L>My fortune to disarm him; but the death</L>
<L>Of <HI>Celia,</HI> and the anger of the King,</L>
<L>(To save me from the rigor of the Law)</L>
<L>Enforc'd me to a flight, and made me wander</L>
<L>Seven year from Province unto Province: last∣ly</L>
<L>Wearied to see the Court of every Prince,</L>
<L>I thought to free me of all dangers here</L>
<L>Under the feign'd name of <HI>Thersander,</HI> and</L>

<SPEAKER>THIMANTES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Love is a child,</L>
<L>He must be govern'd well, <HI>Diana's</HI> beauty</L>
<L>Hath gain'd her lovers, they may hurt, <HI>Thersan∣der</HI>;</L>
<L><HI>Melintus</HI> hath a subtle wit, and we</L>
<L>Both know he loves <HI>Diana,</HI> and besides</L>
<L>Is jealous of her; fear some foul play from him,</L>
<L>If thou appear his Rival; he disposeth</L>
<L>The spirit of <HI>Melissa</HI> at his pleasure;</L>
<L>When he shall see you serve as obstacle</L>
<L>Unto his love, he will take speedy order</L>
<L>For your removal.</L>

<L>Her free confession to us all, declar'd</L>
<L>How much she did esteem thee, but at last</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="76"/>With such an esteem that love followed</L>

<L>HA! what divine shapes strike mine eyes, and make</L>

<L>For my parte,</L>
<L>I wonder that you are astonish'd at it:</L>
<L>Is it so great a miracle, I pray you,</L>
<L>To see a Mayd to chaung? we have a mind</L>

<L>Or hatred into love, such an effect</L>
<L>As this so common in our Sex, should not</L>

<L>Of age sufficient to feele the effect</L>
<L>Both of the fire she kindles, and o'th'evill</L>
<L>Which she procures; the end, Sir, of her coldnes</L>
<L>Should not surprise you: who gives love, can easilie</L>
<L>Take it againe; and when a young heart never</L>
<L>Hath loved any thing, at the first fire</L>

<L>If I</L>
