<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE present carelesse security of all men in generall, is like unto our first Parents neg∣lect of Gods sacred commandement in Paradice, when the seducing Serpent no sooner per∣swaded evill, but it was instantly put in practise: You shall die (said God) was heard, but you shal not die (said the Divell) was beleeved. Our eares are daily acquainted with the threatnings of Gods de∣nounced
<PB REF="4"/>
against sinners, and yet that sinne, that broad way path and high-way to hell, is attempted with a delectation and pleasure, so craftie and subtill are the baits and lures of the deceiver, and so void of spirituall wisedome is the soule-murdering sinner. But if due consideration were had of the wages of sinne, and the reward of unrighteousnesse, and to what bitternesse it will turne in the end, it would make us lesse bold to sinne, and more fearefull to of∣fend, if wee would take into our company for a daily consort, the pale memory of death, and where∣to he summeth us after this life. Death it selfe is very fearefull, but much more terrible, in regard of the judgement it warneth us
<PB REF="4"/>
unto. Imagine to see a sinner lie on his departing bed, burde∣ned and tyred with the grievous and heavie load of all his former trespasses, goared with the sting and pricke of a festered consci∣ence, feeling the crampe of death wresting at his heart strings, ready to make the ruthfull di∣vorce betweene soule and body, panting for breath, and swim∣ming in a cold and fatall sweat, wearied with strugling against the deadly pangs: Oh how much would he give for an houre of re∣pentance! at what rate would he value a daies contrition! Then worlds would bee worthlesse, in respect of a little respite, a short truce would seeme more precious than the treasures of Empires,
<PB REF="5"/>
nothing would bee so much estee∣med as a moment of time, which now by moneths and yeeres is la∣vishly spent.</P>
<P>How inconsolable were his case, his friends being fled, his sences frighted, his thoughts a∣mazed, his memorie decaied, his whole minde agast, and no part able to performe that it should, but onely his guiltie conscience pestered with sinne, continually upbraiding him with bitter accusations? what would hee thinke then (stripped out of this mortall weed, and turned both out of the service and house∣roome of this world) hee must passe before a most severe Iudge, carrying in his owne conscience his enditement written, and a
<PB REF="5"/>
perfect register of all his mis∣deeds: when he should see the Iudge prepared to passe the sen∣tence against him, and the same to bee his Vmpire, whom by so many offences he hath made his enemie: VVhen not onely the di∣vels, but even the Angels, should plead against him, and himselfe maugre his will, bee his owne sharpest appeacher: VVhat were to be done in these dreadfull exi∣gents?</P>
<P>VVhen hee saw that gastly dungeon and huge gulfe of hell, breaking out with fearefull flames, the weeping, hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, and gnashing of teeth, the rage of all those hellish monsters, the horrour of the place, the rigour of the paine, the terrour of the
<PB REF="6"/>
company, and the eternitie of all those punishments. Would you thinke them wise that would daily in so weighty matters, and idlely play away the time allot∣ted them to prevent these in∣tollerable calamities? Would you then account it secure, to nurse in your bosome so many ougly Serpents as sinnes are, or to foster in your soule so many malicious accusers, as mortall faults are?</P>
<P>Would you not then thinke one life too little to repent for so many iniquities, everie one whereof were enough to cast you into those everlasting and unspeakeable torments? Why then doe wee not (at the least) devote that small remnant of
<PB REF="6"/>
these our latter dayes, to the ma∣king an attonement with God, that our consciences may be free from this eternall danger? Who would relie the everlasting affaires of the life to come upon the gliding slipperinesse, and running streame of our uncertaine life?</P>
<P>It is a preposterous pollicie (in any wise conceit) to fight against God till our weapons bee blunted, our forces consumed, our limmes impotent, and our breath spent; and then when wee fall for faint∣nesse, and have fought our selves almost dead, to presume on his mercy. It were a strange peece of Art, and a very exorbitant course, while the Ship is sound, the Pylot well, the Marriners strong, the gale favourable, and the Sea calme,
<PB REF="7"/>
to lie idle at rode: and when the Ship leakes, the Pylot were sicke, the Marriners faint, the stormes boysterous, and the Sea turmoyled with surges, to launch forth for a voyage into a farre Countrey: yet such is the skill of our evening re∣penters, who though in the sound∣nesse of health, and in the perfect use of reason, they cannot resolve to weigh the ankers that withhold them from God, neverthelesse, feed themselves with a strong per∣swasion, that when their sences are astonied, their wits distracted, their understanding dusked, and both body and minde racked and tormented with the throbs and gripes of a mortall sicknesse, then will they thinke of the weightiest matters, ad become Saints, when
<PB REF="7"/>
they are scarse able to behave themselves like reasonable crea∣tures? being then presumed to bee lesse then men: for how can he that is assaulted with an unsetled conscience, distrained with the wringing fits of his dying flesh, maimed in all his abilities, and circled in with so many encom∣brances, be thought of due discre∣tion to dispose of his chiefest jewell, which is his soule? No, no, they that will loyter in seed time, and begin then to sow when others begin to reape: they that will riot out their health, and cast their accounts when they can scarsely speake: they that will slumber out the day, and enter their journey when the light doth faile them, let them blame their owne folly, if they die
<PB REF="8"/>
in debt, and eternall beggerie, and fall headlong into the lapse of end∣lesse perdition.</P>
<P>Great cause have wee then to have an hourely watchfull care over our soule, being so dangerous assaulted and environed: most in∣stantly entreating the divine Ma∣jesty to be our assured defence, and let us passe the day in mourning, the night in watching and wee∣ping, and our whole time in plaine∣full lamenting, falling downe up∣on the ground humbled in sack∣cloth and ashes, having lost the garment of Christ, that hee may receive what the persecuting ene∣my would have spoyled every short sigh will not bee sufficient satisfa∣ction, nor every knocke a warrant to getin. Many shall cry Lord,
<PB REF="8"/>
Lord, and shall not be accepted: the foolish Virgins did knocke, but were not admitted: <HI>Judas</HI> had some sorrow, and yet died despe∣rate. Foreslow not (saith the Holy Ghost) to be converted unto God, and make not a daily lingering of thy repaire unto him: for thou shalt finde the suddennesse of his wrath and revenge not slacke to destroy sinners. For which cause, let no man sojourne long in sinfull security, or post over his repen∣tance untill feare enforce him to it, but let us frame our premises as we would finde our conclusion, endeavouring to live as we are de∣sirous to die: let us not offer the maine crop to the Divell, and set God to gleane the reproofe of his harvest: let us not gorge the Di∣vell
<PB REF="9"/>
with our fairest fruits, and turne God to the filthy scraps of his leavings: but let us truly de∣dicate both soule and body to his service, whose right they are, and whose service they owe; that so in the evening of our life we may re∣tire to a Christian rest, closing up the day of our life with a cleare sunne-set, that leaving all dark∣nesse behind us, we may carry in our consciences the light of grace: and so escaping the horrour of an eternall night, passe from a mor∣tall day, to an everlasting morrow.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O the end there might want nothing to stirre up our mindes to ver∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, after the paines which Al∣mighty
<PB N="2" REF="14"/>
God threatneth to the wicked, he doth also set before us the reward of the good: which is, that glory and everla∣sting life which the blessed Saints doe enjoy in Heaven, whereby he doth very mighti∣ly allure us to the love of the same. But what manner of thing this reward; and what this life is, there is no tongue, nei∣ther of Angels nor of men, that is sufficient to expresse it. How∣beit, that wee may have some kinde of savour and knowledge thereof, I intend here to re∣hearse even word for word what S. <HI>Augustine</HI> saith in one of his meditations, speaking o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the life everlasting (ensuing thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> transitorie time) and of the
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
joyes of the blessed Saints in Heaven. O life (saith he) prepa∣red by Almighty God for his friends, a blessed life, a secure life, a quiet life, a beautifull life, a cleane life, a chast life, a holy life; a life that knoweth no death, a life without sadnesse, without labour, without griefe, without trouble, without cor∣ruption, without feare, without variety, without alteration; a life replenished with all beautie and dignity; where there is nei∣ther enemy that can offend, nor delight that can annoy, where love is perfect, and no feare at all, where the day is everlasting, and the spirit of all is one; where Almighty God is seene face to face, who is the onely
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
meate whereupon they feed without loathsomenesse: it de∣lighteth mee to consider thy brightnesse, and thy treasures doe rejoyce my longing heart. The more I consider thee, the more I am striken in love with thee. The great desire I have of thee, doth wonderfully delight me, and no lesse pleasure is it to me, to keepe thee in my remem∣brance. O life most happy, O kingdome truly blessed, where∣in there is no death nor end, neither yet succession of time, where the day continuing ever∣more without night, knoweth not any mutation; where the victorious Conqueror being joyned with those everlasting quires of Angels, and having
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>
his head crowned with a gar∣land of glory, singeth unto Al∣mighty God one of the songs of <HI>Sion.</HI> Oh happy, yea, and most happy should my soule be, if when the race of this my pil∣grimage is ended, I might bee worthy to see thy glory, thy blessednesse, thy beauty, the wals and gates of thy Citie, thy streets, thy lodgings, thy noble Citizens, and thine omnipotent King in his most glorious Ma∣jestie. The stones of thy wals are precious, thy gates are ador∣ned with bright pearles, thy streets are of very fine excel∣lent gold, in which there ne∣ver faile perpetuall praises; thy houses are paved with rich stones, wrought throughout
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>
with Saphirs, and covered about with massie gold, where no uncleane thing may enter, neither doth any abide there that is defiled. Faire and beauti∣full in thy delights art thou O <HI>Ierusalem</HI> our mother, none of those things are suffered in thee, that are suffered here. There is great diversitie betweene thy things and the things that wee doe continually see in this life. In thee is never seene neither darkenesse nor night, neither yet any change of time. The light that shineth in thee, com∣meth neither of lampes, nor of Sunne or Moone, nor yet of bright glittering Starres, but God that proceedeth of God, and the light that commeth of
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
light, is he that giveth clearenes unto thee. Even the very King of Kings himselfe keepeth con∣tinuall residence in the middest of thee, compassed about with his officers and servants. There doe the Angels in their orders and Quires sing a most sweere and melodious harmony. There is celebrated a perpetuall solem∣nity and feast with every one of them that cōmeth thither, after his departure out of this pilgri∣mage. There be the orders of Prophets; there is the famous company of the Apostles; there is the invincible army of Mar∣tyrs; there is the most reverent∣assembly of confessors; there are the true and perfect religi∣ous persons; there are the holy
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
Virgins, which have over∣come both the pleasures of the world, and the frailty of their owne nature; there are the young men and young women, more ancient in vertue than in yeares; there are the sheepe and little lambes that have escaped from the Wolves, and from the deceitfull snares of this life, and therefore doe now keepe a per∣petuall feast, each one in his place, all alike in joy, though different in degree. There Cha∣rity raigneth in her full per∣fection, for unto them God is all in all, whom they behold without end, in whose love they bee all continually inflamed, whom they doe alwaies love, and in loving doe praise, and
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
in praising, doe love, and all their exercises consist in praises, without wearinesse, and with∣out travell. O happie were I, yea, and very happy indeed, if at what time I shall bee loosed out of the prison of this wret∣ched body, I might be thought worthy to heare those songs of that heavenly melody, sung in the praise of the everlasting King, by all the Citizens of that so noble Citie. Happie were I, and very happie, if I might obtaine a roome among the Chaplaines of that Chap∣pell, and wait for my turne also to sing my <HI>Hallelujah.</HI> If I might bee neare to my King, my God, my Lord, and see him in his glory, even as he
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
hath promised me, when he said: O Father, this is my last determi∣nate will, that all those that thou hast given unto me, may be with me, and see the glory which I had with thee before the world was created. Hetherto are the words of S. <HI>Augustine.</HI> Now tell me (Christian brother) what a day of glorious shine shall that be unto thee (if thou lead thy life in Gods feare) when after the course of this pilgrimage, thou shalt passe from death to im∣mortality; and in that passage, when others shall beginne to feare, thou shalt beginne to re∣joyce, and lift up thy head, be∣cause the day of thy deliverance is at hand. Come forth a little (saith S. <HI>Ierome</HI> unto the Vir∣gine
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
<HI>Eustochia)</HI> out of the prison of this body, and when thou art before the gate of this Ta∣bernacle, set before thy eyes the reward that thou hopest to have for thy present labours. Tell me, what a day shall that bee, when our Lord himselfe with all his Saints, shall come and meete thee in the way, say∣ing unto thee: <HI>Arise and make hast O my beloved, my delight, and my Turtle dove, for now the VVin∣ter is past, and the tempestuous waters are ceased, the flowers doe beginne to appeare in our land. Cant.</HI> 2. How great joy shall thy soule then receive, when it shall be at that time presented before the Throne of the most blessed Trinity, by the hands of the ho∣ly
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
Angels, and when shall be declared thy good workes, and what crosses, tribulations, and injuries thou hast suffered for Gods sake. <HI>Acts</HI> 9. S. <HI>Luke</HI> wri∣teth, That when holy <HI>Tabitha,</HI> the great almes giver was dead, all the Widdowes and poore folke came about the Apostle S. <HI>Peter,</HI> shewing unto him the garments which shee had given them: wherewith the Apostle being moved, made his prayer unto Almighty God for that so mercifull a woman, and by his prayers he raised her againe to life. Now what a gladnesse will it be to thy soule, when in the middest of those blessed spi∣rits thou shalt bee placed, with remembrance of thy almes∣deeds,
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
thy prayers and fastings, the innocency of thy life, thy suffering of wrongs and inju∣ries, thy patience in afflictions, thy temperance in diet, with all other vertues and good workes that thou hast done in all thy life. O how great joy shalt thou receive at that time for all the good deeds that thou hast wrought; how clearely then shalt thou understand the value and the excellencie of vertue. There the obedient man shall talke of victories; there vertue shall receive her reward, and the good honoured according to their merit. Moreover, vvhat a pleasure vvill it bee unto thee, when thou shalt see thy selfe to bee in that

sure haven, and shalt looke back upon the course of thy naviga∣tion which thou hast sailed here in this life: when thou shalt re∣member the tempests wherein thou hast beene tossed, the straits through which thou hast passed, and the dangers of theeves and pyrats, from whom thou hast escaped. There is the place where they shall sing the song of the Prophet, which saith, <HI>Had it not beene that our Lord had beene mine helper, it could not be but my soule had gone into hell.</HI> Especially, when from thence thou shalt behold so many sins as are committed every houre in the world, so many soules as doe descend every day into hell, and how it hath plea∣sed
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
Almighty God, that among such a multitude of damned persons, thou shouldst be of the number of his elect, and one of those to whom he would grant such exceeding great felicity and glory. Besides all this, what a goodly sight will it bee to see those seats filled up, and the Ci∣tie builded, and the wals of that noble <HI>Ierusalem</HI> repaired againe? With what chearefull embra∣cings shall the whole court of Heaven entertaine them, behol∣ding them when they come loa∣den with the spoiles of their vanquished enemies?

Oh, how sweet and savorie shall the fruit of vertue then be, although for a time before her roots see∣med very bitter: sweete is the cold evening after the hot sunnie day; sweete is the foun∣taine to the weary thirstie tra∣vailer; sweet is rest and sleepe to the tired servant: but much more sweet is it to the Saints in

This is the region of all peace, the place of security, situ∣ated above all the Elements, whether the cloudes and stor∣mie winds of the darke ayre cannot come.

Happy shall I be, if the remnant of my posterity might come to see the clearenesse of <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> her gates shall be wrought with Saphirs and Emeraulds, and all the circuit of her wals shall bee built with precious stones, her streets shall bee paved with white and polished marble, and in all parts of her territories shall bee sung <HI>Hallelujah.</HI> O joyfull countrey! O sweete glory! O blessed company! who shall be those so fortunate and happy that are elected for thee? It see∣meth a presumption to desire thee, and yet I will not live

O ye scattered sheepe, wandring out of your right way, if this be your sheep-coat, whether goe you backeward? What meane you? Why suf∣fer you such an excellent bene∣fit to be wilfully lost for not ta∣king so little paines? What wise man would not desire, that all labour &amp; paine of the world were imposed unto him? that all sorrowes, afflictions, and di∣seases were even powred upon him as thicke as haile; that persecutions, tribulations, and griefes, with one to molest him, another to disquiet him, yea, that all creatures in the world

<HEAD>Of the benefits which our Lord promiseth to give in this pre∣sent life; to such as live a just and godly life.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>Eradventure thou wilt now say, that all these things before rehearsed, bee re∣wards and punishments onely for the life to come: and that thou desirest to see something in this present life, because our mindes are wont to be mo∣ved very much with the sight of things present. To satisfie
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
thee herein, I will also explaine unto thee what may answer thy desire. For although our Lord doe reserve the best wine, and the delicate dishes of most delight, untill the end of the banket, yet he suffereth not his friends to bee utterly destitute of meate and drinke in this tedi∣ous voyage: for hee knoweth very well, that they could not otherwise hold out in their journey. And therefore when he said unto <HI>Abraham,</HI> Feare not <HI>Abraham,</HI> for I am thy de∣fender, and thy reward shall be exceeding great: By these words he promised two things, the one for the time present, that was, to be his safeguard and defence in all such things as
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
may happen in this life, and the other for the time to come, and that is, the reward of glory which is reserved for the next life. But how great the first pro∣mise is, and how many kinds of benefits and favours are there∣in included, no man is able to understand, but onely he, that hath with great diligence read the holy Scriptures, wherein no one thing is more often repea∣ted and set forth, than the great∣nesse of the favours, benefits, and priviledges, which Almigh∣ty God promiseth unto his friends in this life. Hearken what <HI>Salomon</HI> saith in the third Chapter of his Proverbs, as touching this matter. <HI>Blessed is that man that findeth wisedome,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
<HI>for it is better to have it, than all the treasures of Silver and Gold, be they never so excellent and pre∣cious: and it is more worth than all the riches of the world, and whatsoever mans heart is able to desire, is not comparable unto it. The length of daies are at her right hand, and riches and glo∣rie at her left. Her waies be plea∣sant, and all her passages bee quiet; shee is a tree of life to all those that have obtained her; and hee that shall have her in continuall pos∣session, shall bee blessed. Keepe therefore (O my sonne) the lawes of Almighty God, and his coun∣sell, for they shall be as life to thy soule, and sweetnesse to thy taste▪ Then shalt theu walke safely in thy waies, and thy feet shall no</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
<HI>finde any stumbling blockes. If thou sleep, thou shalt have no cause to feare: and if thou take thy rest, thy sleepe shall bee quiet.</HI> This is the sweetnesse and quietnesse of the way of the godly, but the waies of the wicked are farre different, as the holy Scrip∣ture doth declare unto us. The paths and waies of the wicked (saith <HI>Ecclesiasticus)</HI> are full of brambles, and at the end of their journey are prepared for them hell, darknesse, and paines. Doest thou thinke it then a good exchange, to forsake the waies of Almighty God, for the waies of the world, sith there is so great difference betweene the one and the other, not one∣ly in the end of the way, but also
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
in all the steps of the same? What madnesse can be greater, than to choose one torment to gaine another by; rather than with one rest to gaine another rest? And that thou maist more clearely perceive the excellen∣cy of this rest, and what a num∣ber of benefits are presently in∣cident thereunto, I beseech thee hearken attentively even what Almighty God himselfe hath promised by his Prophet <HI>Esay,</HI> to the observers of his law, in a manner with these words, as divers interpreters doe ex∣pound them. When thou shalt doe (saith hee) such and such things, which I have comman∣ded thee to doe, there shall forthwith appeare unto thee
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>
the dawning of the cleare day (that is, the sonne of justice) which shall drive away all the darkenesse of thy errours and miseries, and then shalt thou begin to enjoy true and perfect salvation. Now these are the benefits which Almighty God hath promised to his servants. And albeit some of them bee for the time to come, yet are some of them to be presently received in this life: as, that new light and shining from heaven; that safety and abundance of all good things; that assured confidence and trust in the Al∣mighty God; that divine assi∣stance in all our Prayers and Pe∣titions made unto him; that peace and tranquility of consci∣ence;
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>
that protection and pro∣vidence of Almighty God. All these are the gracious gifts and favours which Almighty God hath promised to his servants in this life. They all are the works of his mercy, effects of his grace, testimonies of his love, and blessings, which he of his father∣ly providence extendeth.</P>
<P>To be short, all these benefits doe the godly injoy both in this present life, and in the life to come: and of all these are the ungodly deprived, both in the one life, and in the other. Whereby thou maist easily per∣ceive, what difference there is betweene the one sort and the other, seeing the one is so rich in graces, and the other so
<PB N="31" REF="28"/>
poore and needy: For if thou ponder well Gods promised blessings, and consider the state and condition of the good and the wicked, thou shalt find, that the one sort is highly in the fa∣vour of Almighty God, and the other deepely in his dis∣pleasure: the one be his friends, and the other his enemies: the one be in light, and the other in darkenesse: the one doe enjoy the company of An∣gels, and the other the fil∣thy pleasures and delights of Swine: the one are truely free, and Lords over them∣selves, and the other are be∣come bond-slaves unto Satan, and unto their owne lusts and appetites. The one are joy∣full
<PB N="32" REF="29"/>
with the witnesse of a good conscience, and the other (ex∣cept they bee utterly blinded) are continually bitten with the worme of conscience, ever∣more gnawing on them: the one in tribulation, stand sted∣fastly in their proper place; and the other, like light chaffe, are carried up and downe with e∣very blast of winde: the one stand secure and firme with the anker of hope, and the other are unstable, and evermore yeel∣ding unto the assaults of for∣tune: the prayers of the one are acceptable and liking unto God, and the prayers of the other are abhorred and accursed: the death of the one is quiet, peace∣able and precious in the sight
<PB N="33" REF="29"/>
of God, and the death of the o∣ther, is unquiet, painefull, and troubled with a thousand frights and terrours: To con∣clude, the one live like children under the protection and de∣fence of Almighty God, and sleepe sweetly under the shad∣dow of his pastorall provi∣dence; and the other being ex∣cluded from this kinde of pro∣vidence, wander abroad as strai∣ed sheepe, without their shep∣heard and Master, lying wide open to all the perills, dangers, and assaults of the world. See∣ing then, that a vertuous life is accompanied with all these benefits, what is the cause that should withdraw thee, and perswade thee not to
<PB N="34" REF="30"/>
embrace such a precious trea∣sure? what art thou able to al∣ledge for excuse of thy great negligence? To say that this is not true, it cannot be admitted, for so much as Gods word doth avouch the certaintie hereof. To say that these are but small benefits, thou canst not, for so much as they doe exceede all that mans heart can desire. To say that thou art an enemy un∣to thy selfe, and that thou doest not desire these benefits, can∣not be, considering that a man is even naturally a friend to himselfe, &amp; the will of man hath ever an eye to his owne benefit, which is the very object or mark that his desire shooteth at. To say that thou hast no understan∣ding,
<PB N="35" REF="30"/>
nor taste of these benefits, it will not serve to discharge thine offence, forsomuch as thou hast the faith and beleefe there∣of, though thou hast not the taste, for the taste is lost through sinne, but not the faith: and the faith is a witnesse more certaine, more secure, &amp; better to be tru∣sted, than all other experiences and witnesses in the world. Why doest thou not then dis∣credit all other witnesses with this one assured testimony? Why doest thou not rather give credit unto faith, than to thine owne opinion and judgement? O that thou woul∣dest make a resolute determi∣nation, to submit thy selfe into the hands of Almighty God,
<PB N="36" REF="31"/>
and to put thy whole trust assu∣redly in him How soone shouldest thou then see all these Prophesies fulfilled in thee: then shouldest thou see the ex∣cellency of these divine trea∣sures: then shouldest thou see how starke blinde the lovers of this world are, that seeke not after this high treasure: then shouldest thou see upon what good ground our Saviour invi∣teth us to this kind of life, say∣ing; <HI>Come unto me all yee that travell, and are loaden, and I will refresh you; take my yoake upon you, and you shall finde rest for your soules: for my yoake is sweet, and my burden is light.</HI> Almigh∣ty God is no deceiver, nor false promiser, neither yet is hee a
<PB N="37" REF="31"/>
great boaster of such things as he promiseth. Why dost thou then shrinke backe? why dost thou refuse peace and true qui∣etnesse? why dost thou refuse the gentle offers and sweet cal∣lings of thy Pastor? how darest thou despise and banish away vertue from thee, which hath such prerogatives and privi∣ledges as these be: and withall, confirmed and signed even with the hand of Almighty God? The Queene of <HI>Sheba</HI> heard far lesse things than these of <HI>Salomon,</HI> and yet she travelled from the uttermost parts of the world, to try the truth of those things that she had heard. And why doest not thou then (hearing such notable, yea, and so cer∣taine
<PB N="38" REF="32"/>
newes of vertue) adventure to take a little paines to try the truth and sequell thereof? O deare Christian brother, put thy trust in Almighty God and in his Word, and commit thy selfe most boldly without all feare into his armes, and unloose from thy hands those trifling knots that have hitherto decei∣ved thee, and thou shalt finde, that the merits of vertue doe farre excell her fame: and that all which is spoken in praise of her, is nothing in comparison of that which she is indeed.</P>

How long wilt thou tarry, untill thou fully resolve to doe it? Turne thine eyes a little, and look back upon thy life past, and consider, that at this present (of what age soever thou be) it is high time, or rather, the time well nigh past to begin to dis∣charge some part of thy old debts. Consider, that thou which art a Christian regenerated in the water of holy Baptisme, which doest acknowledge Al∣mighty God for thy Father, and the Catholike Church for thy Mother, whom she hath nouri∣shed with the milke of the Gos∣pell, to wit, with the doctrine of the Apostles and Evangelists: consider (I say) that all this not∣withstanding, thou hast lived
<PB N="41" REF="33"/>
even as loosely and dissolutely, as if thou hadst beene a meere Infidell, that had never any knowledge of Almighty God. And if thou doe denie this, then tell me what kinde of sin is there which thou hast not commit∣ted? What tree is there forbid∣den that thou hast not beholden with thine eyes? What greene meddow is there, in which thou hast not (at the least in desire) feasted thy letcherous lust? what thing hath beene set be∣fore thine eyes, that thou hast not wantonly desired? What appetite hast thou left unexecu∣ted, notwithstanding that thou didst beleeve in Almighty God, and that thou wert a Christian? What wouldst thou have done
<PB N="42" REF="34"/>
more, if thou hadst not had any faith at all? If thou hadst not looked for any other life? If thou hadst not feared the dreadfull day of judgement? What hath all thy former life beene, but a web of sinnes, a sinke of vices, a way full of brambles and thornes, and a fro∣ward disobedience of God? with whom hast thou hitherto lived, but onely with thine appetite, with thy flesh, with thy pride, and with the goods and riches of this transitory world? These have beene thy gods, these have beene thine idols whom thou hast served, and whose lawes thou hast diligently obeyed. Make thine account with the Almighty God, with his lawes,
<PB N="43" REF="34"/>
and with his obedience, and peradventure thou shalt finde, that thou hast esteemed him no more, than if he had beene a god of wood, or stone. For it is certaine, that there bee many Christians, which beleeving that there is a God, are induced to sinne with such facility, as though they beleeved, that there were no God at all: and doe offend no whit the lesse, though they beleeve that there is a God, then they would doe, if they beleeved there were none at all. What greater inju∣rie, what greater despight can bee done, than so to con∣temne his divine majestie? Finally, thou beleeving all such things as Christs Church
<PB N="44" REF="35"/>
doth beleeve, hast notwithstan∣ding so led thy life, as if thou wert perswaded, that the be∣leefe of Christians were the greatest fables or lies in the world. And if the multitude of thy sinnes past, and the faculty thou hast used in committing of them, doe not make thee afraid, why dost thou not feare at the least the Majesty and omnipo∣tencie of him, against whom thou hast sinned? Lift up thine eyes, and consider the infinite greatnesse and omnipotencie of the Lord, whom the powers of Heaven do adore, before whose Majesty the whole compasse of the wide world lyeth pro∣strate; in whose presence, all things created, are no more
<PB N="45" REF="35"/>
than chaffe carried away with the winde. Consider also with thy selfe how unseemely it is, that such a vile worme as thou art, should have audacity so ma∣ny times to offend and provoke the wrath of so great a Majesty. Consider the wonderfull and most terrible severity of his ju∣stice, and what horrible punish∣ments hee hath used from time to time in the world against sinne; and that not onely upon particular persons, but also up∣on Cities, Nations, Kingdomes and Provinces, yea, upon the u∣niversall World: And not one∣ly in earth, but also in Heaven; and not onely upon strangers sinners, but even upon his owne most innocent sonne, our
<PB N="46" REF="36"/>
sweet Saviour Jesus Christ, when he tooke upon him to sa∣tisfie for the debt that we owed. And if this severity was used upon greene and innocent wood, and that for the sinnes of others; what then will he doe upon dry and withered wood, and against those that are loden with their owne sinnes? Now, what thing can bee thought more unreasonable, then that such a fraile wretch as thou art, should bee so saucie and mala∣pert, as to mocke with so migh∣tie a Lord, whose hand is so heavie, that in case hee should strike but one stroke upon thee, hee would at one blow drive thee downe headlong into the deepe bottomelesse pit of hell,
<PB N="47" REF="36"/>
without remedy. Consider like∣wise the great patience of this our mercifull Lord, who hath expected thy repentance so long, even from the time that thou didst first offend him: and think, that if after so long pa∣tience and tarrying for thee, thou shalt still continue thy leaud and sinfull life, abusing thus his mercy, and provoking him to further indignation and wrath, hee will then bend his bowe, and shake his sword, and raine downe upon thee even sharpe arrowes of everlasting wrath and death. Consider also the profoundnesse of his deepe judgments, wherof we read, and see daily so great wonders. We see how <HI>Salomon</HI> himselfe, after
<PB N="48" REF="37"/>
his so great wisdome, and after those three thousand parables and most profound mysteries uttered by him, was forsaken by Almighty God, and suffered to fall down and adore Idols. Wee see how one of those seven first Deacons of the Primitive Church, which were full of the Holy Ghost, became not onely an hereticke, but also an arch∣hereticke and a father of here∣sies. We see daily many starres fall downe from Heaven unto earth, with miserable fals, and to wallow themselves in the durt, and to eate the meate of swine, which sate before at Gods owne table, and were fed with the very bread of Angels. If then the just and righteous
<PB N="49" REF="37"/>
for some secret pride or negli∣gence, or else for some ingrati∣tude of theirs) be thus justly for∣saken of Almighty God, after they have bestowed so many yeares in his service. What maist thou looke for, that hast done in a manner nothing else in all thy life time, but onely heaped sinnes upon sinnes, and hast thereby offended Almigh∣ty God most grievously?</P>
<P>Now, if thou hast lived after this sort, were it not reason that thou shouldst now at the length give over, and cease heaping sinne upon sinne, and debt up∣on debt, and begin to pacifie the wrath of Almighty God, and to disburden thy sinnefull soule? Were it not meet, that
<PB N="50" REF="38"/>
that time which thou hast hi∣therto given to the world, to thy flesh, and to the Divell, should suffice? and that thou shouldest bestow some little time of that which remaineth, to serve him, who hath given thee all that thou hast? Were it not a point of wisedome, after so long time, and so many great injuries, to feare the most ter∣rible justice of Almighty God, who the more patiently he suf∣fereth sinners, the more hee doth afterwards punish them with severity and justice? Were it not meet for thee to feare thy long continuance so many yeares in sinne, and in the dis∣pleasure of Almighty God, pro∣curing thereby against thee such
<PB N="51" REF="38"/>
a mighty adversary as he is, and provoking him of a mercifull loving Father to become thy se∣vere terrible judge and enemy? Were it not meet to feare, least that the force of evill custome may in continuance of time be turned into nature; and that thy long vicious usuall manner of committing sinne, may make of a vice, a necessity, or little lesse? Why art thou not afraid, least by little and little thou maiest cast thy selfe downe head-long into the deep pit of a reprobate sence, whereinto after that a man is once falne, hee never maketh account of any sinne, be it never so great.</P>
<P>The Patriarke <HI>Iacob</HI> said unto <HI>Laban</HI> his father in law: These
<PB N="52" REF="39"/>
fourteene yeares have I served thee, and looking to thine af∣faires, now it is time that I should looke to mine owne, and begin to attend unto the af∣faires of mine owne houshold. Wherefore if thou hast likewise bestowed so many yeares in the service of this world, and of this fraile transitory life, were it not good reason, that thou shoul∣dest now begin to make some provision for the salvation of thy soule, and for the everla∣sting life to come? There is nothing more short, nor more transitory then the life of man; and therefore providing so carefully as thou doest for all such things as be necessarie for this life, which is so short, why

If this be not a vanity of vanities, who can tell what is vanity? Every man is an eye-witnesse of this vanity, the more is the pittie that it should bee so common: your Lady, the Merchants wife,
<PB N="79" REF="52"/>
the trades mans wife, nay, all of all sorts are a degree above their estate. Your Gallant is no man, unlesse his haire bee of the womans fashion, dangling and waving over his shoulders; your woman no body, except (contrary to the modesty of her sexe) shee be halfe (at least) of the mans fashion: shee jets, she cuts, shee rides, she sweares, she games, she smoakes, shee drinkes, and what not that is e∣vill? Shee is in the universall portraiture of her behaviour, as well as in her accoutrements, more then halfe a man; the man on the other side, no lesse wo∣manish. We may well admire and exclaime with the Poet, <HI>O tempora! O mores!</HI> O the times!
<PB N="80" REF="53"/>
O the manners of these times! <HI>O quantum est in rebus mane!</HI> O how great a nothing is there in all things! What a vanity of va∣nity hath overspread the age we live in? Were our forefathers now alive to be spectators of this vanity, it would strike them into amazement. In their dayes the Pike, the Speare, the Sword, the Bowe, the Arrow, Musket and Caliever, with the warlike Horse, were the object of exer∣cise and recreation: Now the Pot, the Pipe, Dice and Cards, and such like vanities, indeed worse then the quintessence of the extreamest vanity. We are now all for ease, wee must lye soft, fare deliciously, goe sump∣tuously, drinke Wine in bowles,
<PB N="81" REF="53"/>
carowse healths, till health bee quite drunke away; nay, we must kneele to our drinke, when we will not kneele to him that gave us our drinke; we doe ho∣mage to that which takes away the use of our legges, nay, of our braines, our hearts, wits, sence, reason, when we refuse homage to him that gave us all these. O vaine man that dost thus forget thy God, and abuse thy selfe! why dost thou thus suffer thy selfe to be swallowed up in the gulfe of vanity, which hath no bottome but misery? Why sufferest thou the Divell thus to take thee on the hip, that he may cast thee downe into the Abisse of hell? Art thou so bewitched with that which will

have an end, a sudden end, a wretched end? Thy honey will prove Gall in the end, and thy Wine, Vinegar. In these faire roses of vanity the Divell hides his pins, that shall pricke thee, when thou lookest to be re∣freshed with their sweet smels. These vanities we purchase at no easie rate; it is with the pro∣curement of punishment, and losse of happinesse: As the bird that accepts of the Fowlers meat, buyes it full dearely, with the losse of her owne life: so when we accept these vanities from the Divell, it is with the losse of better things, in price a∣bove the whole world. In these contracts with Satan, we make <HI>Esau's</HI> penniworth, sell Heaven

Now thou art pompering thy corruptible flesh; but let pale death step in, and clap thee on the shoulder, wher's thy mirth, wher's thy felicity? thy volup∣tuous vanity doth presently ex∣pire. There is a banquet set be∣fore thee, in which are all varie∣ties of delicacies, but alas! eve∣ry one poysoned: darest thou touch or taste any one of them? by sin thou poysonest all those outward blessings of God, which in themselves are wholesome and good: and wilt thou ingur∣gitate that which is poyson to thy soule? Tell me, when all is done, two or three hundred yeares hence, what thou wilt be
<PB N="84" REF="55"/>
the better for all thy dainties, more then the poore man that never tasted them? Nay, how much better in the day of triall, and at the houre of death? Then all thy pride, pompe, and plea∣sure shall be turned into squa∣led deformity, &amp; irrecoverable calamity; then vanity shewes it selfe in the proper colours, then death, and knell, and hell doe all conspire to aggravate thy sor∣row; yea, then hell begins to come to thee before thou come to it; thy eyes sleepe not, thy senses rest not, thy perplexed heart burnes within thee, thy wounded conscience bleeds within thee; thou seest nothing but terror, thou feelest nothing but horror; thou thinkest thy
<PB N="85" REF="55"/>
selfe to be haunted with sprights, ghosts, and hellish furies, sting∣ing thee with Adders, pursuing thee with Torches and fire-brand. That saying of the Hea∣then man is then, if not before, verified: <HI>Suae quemque exagitant furiae;</HI> every man is tormented with his owne fury, which is his conscience. Besides thy wife, children, or other friends (to the exasperating of thy griefe) doe stand about thee weeping, as loath to part from thee: whereas thy sinnes follow thee, and will follow thee, doe what thou canst; hell gapes before thee with a wide mouth as rea∣dy to devoure thee, destruction on both sides attends thee: backe thou canst not goe, for a

dead corps followes thee so neere that thou canst not part from it, it is tied unto thee with an indissolveable knot; besides, conscience followes thee, and cries out against thee, and will not leave thee; continually it presents thee with the dreadfull spectacle of thy dolefull and wo∣full sinnes. If this were now seriously considered, how would it make thy heart to ake with grieving, thy eyes to swell with weeping, thy hands to bee al∣waies lifted up, thy knees ever bended? How wouldest thou strive to subdue thy flesh to the spirit, sensuality to reason, reason to faith, and faith to the service of God? But thou dost not now consider this, that thy sinne is so
<PB N="87" REF="56"/>
fast linkt to thy conscience, that at the last (albeit not before) it will pull and hale thee, and rack and prick thy conscience, which wil accuse, convict, &amp; condemne thee: all thy vanities, all thy iniquities, will then pursue thee like so many furious ghosts. Then <HI>ex ore tuo,</HI> out of thy own mouth shalt thou be judged, thou evill servant: thy owne mouth shall confesse that thou hast followed nothing but va∣nity: What a vanity was it for me to make earth my heaven, and so to admire and even adore this earth, that it is a hell to for∣sake it? What a wofull bargaine have I made to sell my soule for vanity? I was borne in vanity, I have lived in vanity, and it is

my feare that I shall dye in va∣nity.

Indeed my friends may goe with me to the grave, but there they must leave me; my riches, pleasures, and such like vanities vanish before; but my sinnes and conscience will never leave me; the divell will still pursue me: hee that tempts me now to sinne, will then torment me for sinning,

Re∣solve therefore with thy selfe that all things earthly, worldly, carnall, sinfull, are vaine: <HI>the fashion of this world passeth away,</HI> saith the Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 3. <HI>The fashion,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a word very emphaticall: it signifies first an accidentall and externall figure without substance; se∣condly, the habit, vesture or cloathing of a thing.

<PB N="91" REF="58"/>
that the world is <HI>cloathed with a vesture,</HI> that is, wearing and wasting, the <HI>fashion</HI> of it lasteth but for a time, it is ready every houre to put on a <HI>new fashion:</HI> againe, by intimating unto us that the world is <HI>without any substantiall forme,</HI> like unto <HI>shewes</HI> and <HI>shadowes,</HI> that vanish in the representation. Saint <HI>Luke</HI> cals all <HI>Agrippa's</HI> pompe but a <HI>fancie: David</HI> cals the yeares of a man but a <HI>tale, Psal.</HI> 90. 9. <HI>We spend our yeares as a tale that is told.</HI> As a tale, nay, as a thought (for so much the originall word doth import) and how many thoughts may a man have in an houre?

<PB N="92" REF="59"/>
nothing more fickle then a <HI>fan∣cie,</HI> nothing more swift then <HI>thought.</HI> What a disproportion therefore is it for the immortall soule of a man to bee fastened unto things which are of such a variable nature? What a folly for us to preferre those which are but momentary (for so I may more truely call them then tem∣porall) unto those things which are indeed eternall? Glasses are in great use amongst us, yet be∣cause of their brittlenesse who esteemes them precious?

<P>Death is the most terrible of all things that are terrible, said the Philosopher <HI>Aristotle:</HI> it is terrible both to man and beast, but most terrible to a wicked man that is worse then a beast, when he remembers his sinfull life past, the complexion of his flesh, the palenesse of his face, the dissolution of his members, the rottennesse of his bones, the obscurenesse of his grave, the solitarinesse of his sepulcher, the gnawing of wormes, and the

<HEAD>Of the punishments <HI>which the Lord threatneth unto such as live a sinfull life.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>Ne of the princi∣pall meanes that our Lord hath used oftentimes to bridle the hearts of men, and to draw them unto the obedience of his commandements, hath beene, to set before their eyes the horrible plagues and punishments that are prepared
<PB N="117" REF="71"/>
for such persons as bee rebels and transgressours of his Law. For although the hope of the rewards that are promised unto the good in the life to come, may move us very much here∣unto: yet are wee commonly more moved with things that be irkesome unto us, than with such as be pleasant: even as we see by daily experience, that we are vexed more with an injury done unto us, than delighted with any honour; and we are more troubled with sicknesse, than comforted with health: and so by the discommodity of sicknes, we come to understand the commodity of health, as by a thing so much the bet∣ter perceived, by how much
<PB N="118" REF="72"/>
more it is sensibly felt. Now for this cause did our Lord in times past use this meane more than any other, as it appeareth most clearely by the writings of the Prophets, which are every where full of dreadfull sayings and threatnings, wherewith our Lord pretendeth to put a terrour into the hearts of men, and so to bridle and subdue them under the obedience of his Law. And for this end he com∣manded the Prophet <HI>Ieremie,</HI> That hee should take a white booke, and write in the same all the threatnings and calamities which hee had revealed unto him, even from the first day he began to mlke with him, untill that present houre, and that he
<PB N="119" REF="72"/>
should read the same in the pre∣sence of all the people, to see if peradventure they would bee moved therewith unto repen∣tance, and to change their for∣mer life, to the end, that hee might also change the determi∣nation of his wrath, which he had purposed to execute upon them. And the holy Scripture saith, That when the Prophet had done according as hee was commanded by almighty God, and had read all those threat∣nings in the presence of the people, and of the Rulers; there arose such a feare and terrour amongst them, that they were all astonished, and as it were bestraughted of their wits, look∣ing one in anothers face, for the
<PB N="120" REF="73"/>
exceeding great fear which they had conceived of those words. This was one of the principall means which Almighty God u∣sed with men in the time of the written Law, and so he did also in the time of the Law of graces in vvhich, the holy Apostle saith, That as there is revealed a justice, vvhereby God maketh men just, so is there also revea∣led an indignation and vvrath, vvhereby he punisheth the un∣just: for vvhich cause, S. <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> (the glorious forerunner of our Saviour Christ) was sent vvith this commission and em∣bassage, to preach unto the world, <HI>That the axe was now put to the rooot of the tree, and that every tree that brought not forth</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="73"/>
<HI>good fruit, should bee cut downe and cast into the fire.</HI> Hee said moreover, <HI>That there was ano∣ther come into the world, more mighty than hee, that carried in his hand a fanne to winnow and cleanse therewith his floore, and that he would put up the corne into his garner, but the chaffe hee will burne in a fire that should ne∣ver bee quenched.</HI> This was the preaching and embassage which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he holy fore-runner of our Saviour Jesus Christ brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto the world. And so great was the thunder of these words, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the terrour which entered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto mens hearts so dreadfull, that there ran unto him of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sates and conditions of men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven of the very Pharisees and
<PB N="122" REF="74"/>
Publicans, yea, and Souldiers also (which of all others are wont to be most dissolute, and to have the least care of their consciences) and each of them demanded for himselfe particu∣larly of that holy man, what he should doe to attaine unto sal∣vation, and to escape those ter∣rible threatnings which hee had denounced unto them, so great was the feare they had concei∣ved of them.</P>
<P>And this is that (deare Chri∣stian brother) which I doe a this present (in the behalfe o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Almighty God) deliver unto thee, although not with such fervency of spirit and like holi∣nesse of life, yet that which im∣porteth more in this case, with
<PB N="123" REF="74"/>
the same truth and certainty; for so much as the faith and Gospell which Saint <HI>Iohn Bap∣tist</HI> then preached, is even the same now taught.</P>
<P>Now, if thou be desirous to understand in few words, how great the punishment is, that Al∣mighty God hath threatned in his holy Scriptures to the wick∣ed, that which may most briefly and most to the purpose be spo∣ken in this matter, is this: That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke as the reward of the good is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> universall good thing, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the punishment of the wick∣ed is an universall evill, which comprehendeth in it al the evils <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at are. For the better under∣standing whereof it is to be no∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, That all the evils of this life
<PB N="124" REF="75"/>
are particular evils, and there∣fore doe not torment all our sences generally, but onely one or some of them. As taking an example of the diseases of our body; we see, that one hath a disease in his eyes, another i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his eares: one is sicke in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heart, another in the stomacke some other in his head. And so divers men are diseased in diver parts of the body, howbeit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such wise, that none of all the diseases be generally through out all the members of the bo∣dy, but particular to some on of them. And yet for all thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we see what griefe onely one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these diseases may put us unt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and how painefull a night t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sicke man hath in any one

Now let us put the case, that there were some one man sicke of such an uni∣versall disease, that he had no part of his body, neither any one joynt or sence free from his proper paine, but that at one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime and instant hee suffered most exceeding sharpe torment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his head, in his eyes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ares, in his teeth, and stomack, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his liver and heart: and to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hort, in all the rest of his mem∣bers and joynts of his body, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he lay after this sort stret∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing himselfe in his bed, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained with these greeses and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orments, every member of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody having his particular tor∣ment
<PB N="126" REF="76"/>
and griefe: Hee (I say that should lye thus pained and afflicted, how great torment and griefe of minde and body (thinke ye) should he sustaine: Oh, what thing could any man imagine more miserable, and more worthy of compassion▪ Surely, if thou shouldest see bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a dogge to be so tormented and grieved in the street, his very paines would move thy hear to take pitty upon him. Now this is that (my deare Christian brother, if any comparison may be made betweene them) which is suffered in that most curse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and horrible place of hell, and not onely during for the spac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of one night, but everlastingly for ever and ever. For like
<PB N="127" REF="76"/>
the wicked men have offended Almighty God with all their members and sences, and have made armour of them all to serve sinne, even so will he or∣daine, that they shall bee there tormented every one of them with his propertorment.</P>
<P>There shall the wanton un∣chaste eyes be tormented with the terrible sight of Divels: the cares with the confusion of such horrible cries and lamentations which shall there be heard: the nose with the intollerable stinke of that ougly, filthy, and loath∣some place: the taste, with a most ravenous hunger and thirst: the touching, and all the members of the body with ex∣treame burning fire. The ima∣gination
<PB N="128" REF="77"/>
shall be tormented by the conceiving of griefes pre∣sent: the memory, by calling to minde the pleasures past: the understanding, by considering what benefits are lost, and what endlesse miseries are to come.</P>
<P>This multitude of punish∣ments the holy Scripture signi∣fieth unto us, when it saith, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15. <HI>Psal.</HI> 10. <HI>That in hell there shall be hunger, thirst, wee∣ping, wailing, gnashing of teeth, swords double edged, spirits crea∣ted for revengement, serpents, wormes, scorpions, hammers, wormewood, water of gall, the spi∣rit of tempest,</HI> and other things of like sort. Whereby are sig∣nified unto us (as in a figure) the multitude and dreadfull terrous
<PB N="129" REF="77"/>
of the most horrible torments and paines that be in that cursed place. There shall bee likewise darkenesse inward and outward, both of body and soule, farre more obscure than the darke∣nesse of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which was to be felt even with hands, <HI>Exod.</HI> 20. There shall be fire also, not as this fire here, that tormenteth a little, and shortly endeth, but such a fire as that place requi∣reth, which tormenteth excee∣dingly, and shall never make an end of that tormenting. This being true, what greater won∣der can there be, than that they which beleeve and confesse this for truth, should live with such most strange negligence and carelesnesse as they doe? What

travell and paines would not a man willingly take to escape even one onely day, yea, one houre, the very least of these torments? and wherefore doe they not then, to escape the everlastingnesse of so great paines and horrible torments, endure so little a travell, as to follow the exercise of vertue. Surely, the consideration of this matter were able to make any sinfull soule to feare and trem∣ble, in case it were deepely re∣garded.</P>
<P>And if amongst so great num∣ber of paines, there were any manner hope of end or release, it would be some kinde of com∣fort: but alas it is not so, for there the gates are fast shut up from
<PB N="131" REF="78"/>
all expectation of any manner of ease or hope. In all kinde of paines and calamities that be in this world, there is alwaies some gap lying open, whereby the patient may receive some kinde of comfort: sometimes reason, sometimes the weather, sometimes his friends, some∣times the hearing that others are troubled with the very same disease, and sometimes (at the least) the hope of an end may cheare him: onely in these most horrible paines and miseries that be in hell, all the waies are shut up in such sort, and all the havens of comfort so embarred, that the miserable sinner cannot hope for remedy on any side, neither of heaven, nor of earth,
<PB N="132" REF="79"/>
neither of the time past, or pre∣sent, or of the time to come, or of any other meanes. The dam∣ned soules thinke, that all men are shooting darts at them, and that all creatures have conspired against them, and that even they themselves are cruell against themselves. This is that distresse whereof the sinners doe lament by the Prophet, saying: <HI>The sorrowes of hell have compassed me round about, and the snares of death have besieged me:</HI> For on which side soever they looke or turne their eyes, they doe con∣tinually behold occasions of sorrow and griefe, and none at all of any ease or comfort. The wise Virgins (saith the Evange∣list) <HI>that stood ready prepared at</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="79"/>
<HI>the gate of the Bridegroome, entred in, and the gate was forthwith locked fast.</HI> O locking everla∣sting, O enclosure immortall, O gate of all goodnesse, which shal never any more be opened a∣gaine. As if he had said more plainely, the gate of pardon, of mercy, of comfort, of grace, of intercession, of hope, and of all other goodnesse, is shut up for ever and ever. Six daies and no more was Manna to be ga∣thered, but the seventh day, which was the Sabbath day, was there none to bee found: and therefore shall he fast for ever, that hath not in due time made his provision aforehand. The sluggard (saith the Wise man) will not till his ground for
<PB N="134" REF="80"/>
feare of cold, and therefore shall he beg his bread in summer, and no man shall give him to eat. And in another place he saith: <HI>He that gathereth in summer, is a wise sonne, but hee that giveth himselfe to sleeping at that season, is the sonne of confusion.</HI> For what confusion can be greater then that which that miserable cove∣tous rich man suffereth, who with a few crums of bread that fell from his table, might have purchased to himselfe abun∣dance of everlasting felicity, and glory in the kingdome of Heaven? But because he would not give so small a thing, he came to such an extreame ne∣cessity that he begged (yea, and shall for ever beg in vaine) one∣ly
<PB N="135" REF="80"/>
one drop of water, and shall never obtaine it. Who is not moved with that request of that unfortunate damned person, who cried, <HI>O father</HI> Abraham <HI>have compassion on me, and send downe</HI> Lazarus <HI>unto me, that hee may dip the tip of his finger in wa∣ter, and touch my tongue, for these horrible flames doe torment me exceedingly.</HI> What smaller request could there be desired than this? He durst not request so much as one cup of water, neither that <HI>Lazarus</HI> should put his whole hand into the water, nor yet (which is more to be wondered at) did he request so much as the whole finger, but onely the tip of it, that it might but touch his tongue; and yet
<PB N="136" REF="81"/>
even this alone would not be granted unto him. Whereby thou maiest perceive, how fast the gate of all consolation is shut up, and how universall that interdict and excommuni∣cation is that is there laid upon the damned, sith this rich Glut∣ton could not obtaine so much as this small request. So that wheresoever the damned per∣sons doe turne their eyes, and on which side soever they stretch their hands, they shall not finde any manner of com∣fort, be it never so small. And as he that is in the Sea choaked, and almost drowned under the water, not finding any stay whereupon to set his foot, stretcheth forth his hands often∣times
<PB N="137" REF="81"/>
on every side in vaine (be∣cause all that he graspeth after, is thin and liquid water, which deceives him) even so shall it fare with the damned persons, when they shall be drowned in that deepe Sea of so many mi∣series, where they shall strive and struggle alwaies with death, without finding any succour or place of stay, whereupon they may rest themselves. Now this is one of the greatest paines wherewith they be tormented in that cursed place: for if these torments should have their con∣tinuance limited but for a cer∣taine time, though it were for a thousand, yea, a hundred thou∣sand millions of yeares, yet even this would be some little com∣fort
<PB N="138" REF="82"/>
unto them, for nothing is perfectly great, in case it have an end: But alas, they have not so much as this poore and mise∣rable comfort: but contrariwise, their paines are equall in conti∣nuance with the eternity of Al∣mighty God, and the lasting of their misery with the eternity of Gods glory. As long as Al∣mighty God shall live, so long shall they die: and when Al∣mighty God shall cease to be God, then shall they also cease to be as they are. O deadly life, O immortall death! I know not whether I may truely tearme thee, either life or death: for if thou be life, why dost thou kill? And if thou be death, why doest thou endure? Wherefore
<PB N="139" REF="82"/>
I will call thee neither the one, nor the other, for so much as in both of them there is contained something that is good: as in life there is rest, and in death there is an end (which is a great comfort to the afflicted) but thou hast neither rest nor end. What art thou then? Marry, thou art the worst of life, and the worst of death; for of death thou hast the torment, without any end, and of life thou hast the continuance without any rest. O bitter composition, O unsavory purgation of our Lords cup! of the which, all the sin∣ners of the earth shall drinke their part.</P>
<P>Now in this continuance in this eternity, I would wish that
<PB N="140" REF="83"/>
thou (my deare Christian bro∣ther) wouldst fixe the eyes of thy consideration a little while: and that as the cleane beast cheweth the cud, even so thou wouldest weigh this point within thy selfe with great deli∣beration. And to the intent thou maiest doe it the better, consider a little the paines that a sicke man abideth in one evill night, especially if he be vexed with any vehement griefe, or sharpe disease. Marke how oft he tumbleth and tosseth in his bed, what disquietnesse he hath, how long and tedious one night seemeth unto him, how duely he counteth all the houres of the clocke, and how long hee deemeth each houre of them to
<PB N="141" REF="83"/>
be, how he passeth the time in wishing for the dawning of the day, which notwithstanding, is like to helpe him little towards the curing of his disease. If this then be accounted so great a torment, what torment shall that be (thinke you) in that e∣verlasting night in hell, which hath no morning, nor so much as any hope of any dawning of the day: O darknesse most ob∣scure! O night everlasting! O night accursed even by the mouth of Almighty God and all his Saints! That one shall wish for light, and shall never see it, neither shall the bright∣nesse of the morning arise any more. Consider then what a kinde of torment shall that bee,
<PB N="142" REF="84"/>
to live everlastingly in such a night as this is, lying not in a soft bed (as the sicke man doth) but in a hot burning furnace, fo∣ming out such terrible raging flames. What shoulders shall be able to abide those horrible heats. If it seeme to us as a thing intollerable to have onely some part of our feet standing upon a pan of burning coales, for the space of repeating the Lords prayer. What shall it be (thinke you) to stand body and soule burning in the midst of those e∣verlasting hot raging fires in hell, in comparison of which, the fires of this world are but painted fires. Is there any wit or judgement in this world? Have men their right sences?
<PB N="143" REF="84"/>
doe they understand what these words import? or are they per∣adventure perswaded, that these are onely the fables of Poets? or doe they thinke, that this ap∣pertaineth not to them, or else that it was onely ment for o∣thers? None of all this can they say, for so much as our faith assureth us most certainely herein. And our Saviour Christ himselfe, who is everlasting truth, crieth out in his Gospell, saying, <HI>Heaven and earth shall faile, but my word shall not faile.</HI></P>
<P>Of this misery there follow∣eth another as great as it, which is, that the paines are alwaies continuing in one like degree, without any manner of inter∣mission, or decreasing. All man∣ner
<PB N="144" REF="85"/>
of things that are under the cope of heaven, doe move and turn round about with the same heaven, and doe never stand still at one state or being, but are continually either ascending or descending. The sea and the rivers have their ebbing and flowing, the times, the ages, and the mutable fortune of men, and of kingdomes, are evermore in continuall motion. There is no feaver so fervent, that doth not decline, neither griefe so sharp, but that after it is much aug∣mented, it doth forthwith de∣crease. To be short, all the tri∣bulations and miseries are by little and little worne away with time, and as the common saying is, <HI>Nothing is sooner dried</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="85"/>
<HI>up than teares.</HI> Onely that paine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n hell is alwaies greene, onely that feaver never decreaseth, onely that extremity of heat knoweth not what is either eve∣ning or morning. In the time of <HI>Noahs</HI> flood, Almighty God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained forty daies and forty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ights, continually without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easing upon the earth, and this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fficed to drowne the whole world. But in that place of torment in hell, there shall raine everlasting vengeance, and darts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f furie upon that cursed land, without ever ceasing so much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e onely minute or moment. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow what torment can bee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eater and more to be abhor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, than continually to suffer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r one like manner, without
<PB N="146" REF="86"/>
any kinde of alteration or change? Though a meat bee never so delicate, yet in case we feed continually thereupon, it will in very short time be very loathsome unto us: for no meat can be more precious and deli∣cate than that Manna was, which almighty God sent down unto the children of Israel in the Desart, and yet because they did eat continually thereof, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made them to loath it, yea, and provoked them to vomit it up againe. The way that is all plaine (they say) wearieth more than any other, because alwaies the variety (yea, even in punish∣ment) is a kinde of comfort▪ Tell me then, if things that be pleasant and savoury, when the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

What will the dam∣ned and cursed creatures think, when they shall there see them∣selves so utterly obhorred and forsaken of Almighty God, that he will not so much as with the remission of any one sinne, mi∣tigate somwhat their torments. And so great shall the fury and rage be which they shall there conceive against him, that they shall never cease continually to curse and blaspheme his holy
<PB N="148" REF="87"/>
name. Unto all these paines, there is also added the paine of that everlasting consumer, to wit, <HI>the worme of conscience,</HI> whereof the holy Scripture maketh so oftentimes mention, saying, <HI>Their worme shall never die, and their fire shall never bee quenched.</HI> This worme is a fu∣rious raging despight and bitter repentance, without any fruit, which the wicked shall alwaies have in hell, by calling to their remembrance the opportunity and time they had whiles they were in this world, to escape those most grievous and horri∣ble torments, and how they would not use the benefit there∣of. And therefore when the miserable sinner seeth himselfe
<PB N="149" REF="87"/>
thus to be tormented and vex∣ed on every side, and doth call to minde how many dayes and yeeres he hath spent idely in va∣nities, pastimes, and pleasures; and how oftentimes he was ad∣vertised of this perill, and how little regard he tooke thereof: What shall he thinke? What anguish and sorrow shall there be in his heart? Hast thou not read in the Gospell, that there shall be <HI>weeping and wailing, and gnashing of teeth?</HI> The famine of Aegypt endur'd onely seven yeares, but that in hell shall en∣dure everlastingly. In Aegypt they found a remedy, though with great difficulty and charge; out for this, there shall never a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y remedy bee found. Theirs
<PB N="150" REF="88"/>
was redeemed with money and cattell, but this can never be re∣deemed with any manner of ex∣change. This punishment can∣not bee pardoned, this paine cannot be exchanged, this sen∣tence cannot be revoked. Oh, if thou knewest and wouldest consider, how every one con∣demned to hell, shall there re∣maine tormenting and renting himselfe, weeping and wailing, and saying, O miserable and unfortunate wretch that I am, what times and opportunities have I suffered to passe in vaine? A time there was, when with one cup of cold water I might have purchased to my selfe a crowne of glory, and when also with such necessary workes of
<PB N="151" REF="88"/>
mercy in relieving the poore, I might have gained life everla∣sting. Wherefore did I not looke before me? How was I blinded with things present? How did J let passe the fruitfull yeares of abundance, and did not enrich my selfe? If J had beene brought up amongst In∣fidels and Pagans, and had be∣leeved that there had beene no∣thing else but only to be borne, and to die, then might I have had some kinde of excuse, and might have said. I knew not what was commanded or pro∣hibited me: but for so much as I have lived amongst Christians, and was my selfe one of them professed, and held it for an ar∣ticle of my beleefe, that the
<PB N="152" REF="89"/>
houre should come when I should give up an account after what order I had spent my life: forsomuch also as it was daily cried out unto me by the conti∣nuall preaching and teaching of Gods Embassadours (whose advertisements many follow∣ing, made preparation in time, and laboured earnestly for the provision of good workes:) forasmuch I say as I made light of all these examples, and per∣swaded my selfe very fondly, that Heaven was prepared for me, though I tooke no paines for it at all: what deserve I that have thus led my life? O ye in∣fernall furies, come and rent me in peeces, and devoure these my bowels, for so have I justly de∣served,
<PB N="153" REF="89"/>
I have deserved eternall famishment, seeing I would not provide for my selfe while I had time. I deserve not to reape, because I have not sowne; I am worthy to be destitute, because I have not laid up in store; I deserve that my request should now be denied me, sith when the poore made request unto me, I refused to releeve them: I have deserved to sigh and la∣ment so long as God shall be God; I have deserved, that this worme of conscience shall gnaw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine entrails for ever and ever, by representing unto mee the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle pleasure that I have en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyed, and the great felicity which I have lost, and how far greater that was which I might
<PB N="154" REF="90"/>
have gained, by forgoing that little which J would not forgoe. This is that immortall worme that shall never dye, but shall lye there everlastingly gnawing at the entrailes of the wicked, which is one of the most terri∣ble paines that can possibly be imagined.</P>
<P>Peradventure thou art now perswaded (good Reader) that there can be added no more un∣to this, than hath beene said: But surely the mighty arme of God wanteth not force to cha∣stise his enemies more &amp; more: for all these paines that are hi∣therto rehearsed, are such as doe appertaine generally to all the damned: but besides these ge∣nerall paines, there are also
<PB N="155" REF="90"/>
other particular paines, which each one of the damned shall there suffer in divers sorts, ac∣cording to the quality of his sinne. And so according to this proportion, the haughty and proud shall there be abased and brought low to their great con∣fusion. The covetous shall bee driven to great necessity. The glutton shall rage with conti∣nuall hunger and thirst. The lecherous shall burne in the ve∣ry same flames which they themselves have enkindled. And those that have al their life time hunted after their pleasures and pastimes, shall live there in continuall lamentation and sor∣row. But because examples are of very great force to move our
<PB N="156" REF="91"/>
hearts, I will bring onely one for this purpose, wherby some∣what of this matter may the better be perceived. It is writ∣ten of a certaine holy man, that he saw the paines (in spirit) of a licentious and worldly man in this sort. First, he saw how the divels that were present at the houre of his death, when hee yeelded up his ghost, snatched away his soule with great rejoy∣cing, and made a present there∣of to the Prince of darkenesse, who was then sitting in a chaire of fire, expecting the comming of this present. Immediately af∣ter that it was presented before him, he arose up out of his seat, and said unto the damned soule, that he would give him the pre∣heminence
<PB N="157" REF="91"/>
of that honourable seat, because he had been a man of honour, and was alwaies ve∣ry much affected to the same. Incontinently after that he was placed therein, crying and la∣menting in that honourable tor∣ment, there appeared before him two other most ougly di∣vels, and offered him a cup full of most bitter and stinking liquor, and made him to drinke and carouse it up all perforce; saying, It is meet, sithence thou hast beene a lover of precious wines and bankets, that thou shouldest likewise prove of this our wine, whereof all we doe use to drinke in these parts.</P>
<P>Immediately after this there came other two, with two fiery
<PB N="158" REF="92"/>
trumpets, and setting them at his eares, began to blow into them flames of fire, saying, This melody have we reserved for thee, understanding that in the world thou wast very much delighted with minstrelcie and wanton songs: and sodainly he espied other divels, loaden with vipers and serpents, the which they threw upon the breast and bellies of that miserable sinner, saying unto him, that for somuch as he had beene greatly delight∣ed with the wanton embracings and lecherous lusts of women, he should now solace himselfe with these refreshings, instead of those licentious delights and pleasures, which he had enjoy∣ed in the world. After this sort
<PB N="159" REF="92"/>
(as the Prophet <HI>Esay</HI> saith in the 47. Chapter) when the sinner is punished, there is given measure for measure, to the end, that in such a great variety and propor∣tion of punishments, the order and wisedome of Gods justice, might the more manifestly ap∣peare.</P>
<P>This vision hath Almighty God shewed in spirit to this ho∣ly man for advertisement and instruction, not that in hell these things are altogether so mate∣rially done, but that by them we might understand in some man∣ner the variety and multitude of the paines which bee there appointed for the damned. Whereof, I know not how some of the Pagans have had a
<PB N="160" REF="93"/>
certaine knowledge: for a <HI>Poet</HI> speaking of this multitude of paines, affirmed, That although he had a hundred mouthes, and as many tongues, with a voice as strong as Iron, yet were they not able onely to expresse the names of them. A Poet he was that spake this, but truely therin he spake more like a Prophet or an Evangelist than a Poet. Now then, if all this evill shall most assuredly come to passe, what man is he, that seeing all this so certainely with the eyes of his faith, will not turne over the leafe, and begin to provide for himselfe against that time? Where is the judgement of men now become? Where is their wits? yea, where is at least their
<PB N="161" REF="93"/>
selfe-love, which seeketh ever∣more for his owne profit, and is much afraid of any losse? May it be thought that men are be∣come beasts, that provide onely for the time present? Or have they peradventure so dimmed their eye-sight, that they cannot looke before them? Hearken (saith <HI>Esay)</HI> O yee deafe and ye blinde, open your eyes that you may see; Who is blinde but my servant? And who is deafe but wee, unto whom I have sent my messengers? And who is blind, but he that suffereth himselfe to be sold for a slaue? Thou that seest so many things, wilt thou not suffer thy selfe to see this? Thou that hast thine eares open, wilt thou not giue eare hereun∣to?
<PB N="162" REF="94"/>
If thou beleeve not this, how art thou then a Christian? If thou beleeve it, and doest not provide for it, how canst thou be thought a reasonable man? <HI>Aristotle</HI> saith, That this is the difference betweene opinion and imagination, that an imagi∣nation alone is not sufficient to cause a feare, but an opinion is a for if I doe imagine that a house may fall upon mee, it is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enough to make me afraid, un∣lesse J beleeve or have an opi∣nion it will be so indeed: fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then it is sufficient to make mee afraid. And hereof commeth the feare that murderers al∣waies have, by reason of the suspition they conceive, that their enemies doe lye in wai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="163" REF="94"/>
for them. If then the opinion and onely suspition of danger is able to cause the greatest cou∣rage to feare, how is it that the certainty and beleefe of so ma∣ny and so great terrible miseries which are farre more sure than any opinion) doth not make thee to feare? If thou perceivest, that for these many yeares past thou hast led a licentious and sinfull life, and that at the last, according to present justice, thou art condemned to these horrible torments in hell: if al∣so there appeare by probable conjecture, that there is no more likelihood of thy amend∣ment for ensuing years to come, than there was in those already past, how happeneth it, that run∣ning
<PB N="164" REF="95"/>
head long into so manifest a danger, thou art not at all a∣fraid? Especially, considering the sinfull state wherein thou livest, and the horrible paines and torments which doe attend for thee, and the time which thou hast lost, and the endlesse repentance which thou shall have therefore in the most hor∣rible torments of hell. Assured∣ly, it goes beyond the compasse of all common sence and con∣ceit of humane reason, to consi∣der, That there should be such negligent, wilfull, grosse, and carelesse blindnesse, able to en∣ter and take such deepe rooting in the soule of man.</P>

<PB N="166" REF="96"/>
telleth thee, that thou hast a judge above that seeth all the steps and motions of thy life and that certainely there shall a day come, when he will require an account of thee, even for every idle word. This faith teacheth thee, That a man is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> altogether at an end when he dieth, but that after this tempo∣rall life, there remaineth ano∣ther everlasting life; and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the soules die not with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bodies, but that whiles th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> body remaineth in the grave untill the generall day of judge∣ment, the soule shall enter into another new country, and into a new world, where it shall have such habitation and company as the faith and workes we

which it had in this life. This faith telleth thee also, that both the reward of vertue, and the punishment of vice, is athing so wonderfull, that although the whole world were full of bookes, and all creatures were writers, yet should they all be wearied, and the world come to an end, before they should end their description, and make a perfect declaration what is comprehended in each one of these points. This faith infor∣meth thee also, that the debts and duties which we owe to Al∣mighty God, are so great, that albeit a man had so many lives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s there be sands in the Sea, yet would they not suffice, if they were al employed in his service.
<PB N="168" REF="97"/>
And this faith likewise telleth thee, that vertue is such an ex∣cellent treasure, that all the trea∣sures of the world, and all that mans heart can desire, are in no sort comparable unto it.</P>

If this matter were to be discus∣sed with reason, surely this al∣ready spoken might suffice to prevaile with any reasonable creature: for not onely in be∣holding almighty God upon the crosse, but whethersoever wee doe turne our eyes, wee shall finde, that every thing crieth out to us, and calleth upon us to receive this so excellent a bene∣fit: for there is not a thing crea∣ted in the world (if wee duely consider it) but doth invite us to the love and service of our Saviour Jesus Christ, insomuch, that looke how many creatures there be in the world, so many preachers there are, so many

<P>And how is it possible then, that so many callings as these are, so many promises, so many threatnings, and so many pro∣vocations, should not suffice to bring us unto him? What might almighty God have done more than he hath done, or pro∣mised more greater blessings than hee hath promised, or threatned more grievous and horrible torments than he hath threatned, to draw us unto him, and to plucke us away from sinne? And yet all this not∣withstanding, how commeth it to passe, that there is so great (I will not say arrogancy, but)

Oh, what doth the worme of thy consci∣ence say unto thee, whiles thou art in such a fond securitie and confidence, continuing in such a dissolute and wicked life as thou doest?

to see thine owne misery, in sensible to understand thine owne perdition, and harde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than any Adamant, to feele the hammer of Gods word.

Oh, how

much better had it beene for thee, never to have been borne, if thou shalt be damned in the horrible pit of hell for ever, where the torments are perpe∣tually durable. How much better had it beene for thee ne∣ver to have beene baptised, not yet to have received the Chri∣stian Faith, if through the abu∣sing thereof by thy wicked life, thy damnation shallt hereby be the greater? For if the light of reason onely sufficeth to make the Heathen Philosophers in∣excusable, because they know∣ing God in some degree, did not glorifie him nor serve him (as the Apostle saith in the first to the <HI>Romans)</HI> how much lesse shall hee be excused, that hath

received the light of faith, and the water of Baptisme, yea, and the holy Sacrament of the body and bloud of our Lord and Sa∣viour Jesus Christ, hearing dai∣ly the doctrine of the Gospell, if hee doe nothing more than those Pagan Philosophers have done.</P>
<P>Now, what other thing may we inferre of the premises, but briefly to conclude, That there is none other understanding, none other wisedome, none o∣ther counsell in the world, but that setting aside all the impedi∣ments and combersome dan∣gerous wayes of this life, wee follow that onely true and cer∣taine way, whereby true peace and everlasting life is obtained.
<PB N="181" REF="103"/>
Hereunto are we called by rea∣son, by wisedome, by law, by heaven, by earth, by hell, and by the life, death, justice, and mercy of Almighty God. Hereunto are we also very notably invi∣ted by the Holy Word, spoken by the mouth of <HI>Ecclesiasticus</HI> in the sixt Chapter, in this wise: My sonne hearken to instruction even from the first yeares of thy youth, and in thy latter daies thou shalt enjoy the sweet fruit of wisedome: Approach unto it, as one that ploweth and soweth, and with patience ex∣pect the fruitfull increase which it shall yeeld unto thee. The paines that thou shalt take, shall bee but little, and the benefits that thou shalt speedily enjoy,
<PB N="182" REF="104"/>
shall be great. My son hearken to my words, and neglect not this my counsell which I shall give thee, put thy feet willingly into her fetters, and thy necke into her chaines: bow downe thy shoulders, and carry her upon thee, and be not displea∣sed with her bonds: approach neere unto her with all thy heart, and follow her wayes with all thy strength, seeke for her with all thy diligence, and she will make her selfe knowne unto thee, and after that thou hast found her, never forsake her: for by her shalt thou finde rest in thy latter daies, and that which before did seeme so pain∣full unto thee, will afterwards become very pleasant. Her fet∣ters
<PB N="183" REF="104"/>
shall be a defence of thy strength, and a foundation of vertue, and her chaine shall be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obe of glory: for in her is the beauty of life, and her bonds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the bonds of health. Hether∣to <HI>Ecclesiasticus.</HI> Whereby thou maiest understand in some de∣gree, how great the beauty, the delights, the liberty, and riches of true wisedome are, which is vertue it selfe, and the know∣ledge of Almighty God, wher∣of wee doe intreate. But if all this be insufficient to mollifie our stony hearts, lift up thine eyes, and fix thy thoughts con∣stantly to behold our omnipo∣tent God in his mercy and love towards sinners upon his dying crosse, where he made full sa∣tisfaction
<PB N="184" REF="105"/>
for thy sinnes. There shalt thou behold him in this forme: his feet nailed fast, look∣ing for thee; his armes spread abroad to receive thee, and his head bowing downe, to give thee, as to another prodigall sonne, new kisses of peace and attonement. From thence hee calleth thee (if thou wouldest heare) with so many callings and cries as there be wounds in his whole body. Hearken thou therefore unto these voyces, and consider well with thy selfe, that if his prayer be not heard that hearkeneth not unto the cries of the poore, how much lesse shall he be heard, that ma∣keth himselfe deafe to such cries as these, being the most merci∣full
<PB N="185" REF="105"/>
cryings of our loving Savi∣our, and intended for our soules salvation. Who is he that hath not cause to resolve himselfe wholly into teares to weepe and bewaile his manifold offences? Who is he that can lament, and will not lament at this? unlesse he be such a one as seeth not, nor careth what great ship∣wracke, waste, and havocke he maketh of al the riches and trea∣sures of his soule.</P>
