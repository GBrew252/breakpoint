<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Statutes of <HI>Bankrupts,</HI> and the Proceedings thereup∣on (to any persons who en∣tertain the least Commerce, and know the World but at an ordinary rate) will certainly appear to be very im∣portant; and not only in respect of the greatness of the Estates, the variety and multiplicity of Debts, Credits and Accounts, about which they are
<PB REF="3"/>
concerned (the effects whereof are derived down upon thousands of Fa∣milies) but also in regard of the ex∣tream Severities and Penalties which are inflicted on the Offenders. And I have often wondred, that so little hath been written on a Subject which makes <HI>so great a Figure</HI> a∣mongst Men of Business, either at <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> or upon the <HI>Ex∣change.</HI> Nay, I may add (to carry on this Reflection a little further) the concerns of Bankrupts, which were heretofore almost wholly managed within the Precincts of our Capital City or famous Marts, are now des∣cended into Country-Towns and Vil∣lages, so that it is become a matter of Publick Consideration.</P>
<P>There are but two (that I know of) who have designedly Treated on this Subject: Mr. <HI>Serjeant Stone,</HI> who was a Learned Lawyer and the grea∣test Commissioner in his time, hath left us his Readings on one of the Sta∣tutes against Bankrupts; which are indeed full of Moot-Cases, ingeni∣ously contrived, but there are not
<PB REF="3"/>
many stated Resolutions; the Cases of Services, Tenures, Seisins, Ward∣ships, and the like, are not practica∣ble now; and besides, he hath ap∣plied his Reading to one Statute on∣ly, and that the first; whereas the defects of that Law hath been abun∣dantly aided and supplied by subse∣quent Statutes, so that He cannot be sufficiently directive in this Grand Concern: And Mr. <HI>Billinghurst,</HI> who, for so much as he hath attempted, is Acceptable; but we must say, he hath done little more than to improve the method to which the Statutes themselves naturally lead him; the Resolutions are but few, neither do they extend to thousands of Cases that daily happen in these weighty matters.</P>
<P>Having therefore had some loose Papers, relating to this Subject, brought to my hands, upon perusal of them, I found they might be use∣ful as well for Lawyers as Merchants and other Traders: I considered we are not born meerly for our selves, we are sometimes, at least, obliged to
<PB REF="4"/>
render our selver <HI>serviceable</HI> to the welfare of the Publick Society where∣of we are Members, and to do some∣thing that may be useful for o∣thers. I then (the whole being left to my disposal) made some Addi∣tions and Substractions, as I thought convenient, and moulded them into some Frame and Order; the result whereof is this little Piece (for Volu∣minousness I never affected) which I now present to you. Whereof I think it becomes me to give this short Account:</P>
<P>To address my self then in the first place to the Gentlemen of the Long Robe, I conceive it might be some advantage, not only to cite▪ (under Proper Titles) our Printed Law Cases, and in some places to correct them, (but that very sparing∣ly, for it is expected we should read Reporters in their own Words) but to add some Cases not extant, which I have observed in the Course of my Profession. I have, in some measure, considered the Learning of Declarati∣ons and Pleadings upon Actions
<PB REF="4"/>
brought by the Assignees of the Com∣missioners, the usefulness whereof I need not stand to Illustrate. The Forms and Presidents (tho' I have not displayed all the <HI>Arcana</HI>'s of the Commissioners Practice) will be suf∣ficient to give such hints and helps to an ingenious inquisitive Mind, as thereby to enable him, upon occasion, to frame Instruments of the like na∣ture. In which let me recommend the President of the <HI>Scire Facias</HI> upon a Judgment recovered by the Bankrupt against an Executrix, which I take to be the exactest in its kind, and which was found in the Manuscripts of Mr. <HI>Pynsent,</HI> a very Judicious Practiser and Prothonotary of the <HI>Common Pleas</HI> (now deceased.)</P>
<P>As for the Merchants and Trades∣men, the advantage of a Treatise of this Nature will appear if we consi∣der them as Creditors or Debtors, and into one of these two Ranks we may generally cast them. For, it is mo∣rally impossible to think that a Mer∣chant can make a solemn Protestati∣on in this sort; <HI>I owe to no Body,</HI>
<PB REF="5"/>
<HI>and no Body owes to me.</HI> Affairs of this nature cannot admit of such even Ballances: If we consider the prospects and allurements of Advan∣tage and Profit, the insinuations of Business, the Twistings and Links of Commerce; in short (I say) if we reflect on the Revolutions, Movements and Intreagues of Trading, we may then find reason to pronounce, that no Trading Merchant (while he con∣tinues such) can say to his Shop▪ Book (which is as restless as that watry and unstable Element) <HI>hither∣to shalt thou go and no further.</HI></P>
<P>You who are not not only dipt, but drencht in Debt, may see here how to manage your Concerns with so much Prudence, as to avoid those dangerous Shelfs on which thousands of Families have been irrecoverably ruin'd. For I am very confident, ma∣ny have committed, or suffered such Acts of Bankrupcy, which they ne∣ver understood would bring them within the Compass of the Statutes, but have thought that it only consist∣ed in Absconding or downright Run∣ning.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>You who are Creditors, may in this receive hints how to secure your Debts in time, and to be precautio∣ned not to be too forward in any fraudulent Contrivances, when you are sensible your Debtor is a Bank∣rupt, tho' no Commission be award∣ed out against him: And also how, and in what time you are to be re∣lieved by the Statutes, and whether you are such Creditors who are capa∣ble of Relief.</P>
<P>It must be granted, and it's the subject of pity rather than scorn, that many good Men may, and do insensibly sink and decay in their E∣states, either by losses at Sea or Land, living up to support a Credit, and shoar up a Reputation (no mean Mystery in this World) or by the fa∣tal and hidden determinations of Pro∣vidence, which will sometimes baffle human designs, and will teach us not to ascribe Success always to our own Industry: And therefore frequently presents Instances to confirm the truth of the Wise Mans Observation, <HI>The</HI>
<PB REF="6"/>
<HI>Battle is not always to the Strong, neither Bread to the Wise, nor yet Riches to Men of Ʋnderstanding.</HI></P>
<P>A Bankrupt, by Fraud, I always hated, I mean one that breaks on pur∣pose to raise a Fortune by the ruin of others; tho' my Charity and Rea∣son will induce me to believe such are not very ordinary. To leave a dear Family to the taunts and scorns of inconsiderate and insulting Fools, to roll about the World ones self like an Outlaw or a Fugitive, certain∣ly are not things of choice, they are in no wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e amiable. If such Mon∣sters are to be found, I conceive our Laws are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fevere enough against them. But I regret the proceedings against Bankrupts by Accident, (if we must allow of that distinction) and am sorry they are involved in the same Penalties.</P>
<P>But I must digress no further. I have only to add, My design in this is for the Publick Good of my Countrymen: And upon that score I must rely upon the Readers pardon
<PB REF="6"/>
for my Mistakes: However, if he will be so inexorable as not to grant me a total discharge from my Errors, yet I hope my honest intentions may molli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie him into some reasonable composition for them.</P>

shall not pay or otherwise compound for the same within six months next after the same shall grow due, and the Debtor be Arrested for the same, or within six months after an Original Writ sued out to recover the said Debt, and notice thereof given unto him, or left in writing at his or their Dwelling∣house, or last place of abode; or being Ar∣rested for Debt, shall after his or her Ar∣rest lie in Prison two months or more upon that or any other Arrest or Detention in Pri∣son for Debt; or being Arrested for the sum of One Hundred Pound or more of just Debt or Debts, shall at any time after such Arrest escape out of Prison, or procure his enlargement by putting in Common or Hired Bayl shall be adjudged a Bankrupt. And in the said cases of Arrest, or lying in Pri∣son for such Debt or Debts, or getting out by Common or Hired Bayl, from the time of his or her said first Arrest.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>This Description consists of these several parts.</HEAD>
<P>1. ABsconding or withdrawing him∣himself, and that is Four Ways.</P>
<P>1. By departing the Realm. Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> in his Lecture, puts this Case. If a man<NOTE PLACE="marg">Departing the Realm.</NOTE> depart the Realm, and long time after his departure becomes <HI>non solvent,</HI> his absenting himself in such a Case brings him within the Statute of Bankrupts, p.
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
133. It seems otherwise, For suppose a Wealthy Merchant goes beyond Sea with a good Cargoe, and states his Ac∣counts with his Creditors, who know of his Voyage, and are pleased therewith, and he sends over several effects to them, and they trust him in the way of Mer∣chant-factor; and after five or seven years space, he by Losses becomes <HI>non∣solvent,</HI> and abides beyond Sea; I con∣ceive this is not within the Statute. For the Statute of 17 <HI>Eliz. c.</HI> 7. saith, That this withdrawing or absenting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> must be on purpose to defraud his Cre∣ditors; and this can never be construed so; and we must imagin after his <HI>non∣solvency,</HI> he must stay to get up his Eects.</P>
<P>2. Departing from their Dwelling∣houses.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Departure from his House.</NOTE> It need not be a total departure; for as it is rightly put, If one that hath an House, and yet absents for fear of Arrest, for a time, and then returns, yet he is a Bankrupt. Suppose a man hath no Dwelling-house, but sojourns some∣time at one place, and sometime at ano∣ther, yet if he appear not at his usual times or places of Trade as formerly, nor can be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound as formerly, this is within the words of 13 <HI>Eliz. c.</HI> 7. or <HI>otherwise absent himself.</HI> So a Lodger in a Chamber. Yet Query: For if he sometimes absent himself, and at other<NOTE PLACE="marg">Denial to be at home.</NOTE> times when he thinks himself safe from Arrests, appears publickly, as upon the
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
open <HI>Exchange,</HI> this seems to be a pur∣ging of absenting or withdrawing him∣self before, as it was held in the Case of <HI>Hind</HI> the Banker, who was sometimes de∣nied at his House, tho' within; yet af∣terwards appearing upon the open <HI>Ex∣change,</HI> 'twas held in that Case, that this appearing publickly purged such his de∣nial or absence.</P>
<P>3. Keeping their Houses. 20 <HI>Jac. B. R. Taylor</HI> and <HI>Hills</HI> Case. It was resolved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keeping his House.</NOTE> That the keeping within his House, unless to defraud and delay Creditors, makes him not a Bankrupt. But if he conceal him∣self for Debt, for which he is sued, and to delay and defraud his Creditors, tho' but for an hour, this makes him a Bank∣rupt. <HI>Palmers Rep. 325. Haylor</HI> and <HI>Hall.</HI> Yet it is adjudged, <HI>Croke, Eliz.</HI> Fo. 13.—If a Trader, on notice of Process issued forth against him, keeps in to se∣cure himself from the Arrest, and after goeth forth again; and then upon like notice keeps his House, and then goeth forth again, this brings him not within the Statutes; because he useth to go at large, and he may be met with one time or other. But <HI>Quere</HI> of this Resolution. For if this be Law, then I do not un∣derstand the words in 1 <HI>Jac. c. 15. or begin to keep his or her House:</HI> And also certainly this is a keeping in to delay and hinder Creditors, 17 <HI>Eliz. c.</HI> 7. If the keeping in be to defraud or delay
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
the payment, he is a Bankrupt: And Serjeant <HI>Stone</HI> faith well, <HI>Fo.</HI> 10. If a Trader absents himself for fear of being Arrested by a Writ <HI>de Excommunicato Cap.</HI> Or if a Decree in Chancery be made against him to execute a Conveyance, and he keeps in, or withdraws himself for fear of being Attached for not perform∣ing the Decree; such withdrawing doth not make him a Bankrupt. <HI>Aliter,</HI> Per∣haps if such Decree had been for pay∣ment of Mony, as it was held in the Case of one <HI>Albyn,</HI> a <HI>Turky</HI> Merchant. If a Church warden (Trader) keeps the Church; that is either a keeping his House, or taking Sanctuary. So if a Miller keep in his Mill, that is a keeping his House.</P>
<P>4. Taking Sanctuary. These were priviledged places formerly, but now the Kings Officers may go into any place. If a Merchant abscond, and list himself a Dragooner in the Kings Service, or buy a Captains place; yet a Commissi∣on may go out against him, this is no protection within the the Statute. If a Trader be prest into the King's Service, I conceive it otherwise.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29"/>II. The next part of the description is, about the Bankrupts being Arrested and Imprisoned: Which is either</P>
<P><HI>Voluntarie &amp; permissive,</HI> and fraudulent, Or, Forced, and so continuing in Prison.</P>
<P>1. Voluntary and permissive, 13 Eliz.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feigned Acti∣ons.</NOTE> c. 27. <HI>If any such Trader shall suffer him or her self willingly to be Arrested for any Debt, or other thing not grown, or due for Monies delivered, Wares sold, or any other just or lawful Cause,</HI> 1 Jac. 15. <HI>Or shall willingly or fraudulently procure him or her self to be Arrested,</HI> 13 Eliz. c. 7. 1 Jac. c. 15. <HI>If any such Trader shall yield him or her self to Prison; this is to be understood of voluntary and feigned Actions;</HI> as run∣ning into the Kings Bench or Fleet.</P>
<P>Or shall suffer him or her self to be<NOTE PLACE="marg">Outlaw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> outlawed. 13 <HI>Eliz. c. 7. 1 Jac. c.</HI> 15. One Outlaw'd in <HI>Ireland,</HI> is not thereby a Bankrupt here; for that the Record is not pleadable here, <HI>Stone</HI> 172. Now the Reason of this Clause is, because by the Outlawry the King is intitled to the Goods, and so seems to be a fraud to the Creditors, which the Law abhors: But if the Debtor reverse the Outlawry, be∣fore the Commission of Bankrupts sued out, it seems otherwise, as Mr. <HI>Billinghurst</HI> conjectures. If it be Reversed for want
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
of Proclamations, all done in the mean time by the Commissioners is void.</P>
<P>If the Jury or Special Verdict, find a Bankrupt Outlaw'd, they must find he was outlawed <HI>in Fraudem Creditorum,</HI> and to that intent, 1 <HI>Keb. 11. Bradford</HI>'s Case.</P>
<P>2. Forced Arrest or Imprisonment, and there the description is this: 1 Jac. c. 15. <HI>If such a Trader (as aforesaid) be∣ing Arrested for Debt, shall after her or his Arrest lie in Prison six Months or more upon that Arrest, or upon any other Arrest, or De∣tention in Prison for Debt, and lie in Pri∣son six Months upon such Arrest or Deten∣tion, shall be judged a Bankrupt.</HI> 21 Jac. c. 19. <HI>If any such Trader</HI> (as aforesaid) <HI>being indebted unto any Person or Persons in the sum of 100 l. or more, shall not pay or otherwise compound for the same within six Months next after the same shall grow due, and the Debtor be arrested for the same; or being Arrested for Debt, shall af∣ter his or her Arrest lie in Prison two Months or more upon that or any other Arrest or De∣tention in Prison for Debt; or being Arrest∣ed for the Sum of 100 l. or more of just Debt or Debts, shall at any time after such Arrest escape out of Prison, or procure his Enlargemement by putting in Common or Hired Bail, shall be adjudged a Bankrupt; and in the said Cases of Arrest, or lying in Prison for such Debt or Debts, or getting out by Common or Hired Bayl from the time of his, or her said first Arrest.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30"/>Observe this difference,</P>
<P>If such Trader owe 100 <HI>l.</HI> and up∣wards, and doth not pay or compound for the same, within six Months next af∣ter the same shall grow due, and the Debtor shall be Arrested for the same, he is a Bankrupt, <HI>per 21 Jac.</HI> 19. But a Clause comes after, And being Ar∣rested for Debt, shall lie in Prison two Months and more; which includes as well under as above an 100 <HI>l.</HI> So that if a Statute-trader owes me 100 <HI>l.</HI> and doth not pay it or compound for it within six Months after its due, and he be Ar∣rested for it, this makes him a Bankrupt; and if he owe me 20 <HI>l.</HI> and shall be Ar∣rested for it, and lie in Prison two Months, this makes him a Bankrupt. <HI>Durus Sermo.</HI> The Act saith, if he do not compound; suppose his Creditors will not, then he must of necessity lie in Pri∣son; (<HI>upon any other Arrest or Detention for Debt.)</HI> I conceive the meaning of these words are, for Debt originally, and not Debt by reason of a Fine imposed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For the Statute hath respect to Creditors, either by way of Contract, Exchanging, Buying, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and not Fines or Amercia∣ments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which no way respect Trade. (or <HI>shall lie in Prison after his or her Arrest two Months or more, on that or any other Arrest, or Detention in Prison for Debt)</HI> on which I will put this Case. One owes 100 <HI>l.</HI> and is Arrested and Im∣prisoned,
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
and in a Fortnights time pays<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lying in Pri∣son.</NOTE> it; and during that Fortnight another Action of 100 <HI>l.</HI> is entred against him, and he pays that in a Fortnights time after; and so another Fortnight he pays a third Action off. <HI>Quere</HI> if this be with∣in the Statute lying two Months or more on that or any other Arrest. I conceive not. For by that payment he is dischar∣ged from that Debt, and so not in Pri∣son on that account.</P>
<P>But the Case which Mr. <HI>Billinghurst</HI> puts. Suppose (saith he, <HI>p.</HI>—) a man be Arrested upon a Bond before the day of payment, as by the Custom of <HI>London</HI> he may, and lie in Prison two Months, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Quere</HI> is, whether this be such an Arrest for Debt as is within the Sta∣tute. It seems doubtful. For tho' it be <HI>debitum in praesenti,</HI> and so a release of all Debts shall extend to it; yet it is not properly a Debt within the words or in∣tent of the Statute, for that must be such a Debt for which a Cause of Action is given; and there can be no cause of Action properly, till the forfeiture, for the Obligation is guided by the Conditi∣on; and the Custom of <HI>London</HI> will not help it: For the Custom is not, that he shall be Arrested for the Payment of the Mony, but to find better Sureties. And the Statute only intends Detention in Prison for a just Debt really due. But I submit my reason to the Judicious Rea∣der.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="31"/>Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> puts a Question. If a man remaining in Prison six Months at the Suit of the King, makes him a Bankrupt? It may be Answered, if it be for a Debt, it doth; if on a Criminal Matter it doth not.</P>
<P>The next part of the Description is, 21 <HI>Jac. c.</HI> 19.</P>
<P>If such a Trader being indebted unto any person or persons, in the Sum of One Hundred Pounds or more, and shall not pay or otherwise compound for the same within six Months next after the same shall grow due, and the Debtor be Arrested for the same, or <HI>within six</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">After an Origi∣nal Writ sued out.</NOTE> <HI>Months next after an Original Writ sued out to recover the said Debt, and notice thereof be given unto him, or left in wri∣ting at his or their Dwelling-House, or last place of abode.</HI> This is plain, and needs no explanation. It was resolved in the Court of Kings Bench, on a Tryal a∣gainst Sir <HI>Anthony Bateman, Term. Mich.</HI> 1671. That one may become a Bankrupt, by reason of a Suit in the Exchequer, altho' the Statute speaks only of Origi∣nal Writs; for the Statutes shall have a beneficial construction. <HI>Per Hales.</HI></P>
<P>The next is per Stat. 21 Jac. c. 19.</P>
<P><HI>If such Trader (as aforesaid) being Ar∣rested</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Escape.</NOTE> <HI>for the Sum of</HI> 100 l. <HI>or more of just Debt, shall at any time after such Arrest</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Common Bayl.</NOTE> <HI>escape out of Prison, or procure his Enlarge∣ment</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
<HI>by Common or Hired Bail, he shall be adjudged a Bankrupt; and in the said Cases of Arrest, or lying in Prison for such Debt or Debts, or getting out by Common or Hired Bail, he shall be adjudged a Bankrupt from the time of his first Arrest.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose one so Arrested lies in Prisons three Terms, and no Declaration comes in against him, and he by course of Law is let out at Common-Bayl, <HI>Quere,</HI> if he be within the Statute: for that is a Legal Course; and the word (procure) in the Statute is taken <HI>in malam partem.</HI></P>
<P>The next is, per 21 Jac.</P>
<P><HI>If such Trader shall by himself, or others</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Protections.</NOTE> <HI>by his procurement, obtain any Protection or Protections, other than such person or per∣sons as shall be lawfully protected by the pri∣viledge of Parliament, shall be adjudged a Bankrupt.</HI></P>
<P>This is plain, All Protections are with∣in this Statute, except Parliament Pro∣tections duly obtained.</P>
<P>The next is,</P>
<P><HI>Or if such Trader shall prefer or exhibit</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Petition to com∣pound or pro∣cure time.</NOTE> <HI>unto his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, or unto any of the Kings Courts, any Petiti∣on or Petitions, Bill or Bills against his or her Creditor or Creditors, or any of them; thereby desiring or endeavouring to compel or enforce them, or any of them to accept less than their just and principal Debts; or to</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
<HI>procure time or longer days of payment, than was given at the time of their Original Contracts, shall be adjudged a Bankrupt,</HI> Statute 21 Jac. c. 19.</P>
<P>But if the Debtor call his Creditors to∣gether, and they grant him License for longer time, this Act makes him not a Bankrupt; this is no fraud, nor intenti∣on to defraud.</P>
<P>The last part of the description is about Frauds; and that is in two Paragraphs.</P>
<P>1 Per Stat. 1 Jac. 15. <HI>If such Trader</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fraud as to Goods.</NOTE> (as aforesaid) <HI>shall willingly or fraudulently procure his or her Goods, Mony or Chattels to be Attached or Sequestred, shall be adjudg∣ed a Bankrupt.</HI> But then note, That this must be of the Parties immediate procu∣ring, and not by his meer Default or Latchess. For the words of the Statute are <HI>willingly and fraudulently;</HI> therefore Mr. <HI>Stone,</HI> p. 172. is right in this Case. A Merchant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> hath an Impropriate Rectory; the Choire is not repaired, the Tythes are sequestred; it is no Sequestra∣tion within this Statute; for tho' this is his default in not repairing the Church, yet it is not of his immediate procuring. So in Cases of other Attachments out of any Court.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33"/>2. Per Stat. 1 Jac. 15. <HI>If any such Tra∣der</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lands or Goods.</NOTE> <HI>shall make, or cause to be made any fraudulent Grant or Conveyance of his, her or their Lands or Tenements, Goods or Chat∣tels, to the intent, or whereby his, her or their Creditors, being Subjects born (but</HI> Per 21 Jac. <HI>it extends to all Strangers) shall or may be defeated or delayed for the reco∣very of their just and true Debts, shall be adjudged a Bankrupt.</HI></P>
<P>But for the further explication of this last Paragraph about fraudulent Sales and Conveyances, I shall shew</P>
<P>What Sales and Conveyances, made by the Bankrupt, shall be said to be fraudulent within this Statute, and what not; I mean as to make him a Bankrupt: for as for what Con∣veyances shall be adjudged fraudu∣lent in this Statute in reference to Purchasers, I shall consider after∣wards.</P>
<P>And they may be considered two ways.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Either such as are made long before he becomes a Bankrupt. Or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Such as are made some short time before; for what is done after the time of Bankrupcy is totally void.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>But first I shall observe any one single Act of these descriptions is sufficient to
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
make such Trader (as aforesaid) a Bankrupt. And that (as by the Pream∣ble of the several Statutes against Bank∣rupts it appears) the main intent of the Statutes is to relieve Creditors against Frauds and Deceits; tho' in some of the forementioned descriptions a delaying of Creditors is provided against, as the ly∣ing in Prison six Months, or two Months, or not paying or compounding, <HI>per 21 Jac. &amp;c.</HI> yet Fraud and Cheat lies, or should lie at the bottom of all; and I understand not the distinction of a Bank∣rupt by Fraud, and a Bankrupt by Ac∣cident, which I find in some of our Books, as the Laws have been expounded.</P>
<P>Any Fraudulent Conveyance within the Stat. 13 <HI>Eliz. &amp; 25 Eliz.</HI> is within this Clause. But I shall not stand upon the explication of those two Statutes, it being a distinct Head from my present purpose; but shall come to set down some Cases, wherein Conveyances and Sales, made by the Bankrupt, have been adjudged Fraudulent, and which make him such.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Rules for the Constructions of the Sta∣tutes, and when the Bankrupcy shall be said to Commence.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Statutes having made a full description of the Bank∣rupt; do then order how, and in what manner the Commissioners shall act. Before we fall directly upon that, I shall name two or three things out of these Statutes which are necessary and useful to be known. As,</P>
<P>Note 1. <HI>Per Stat. 21 Jac. c.</HI> 19. These Statutes of Bankrupcy are favourably to be construed for the Creditors, being made for the suppression of Fraud. <HI>Vide</HI> this explained in many Cases hereafter;
<PB N="40" REF="36"/>
and yet this should not be too far ex∣tended. For the Statutes are highly pe∣nal, and my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Remark is good, <HI>It is an hard case to torture Laws, that they may torture Men.</HI></P>
<P>Note 2. By Stat. 13 <HI>Eliz.</HI> He that is a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alien.</NOTE> Bankrupt must be a Subject born in the King's Dominions or Denizen.</P>
<P>One is born in the <HI>Isle of Man.</HI> Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> seems, that he cannot be a Bank∣rupt, because it hath been adjudged that it is not parcel of the Realm. But with∣out dispute it is within the Kings Domi∣nions; and the King grants it to a Sub∣ject, and by the precedent Rule the Sta∣tute must be construed favourably for Creditors.</P>
<P>A Denizen of <HI>Ireland</HI> may be a Bank∣rupt within the intent of the Statute.</P>
<P>One born in a Ship on the Coast of <HI>Flanders,</HI> may be said to be born in the Kings Dominions.</P>
<P>If the Husband be an Alien, and the Wife a Subject; or the Wife an Alien, and the Husband a Subject; by Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> it's all one as to Goods, they are both within the Statute, but the Lands are the Kings. Yet I cannot conceive, that if an Alien marry a Subject Woman, of a great Fortune, that he can be within the Statute, for he is no Subject nor De∣nizen; and in such case I never heard of a naturalization by an Apron-string.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="36"/>But by the Proviso in 21 <HI>Jac. c.</HI> 19.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alien▪ Denizen.</NOTE> That Act, and all other Acts made against Bankrupts shall extend to Aliens, and they shall be subject to the Laws as Bankrupts, and capable of the benefit as Creditors.</P>
<P>Note 3. When the Commission is to be sued out, and the effect of it; by the Statute 21 <HI>Jac.</HI> It is provided, that no Purchaser, for good and valuable consi∣deration, shall be impeached by vertue of any of the Statutes of Bankrupts, un∣less the Commission to prove him or her a Bankrupt, he sued forth against such Bankrupt, within five years after he or she shall become a Bankrupt. In o∣ther Cases I find no time limited for the taking out the Commission; tho' its with∣out doubt the sooner the better for the Creditors. <HI>Vide postea Tit.</HI> Settlement, Pur∣chasers; and the Proviso, that the Commis∣sion must be sued within five years after some time when he became a Bankrupt, 1 <HI>Keb. 12. Bradford &amp; Bludworth.</HI></P>
<P>Note 4. From what time the Bank∣rupcy shall commence, per Stat. 21 <HI>Jac. c. 19. If any such Trader</HI> (as aforesaid) <HI>being Arrested for one hundred pounds, or more, of just Debt or Debts, shall after such Arrest escape out of Prison, or procure his Enlargement by Common or Hired Bail; he shall be adjudged a Bankrupt from the time of his first Arrest.</HI> Also by the said Sta∣tute,</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="37"/><HI>If such Trader, being indebted unto any person or persons in the sum of</HI> 100 l. <HI>or more, shall not pay, or otherwise compound for the same within six Months next after the same shall grow due, and the Debtor be arrested for the same, he shall be ad∣judged a Bankrupt from the time of his said first Arrest.</HI> For the Statute saith in the said Cases of Arrest, or lying in Prison.</P>
<P>But the Statute doth not mention in the Case of Escape. Yet I conceive it is within the intention, the escaping being a more notorious offence than the o∣thers.</P>
<P><HI>Per Stat. 21 Jac.</HI> A man is only a Bankrupt by relation from the time of his Arrest; when he makes an escape, or comes out upon Common Bail.</P>
<P>A Merchant is imprisoned, and after becomes a Debtor to <HI>A,</HI> and then the six Months pass, <HI>A</HI> is relievable as a Credi∣tor, for he is not a Bankrupt by relation, <HI>per</HI> Mr. <HI>Stone,</HI> p. 182.</P>

<PB N="54" REF="43"/>
did become a Bankrupt within all, or some of the Statutes made concerning Bankrupts; and accordingly we declare him to he a Bankrupt, and to have been so from that time.</P>
<P>But the Commissioners are generally cautious in declaring the Bankrupcy from a certain time, but leave it to a Trial at Law, in case there be any Question or Doubt of it; and this for their own se∣curity against Actions that may be brought against them.</P>
<P>Note. The declaring of the Commis∣sioners whether he be a Bankrupt or not, doth not acquit him or charge him, unless in truth it were so. 2 <HI>Siderfin,</HI> 176.</P>

The Form of which Inhibition you may soon frame, or repair to a Ga∣zett.</P>
<P>It is convenient to fix this in some publick place of the Town or Towns ad∣jacent where the Bankrupt lived; and let them give notice to the Creditors to prove their Debts.</P>

<HEAD>A Warrant to Commit a Person to the Goal who refuseth to be Sworn, and to An∣swer Interrogatories.</HEAD>

B. hath for several years last past sought his live∣lihood by buying and selling of Cattle, Malt and other Merchandise, and there∣by become indebted to several persons in the sum of one thousand pounds and upwards; and whereas upon good and sufficient proof to us made, we have ad∣judged the said A. B. a Bankrupt, to all intents and purposes, within the true in∣tent and meaning of the said several Sta∣tutes made against Bankrupts, some or one of them, before the Date, and su∣ing forth of the same Commission; and whereas J.

B. and was duly summon∣ed to appear before us; but hath made default in contempt of our Authority; but at length coming and appearing be∣fore us, we then sitting in execution of the said Commission, did obstinately re∣fuse to be sworn, and make answer to such Interrogatories and Questions, as we by vertue of the said Commission re∣quired him to answer unto concerning the said A. B. and his Estate, according to the true meaning of the said Statutes, for the discovering the Estate of the said A. B. in contempt of the said Statutes, and of the Commission aforesaid, and the Authority thereby to us given. These are therefore to Will, Require and Au∣thorize you, and every of you, imme∣diately upon receipt hereof, to Appre∣hend, Arrest, and to take into your Cu∣stody the Body of the said J.

<HEAD>The Commissionrs Power in breaking up Houses.</HEAD>
<P>BY the <HI>Stat. 21 Jac. c.</HI> 29. It is enacted, <Q>That in the execution of the said Commission, it shall be Lawful to, and for the said Commissioners, or the greater part of them, or any other Per∣son or Persons, Officer or Officers, by them, or the greater part of them, to be deputed and appointed by their War∣rant or Warrants under their Hands
<PB N="65" REF="48"/>
and Seals, to break open the House or Houses, Chambers, Shops, Warehouses, Doors, Trunks or Chests of the said Bankrupt, where the said Bankrupt or any of his or her Goods or Estate shall be, or reputed to be; and to seise upon, and order the Body, Goods, Chattels, ready Mony, and other Estate of such Bankrupt, as by the said former Laws are limited and appointed, whether it be by Imprisonment of his or her Bo∣dy, or otherwise as the said Commissio∣ners, or the greater part of them shall think meet.</Q></P>
<P>The Commissioners may break open the House of a Bankrupt for Debt of the Debtor; and if the Bankrupt convey his Goods to his Neighbours House, the Commissioners may not, but the Sheriff may break open the House, because he is a sworn Officer of the Kings. The Commissioners may break open the Booth of another to come to the Bankrupts Goods, <HI>per</HI> Mr. <HI>Barckdale, Lect. Lincolns-Inn,</HI> 1627. But <HI>Quaere</HI> if the Commissi∣oners do not now break open any House, Shop or Room where the Bankrupt or his Goods are, tho' they are in the House of a Stranger, <HI>Sed Cave,</HI> for this part of the Statute is very penal, and shall be ta∣ken strictly. And possibly a Judge at a Trial may think that to be Law, which upon mature reflexion appears not to be so.</P>

<P><HI>Per Stat. 1 Jac. c.</HI> 15. It is enacted, <Q>That if upon Lawful Warning or No∣tice left, or made in Writing three se∣veral times at the Dwelling House, <HI>&amp;c. (vide supra)</HI> the Bankrupt shall not ap∣pear, then they may make Proclamati∣on<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proclamation.</NOTE> (<HI>prout supra</HI>) and if then the Bank∣rupt appear not, then the Commissioners are impowred to award a Warrant to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warrant.</NOTE> such sit Person or Persons as they think meet, to apprehend the Body of such Offender, and to bring him, her or

them so offending before the said Com∣missioners, wheresoever the Parties so Offending may be found in place pri∣viledged or not, to be examined by the said Commissioners, or the greater part of them. And if therein the Offender or Offenders shall refuse to be exami∣ned, or refuse to answer fully to every Interrogatory, to him, her or them to be administred by the said Commissi∣oners, or the greater part of them, it shall be lawful for the said Commissio∣ners, or the greater part of them, to commit the said Offender or Offenders to some close or strait Imprisonment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imprisonment.</NOTE> there to remain until he, she or they better conform him or her self.</Q></P>
<P>And by the <HI>Stat. 21 Jac. c.</HI> 19. It is Enacted, <Q>That after such time as any Person shall by the said Commissioners, executing the said Commission, or the greater part of them, be lawfully ad∣judged or declared to be a Bankrupt; the said Commissioners, executing such Commission, shall have Power and Au∣thority to examin upon Oath, the Wife<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wife Examined</NOTE> and Wives of all and every such Bank∣rupt, for the finding out and disco∣vering of the Estate and Estates, Goods and Chattels of such Bankrupt or Bank∣rupts, concealed, kept or disposed of by such Wife or Wives, in their own Per∣son and Persons, or by their own Act

<HEAD>Interrogatories.</HEAD>
<P>AS to Interrogatories, they are to be framed according to the matters to be examined to; tho' some will have ready all the general Interrogatories that will fit the Examinations throughout all the Statutes. Some Commissioners a∣gain will not examine by Iterrogatories at all, for fear of some leading Questi∣ons may make Witnesses frame Evasions. But I cannot commend this way, it be∣ing a sort of careless behaviour, and too slight for such a weighty matter as this, considering the Penalties attending the Offenders against the Statutes. Besides, at a Trial, Depositions may be made use of as Evidence (especially against the party himself, or in case of the Death of Witnesses) and to read a Deposition without referring to Interrogatories, is to judge upon an Answer without know∣ing the state of the Question. I had thought to have inserted here the Forms of some Comprehensive Interrogatories, but there is such variety of Examination in the executing this Commission, that I shall leave that to the Ingenuity of the Commissioners, who may easily form Interrogatories, as the nature of the Case, and the Matter before them shall direct.</P>

The Commissioners may sell all Intail'd Lands (except such whereof the Reversion or Remainder in the King, of the Gift or Provision of the King) and such Sale shall be good a∣gainst the Bankrupt and his Issue, and all those in Remainder or Reversion, which the Bankrupt by common Recovery or otherways might cut off or debar. So that in such Case the Sale by Commissi∣oners shall bar those in Reversion or Remainder, as much as if the Bankrupt himself had suffered a Common Recove∣ry; and observe the words in Stat. 21 Jac. <HI>Cut off or Debar from any Remainder, Re∣version, Rent, Profit, Title or Possibility, in∣to, or out of any Mannors,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I will put this Case. Lands are setled<NOTE PLACE="marg">Contingent Estate. Son.</NOTE> to <HI>A.</HI> and <HI>B.</HI> for their Lives, and after their Deceases, to the use of the first Son of their Bodies, lawfully to be begotten, and to the Heirs Males of such first Son, and for want of such Issue, to the use of the second Son, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Tail Male, and so to the tenth Son. A. becomes a Bankrupt before he hath a Son: Whe∣ther the Commissioners may sell these Lands, and make to the Purchaser a Good Estate? I hold they may; for
<PB N="97" REF="64"/>
tho' A. be not Tenant in Tail, but bare Tenant for Life, yet the words in the Statute being <HI>the Bargain and Sale shall be good against all and every other person and persons whomsoever, whom the Bank∣rupt by Common Recovery or otherwise might cut off and debar from any Remainder, Re∣version, Rent, Profit, Title or Possibility:</HI> It seems this Bargain and Sale shall be good. For A. the Father, before Issue, by his bare Feoffment might destroy the con∣tingent Estate, as it is in <HI>Archer</HI>'s Case. But were the Settlement made so as to support the contingent Remainder (as is usully done) so that the Father could by no means debar it by any act he could do, then it would make a greater Question; and yet if the Commissioners could not sell in such case, as Settle∣ments<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voluntary Set∣tlement.</NOTE> are generally made now; the Act in this Point might be easily eluded. (This is to be understood of voluntary Settlements.)</P>
<P>A Man makes a Lease of certain Lands to A. B. for three Lives to begin after the death of J. S. if the three Lives shall so long live. A. B. becomes a Bank∣rupt. This Lease to A. B. is but a possi∣bility,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Possibility.</NOTE> for J. S. may survive all the three Lives, and so it is a thing not grantable. Yet I think the Commissioners may sell this within the intent of these words; for tho' A. B. cannot properly grant this, yet it is such a thing as he may forfeit or extinguish.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="65"/>A. is Tenant in Tail, Remainder to B. in Tail. B. becomes a Bankrupt, A makes a Feoffment in Fee and dies, and the Commissioners sell these Lands be∣fore B. hath recovered in a Formedon, who shall bring the Formedon? Or whe∣ther the Act doth vest the Estate in the Purchaser, that he may enter, and have Ejectment? I hold that this Sale is good; for tho' the Remainder Man claims no Estate under the Bankrupt, yet the Bank∣rupt by Common Recovery might have barred him; and the Act saith such Bar∣gains and Sales shall be good, and the Assignee shall bring a Formedon.</P>
<P>A Bankrupt commits Felony, the Land shall not Escheat, but the Commissioners<NOTE PLACE="marg">Escheat.</NOTE> may sell it; this is to be understood of a Common Lord.</P>
<P>If one Bargain and Sell his Land, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bargain and Salo, and Bar∣gainor becomes a Bankrupt be∣fore Inrollment.</NOTE> before Inrollment becomes a Bankrupt, this Land may not be sold by the Com∣missioners, according to the Rule put be∣fore by <HI>Jones:</HI> But if he makes a Feoff∣ment, and a Letter of Attorney to give Livery, and then becomes a Bankrupt before the Seism delivered, these Lands in such case may be sold, <HI>B. R. 4 Car.</HI> 1. The reason of the difference is, in the first Case the Bargainee is in by the Bar∣gain and Sale, and not by the Inroll∣ment; and the Bankrupt could not by his own Act defeat this; but no Estate in the other Case passeth at all till the
<PB N="99" REF="65"/>
Livery be executed: And then in the last Case, his Letter of Attorney is re∣vocable, and his becoming a Bankrupt before the Estate executed, is <HI>quasi</HI> a Countermand or Revocation in Law. The first Reason is best.</P>
<P>2. Lands settled in other Mens Names;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lands in other mens names▪</NOTE> in Trust for the Bankrupt.</P>
<P>It is plain these are within the Sta∣tute.</P>
<P>If a Bankrupt grant his Lands or Goods, or transfer his Debts in other Mens Names, except to his Children upon Marriage (they being at the Age of Consent) or upon valuable Considera∣tion, the Commissioners notwithstanding may sell them, and the Sale shall be good.</P>

<HEAD>Of Lands Purchased by, or Descended or Devised to the Bankrupt since he was a Bankrupt.</HEAD>
<P>PER Stat. 13 Eliz. <HI>If any person who is or shall be declared to be a Bankrupt, shall at any time hereafter purchase any Lands, Tenements, Hereditaments Free or Copy, or Offices, Fees, Goods or Chattels; or that any Lands, Tenements, Hereditaments Free or Copy, Offices, Fees, Goods or Chat∣tels shall descend, revert or by any means come to any Bankrupt before such times as Debts due to their Creditors shall fully be sa∣tisfied and paid, or otherwise agreed for, then the said Lands▪</HI> &amp;c. <HI>shall be sold as other Lands,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>which the Bankrupt had at the time of his becoming a Bankrupt. Vid. supra.</HI></P>
<P>This Clause is to be understood of such Lands which descend or revert to him, and which were in a remote possibility of ever hapning. As suppose a Father seised of Lands in Fee, hath issue a Son, and the Father dies, and the Uncle is a Bankrupt, then the Son dies, and the Lands descend to the Uncle, these could not be sold by the Commissioners, with∣out this Clause in the Statute. Tho' Re∣versions after Estates for Life or Years might have been sold by the other Clause of this Statute, or any Estate wherein the Bankrupt hath an Interest <HI>in futuro.</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="66"/>
But tho' a Bankrupt hath the Remain∣der or Reversion in Fee after an Estate in Tail, yet this cannot be sold by Com∣missioners till it fall, because the Tenant in Tail hath power to bar this Remain∣der or Reversion.</P>
<P>Suppose a Judicial Office, or Office of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offices.</NOTE> Trust, which cannot be executed by a Deputy, be granted for Life, and the King grants the Reversion to J. S. for Life, he who hath the Grant of the Reversion becomes a Bankrupt, and then the Office falls, how shall the Commissioners dispose of this Office? They cannot execute it themselves, neither can they put in a Deputy. I conceive if the Officer absents, he forfeits his Office, and then the King grants it over; but this is no relief to the Creditors: Therefore Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> thinks well, the Statute doth not mean such Offices of Trust, which are annexed to the Party; but other Offices of Inheri∣tance, as Keeper of a Forest, Warden of the Fleet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Land is devised to a Bankrupt, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Land devi∣sed to a Bank∣rupt.</NOTE> Commissioners may sell, and the Bank∣rupt shall not wave the Devise.</P>

<P>This is in Case the Bankrupt hath Mortgaged any Lands to another.

It was said, that upon the whole Record it ap∣pears, that the Plaintiff hath not made a good Title to his Action, for he hath al∣ledged the Assignment to be of a Debt of 43 <HI>l. 1 s.</HI> whereas the Debt was but 41 <HI>l. 1 s.</HI> And this being an entire thing, will not pass by the Assignment of a greater Sum: But it was resolved,</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="85"/>1. That it was the same Promise; for if <HI>Gode</HI> himself had brought the Action, he should have recovered upon this Ver∣dict, and the Assignment by the Com∣missioners vests the Debt in the Plaintiff, and he hath the same Remedy to reco∣ver that the Brankrupt had.

<P>2. The Assignment is not in question, and that which they found touching the Assignment is not material; however the Assignment is not laid to be of such a Sum, as by that name, for then the Court inclined to believe it would not have been good, <HI>Allen Rep. p. 28.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of Pleadings in respect of the Statutes of Bankrupcy by the Debtor or by the Commissioners to Actions brought against them, and what Pleas shall be good, and what not.</P>

<P>In Debt on Obligation, the Defen∣dant<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plea, that the Plaintiff was Bankrupt be∣fore Action brought, ill.</NOTE> pleaded, before the Action brought the Plaintiff became a Bankrupt; to which the Plaintiff demurred. <HI>Per Cu∣riam,</HI> it's an ill plea; and until assignment be made, the Debtor is defensless: Pay∣ment before Commission sued out is good enough, and so it is before his Debt is assigned; <HI>quaere de hoc.</HI> Judgment <HI>pro Quer’ 3 Keb. 616.

<P><HI>Det</HI> on Obligation, on <HI>Oyer</HI> the Defen∣dant <HI>protestando</HI> that this Debt was not assigned by the Commissioners of Bank∣rupcy of <HI>Holt,</HI> for plea saith, that this was not due to the Plaintiff, <HI>&amp; alijs Cre∣diroribus</HI> of <HI>Holt;</HI> to which the Plaintiff replied it was so due, and the Defen∣dant demurred specially as double. <HI>Twis∣den</HI> conceived the Replication ill, and that the Assignment to the Plaintiff should be shewed, that being traversable as well as the Bankrupcy: This Case seems not to be well reported here, there∣fore let us see how it is reported three or four Leaves after. In <HI>Det</HI> on Obliga∣tion, Defendant pleads that it was in trust for <HI>Holt</HI> who is a Bankrupt, <HI>&amp; vir∣tute</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bankrupcy tra∣versable as well as the Assign∣ment.</NOTE> <HI>Commissionis quibusdam</HI> Commissioners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this Debt was assigned to <HI>Ashly</HI> and <HI>Penning &amp; alijs Creditoribus, &amp;c.</HI> to which the Defendant demurred specially for doubleness; the Court conceived the Bankrupcy traversable as well as the As∣signment, but the Issue is well enough, 3 <HI>Keb. 710, 737. Jonas</HI> and <HI>Boulton.</HI></P>
<P>Action on the Case, <HI>Indebitatus Assump∣sit</HI> to pay a Debt assigned by the Com∣missioners of Bankrupts; the Defendant pleaded the Statute of Limitations, and that <HI>Causa Actionis non accrevit infra sex</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stat. Limitati∣ons.</NOTE> <HI>Annos.</HI> Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> hath made a <HI>Quaere</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="97"/>
whether he that comes in as Creditor, and hath a Debt made over unto him by the Commissioners, may not be barred by the Statute of Limitations. Mr. <HI>Bil∣linghurst, p.</HI> 129. very roundly answers the matter, that he shall be barred. But it seems this is not within the Statute of Limitations: And certainly the Commis∣sion being dated within the six years, the plea should have been <HI>infra sex an∣nos,</HI> after the Commission. Let us di∣stinguish: If a Commission be not taken out within six years (as it may be so long and longer except in case of Pur∣chasers, for then it must be taken out within the space of five years) then perhaps to this Action, being on Con∣tract, the Defendant may plead the Sta∣tute of Limitations; but if Commission be taken out within the six years, and Assignment made within six years, then the Statute seems to preserve this Debt by the Assignment, it being to relieve Creditors against such base Fraud: But to allow this Knavish Plea to cover for∣mer Knavery of this high Nature, it is intolerable, <HI>Vide in 3 Keb.</HI> 625, 645. in <HI>Coply</HI> and <HI>Dockmins</HI> Case, an <HI>Anonymous</HI> Case cited by <HI>Weston,</HI> that it was ad∣judged in C. B. that this Debt is not with∣in the Statute of Limitations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">On Covenant by Assignee to account.</NOTE></P>
<P>In <HI>Det</HI> on Bond given to the Plaintiff to perform Covenants between the De∣fendant as Assignee, for the benefit of

the other Creditors, and the Commissi∣oners of Bankrupts, which was, <HI>inter alia,</HI> to give an account to the other Credi∣tors, or to either of their Assignees on re∣quest: The Plaintiff said he had not gi∣ven him an account in his Replication; (the Defendant having pleaded perfor∣mance in bar) to which the Defendant demurred, because the Covenant is joint as to Creditors, to which the Court in∣clined, there being a subsequent Clause several as to Assignees, 1 <HI>Keb. 815. Selby</HI> and <HI>VValker:</HI> But <HI>per Keeling,</HI> the Cove∣nant is several, according to the interest and subject matter, and each of the Cre∣ditors may call the party to an account, but the Covenant was by the Defendant and his Brother, which was severally to do their endeavours to bring in the Debts, <HI>&amp; super requisitio’ eis fact’,</HI> they would account; therefore both are bound to account jointly, tho' the Bond is only given by one. Court held it ill, the Plaintiff being no party to the Covenant, <HI>p. 843. Mesme</HI> Case.</P>

<P><HI>Craven &amp; al</HI>' and <HI>Knight,</HI> &amp;c. In Chancery. The Bill sets forth that the Defendant <HI>George Widdowes</HI> being indubt∣ed to the Plaintiffs, became bound to them in several Bonds; and the said <HI>Widdows,</HI> and the Defendant <HI>Berman</HI> for several years past, were Copartners, and <HI>Widdows</HI> by Articles of Copartnership was intitled to two thirds of the whole Stock, and the Defendant <HI>Berman</HI> to one third part; the said <HI>Widdows</HI> and <HI>Berman 25 August</HI> last became Bankrupts, and a Commission of Bankrupcy was awarded again them; the Commissioners of Bank∣rupts assigned all the Estate of the said Bankrupts to the Defendant <HI>Knight</HI> and others, and refuse to let the Plaintiffs Creditors of the Bankrupts to come in, and intend to divide the said Estate a∣mongst the Joint-Creditors of the Bank∣rupts, by reason whereof the Plaintiffs Debts will be utterly lost.</P>
<P>The Defendants insist, that it was agreed by Indenture of Copartnership, that all such Debts as should be owing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joint Debts to be paid out of the Joint-Stock.</NOTE> on the Joint-Account should be paid out of the Joint-Stock; and at the end of the Partnership each Copartner take and receive to his own use his share of the Joint-Stock, and that the Joint-Stock or Trade should not be charged with the private or particular Debts of either of
<PB N="175" REF="103"/>
the Partners, but that each should pay their private Debts out of their particu∣lar Estates, not included in the Joint-Stock: That if both the said Parties should be living at the end of the first three years of the six years, that the said <HI>Berman</HI> should come in Joint-Partner ac∣cordingly; and during the said Joint-Trade, the Copartners became jointly indebted to the other Defendants, <HI>Knight,</HI> &amp;c. in 6000 <HI>l.</HI> and that <HI>Widdows</HI> became indebted to the Plaintiffs, as aforesaid, without the consent of <HI>Berman;</HI> and the Mony due upon the said Bonds was not brought into the Account of the Joint-Stock; and the said <HI>Widows</HI> was only a Surety, and received none of the Mony; and the Defendants insisted, that the Joint-Creditors ought to be first paid out of the Estate of Partnership; and that the Commissioners have no power to grant the Joint-Estate to pay the Plain∣tiffs, they being separate Creditors of <HI>Widdows:</HI> And if a <HI>Surpluss</HI> of the Joint-Estate, after the Joint-Creditors paid, then the Plaintiffs can have but a joint∣moiety of such <HI>Surpluss,</HI> towards their satisfaction, the said <HI>Bermans</HI> moiety be∣ing not liable to pay the said <HI>Widdows</HI> his separate Debts; and the Debts then claimed were the proper Debts of the said <HI>Widdows;</HI> and yet after all the Joint-Debts are paid, there will be an over∣pluss; so that thereby the said <HI>Berman</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="104"/>
will be discharged, and have Mony paid unto him: But if the Plaintiff, and other separate Creditors of <HI>Widdows</HI> be<NOTE PLACE="marg">Separate Cre∣ditors.</NOTE> admitted to the Joint-Estate, there will not be sufficient to pay the Joint-Credi∣tors; so that thereby not only <HI>Bermans</HI> Estate will be applied to pay <HI>widdows</HI>'s Debts, but will be liable to the Joint-Creditors. But there can be no division of the Joint-Estate whereby to charge any part thereof with the private Debts of either Party; and till the Joint-Debts are paid, and till division made of the <HI>Surpluss,</HI> both parties are alike interested in every part of the said Joint-Stock; that the Commissioners have no power by the Commission to administer an Oath to the Plaintiffs for proof of their Debts, they claiming Debts from the said <HI>Widdows</HI> only; and the Commission is against <HI>Widdows</HI> and <HI>Berman</HI> jointly, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Creditors.</NOTE> not severally, and therefore cannot admit the Plaintiffs Creditors.</P>
<P>The Court declared, that the Estate belonging to the Joint-Trade, as also the the Debts due from the same, ought to be divided into moieties, and that each moiety of the Estate ought to be char∣ged in the first place with a moiety of the said Joint-Debts; and if there be enough to pay all the Debts belonging to Joint-Trade, with an overplus, then such overplus ought to applied to pay the par∣ticular Debts of each Partner; but if suf∣ficient

shall not appear to pay all the Joint-Debts; and if either of the said Partners shall pay more than a moiety of the said Joint-Debts, then such Part∣ner is to come in before the said Com∣missioners, and to be admitted as a Cre∣ditor, for what he shall so pay over and above the moiety; and was decreed ac∣co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dingly.</P>

<P>The Lord Chancellor did Decree, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Agreement De∣creed.</NOTE> <HI>Allen</HI> and the rest should be satisfied with ten Shillings in the pound for their Debts, according to their Agreement, certified by the Commissioners, but no abatement of the 400 <HI>l.</HI> paid for the Land, nor of the thirty pound paid for the Mortgage; and withall, that <HI>Allen</HI> should have al∣lowance for Costs of Suit, reasonable; and for this purpose his Lordship made a reference to Sir <HI>John Tindal</HI> to cast up<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reference to a Master to cast up the Estate and Debts.</NOTE> the Estate of the Bankrupt and the Debts, and to certifie what overplus he found for relief of the poor Children.</P>

<P>The Lord Chancellor, upon reading<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 Noc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jac.</NOTE> the Report, gave time to <HI>Allen</HI> to make his election, whether he would keep the Land and pay the Mony, or depart with the Land and receive his Mony.</P>
<P>For that <HI>Allen</HI> made no Election, but insisted upon the advantage, to have the Land for the 400 <HI>l.</HI> which was worth 2400 <HI>l.</HI> and would yield nothing to the poor Children, nor to the Creditors, but dealt so mercilesly with them whose Pa∣rents lost both their lives in following their Suit to be relieved against <HI>Allens</HI> Unchristian and Barbarous Dealings.</P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor did make De∣cree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decree that the Trustee should receive his own Mony, and de∣part with the Estate.</NOTE> that <HI>Allen</HI> should receive the Mo∣ny mentioned in the Report, which is much more than in Equity is any way due unto him, and convey the Lands to <HI>Boles</HI> and <HI>Smith,</HI> two sufficient Men,

<P>The pitiful Cries of the Father and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trustee for not performing the Decree, is com∣mitted.</NOTE> the Mother dying, as is aforesaid, and of the poor Orphans, do call to God for relief, and moved the heart of the Chan∣cellor to take compassion upon them, and to take such order as he hath done.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> Where <HI>Allen</HI> in the Bill of In∣dictment<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indictment, for that the Chan∣cery decreed Lands after Judgment at Law.</NOTE> setteth forth, that he had two Judgments for his Debt in the Common Pleas, before the Suit in Chancery be∣gun, which Judgments he supposeth to be called into Examination by this Suit and Decree in Chancery against him, contra∣ry to the Laws and Statutes.</P>
<P>To this it is answered, <HI>First,</HI> That these Judgments were not alledged by <HI>Allen</HI> in his own Bill against <HI>Edwards</HI> in Chancery, nor in his Answer to <HI>Edwards</HI> Bill, nor in any Replication, Rejoinder, Deposition, Report or Motion in Chan∣cery; neither were they so much as spo∣ken of or informed to any Councel or others, and there is no Order in Chance∣ry concerning those Judgments.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That these Judgments to be a year after <HI>Edwards</HI> became a Bank∣rupt, for he was Bankrupt <HI>Primo Jacobi,</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="111"/>
and the Judgments wore <HI>Secundo Ja∣cobi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> That these Judgments stand in force against the Bankrupts Body, or any Lands or Goods which he should after∣wards obtain, and were not disposed by the Commissioners.</P>
<P><HI>Allen</HI> himself sued out the Commission of Bankrupt with other Creditors, and was first named in the Petition to the Lord Chancellor for getting the Commis∣sion, and attended in person in executi∣on of that Commission at all meetings, by which he himself did decline from the strength of his Judgments, and sub∣mitted himself to be ordered by the Commissioners for his Debt before any Suit in Chancery begun.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> Where <HI>Allen</HI> by his Bill of In∣dictment supposeth his Freehold to be drawn in question in the Chancery, con∣trary to the Statute in <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> it is to be answered, that albeit Freeholds<NOTE PLACE="marg">Freehold Lands ordered in Chancery upon Equity, where the Common Law cannot re∣lieve the Par∣ties.</NOTE> have been always ordered in Chancery upon Equity, where the Common Law cannot help the Parties, yet in this par∣ticular Case it is to be observed, that <HI>Allen</HI> himself was first Plaintiff in the Chancery, and did draw in question the Freehold which then was in Alderman <HI>Boles</HI> his Son by a Mortgage forfeited, for which Freehold to be conveyed to himself, he obtained the Decree in Chan∣cery, and had it conveyed accordingly
<PB N="192" REF="112"/>
upon matter of Equity (<HI>viz.</HI>) because there was but 30 <HI>l.</HI> unpaid of the Mort∣gage Mony.</P>
<P>Therefore if the Chancery did well when it dealt with the Freehold for <HI>Allen;</HI> why ought not the Chancery upon a new Matter of Equity, make Decree against <HI>Allen</HI> to depart with the same Freehold again, when he would have Land worth 2400 <HI>l.</HI> to the defrauding of Creditors and poor Orphans, and in abuse to the Commissioners of Bankrupts and Court of Chancery.</P>

<P>THAT no Compulsory Order be granted to Creditors to conform themselves, and agree unto any Rate or Composition at the Suit and Petition of the Debtor or insolvent himself, but on∣ly at the Suit of the Creditors, in imi∣tation and according to the Equity of the Statute of Bankrupts.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="112"/>That where such Suits are exhibited in the behalf of the Creditors, it be not enough that the Creditors are na∣med in the Bill or Petition; but that there shall be always affixed to the Bill or Petition the agreements of the Cre∣ditors under the Hands and Marks of so many as have agreed, with a recital of the Sums and Times of their particular Debts.</P>
<P>That to the end there may be a ground of Information unto the Court, what the Debts are in truth, which otherwise may be but in shew; there shall always be before any Order is granted, a Re∣ference made to some of the Masters of the Court, or other Commissioners upon due Examination, to certifie the Court what the Debts are in truth, and of what Nature, and upon what Security; before which Masters and Commissio∣ners shall also be heard the Informati∣ons and Allegations of such Creditors as have not compounded.</P>

R. being so indebted to your Orator in such a great sum of Mo∣ny; and sometime in the year 1661▪ he the said J. R. failing in his Estate, and becoming Bankrupt, your Orator for the recovery and gaining his said Debt out of the Estate of the said J. R. he himself being gone beyond the Seas, your Ora∣tor did sue forth his Majesties Commissi∣on, grounded upon the several Statutes made concerning Bankrupts, against him the said J. R. and accordingly the same
<PB N="249" REF="140"/>
was granted and issued forth against him at the sole Instance and Petition of your Orator on the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> in the <HI>13th</HI> year of, <HI>&amp;c. Anno Dom.</HI> 1661. directed to J. P. R. A. Esquires, J. L. H. N. and R. H. Gent. the major part of which said Commissioners did put the said Commis∣sion in Execution, and sate several times in the said year 1661. And after for the discovering and finding out of the Estate of the said J. R. And having so done, did agree by, and with the con∣sent of the other Creditors of him the said J. R. that came into the said Commis∣sion, that your Orator, and one E. M. of, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> another of the said R.'s Credi∣tors that was come into the said Com∣mission, should be Assignees of the Estate of the said J. R. and should be impower∣ed by them the said Commissioners by Deed of Assignment under their Hands and Seals, to gather in and receive the same Estate in trust, and for the use of themselves and all other the Creditors of the said J. R. that should duly seek re∣lief by the said Commission, and towards satisfaction of their several Debts; but not∣withstanding such Agreement and Consent of the Commissioners and Creditors, the said Commissioners sometime afterwards, at the instigation of the said E. M. and of P. S. another of the Creditors who was come into the said Commission, and had before consented to your Orators being
<PB N="250" REF="141"/>
one of the Assignees, as is afore-menti∣oned, did make their Deed or Deeds of Assignment of the said J. R.'s whole E∣state, of a very considerable value in Goods, Debts and Monies, amounting to 3000 <HI>l.</HI> and upwards, to them the said P. S. and E. M. to both whom the said R. was indebted 100 <HI>l.</HI> or thereabouts, your Orator being a Creditor for 2400 <HI>l.</HI> as afore is mentioned; part of which said Estate was inserted in a Schedule, annex∣ed to one part of the said Assignments; a Copy whereof is also hereunto affixed.

R. by the ma∣jor part of the said Commissioners, by one or more Deed or Deeds of Assign∣ment under their Hands and Seals, and impowred to recover, gather in and re∣ceive the same Estate in trust for the use of your Orator, and other the general Creditors of the said J. R. that should duly seek relief by the said Commission; they the said P. S. and E. W. did enter into a Covenant under their Hands and Seals, to, and with the said Commissio∣ners to give and render unto them upon reasonable request, an account of whatso∣ever Monies they, or either of them should receive and gain in of the said J. S. and relating to his Estate, and pay and satisfie the said Monies to them the
<PB N="251" REF="141"/>
said Commissioners, to the end the same might be by them divided equally a∣mongst all the Creditors of the said J. R. that should come into the said Commis∣sion, proportionable to their several Debts. And your Orator further shew∣eth, that they the said P. S. and E. M. being so intrusted, as aforesaid, did re∣cover and gain in several great sums of Mony which belonged to the Estate of the said J. R. and did keep the same in their own hands for several years, a∣mounting to 2000 <HI>l.</HI> or more, for which hitherto they, or either of them have not given any account, the said Com∣missioners themselves, who might have called them to such account, according to their Covenants, being deceased. Whereby they the said Assignees have for several years kept all the said Monies, and intend still so to do, and to pay no pro∣portion of the same to your Orator for his said great Debt of 2400 <HI>l.</HI> or to the o∣ther Creditors, to your Orators know∣ledge, without they be compelled there∣unto by order of this Honourable Court, contrary to all Equity and Good Consci∣ence.

R.'s Estate, for, and in respect of his said Debt of 2400 <HI>l.</HI> and proportionable thereunto▪ And to that purpose, that the said P. S. and E. M. may bring in a true and particular account upon their Oaths, of all the Estate that hath been heretofore assigned to them by the said Commissioners, the same being in trust, as afore-mentioned, and declare whether they have had one or more Assignments made to them of the same, together with the Dates thereof, and the Cove∣nants therein contained, and whether they sealed the Counterpart of such As∣signment, and may set forth a true par∣ticular of how much of the said Estate hath been received by them, or either of them, or under them, and of, and from whom, and when, and may de∣clare upon their Oaths, what other Cre∣ditors of the said J.

<PB N="261" REF="146"/>
J. E. were a Man that did seek or get his Living by Buying and Selling, and that the said J.

And if it be likewise true, That the said Complainants, and others of the Credi∣tors of the said J. E. did the <HI>28th</HI> day of <HI>J.</HI> last, being the <HI>28th</HI> day of <HI>J. Anno Dom.</HI> 1631. become Suiters to the Right Honourable the Lord Keeper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for a Commission upon the Statutes of Bankrupts, to be awarded against the said J. E. and that thereupon a Commission was awarded the <HI>29th</HI> Day of <HI>J.</HI> now last past, directed to the Commissioners in the Bill named, or to any four or three of them. And if it be true, That the said Commissioners have begun to put the said Commission in Execution, and have found that the said J. E. being indebted to the said Complainant and others, did in the Month of <HI>December, Anno Dom.</HI> 1626. begin to keep his House, and absent himself from his Cre∣ditors, and that the said J. E. did there∣by become a Bankrupt, as by the said Bill is set forth. This Defendant for De∣murrer to the said Bill sath, that if all
<PB N="262" REF="147"/>
the said Surmises and Allegations were true, yet the said Complainants, of their own shewing, ought not thereupon to be relieved either in Law or Equity; for this Defendant saith, that the said Com∣missioners, by vertue of the said Commis∣sion, had not any thing to do with any of this Defendants said Leases, neither were the same Leases any way subject to the said Commission, for that it appeareth of the Complainants own shewing, that the said Leases were made for good consi∣deration of Mony, paid long before the said J. E. did become a Bankrupt (that is to say) the said first Lease made by the said J. E. unto this said Defendant, and the Redemise thereupon made by this Defendant to the said J. E. were both made in consideration of 240 <HI>l.</HI> paid by this Defendant to the said J. E. to secure unto him this Defendant, the sum of 30 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> out of the Mesuages or Tenements thereby Demised for 21 years. And the said later Leases, as it appears of the Complainants own shew∣ing, was made after a forfeiture of the Redemise made by this Defendant to the said J. E. and after a forfeiture of a Bond of 300 <HI>l.</HI> and the same was only made to secure the subsequent payments of the said Rent of 30 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI> And this Defendant saith, that the said first Lease, and the said Redemise, being so as aforesaid, made in <HI>June, Anno Dom.</HI>
<PB N="263" REF="147"/>
1624. and in the <HI>22th</HI> Year, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this De∣fendant then could not prognosticate that the said J. E. would become a Bank∣rupt in <HI>December</HI> 1626. which was two Years and six Months after the making of the said Lease and Redemise; for which cause, and because it appeareth of the Complainants own shewing, that the said Lease and Redemise were made for the consideration of 240 <HI>l.</HI> and to secure to this Defendant 30 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> for 21 Years, and were made two Years and six Months before the said J. E. did become a Bankrupt: And because the Complainants by their Bill do set forth a good Title both in Law and Equity to this Defendant, of, and in the Mesuages, Lands and Tenements in question, but do not shew nor derive to themselves any Title at all thereunto, either in Law or Equity, neither by Grant nor Assign∣ment from the Commissioners, nor o∣therwise; therefore this Defendant doth Demur, and abide in Law upon the in∣sufficiency of the said Bill, and doth humbly demand Judgment of this Ho∣nourable Court, if he, this Defendant, shall be compelled to make any answer thereunto. And for further Cause of Demurrer to the said Insufficient Bill, this Defendant saith, That the Title set forth by the Complainant by their said Bill to the Leases in question, or to the Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments
<PB N="264" REF="148"/>
thereby Demised, is no good Title in Law or Equity. For if it be true, That the Commissioners, upon these Statutes of Bankrupts, did Assign and Appoint the Complainants to pay and tender un∣to this Defendant the sum of 240 <HI>l.</HI> with Interest, and in such manner as by the said Bill is suggested; and Assign and Appoint them to take from this Defen∣dant an Assignment or Conveyance of the Leases made to this Defendant of the Lands in the Bill mentioned, to the be∣nefit and behoof of the Complainants, and of the other Creditors of the said J. E. yet the said Commissioners had no power by any the Statute or Statutes of Bankrupts, or by their Commission, ei∣ther to Assign or Appoint the Complai∣nants to pay or tender unto this Defen∣dant any sum or sums of Mony, or to Assign or Appoint this Defendant to As∣sign or Convey the said Leases or Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments thereby Demised. For which Cause also, and because there is no matter of Equity contained in the said Bill, but the said Commissioners do thereby indeavour to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oid a plain, honest and lawful contract made for just and valuable consideration two Years and six Months before the said J. E. became a Bankrupt, this De∣fendant doth Demur in Law upon the insufficiency of the said Bill, and doth humbly demand the Judgment of this
<PB N="265" REF="148"/>
Honourable Court, if he, this Defendant, shall be compelled to make any answer thereunto. And for Plea in Bar to this said Bill, this Defendant saith, That the said J. E. and F. his said Wife in the Term of the Holy Trinity, which was in the <HI>22th</HI> Year, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by one Fine ac∣knowledged, and Levied before his then Majesties Justices of his Court of Com∣mon Pleas at <HI>Westminster,</HI> did grant unto this Defendant all, and singular the Me∣suages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the said Indenture of the <HI>12th</HI> and <HI>14th</HI> days of <HI>June,</HI> in the said <HI>22th</HI> Year, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mentioned by the names of three Mesuages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the Appur∣tenances in the Town of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> and in the Parish of St. <HI>Michaels:</HI> To have, and to hold to this Defendant, from the Feast of St. <HI>John Baptist</HI> then next follow∣ing, for the Term of 21 Years and 28 Days then next following, and fully to be compleat and ended, as by the said Fine remaining upon Record in his Ma∣jesties said Court of Common Pleas ap∣peareth. And therefore this Defendant demandeth the Judgment of this Honou∣rable Court, if against the Indenture of the said J. E. under his Hand and Seal, made for the consideration of 240 <HI>l.</HI> con∣fessed by the Complainants to be paid, and the same Indenture acknowledged by the said Complainants to be made two Years and six Months before the said J. E. did become a Bankrupt; and if
<PB N="266" REF="149"/>
against the said Fine, the said Complai∣nants, as Creditors to the said J. E. upon a bare surmise, that the Commissioners upon the Statute of Bankrupts, have ap∣pointed them the said Complainants to pay 240 <HI>l.</HI> and this Defendant to Assign or Convey his Interest to the said Com∣plainants; the said Complainants shall be received to Complain in this Honourable Court. All which Matters this Defen∣dant is ready to maintain as this Honou∣rable Court shall award, and humbly prays to be dismissed forth of the same, with his reasonable Costs and Charges in this behalf most wrongfully sustained.</P>

<P><HI>Hillary</HI> 1687.</P>
<P><HI>John Butcher</HI> Plaintiff, exhibited his Bill against <HI>Ben.

<P>THAT <HI>Butcher</HI> and <HI>Short</HI> were<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill.</NOTE> Partners in 1669. in the <HI>Norway</HI> Trade for Timber used in Rebuilding <HI>London</HI> for seven years, two years of which <HI>Butcher</HI> was in <HI>Norway.</HI> And having occasion for Mony to pay Bills before the Goods could be disposed of, <HI>Short</HI> employed <HI>Hinton</HI> as Banker, who paid and received several sums on the joint Account▪ and not suspecting any unjust dealing two years after accepted the Account <HI>Hinton</HI> gave, without examin∣ing the <HI>Items.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Butcher</HI> and <HI>Short</HI> being forc'd to trust great quantites of Goods, su∣stained great Losses; <HI>Hinton</HI> finding them in sudden Exigences to pay Bills, took advantage and prepared Accounts of
<PB N="268" REF="150"/>
Mony paid and received, in which <HI>Hin∣ton</HI> made them Debtors 4000 <HI>l.</HI> and pre∣tended there was no Error or Over∣charges, desired Bonds for the said bal∣lance, declared it should be no prejudice, and if any Errors, it should be rectified, and the Security should be for no more than should appear to be due: They sign∣ed the Account and gave Bonds.</P>
<P>That after <HI>Hinton</HI> received and paid divers sums on Account on the Partner∣ship, and perceiving they were forc'd to give great Credit, and being in great Exigences to pay Bills of Exchange and other occasions in Trade, took advan∣tage and drew up another Account, and Bonds, and required them to execute the same, which they were forced to do, else he threatned to ruin them by bringing Actions on the Penalties; and being Conscious he had wronged them, con∣trived to avoid a re-examination, <HI>Dec.</HI> 4. 1675. pretending there was above 6000 <HI>l.</HI> due, and that he was pressed by his Creditors, and could not pacifie them unless he and his other Creditors would become bound; but <HI>Butcher</HI> al∣ledging there was not so much due, and the Partnership being ended, and their Debts divided, was unwilling to enter into new Bonds for more than his own part, and be discharged of <HI>Shorts</HI> part, and have the Bonds and Securities deli∣vered up, and the new Bonds to be sub∣ject
<PB N="269" REF="150"/>
to the same examination the old ones were, and to make good no more than a moiety, which <HI>Hinton</HI> agreed to; and agreed that he and <HI>Short</HI> should be bound for 2000 <HI>l.</HI> And <HI>Hinton</HI> promised to deliver up the old Bonds, and <HI>Butcher</HI> should be discharged of all former Bonds, and <HI>Hinton</HI> executed two Receits on the <HI>4th</HI> of <HI>Decemb.</HI> 1675. one of 4000 <HI>l.</HI> and the other of 2500 <HI>l.</HI> being the sum de∣manded to be due on the old Bonds, and they sealed new Bonds for 6300 <HI>l.</HI> with <HI>Hinton</HI> to his Creditors.</P>
<P>That <HI>Hinton</HI> took Counterbonds of <HI>Butcher</HI> and <HI>Short</HI> to save him harmless, and they having paid above 3000 <HI>l.</HI> and <HI>Hinton</HI> delaying to deliver up the old Bonds, or to come to a fair Account, <HI>Butcher</HI> brought a Bill to compel him thereto, but <HI>Hinton</HI> threatned to ruin him unless he would execute a General Release, and give new Bonds, which he was compelled to do on <HI>Hinton</HI>'s promise, that he would come to a fair Account, and no use should be made thereof, but to secure what was justly due: And thereupon he executed such Release and new Bonds.</P>
<P>That <HI>Hinton</HI> failing, a Commission of Bankrupcy was awarded against him, and he declared a Bankrupt: And all the Bonds were assigned to <HI>Sedgwick, Sitt∣well</HI> and <HI>Hill,</HI> to whom <HI>Butcher</HI> applied himself to have the old Bonds, Release

and Security delivered up and cancelled, and that the Accounts might be exami∣ned, being willing to pay what should appear to be due (if any thing due on his Account,) which the Assignees refu∣sed to do, and threatned to sue the old and new Bonds, and recover the Penal∣ties, tho' he had paid much on the new Bonds. And in looking over the Ac∣counts found divers Errors, Omissions and Miscomputations, and made his Ac∣counts to carry 12 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> Interest, and had charged near 3000 <HI>l.</HI> for Inte∣rest at 12 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> and that thrown into several Ballances, Interest was again charged at 12 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> which was In∣terest upon Interest at 12 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> and <HI>Hinton</HI> had several sums of Mony in his Hands which he received, so that he charged the Plantiff with Interest in ef∣fect for his own Mony 12 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> and Interest for that Interest at 12 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> and had overcharged for Prises of Dol∣lers: And no allowance made for Mo∣ny the Partners paid on <HI>Hinton</HI>'s Account, nor of Mony paid the Assignees; so that the Plaintiff was wronged 5000 <HI>l.</HI> the Plain∣tiff hoped the Account should be unra∣velled, being willing to pay what is due on a fair Account, if any thing on his part due.

<P><PB N="271" REF="151"/>That <HI>Hinton</HI> and <HI>Short</HI> would lay the whole on the Plaintiff, and refused to produce the Books of Accounts and Bonds; That the same might be produ∣ced, and old and new Bonds delivered up, and satisfaction on Judgments ac∣knowledged, if any be, and the Accounts examined and liquidated, and the Plain∣tiff on paying his part of what (if any thing) be due on his part, and that the Defendants might answer, and the Plain∣tiff be relieved, Is the substance of the Bill.</P>
