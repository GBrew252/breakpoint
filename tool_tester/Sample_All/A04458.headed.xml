<HEAD>The Apologie of the Churche of Englande.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T hathe ben alwaies an olde complainte, euen from the tymes of the Patryarkes &amp; Prophets, and confyrmed by the writings &amp; testimonies of all ages, y<SUP>t</SUP> Truth dwel∣leth as a straunger here vpon earthe: and sone findeth enemies and slaunderers amonge suche as do not knowe her.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tertull. in Apologetic<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> The whiche thing althoughe perad∣uenture it maie seeme incredible vnto others,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Trew religi∣on was al∣waies slaūde∣red amonge men.</HI></NOTE> suche as haue not diligently marked these thinges: specially by∣cause y<SUP>t</SUP> the whole ofspringe of mankinde by very course of nature, without a teacher, euen of his owne inclina∣tion coueteth after truth: and Christe himselfe our sa∣uioure, what tyme he was here conuersante amongest men, called himselfe the Truth, as by that name which moste aptly did expresse all diuine power: neuerthelesse we that are exercysed in the holy Scriptures, and haue redde and seene what hathe happened in manner to all godly men of al ages, euen vnto the Prophets, vnto the Apostles, vnto the holy Martyres, &amp; vnto Christ hym∣selfe: w<SUP>t</SUP> what reproches, what reuylinges, what slaun∣derous names thei were vexed here in their life time for onely truthes sake: we I say do se, that it is a thing not onely nothing new nor incredible, but also very currant and cōmon to all ages. Mary on the other side it might seeme muche more merueylous and vncredible: in case that the Deuyl, the very father of lyes and enemie to al truth, shoulde nowe sodainely change his naturall dis∣position, &amp; hope to fynde some other way then by lying, to oppresse the truth: or that by other sleyghtes then
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>
suche as he hathe alwaies vsed, hee shoulde nowe beginne to establishe his kingedome. For oute of all re∣cordes you shall scantly finde any time, (other whyles religiō was newly growing and encreasing, or after it was staied and setteled, or when it began to sprynge a∣gaine (wherin truth and innocency amongest men was not moste vnworthyly and most shamefully entreated: for the Dyuill seeth, whiles truth preuaileth, he can not preuaile nor keepe his owne.</P>
<P>For to passe ouer, and to speake nothing of the times of y<SUP>e</SUP> auncient Patriarkes &amp; Prophets, in whose dayes, as I haue sayde before, there was no season voyde of slaunders and reproches against the truth. We knowe that there were certaine persons that sayde and openly pronounced of y<SUP>e</SUP> auncient Iewes, (of whom we doubt not, but they worshypped the onely and the trew God) that in stede of God they worshipped other a Sowe or an Asse:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cor. Tacitus. Tertul. in A∣pologetico. cap.</HI> 7. <HI>C. Plinius.</HI></NOTE> and that all their religion was nothing els but a sacrilege &amp; a contempt of al diuine power. We knowe that the sonne of God, oure sauioure Iesus Christ, for teachinge of the truth, was taken for an enchaunter, for a worker of mischiefe, for a Samaritane, for Beel∣zebub, for a deceiuer of the people, &amp; for a man that fo∣lowed his delite in eatinge and drinkinge. And who is ignorant of those thynges that were spokē in time past agaynste that moste earnest setter forthe &amp; champion of the truth S. Paule: somtime that he was a seditious person, that hee gathered souldiers, that hee entended vprore: sometimes that he was an Heretike, sometyme that he was madde, somtimes that onely to make strife and for his pleasure, he blasphemed the lawe of God, &amp; despised the ordinaunces of the fathers? Who knoweth
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
not how that S. Stephan,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 26. <HI>Epiphanius.</HI></NOTE> so sone as he had receaued into the inwarde bosome of his mynde the truth, and had begon freely (according as he was bounde) &amp; stout∣ly to preache it and to professe it, was by &amp; by brought to pleade for his life, as though he had wickedly spoken blasphemy againste the lawe, against Moses, againste the Temple, &amp; against God? Or who is ignorant that there were men in tymes paste, whiche accused the holy Scriptures of lyes, saying that they conteined thinges plaine contrary and repugnant one to an other: &amp; that the Apostles did dissent euery one frō an other,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Marcion ex Tertull. Aelius è Lactantio.</HI></NOTE> &amp; Paule from them all? And least it should be to longe to reherse all, for that were infinite: who is ignorannt, howe that oure Fathers whiche firste began to acknowledge and to professe the name of Christe, were slaunderously re∣ported of,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euse. li.</HI> 5 <HI>ca.</HI> 2 <HI>Tertul.</HI> 3. <HI>A∣pologetico.</HI> 1.2.3. <HI>&amp;</HI> 7.8.9.</NOTE> that thei conspired togither amongest them∣selues, and that in their secret assembles thei had consul∣tations against the state ouer the cōmō welth, and that euen therefore their meetings were apointed before day in the darke, that thei kylled yonge children, filled them selues wyth mans fleshe, and lyke moste cruell beastes, dranke mans bloode, &amp; howe that at the laste, when the candels were out, thei committed adultery and incest at auenture togither, the brother with the syster, the sonne with the Mother, withoute any reuerence of kyndred, without shame, withoute difference, euen a sorte of wicked men, withoute all religion, withoute God, ene∣mies of mankinde, men vnworthy to beholde the light, vnworthy of lyfe.</P>
<P>All these thinges in those daies were spoken against y<SUP>e</SUP> people of God, against Christe Iesus, against Paul, against Stephan, and againste al those that in the pri∣mitiue
<PB REF="4" MS="y"/>
Churche embraced the truth of the Gospel, and were content to be called by the name of Christians, a name in those daies very odious amongest the people. And albeit those thinges were not trew, yet the Deuill thought it inough for him, if at the least he coulde bring it to passe, to cause them to be taken for trewe, and that the Christians should be hated of al men, and by al men persequuted vnto the death. Wherfore Kings and Prin∣ces leadde by suche perswasions, killed the Prophets of God, euen to the laste man. Esaie thei condemned to the sawe, Ieremy to be stoned, Daniel to the lyons, Amos to the club, Paule to the sworde, Christe to the crosse, al Christian men to prisons, to tortures in horses bellyes, to the gallowes, to rockes, to cliues, to wilde beastes, to fyers. Yea &amp; thei sticked not to make great bonefiers of their liuing bodies, onely for a light to serue them in the night season,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sueton. Tran∣quil. in Nero.</HI></NOTE> &amp; for a scorne, of whom thei made none other accompt then as of moste vile donge, &amp; as of ac∣cursed persons appointed to be slaine for Sacrifice, and to be a scorne of all the worlde. Thus I say the maine∣tainers and professors of the truth hathe bene alwaies delte withall.</P>
<P>So muche the more ought we that haue taken vpō vs the profession of the Gospel of Iesus Christ, to take it in better parte, if in the same quarel we be handled af∣ter the same sorte, and like as oure forefathers in tymes paste, so we at this day, without any oure desert, onely bicause we teache &amp; professe the truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Timoth.</HI> 4.</NOTE> are vexed with slaunderous names, reproches and lyes.</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Slaunders deuysed by Papistes.</HI></NOTE>1. Nowe a daies thei crie euery where, that all we are Heretykes, that we are departed from the faithe, &amp; that we with oure newe perswasions and wycked doctrine,
<PB REF="4"/>
haue brokē the cōsent of the Churche: That we do raise,<MILESTONE N="2"/> as it were out of Hell, and restore to life againe olde He∣resyes, &amp; such as longe agoe were condemned. We sowe <MILESTONE N="3"/> abroade newe sectes and furious fansies, that neuer be∣fore were hearde of: Also that we nowe are deuided in∣to <MILESTONE N="4"/> contrary factions &amp; opinions, &amp; could neuer agree by any meanes among our selues: That we ar wicked mē,<MILESTONE N="5"/> &amp; make war after the māner of y<SUP>e</SUP> Giauntes (as the fable is) against God himselfe, &amp; do liue altogither w<SUP>t</SUP>out care or reuerence of God: That we do despise al good dedes,<MILESTONE N="6"/> and vse no discipline of vertue, maintaine no lawes, no customes, no equitie, no iustice, no right. That we loose y<SUP>e</SUP> bridel to al mischiefe, &amp; allure the people to al kynde of licence and luste: That we go about and seke how al the <MILESTONE N="7"/> states of Monarchies &amp; kingdomes might be ouerthro∣wen, and that all thynges might be broughte vnto the rashe gouernment of the people, &amp; to the rule of the vn∣skilful multitude: That we haue rebelliouslye withdra∣wen <MILESTONE N="8"/> our selues from the catholike Churche, and shaken the whole world with a cursed schisme, &amp; haue troubled the cōmon peace &amp; the general quietnes of the Churche: and that lyke as in tymes paste Dathan and Abiron seuered themselues from Moses and Aaron, so we at this daye departe from the Pope of Rome without any sufficient &amp; iuste cause: As for the authoritie of the aun∣cient <MILESTONE N="9"/> fathers and olde Councelles, we do set at naught. All auncient ceremonies, suche as of oure grandfathers <MILESTONE N="10"/> and great grandfathers nowe many ages paste, when better manners and better daies did florish, were appro∣ued,<MILESTONE N="11"/> we haue rashely and arrogantly abolyshed: &amp; haue broughte into the Churche by our owne priuate autho∣ritie, without any commaundement of any holy and sa∣cred
<PB REF="5" MS="y"/>
generall Counsell, newe rites and ceremonies: And that we haue done all these thinges not for any respecte of religion, but onely of a desire to maintaine strife and contention. As for them, they haue changed vtterly no∣thinge at all, but all thinges euen as they receiued them from the Apostles, &amp; were approued by the moste aun∣cient fathers, so they haue kepte them from age to age vnto this daye.</P>
<P>But now, least thei shoulde seme onely to picke qua∣rels, and to speake euell of vs in corners, onely to the intent to brynge vs into hatred, the Romyshe Byshops haue prouided themselues of certaine men, eloquente y∣noughe and not vnlearned, for to vndertake this despe∣rate cause, and to set it forth with bokes and long orati∣ons, to the intent that the matter being cōningly hand∣led after the best fasshion, the simple and ignorant man might suppose there were somwhat in it: for truely thei sawe how their cause began to decline in al places, how their sleights wer now espied, and therefore lesse set by, and that their Garrysons decaied euery daie: and ther∣fore their cause to be such, that it had great nede of helpe. Now as touching those thinges whiche thei do obiecte against vs, parte of them are manifestly false, and euen by the iudgment of the selfe same persons that do obiect them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A generall aunswere.</HI></NOTE> condemned for lies: parte of them, although they bee as false as the other, yet in asmuche as thei carrye a shewe and a counterfeat of truth, in suche the symple reader if he take not hede, specially, if vnto the probaby∣litie of the matter, the painted &amp; delicate speache of these fellowes be cunningly applied, may easilie be entrapped and caried out of the waie: part of thē againe ar such as we oughte not to decline from them as crimes, but as
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
thinges right well and aduisedly done, to acknowledge &amp; to professe them: and euen to tell you at a word how the matter goeth, these men do slaunder all our doings, euen those thinges whiche them selues can not deny to be wel and ordrely done, and as thoe it were not possy∣ble that any thinge should be other done or spoken wel of vs, so all oure sayinges and doinges thei moste ma∣litiously depraue. No doubt, it hadde been their part to haue gone more simply and more playnely to worke, yf thei had ment to deale truly, whereas now nother tru∣ly nor courteouslie nor Christianly, but couertly &amp; craf∣tily thei assault vs with lyes: abusinge the blindnes of the people and the ignoraunce of Princes, to bringe vs into hatred and to oppresse the truth: this is the power of darkenes &amp; proprety of men, that for the furtherance of their cause, haue more confydence in the blockishnesse of the vnskilfull multitude, &amp; in darkenes then in truth and light, &amp; as S. Ierome saith, of such as with closed eyes do barke against the manifest truth. But we gyue thanks vnto the almighty God, that our quarel is such that euen these men woulde thei neuer so faine, can say nothing in reproche therof: whiche might not be tour∣ned in reprofe of the fathers, of the Prophets, of the A∣postles, of Peter, of Paule, and of Christe himselfe.</P>
<P>Now then in case it be lawfull for these men in rai∣linge and speaking euil to be thus lowde and eloquent,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Slaunders that tende to∣wardes blas∣phemye, muste be cō∣futed.</HI></NOTE> truly we in our iuste quarell answeringe for the truth, ought not to be dumme and specheles, for thei that haue noe regarde what is saide of them selfe or of their qua∣rell, althoe it be falsly &amp; slaunderously spoken, specially when it is suche, as thereby the maiestie of God and the state of religion is blasphemed, thei surely declare them
<PB REF="6" MS="y"/>
selfe to be dissolute men, and suche as carelesly and wic∣kedly do winke at the iniuries done to y<SUP>e</SUP> name of God. For albeyt many times other greate and greuous iniu∣ries of a sobre and a Christian man may be borne with∣al and dissembled: neuerthelesse who that paciently can endure to be accounted an Heretike, suche a one Ruffine was wont to denie to be a Christian. Wherfore we will now do that thinge, whiche all lawes, whiche the very voyce of nature commaundeth to be done, and whyche Christ him selfe being in the like matter in like sort rai∣led vpon, did before vs, y<SUP>t</SUP> is to say, we wil giue a repulse to the accusations of these men, and modestly and trulie defende oure cause and oure innocency. For Christ what time he was accused by the Pharises of sorcery, as one that had familiaritie with Deuills, and did many thin∣ges by their helpe:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ioan.</HI> 8.</NOTE> I (saith he) haue no Deuill, but I glorifie my father, and you haue dishonored mee. And Paule, what time as Festus the leutenante contemned him as a madde man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 26.</NOTE> I (saith he) noble Festus, am not mad as thou thinkest, but I speake the wordes of truth and of sobrenesse. And the Christians of the primitiue Churche what time as thei were iniuriously slaundered vnto the people as murderers of men, adulterers, inces∣tuous persons, and troublers of commō wealthes, and sawe that by such slaunders the religiō which thei pro∣fessed, mighte bee broughte in question, specially if thei should seme by their silence in manner to acknoledg the fault:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quadratu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Iustinus. Molitol. Tertuli and others.</HI></NOTE> least I say, this silence sholde hinder y<SUP>e</SUP> course of the Gospell, thei made orations, thei wrote supplications, &amp; spake before Emperours and Princes in the open de∣fence of them and of theirs.</P>
<P>As for vs, inasmuche as within these .20. yeares laste paste, so many thousandes of our brethrē, in the middest
<PB REF="6"/>
of their extreme tormēts, haue borne witnes to y<SUP>e</SUP> truth, &amp; Princes coueting to bridel y<SUP>e</SUP> Gospell, in moyling ma∣ny waies, haue lobored all in vaine, and that the whole worlde in manner beginneth now to open their eies to beholde y<SUP>e</SUP> light, we thinke that our cause is already suf∣ficiently pleaded &amp; defended: and that wheras the matter it selfe speaketh inough for it self, there is no great neede of words. For if the Popes themselues would, or rather if thei coulde consider wyth them selues the whole mat∣ter, the beginnings and the māner of the encrease of out religion, how that their trasshe in manner euery white when no man touched it, withoute all helpe of man sell downe to the grounde: againe how our profession at the first, not withstandinge the continual resistence of Em∣perors, of so many Kynges, of Popes &amp; Bishops, of all men in māner, hath encreased, and by litle &amp; litle spred o∣uer al the earth, and now also at the length is entered in to the Courtes and Palaces of kings: euen these things onely might be sufficient tokens wherby to vnderstand, that God himself doth fight in our defence, and skorneth from heauen all their endeuours, &amp; that so mighty is the power of truth, y<SUP>t</SUP> no force of man nor yet Hel gates can withstand it. For be ye sure, so many free cities, so many kings, so many Princes as at this day haue abandoned the sea of Rome, and adioyned themself to the Gospel of Christe, are not become madde.</P>
<P>And albeit peraduenture hetherto the Popes haue had no leisure to thinke aduisedli &amp; earnestly vpō these mat∣ters, or if now at this day they be letted &amp; encombred w<SUP>t</SUP> other busines, or if thei take these kinde of trauails to be base &amp; light matters, &amp; to appertaine nothing to the ma∣iestie of a Pope, yet our cause oughte to seeme therefore neuer a whit the worse. Nother, if perhaps thei wil not
<PB REF="7" MS="y"/>
see these thinges whiche thei do see, but rather fighte a∣gainst the knowne truthe, ar we therefore by and by to be taken for Heretikes, whiche do not apply our selues to their will?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pius the .iiii.</HI></NOTE> Truly if Pope Pius had ben the man, I saye not, whiche he desiereth to be taken for, but if he were at the least suche a one, as had accounted vs to be other as his brothren, or at the leaste as men, he woulde fyrste haue diligently waied oure reasons, bothe what we haue to saye for vs, and what may be saide againste vs, &amp; not so rashely, onely with a blinde sentence deter∣mined afore hande, in that Bul of his, wherin of late he made a counterfaite shewe of a Councell, haue condem∣ned a good part of the worlde, so many learned &amp; godly men, so many commō weales, so many Kynges, so ma∣ny Princes, the persons vnheard, the cause not pleaded.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Why thys Apology was writen▪</HI></NOTE>But inasmuche as he hathe now openly slaundered vs after this sorte, leaste that by silence we might seeme to confesse the faulte, and specially bicause that in the open Councell, wherein he will suffer no man, but one∣ly suche as are sworne and addicted vnto his vsurped power, to haue authoritie, to gyue a voyce or to declare his minde, we can in no wise be hearde (for therof in the laste assemble at Trente we had ouer muche experience, what time the Embassadours and diuines of the Prin∣ces and of the free citees of Germany were vtterly ex∣cluded out of all their assembles: nother can we yet for∣get how that Iulius the, 3, tenne yeares past, in his bul strayghtly did forbid, that no man of oure proffessyon shoulde be hearde in the councell, onlesse paraduenture there were any that woulde recante and chaunge his opiniō euen for these causes specially we haue thought it good to render a reason of oure faithe by writinge, &amp;
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
vnto suche thinges as are openly obiected againste vs, truly &amp; openly to answer, to the entēt the whole worlde may see the partes and the foundation of that doctrine, whiche so many godly men haue preferred before their owne liffes, &amp; that all men may vnderstande what mā∣ner of men thei be, and what thei do thinke of God &amp; of religion, whome the Byshop of Rome not wel aduised, hathe condemned for Heretiks, yea before thei were cal∣led to pleade their cause, without lawe, without exam∣ple, onely bicause he hearde say thei differed from him &amp; from his in some parte of Religion.</P>
<P>And although in the suspicion of Heresy S. Ierome will haue noe man to be pacient: neuerthelesse we wyll demeane our selfe nother bitterly nor tantingly w<SUP>t</SUP> ma∣ny wordes, nor yet be caried into any chauffe with an∣ger: although in dede he ought not to seeme bitter or tā∣tinge that speaketh truth. But this kynde of eloquence we are content to leaue to our aduersaries, who what soeuer thei speake against vs, thoe it be neuer so bytter∣ly or slanderously spoken, yet it is modestly spoken and to good purpose, how truly or falslye, therof thei make no great account. Suche kinde of sleights we haue no nede of that defende the truth.</P>
<P>But in case we doe proue that the sacred Gospell of God and the auncient Bishops, together with the pri∣mitiue Churche dothe make for vs, and that we haue vpon iuste cause, bothe departed from these men, and also retourned now againe vnto the Apostles and olde catholike fathers, and that we do it in dede not couertly or craftely, but with a good conscience before God, tru∣ly, frankly, clerely &amp; plainely: if thei them selues which flee oure doctrine and will be caled Catholikes, shal eui∣dently

For the people of God is otherwyse instructed now, then they were when all thinges that were set forth by the Popes of Rome, wer taken for the Gospell, &amp; al religion depended onely vpon their authoritie.

<P>But wheras of all these authorities these men bring not a worde against vs, &amp; neuerthelesse to be called He∣retikes that haue not declined nother from Christe, nor frō the Apostles, nor from the Prophets, it is very in∣iuriouse and to to greuous. With this sword Christ re∣pulsed the Deuill when he was tempted of him: with these weapons all loftynesse that auaunceth it selfe a∣gaīst god must be ouerthrowē &amp; vāquished.

Ambrose also vnto Gratian: Let the Scriptures, saith he, be asked the questiō, let the Apostles be asked, let the Prophets be asked, let Christe be asked, for the Catho∣like fathers &amp; Byshops in those daies doubted nothing that oure religion myght be sufficiently proued oute of the Scriptures of God. Nor at any tyme durste they accounte any man for an Heretike, whose errore they coulde not plainely and euidently reproue out of y<SUP>e</SUP> selfe same scriptures.

And that Christ and the Apostles, what time they did exhorte the people to the redyng of the holy scriptures, that out of them thei might become plentifull in all wisdome and knowlege, did goe about to abuse menne with lies? It is no meruaile thoe these men despise vs and all that we doe or say, whiche make so litle accounte of God him self, and of his moste holy worde.

Againe, what if those thinges, in maner all, which these men so hyghly set forth with the name of antiquitie, after that they haue been well and diligently syfted, shall be founde at the last to be but grene and new?</P>
<P>Truely the lawes and Ceremonies of the Iewes, al∣though that Aman did accuse them of nouelty, yet vn∣to any man that considered them truly and vprightly, thei coulde not appeare to be new, for thei were written in most auncient tables. And Christe, although many supposed that he did declyne from Abraham and from the olde fathers, and that he brought in a new Religiō of his owne heade, yet he answered truely: If you be∣leued Moises, you should beleue mee also: for my doc∣trine is not so new as you take it. Moises a most aun∣cient aucthor, whom you doe esteme aboue all men, did speake of mee. And. S. Paule, Although the Gospell of Iesus Christ be reputed of many to be new, yet it hath saith he, a most auncient testimony of the law and the Prophetes. As for our doctrine, the which we may cal more rightly the Catholike doctrine of Christ, is so far of from all nouslty, that the olde God of all ages and the father of our Lorde Iesus Christ hath commended it vnto vs in moste auncient monuments, euen in the Gospell, and in the bookes of the Prophetes and of the Apostles. So that now it can not seeme new vnto a∣ny man, except there be any, to whom either the fayth of the Prophetes, or the Gospell, or Christ himselfe seemeth to be newe. But in case their Religion bee so auncient and so olde, as they woulde haue it to appere, wherefore doe they not proue it oute of the examples

The olde Coūsell called Gangrense, commaundeth, that no man shall make any such diffe∣rence betwene a maried and an vnmaried priest, as for his wiuelesse estate he should think the one holyer thē the other.

Now the Pope chalengeth bothe the swordes and ex∣erciseth them bothe: wherefore it ought to seeme lesse maruaile, if that hath folowed sithens, which Clement spake of: that he hath both deceiued himselfe, and them that haue giuen eare vnto hym. Leo the Pope sayth, y<SUP>t</SUP> in one Churche and vpon one day it is lawfull to say but one Masse: These men in one Churche doe saye sometymes ten, sometimes twenty, sometime thirtye Masses, and ofte times moe in one day, in so much that the vnhappy man that standeth by, and is the looker on, can scantly tell, which way it is best to turne him∣selfe. Pope Gelasius saith, that if anye man deuide the Sacrament, so that when he taketh the one parte he leaueth the other, he doth lewdely and committeth sa∣crilege. These men both contrarye to gods worde and contrary to Pope Gelasius, commaunde that the one parte of the Sacrament onely be gyuen to the people: and in so doyng, they make al their Priestes gilty of sa∣crilege. But in case they will say, that all these matters are nowe worne out of vre, &amp; become vtterly deade, so that vnto these daies they appertaine nothing at al: yet to the intent that all men may vnderstand, what credit is to be gyuen vnto these manner of men, and what good is to be looked for of those Councels which they assemble together: let vs see a little, what regarde they haue to those things, which now in these latter yeares, whils thei be yet in fresh remēberāce thei haue decreed, &amp; in opē Coūcel lawfully called to be inuiolably obser∣ued.

These kinde of men ar oft times wonte to talke muche of their hidde and depe learnyng, and of their manifolde and great variete of reading. Let them therefore now bring out somwhat if they can, wherby it maye at the leaste appeare that they haue readde and knowe somewhat. They haue cried it out lustily in all companies where they came, that all partes of their re∣ligiō
<PB REF="46"/>
were auncient and approued, not only of the mul∣titude, but also by the consent and continuāce of all na∣tions and times.</P>
<P>Wherfore let them at one time or other shew this an∣tiquitie which thei speake of. Let thē make these things to appere, whiche ar spred, as they say, so far &amp; so wide. Let them proue that al Christian nations haue agreed vnto their religion. But they flee, as we sayde a litle be∣fore, euen them selfs from their owne decrees: and those thinges, whiche so fewe yeares paste they had establi∣shed to remaine for euer, in so shorte time haue made to be of none effect. I pray you then, how shold they trust in the fathers, in the olde coūcels, in the wordes of God? They haue not, O mercifull God, they haue not those thinges, whiche thei boaste themselues to haue, nother antiquitie, nor vniuersalitie, nother the consent of all places, nor of al times. And therof they themselues, al∣though they would rather haue the matter dissembled, ar not ignorāt. Yea somtimes thei sticke not also plam∣ly to confesse it. And therfore thei say, that the constitu∣tions of olde Councels and fathers ar of that cōdition, that somtimes they may be chaunged: for according to the diuersitie of times, diuerse decrees ar conuenient to be had in the Church. And thus they couer thē self vn∣der the name and title of the Church, and with a coun∣terfaite shadow doe scornfully abuse the simple &amp; wret∣ched people. And a meruayle it is, that either mē should be so blinde, as they can not see these thinges: or if they doe see them, that they be so pacient, as they can thus easily endure them, and with so quiet a minde.</P>

ouer olde, and worne out of vse, peraduenture thei haue set other in their place, that be better and also more pro∣fitable. For they ar wonte to say, y<SUP>t</SUP> not euen Christ him¦selfe or his Apostles, if they should liue agayne, coulde deuise a better or a more holyer waye to direct the Church of God, then that wherby it is gouerned now at their hādes.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>What newe deuises are broughte in¦stede of aun∣cient and true relygyon by the Papistes.</HI></NOTE> Trewe it is in deede, that thei haue put other in their places, but accordyng as Hieremias said, chaffe in steade of wheate: and as Esay saythe, Those thynges, whiche God hath not requyred at their hāds. They haue stopped vp all the vaynes of the springyng water, and they haue digged broken and durty pittes, full of slyme and filthines, whiche nother haue anye cleane water, nor ar able to contayne it. They haue ta∣ken from the people the holy communion, the worde of God, from whence shoulde haue come all comforte, the true worshyppe of God, the right vse of sacramētes and of prayer. Agayne thei haue giuen vnto vs of their owne store, wherewith in the meane season we might chiere oure selfes, salte, water, creame, pottes, spittell, palmes, bulles, Iubiles, pardonnes, crosses, smoky incēce, and an infinite nombre of ceremonies, and mere mockes as Plautus saythe, meerly to be mocked at. In these thynges, haue they fixed theyr whole reli∣gion. With these thinges, they taught that God might be well appeased: that with these, Devils be driuen a∣waye. That with these, mens consciences were confir∣med. For these forsothe be the ornamentes and denty storeboxes of Christian religion. These, in the sight of God be pleasant and acceptable: that these thynges might be auaunced vnto honor, it behoued that the or∣dinances of Christ and of the Apostles should be taken
<PB REF="47"/>
out of place. And as the wicked kynge Hieroboam in time paste, after he had taken awaye the true worship of God, and had brought the people to the worshipping of golden calues, leaste that afterwardes they shoulde peraduenture haue chaūged theyr mindes, and slipping from him, haue returned agayne vnto Hierusalem to the Temple of God, he exhorted them with a long ora∣tion vnto constācie, sayng: These o Israel ar thy gods: after this sorte your God hath commaunded that you should worshippe him: It should be a paynefull and a troublesome thing for you to vndertake so long a Ior∣ney, and euery yeare to goe to Hierusalem, to the intent to honor and to worshippe God. After the same māner in all pointes, these men, when that for theyr owne tra∣ditiōs sake, they had ones made voyde the law of God, least that the people should afterwardes opē their eies, and slippe an other waye, and finde at others handes a more certayne course for their saluation, O how often haue they cried, This is y<SUP>t</SUP> kynde of worshippyng that pleaseth God: and whiche he doth streightly require at our handes: and wherewith he will be appeased in his anger: By these thinges the agrement in the Church is conserued: with these thinges all sinne is cleansid, and consciences ar made quiet: whoe that shal forsake these thinges, he leaueth himself no hope of eternall saluatiō? It is a paynefull and a troublesome thyng for the peo∣ple to looke backe vpon Christ, vpon the Apostles, vpō the olde fathers: &amp; euer more to be attentife what their will and commaundement is. This I warrant you, is the very way to bring the people of God frō the weake elementes of the world, from the leauenne of scribes &amp; Pharises, and from mans traditions. It behoved that
<PB N="47" REF="47"/>
the ordenaunces of Christe and of his Apostles should be thruste out of place, that these might be accepted in theyr stede. O this was a sufficiēt cause, why that good olde doctrine whiche many ages had bene approued, should be abiected, and a new forme of Religion should be brought into y<SUP>e</SUP> Church of God. Neuerthelesse what so euer it is, these men crie still:
Nothyng must be chaūged: with these thinges mens mindes ar satisfied: these thinges ar decreed by the churche of Rome: that church can not erre: for Siluester Prierias saith,<Q> y<SUP>t</SUP> the Church of Rome is the squire &amp; rule of truth: from the whiche the holy scriptures receaue their authoritie. The doc∣trine, sayth he, of the Churche of Rome, is the vnfalli∣ble rule of fayth, from the whiche the holy Scriptures fetcheth her strength. And pardonnes sayeth he, ar not come to our knowlege by the authoritie of the scrip∣tures, but thei ar knowne vnto vs by the authoritie of the Churche of Rome, and of the Romane Popes, the whiche is a greater authoritie.</Q>
Pighius also is not a∣frayde to saye, that we ought not to beleue any texte of the scripture be it neuer so playne, vnlesse we haue our warrant from the Churche of Rome. Muche like as if any of these that can not speake good and pure Latine, and yet can bable somwhat after the māner of Schole∣mens Latine very roundly and redily, woulde needes maynteyne, that all other mē also ought to speake such Latine now in these times, as many yeres past Mam∣metrect or Catholicon did speake, and suche as at this daye is vsed amongest themselues in their common scholes: for so both that whiche is spoken maye be well inough vnderstanded, and also mens mindes wel satis∣fied: and that it were a mockery, now after so longe cō∣tinuāce,
<PB REF="48"/>
to trouble y<SUP>e</SUP> world with a new kinde of speach, and to cal home againe the olde purenes and elegācy in speakyng, whiche Cicero or Cesar vsed in their dayes. Such is the duety forsoth that these men doe owe vn∣to the ignorance and darknes of the times paste. Many thinges,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plicius.</HI></NOTE> as a certaine man sayth, ar ofte times in good estimatiō, only bicause they had bene ones dedicated to the temples of Heathen Gods. Euen so we see that these menne at this daye doe allowe many thinges and highly esteeme them, not bicause they iudge them to be so much worthe, but only bicause they haue bene recey∣ued by coustume, and dedicated after a certayne māner to the Churche of God.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Churche of Rome may erre.</HI></NOTE>But our Church saye they, can not erre, the whiche thing I suppose they speake much like as in time paste the Lacedemonians were wonte to say, y<SUP>t</SUP> in the whole state of their common welth it was not possible to finde an aduouterer: wheras in deede they were rather al ad∣uouterers, in asmuch as thei cupled thēself in vncertain mariages, &amp; occupied their wifes together in cōmon. Or as the Canonistes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Summa An∣gelica Dist. Papa.</HI></NOTE> for their bealies sake, ar wōte to speake nowe a dayes of the Pope: That he in that he is lorde ouer all benefices, although he doe sell for money Bysshoprickes, Abbeys, personages, and suffereth no∣thing freely to departe from him: neuerthelesse bicause he saythe that all is his, thoe he would neuer so fayne, he can not commit symonie. But howe this argument should be good, and how the wordes maye agree with reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theodoricum de schismate.</HI></NOTE> we can not as yet surely perceiue: except perad∣uenture, like as the aūcient Romanes in time past dealt with Lady Victorie, so these mē, after that truth came fliyng vnto them, they pulled of her winges, that neuer
<PB N="48" REF="48"/>
after she should be able to flie from them. But what if Ieremie say vnto them, accordyng as we sayde before, that these be the wordes of lies? What if the same man saye agayne, that euen they whiche ought to haue ma∣nured the vineyarde, haue wasted and destroyed the Uineyarde of the Lorde? What if Christ saye, that they whiche chyeflye ought to haue bene carefull ouer the Temple: of the Lordes temple haue made a denne of thieues? But in case the Church of Rome can not erre, then muste it needes be that the happynes thereof is greater then the wisedome of these menne. For suche is their lyfe, doctrine and diligence, that the Churche maye full well for all them not onely erre, but also pe∣rishe vtterly, and come to nothyng. Doubtles if that Churche maye erre whiche hath vtterly gone astraye from the worde of God, from the commaundementes of Christe, from the ordinances of the Apostles, from the examples of the primitiue Church, from the consti∣tutions of the olde fathers and auncient Councels, and from the verye decrees of theyr owne makynge: and whiche will not be kepte in order with no lawes, no∣ther olde nor new, nother of theyr owne nor of others, nother of God nor of manne: then is it moste certaine, not onely that the Churche of Rome mighte erre, but also that moste lewdely and shamefully it hath erred.</P>
<P>But you were ones, saye they, of our felowship, but now you ar become Apostatas &amp; rūnegates, &amp; haue se∣parated your selfs frō vs. True it is y<SUP>t</SUP> we haue disseue∣red our selfs from thē: and for that cause we bothe giue thankes to our moste mercyfull and mightie God, and also on oure owne behalfes we doe moste hyghlye

Then lette them giue vs that same leaue, touchyng the water of euerlastyng life, whiche they will haue to be graunted vnto them in this case of material water. Amongest thē this water fayled longe a goe: the elders, as Hieremy sayeth, sent theyr yoūgelings to y<SUP>e</SUP> waters, but they, when thei could finde nothing, brought home theyr empty vessels, beyng in great miserie and vtterly loste for thirste. The needy, sayeth Esay, and the poore sought after water, but they founde none in no place: theyr tongues were now euen dried for thyrst: these mē had broken vp all their water courses and theyr con∣duytes: these had choked all theyr springes, and had fil∣led with myre and durte the fountayne of the water of life. And like as Caligula in time paste, by closing vp of all mens barnes, brought vpon the people a generall hunger and famine: so these men in chokyng vp of all the foūtaynes of Gods worde, haue brought the people into a miserable thyrste. They brought as Amos the
<PB N="49" REF="49"/>
Prophete sayth, hunger and thirst vpon men, not a fa∣mine of bread, not a thirste of water, but of hearyng the worde of God. The poore wretches wandered vp and downe sekyng after some litle sparke of that light of God, wherwith they might chiere their consciences: but it was cleane quenched out: they coulde finde none at all: Suche was the very state, suche was the pyti∣full condition of the Church of God. Moste miserably men liued therein without the gospell, without lighte, without all comforte.</P>
<P>Wherefore, although our departyng be somewhat greuous vnto them: yet ought they to consider howe iuste the cause of our departing is. For in case they wil saye: it is lawefull for thee by no means to departe from that fellowship, wherein thou haste ben brought vp: Thus they maye easily in oure personnes cōdemne both the Prophetes and the Apostles, and also Christe him self. For why doe they not likewise finde fawte at this: that Loth departed from Sodome, Abraham out of Calde, the Hebrewes out of Egypte, Christ from the Iewes, Paule from the Pharisees? For onlesse there maye be some iuste cause of suche departynges, we see not, why they also maye not in like sorte be accused as factious and seditious men.</P>
<P>Nowe if we ought to be condemned for heretikes, bycause we doe not al thinges whiche these menne doe commaunde vs: whoe I praye you, or what maner of men shall we account them to be, which doe despise the commaundementes of Christe and of the Apostles? If we be Schismatikes that haue disseuered our selfs frō these fellowes, by what name I pray you, shal we call them, that haue departed from the Grekes, at whose
<PB REF="50"/>
hādes they receyued the faith, frō the primitiue church, from Christ him self, from the Apostels, euē as it were from their owne parentes? For as for the Grekes, such as at this daye doe professe the religion and name of Christ, althoe they haue many thinges that ar corrup∣ted, yet they retaine to this howre a great part of those thinges which they receyued of the Apostles. Therfore nother haue they priuate Masses, nor their sacramētes mangeled, nor purgatory, nor pardonnes: As for the Popes titles and proude names, so muche they doe re∣gard them, that whosoeuer doth take them vpon him, and wil needes be called either the vniuersal Byshop or heade of the whole Church: of him they will not sticke to saye, that he is bothe an intolerable arrogant man, and a personne that iniuriously defaceth all other By∣shoppes his bretherne, and also an heretike.</P>
<P>Now then, sins the matter is plaine &amp; can not be de∣nied, y<SUP>t</SUP> these fellowes ar gone back frō those, of whom thei receiued the gospel, of whom thei receaued y<SUP>e</SUP> faith, of whome the true religion &amp; the Churche: what cause is there, why they shuld not be cōtent to be called home againe, euen vnto the same personnes, as it were to the fountaines of religion? Wherfore ar they so afrayde, as thoe al the Apostles &amp; old fathers sawe nothing, to fo∣low the exāple of their times? for doe they, trowe ye, see more, or be thei more careful ouer the Churche of God, then they y<SUP>t</SUP> first deliuered these things? And now to re∣turne to our selfs, we haue departed frō that Churche, wherin nother the worde of God could be hearde pure∣ly taught: nor the Sacramentes rightly administered: nor the name of God, as it ought to be, called vpō: and whiche they themselues doe confesse to be corrupted in
<PB N="50" REF="50"/>
many thinges: and wherin, to say the truth, there was nothing that could staye any man that was wise, and that had any consideration, of his owne saluation. To conclude, we haue departed from that Churche that is now founded, not from that Church that was in time past: and we haue departed in such sorte, as Daniel did out of the denne of Lions: as the thre childrē out of the fier: yea rather caste out by them with their cursinges and banninges, then departed of our selfs.</P>
<P>Agayne, we haue adioyned our selfes vnto that Church, wherin they them selfs, in case they wil speake truely and according to their owne consciences, can not denie, but all thynges ar soberly and reuerently hande∣led, and so farre forth as we were able to attayne, most neerely vnto the order of the olde time.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A comparisō of both the Churches.</HI></NOTE> For lette them compare their Churches and oures together, they shal see, bothe that they moste shamefully haue departed frō the Apostels, and we moste iustly haue forsaken them. For we, after the exāple of Christe, of the Apostles and of the holy fathers, doe giue the whole sacrament vnto the people: These men, contrary to all the fathers, con∣trary to al the Apostels, and cōtrary to Christ him self, not without (as Gelasius sayth) hygh sacrilege, doe de∣uide the sacramentes, and plucke the one parte awaye from the people. We haue restored the Lordes supper accordyng to the institutiō of Christ, and desire to haue it asmuch as maye be, and to as many as may be, most common, and as it is called, so to be in very deede, a Cō∣munion. These men haue chaunged all thinges frō the institution of Christ: &amp; of the holy cōmunion they haue made a priuate masse: so that we present vnto the peo∣ple a holy Supper: they, a vayne pagent to gase vpon.</P>
<P><PB REF="51"/>We doe affirme with the moste auncient Fathers, that the bodye of Christe is eaten of none other, but of godly and of faithfull menne, and suche as ar endued with the spirite of Christe: these fellowes doe teache that the very bodye of Christe, maye in very deede, and as they terme it, really and substantially be eaten, not only of wicked and vnfaythfull men, but also, it is hor∣rible to speake it, of myse and dogges.</P>
<P>We doe praye in oure Churches after suche sorte, that, accordyng as Paule dothe admonishe vs, the peo∣ple may know what we doe pray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.</NOTE> and with one minde answere, Amen. These men powre out in the churches vnknowne and straunge wordes, like vnto the noyse of soundyng brasse, without any vnderstanding, without sense, without iudgement, and this is their only ende∣uour, that the people should not be able to vnderstande any thing at all.</P>
<P>And bycause we will not reherse all the differences betwene vs and them, for they ar in maner infinite: We translate the Scriptures into all languages: these men wil scantly suffer them to be abroade in any tonge: We doe exhorte the people to heare and reade the worde of God: these menne driue them from it: We woulde haue our cause hearde before all the worlde: these menne flee al iudgement and triall: We leane vnto knowlege, they vnto ignorance: We truste to the light, they vnto dark∣nesse: We haue in reuerence, as reason is, the wordes of the Apostles and of the Prophetes: these men do burne them. To conclude, we in Gods cause wil stande to the iudgement of God only: these men will stande to their owne. But if they will consider all these thinges with a quiet minde and a prepared purpose to heare and to
<PB N="51" REF="51"/>
learne: thei shal not only allow our doyngs, which lea∣uing all errours, haue folowed Christe &amp; his Apostles, but also they themselues shal fal away from thēselues, and of their owne accorde, encline themselues to ioyne with our felowshippe.</P>
<P>But they will saye,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of general Councels.</HI></NOTE> that it was an vnlawefull at∣tempt to goe aboute such matters without an holy ge∣nerall Counsell: for therein is the whole powre of the Churche: there Christe hathe promised that he will al∣wayes be ready at hand. And yet they themselues haue broken the commaundementes of God &amp; the decrees of the Apostles, and as we sayde a litle before, haue scate∣red and torne in pieces in maner all, not onlye the or∣dinances, but also the certaine principles concernyng doctrine of the primitiue Church, and that without ta∣riyng for any generall Councell.</P>
<P>But where as they say, that it is not lawful for any man to appoint any new order without a Coūcel: who I praye you hath prescribed these lawes vnto vs? or where haue they founde this decree?</P>
<P>It was folishly done of Agesilaus the kynge, who beyng ones acertained of the minde and pleasure of the hyghe Iupiter, woulde needes present the whole mat∣ter agayne vnto Apollo, for to know whether he were of the same minde that his Father was. But we should doe more foolyshlye a greate deale, in case that, when we doe heare God him selfe speakynge moste playnely vnto vs in the holye Scriptures, and vnderstande his will and pleasure, if I saye, afterwardes, as though al this were nothing, we would refarre the whole matter to a councell. The whiche is nothing els, but to searche whether menne be of the same minde that God is: and
<PB REF="52"/>
whether menne will allow by their authoritie the com∣maundementes of God. What I praye you, shall not the truthe be truthe, or shall not God be God, except a councell will and commaunde it so to be? If Christe would haue handeled the matter so frō the beginnyng, that he woulde haue taught or sayde nothing without the consente of the Bysshoppes, and woulde haue re∣ferred ouer hys whole doctrine vnto Annas and Cay∣phas, where should the fayth of Christ be at this day? or who shoulde euer haue hearde of the gospell? Peter forsothe, of whome the Pope is wonte to speake more often and with more reuerence then of Iesus Christe, did boldely withstande the sacred councell: and sayde, it was better to obeye God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Galat.</HI> 1.</NOTE> then men. And Paule, what time he had ones receyued the gospell into his minde, and that not of men, nor by man, but only by the wil of God, did not counsell with flesh and bloud, nor dyd not referre the matter vnto his kinsemen or brothern: but went by and by into Arabia, for to publishe, by the au∣thoritie of God, Gods misteries.</P>
<P>We surely doe not despyse Councels or assemblies and conferences of Bysshoppes and learned menne: Nother haue we done those thinges that be done alto∣gether without Bysshoppes or without a coūcell. The matter was handeled in full parlament, with long de∣liberation, and in a greate assemblie. But as touchyng this councell, whiche Pope Pius dothe at thys tyme counterfetly set forthe, wherein men beyng nother cal∣led, nor hearde, nor seene, ar so lightly condemned, what we maye loke or hope to gette thereby, it is not harde to gesse.</P>
<P>Nazianzenus longe agoe, when that in his tyme
<PB REF="52"/>
he sawe menne that came to suche assemblies, to bee so blinde and so obstinate, that they were caryed after their owne affections, and foughte rather for victorie then for truthe: pronounced in playne wordes, that he neuer sawe good ende of anye councell. What woulde he saye nowe, if he were a liue at this daye, and shoulde vnderstande what these menne wente aboute? For in that tyme all though they were gyuen to partes, yet bothe mennes causes were hearde, and manifeste er∣rours by the common consente of all partes were ta∣ken awaye. These menne agayne neyther will suf∣fer the cause to bee freelye debated: nother will endure to haue anye thyng chaunged, howe many errours so euer there be.</P>
<P>For that is a thyng whiche they ar wonte often and with out all shame to boaste of, that their Churche can not erre: that in hit there is no blemyshe: that there is nothyng to be graunted vnto vs: or yf there be anye thyng, that the iudgement thereof appertayneth vnto Bysshoppes and Abbots: they be the directers of those matters, they be the Churche of God. Aristotel saythe, that bastardes can not make a citie. But whether the Churche of God maye be made of these fellowes or no, let them consider: for surely, nother be they lawfull Ab∣bots nor right Bysshoppes.</P>
<P>But let them hardely be the Churche: lette them be hearde in coūcels: let them only haue authoritie to giue a voyce: Neuerthelesse in times paste, when the Church of God (if it be compared with their Churche) was re∣sonably wel gouerned, as Cipryan sayth, bothe Elders and Deacons &amp; some parte also of the common people
<PB REF="53"/>
were called to the hearyng of Ecclesiasticall causes.</P>
<P>But what if these Abbotes and Bysshoppes haue no knowledge? What yf they vnderstande not what religion is, and what opinion they oughte to haue of God? What if law be loste of the preeste, &amp; coūsel of the Elders? What if the night, as Micheas saythe, be vnto them in stede of a vision, and darkenes in stede of for∣seyng thynges to come? What if all the watchemen of the Citie, as Esaye sayth, ar become blinde? What if the salte hath loste his strēgth and his taste? and as Christ sayth, is good for nothyng, not so muche as to be caste out vpon the dunge hill?</P>
<P>Forsothe they will committe all thynges to the Pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Pope is aboue the Councell.</HI></NOTE> whoe can not erre. But that, to beginne withal, is a folishe deuise: that the holy ghost should flie away in haste from the holy Councell to Rome, to the intent that if he doubte or sticke in anye thyng, and not be a∣ble to winde him selfe out, he mighte take counsell of some other spyrite I wote not who, better learned thē him self: For if the case stande so, what needed it that so many Byshops should in this time at so great charges and through so long iorneys be summoned to come to Trent? It were yet a much more wiser &amp; better way, sure I am it were bothe shorter and more commodi∣ous for them, rather to put of all thynges to the Pope: and to repayre at the firste dasshe, to the heauenly de∣termination of hys sacred breaste. Moreouer it is a∣gaynste equitie, to put ouer oure cause from so manye Bysshoppes and Abbottes to the iudgemente of one man, speciallye of hym, whoe standeth accused by vs of moste weyghtye and greuous offences: and as yet hath not brought in his answer: who also hath condēned vs

without iudgement before wee were once called to bee iudged. What? trow ye that these be things of our own deuise? Or is not this y<SUP>e</SUP> order of their Councels at this day? Or be not all thinges committed ouer from y<SUP>e</SUP> holy Councels vnto the Pope alone, in such sort, that as though so many voices and subscriptiōs serued to no purpose, he alone may adde, chaunge, diminish, take a∣way, alow, release, and againe restraine what him lyf∣teth? Then I pray you, of what maner of men were these words spoken? Or why did the Bishops and Ab∣bots not long agoe in the last Coūcell of Trente decree after this manner at thende of their constitutions: Sa∣uing alwaies in al things the Authorite of the Aposto∣licall seat?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De electione &amp; electi pote∣state. ca.

<P>But let it be so hardely, y<SUP>t</SUP> the Pope alone is aboue all Councels: that is to say, let some one parte be more then y<SUP>e</SUP> whole: let him be of greater power, of more wis∣dome then all his fellowes together: Yea and though Hierome say nay,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ad Euagr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI></NOTE> let the aucthorite of one Citie be grea∣ter then of the whole world: But what if he neuer saw nothing pertaining to these matters, and neuer read neither the holy Scriptures, nor the olde fathers, nor

Or, as Pope Iohn, not many yeares past, should haue a wic∣ked and a heathenishe opinion of the life to come, &amp; of the immortality of soules? Or as Pope Zosimus dyd afore time with the councell of Nice, so he shoulde also now falsifie other coūcels for y<SUP>e</SUP> auācemēt of his powre and aucthoritie: and those things which were neuer, no not so much as thought, those he should say were deba∣ted and decreed by the holy fathers: and should, as Ca∣motenses saith, the Popes are wont ofte times to doe violently, racke the Scriptures, to procure vnto him∣selfe the fulnesse of all power? What if he abandone y<SUP>e</SUP> Christian faith and become an Apostata, like as by the testimony of Lyran, mani Popes haue done? Trow ye y<SUP>t</SUP> notwithstanding all this, the holy Ghost will knocke at his breast and kindle in him, wil he or no, yea altogi∣ther against his wil, such a light, as he can not erre?

Or if he can not iudge, doth he require that all thinges should be referred vnto him?

Why doe they either so vncurtesly dispatche them out of their company, or reiect them w<SUP>t</SUP> such reproche: when that as though they were no Christian men, or were not able to iudge, they will not suffer them to sit in counsell in causes of Religion, nor to knowe the state of their owne Churches.

and take vpon them, other whiles the Byshops be a sleepe, or whiles they doe rebellyously resist, to bridle y<SUP>e</SUP> raging lustes of priestes, and both driue them to the do∣ing of their duty, and kepe them from disorder: &amp; more∣ouer if they plucke downe Idolls, withdraw supersti∣tion, set vp the true worship of God: Why crie they by and by, that they turne all things vpside downe: that they breake into other mens offices, and behaue them∣selues lewdely and arrogantly?

<P>They haue in deede sometime a peculier apparell, Crosses, Pillers, Hattes, Myters, Palls, the which kinde of pompe the auncient Bysshops, Chrysostome, Augustine and Ambrose had neuer. Now besides these things, what teache they, what say they, what do they, what liue they in any point that is comlye and commē∣dable not onely for a Bysshop, but also for a Christian man?

if we had not to doe w<SUP>t</SUP> such men as of contention and for desire of victory, are wōt to denie al things that are most plaine, and euen those thinges which they see and haue daily in their eyes.

<P>As for vs, touching the chaunge of Religiō, we haue done nothing, as we said before, rashly or presūptuous∣ly, nothing but leisurly and w<SUP>t</SUP> gret deliberatiō.

<PB REF="61"/>
which Christ himselfe that can not erre, so long before did prophecy, that it shoulde erre: and which wee our selues did euidently see before our eyes, swarue awaye from the holy Fathers, from the Apostles, from Christ himselfe, from the Primitiue and Catholike Church. Againe we are come, euen as nere as we could possible, to the Church of the Apostles, and of the olde catholike Bysshops and Fathers, euen to y<SUP>t</SUP> Church, which wee knowe was as yet a pure, and as Tertullian saith, an vndefiled Uirgine: infected as yet neither with anye ydolatry, nor with any greuous &amp; knowen error: &amp; we haue directed not our doctrine only, but also our Sa∣craments and the forme of our common praiers, accor∣ding to their rules &amp; ordinances. And whereas, before, Religion was shamefully neglected &amp; depraued at these mens handes, we, according as we know both Christ himself &amp; all other godly men in māner had done here∣tofore, haue brought it home vnto the original, &amp; to the first principles. For we thought it requisite ther to seke the reformation of Religion, from whence the first principles therof were deriued. For this argumēt, sayth the most auncient father Tertullian, is stronge against all Heresies: That is true, whatsoeuer is first: what∣soeuer is of latter time, that is counterfait.

Wherefore can not that sentence bee hearde nowe a daies amongest vs, which in the counsell of Nice longe ago, withoute the gainesaying of anye man,

Esdras, what time he went about to make vp the decayed places of Gods temple, he sēt not to Ephesus, although there was a very beu∣tifull and gorgious temple of Diana: and when he woulde restore their ceremonies and sacrifices, he sente not to Rome, althoe peraduēture he had hearde of their solemne sacrifices, called Hecatombas, Solitaurilia, Lectisternia, of their supplications, and of the ceremo∣niall bokes of Numa Pōpilius. He thought it inough for him to set before his eyes, and to follow the paterne of the olde temple which Salomon did rayse vp at the first, according to the appointment of God: and to be∣holde those olde orders &amp; ceremonies, whiche God him self prescribed by name vnto Moses.</P>
<P>Aggeus the Prophete, what time the temple was buylded vp agayne by Esdras, and the people mighte seeme to haue a very good occasion offered them to re∣ioyce at so great a benefit of the most mighty and mer∣cifull God: yet he constrayned the teeres to fall from all their eyes, bicause that they, whiche remaynyng yet a∣liue, had seene the buyldinges of the first temple, before it was razed by the Babylonians, remembered that it lacked muche of that beauty that it had in times paste.

<P>And to the intent he might the better rebuke the fil∣thy gayne and couetousnesse of preestes, and purge the temple: Frō the beginning, sayth he, this was a house of prayer, where al the people together should deuoutly and soberly cal vpon God: and so ought you also to vse it at this day: for it was not buylded to that intent, for to become a denne of theeues.</P>
<P>So likewise all the godly Princes, and such as were commended in the holye Scriptures, were therefore chiefly cōmended, bicause thei had walked in the wayes of Dauid their father: that is to saye, bicause they had resorted back to the first principles, &amp; to the wel heades, and restored religion to his first estate.</P>
<P>Therefore, what time we sawe that these menne had vtterly throwen all thynges vnder fote, and that in the Churche of God there remayned nothyng but miserable ruynes, we thought it beste to sette before vs those Churches, whiche we dyd know certainly bothe that they had not erred, and also that they had nothing to doe, nother with priuate Masses, nor with prayers in an vnknowen and straunge tonge, nother yet with this corruption of Sacramentes, nor other folyshe toyes.</P>
<P>And wheras our desire was, that the lordes Temple should be restored to his first estate: we went not about to seke any other foundatiō, then that which we knew was layde now long agoe by the Apostles: the whiche is our sauiour Iesus Christ.</P>

For thus we knowe right well the olde Fathers were wonte to make a profe, be∣fore they dyd come to councels assembled out of the whole worlde. There be abrode at this daye Canones wryten in particuler counsels, at Carthage vnder Cy∣prian, at Ancyra, at Neocesaria, at Grangra, also in Paphlagonia, as some men thinke, before the name of the vniuersall councell of Nice was euer hearde of. After this māner in time past, the Pelagians and Do∣natistes, without a generall councell, were by and by mette with all at home in a pryuate cōsultation. Thus Ambrose a Christian Byshop, what time Constantius themperour dyd euidently fauor Auxentius a Byshop of the Arrians faction, appealed not vnto the generall coūcel, wherin he saw, by resō of themperours power, &amp; of affection vnto partes, nothyng could be done, but vnto his own clergie &amp; people: y<SUP>t</SUP> is to say, vnto a Pro∣uinciall assemblie. Thus in the councell of Nice it was decreed, that euery yeare twise: in the councell of Car∣thage, y<SUP>t</SUP> yerly ones at the least, there should be in euery
<PB REF="63"/>
prouince assemblies of Byshoppes: the whiche thynge, the councell of Chalcedone saythe was done for this cause: that, if any errors or abuses should crepe out in any place, they might by and by, euen in the very place where thei sprange vp, be destroyed.
So that whē Se∣cundus and Palladius refused the councel of Aquileia, bycause it was not a generall and a common councell, Ambrose the Byshop of Millane answered: <Q>It ought not to seme new or strange to any man, if the Byshops of the weste called councels amongest them selues, and made prouinciall assemblies: for that hath bene done both of the Westerne Byshoppes not a fewe times, and of the Grekes very oft.</Q>
Thus had Charles the great a prouinciall councell in Germany, touchyng the taking away of images, agaynst the seconde councell of Nice. Neyther is this way of proceding vtterly vnhearde of, or newe amongest vs. For we haue had in times paste here in Englande prouinciall assemblies, and with our own lawes we haue ordered our Churches. What nee∣deth many wordes? Truely, euen those same councels that were the fullest and greatest, and whereof these men ar wonte so much to make theyr auaunt, if thei be compared with al the other Churches, which through out the world doe acknowlege and confesse the name of Christe: what other thyng I pray you they seeme to be, then certaine priuate coūcels of a fewe Byshops, &amp; prouincial assemblies? For althoe peraduēture Italy, Fraunce, Spayne, Englande, Germany, Denmarke and Scotlande should assemble thēselues together and yet all Asia, Grece, Armenia, Persia, Media, Mesopo∣tamia, Egypte, Ethiope, Inde, Mauritania should be absent, in all which places there be both many Christiā
<PB N="63" REF="63"/>
men and also Byshoppes: how might it appere to any sobre manne, that suche a councell were generall? Or when so many partes of the world ar absent, how can they saye truely, that they haue the cōsent of the whole worlde? or what maner of councell was this laste hol∣den at Trente? or how might it be called general, when that out of all Christian kingdomes and coūtries there came vnto it but forty Bysshoppes, and of them some that were so eloquent, that they seemed more mete to be sent to the Grāmer schole: but so well learned, that they neuer redde ouer the holy Scriptures? Howe so euer it is, the truthe of the gospell of Iesus Christe, dothe not depende upō councels, or as Paule sayth, vpon the daye of man. But in case they, who ought to be careful ouer the Church of God, wil not become wise, but will abā∣don their dutie, and harden their hartes agaynste God and his anoynted Christe, and continew still in peruer∣tyng the streyght wayes of the Lorde: God will rayse vp the very stones, and make litel babes eloquent, that alwaies there may be some, by whome the lies of these men maye be confuted. For God is able not only with∣out councels, but also maugre the councels, both to de∣fende and to encrease his kyngdome.
<Q>There be, saythe Salomō, many deuises in mans hart, but the councel of the Lorde abideth stable: for there is no knowlege, there is no wisedome, there is no councell agaynste the Lorde. Thinges, sayth Hilary, that ar buylded vp by mannes worke, doe not endure. The Churche of God muste be otherwise buylded, and otherwise conserued. For it is grounded vpon the foundation of the Apostls and Prophetes, and ioynted together with one corner stone Iesus Christ. But S. Hierome of all other spea∣keth
<PB REF="64"/>
most plainely and most aptly for these times:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In prophetam Naum. ca.</HI> 3.</NOTE> Whō¦soeuer sayth he, the Deuil hath deceiued, and hath as it were with swete and impoysened enchauntment of the meremaydes, entised to fall a slepe, those the worde of God dothe awake, and sayth: Ryse thou that slepeste, stande vp, and Christe will giue the lighte. Wherefore at the commyng of Christe and of Gods worde, and of the doctrine of the Churche, &amp; of the vtter ouerthrow of Niniue, and of that moste beautifull harlot: the peo∣ple that before vnder sholemasters was rocked a slepe, shall be raysed vp, and with haste shal goe to the moū∣taynes of the Scriptures, there they shall finde moun∣taynes, Moses, Iesus the sonne of Naue: mountaines the Prophetes: mountaynes of the newe testamente, the Apostles, the Euangelistes: And when they shall flee vnto suche mountaines, and exercise themself in the readyng of these kinde of mountaynes: yf they finde no manne to teache them (for the haruest shall be greate, and the workemen fewe) neuerthelesse bothe the ende∣uour of the people, bycause they flee vnto these kinde of mountaynes, shall be allowed, and the negligence of the scholemasters shal be cōtrolled.</Q>
These be the words of Hierome, so playne that there needeth no interpreter: so well applied to those thinges whiche we see now be∣fore our eyes, that he semeth vnto vs, to foreshewe as it were with the spirite of Prophecie, and to entende to set before our eyes the whole state of our times, and the fall of that moste sumptuously attiered harlot of Ba∣bylone, and the reformatiō of the Church, &amp; the blinde∣nesse and loytering of the Byshoppes, and the endeuour &amp; cherefulnesse of the people. For who is so blinde, that he seeth not these menne to be those sholemasters, by
<PB N="64" REF="64"/>
whome the people, as Hierome sayth, hath bene ledde into error &amp; therein rocked a slepe? or seeth not Niniue, their Rome, which sometime was counterfetly beauti∣fied w<SUP>t</SUP> most excellent colours, nowe that her visar is ta∣ken away, bothe to be better perceaued and lesse set by? or the seeth hot howe godly menne, beyng raysed vp as it were out of a deade slepe, at the light of the gospel and at the sounde of Gods worde, haue gone forthe, without tariyng for y<SUP>e</SUP> assemblies of these kinde of doc∣tors, vnto the mountaynes of the Scriptures.</P>
<P>But at y<SUP>e</SUP> least (some mā wil say) these thinges ought not to be attempted without the Pope of Romes leaue:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Popes authorytye in Councels.</HI></NOTE> for he only is y<SUP>e</SUP> buckle &amp; the bōd of Christiā felowship: he only is that same Preest of the stoke of Leui, which God did speake of in Deuteronomye, that from him in matters of great difficultie, men should fetche Councel and Iudgment of the truth: and that if any man do not submit himselfe vnto his iudgment, he should be slaine in the sight of his brethren: he whatsoeuer he doth, can not be iudged of any man: Christe reigneth in heauen, he vpon earth: that he alone is able to do what soeuer Christ or God himself can do: for he &amp; Christe haue but one consistory, w<SUP>t</SUP>out him ther is no faithe, no hope, no Church: &amp; that whosoeuer forsaketh him, he casteth a∣way &amp; abandoneth his own saluaciō. These be y<SUP>e</SUP> flatte∣ries of y<SUP>e</SUP> Canonists, y<SUP>e</SUP> Popes belly seruāts: wherin for∣sothe thei vse not ouer much sobrenes: for scarsly could they ascribe moe thinges vnto Christ him self: but sure I am, that greater thinges they could not.</P>
<P>And to returne againe to our own doynges. We truly haue not departed frō y<SUP>e</SUP> pope for any worldly pleasure, or for profites sake. And woulde God that he woulde
<PB REF="65"/>
so behaue himself, that we had no neede to forsake him. But suche was our case, that vnlesse we wente from him, we could not come vnto Christe. Neyther will he yet at this day make any other league with vs, then as Naas the kynge of the Ammonites would haue made with the men of Iabes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Regum.</HI> 11.</NOTE> that was, to put out the right eye of euery one of them. For he wil plucke away from vs the holy scriptures, the gospell of our saluation, and al that hope whiche we haue in Christe Iesu: for with other conditions we can haue no peace.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The argumēt of succession confuted.</HI></NOTE>For as to that whiche certayne menne ar wonte so muche to speake of, that the Pope only is Peters suc∣cessor, as thoe that by reason thereof he carieth the ho∣ly ghoste in his bosome, and can not erre: it is a folishe and a triflying tale. The grace of God is promised vn∣to a well disposed minde, and to him that feareth God: not vnto Chayres &amp; Successiōs. Riches sayth S. Hie∣rome, may make a Byshoppe of greater powre: but all Byshops what so euer they be, ar the successors of the Apostels:
<Q>If the place and the enstalment alone be suf∣ficient, bothe Manasses succeded to Dauid, &amp; Caiphas to Aaron: and ofte times an idole hath stande vp in the tēple of God. Archidamus a Lacedemonian was wōt to auante him selfe muche, bicause he was come out of the stocke of Hercules: whose arrogancie Nicostratus daunted in this wise: As for thou, saythe he, semest not to be come of Hercules: for he killed euill men: whereas thou of good men makest men euil. And what time the Pharisees boasted their succession and kinred, &amp; bloud of Abraham: you, sayth Christ, doe seke to kill me, a mā that haue spoken that truth vnto you, whiche I haue hearde of God.</Q>
Thus dyd Abraham neuer: you ar of
<PB N="65" REF="65"/>
your father the Deuil, &amp; his wil you will obey. Neuer∣thelesse that we should graunt some thing vnto succes∣sion: Doth the Pope onely succede Peter? In what thing I praye you? in what Religion? in what vse of seruice? in what parte of his life doth he succede him? What thing had euer either Peter like the Pope, or the Pope like Peter? Except paraduenture they will say this: that Peter whiles he was at Rome neuer taught the Gospell: neuer fedde his flocke, that he toke away the keys of the kingdome of heauē, hid the treasures of his Lord: only that he satt him down in Laterane, and with his fynger did sett an order for all the roumes in purgatory, and for al kindes of punishment: as for the poore vnhappy soules, some he assigned vnto punishe∣ment, some againe for money he toke out by and by at his pleasure: also that he toke order for priuate masses, that they should be said in euery corner. That he whis∣pered the holy misteries wyth a lowe voice and in a strange tonge: set vp the Sacrament in all Churches and vpon euery altare: &amp; caried it whersoeuer he went, with lightes and sacring belles, before him, vpon an ambeling Genet: that hee consecrated Oyle, Waxe, Woolle, Belles, Chalices, Churches, Alters, with his holy brethe: that he solde Iubilees, graces, licences, ex∣pectations, preuentions, Annates, Palles, the vse of Palles, Bulles, pardons, charters: y<SUP>t</SUP> he called himselfe the head of the Church, the chief Bysshop, and Byshop of Bysshops, and the only Most holy: y<SUP>t</SUP> by vsurpation he tooke vpon hym a right and aucthorite ouer other mens Churches: exempted himselfe frō vnder all ciuill power: y<SUP>t</SUP> he made warres, set Princes together by the eares: and y<SUP>t</SUP> hauing his crown garnished w<SUP>t</SUP> goldē pen∣dantes,
<PB REF="66"/>
his pompous apparell comparable w<SUP>t</SUP> the Persi∣ans, hys royal Sceptre, hys golden diademe glyttering with precious stones, he rode in a chayre of golde caried vpon noble mennes shoulders. these thynges forsoothe dyd Peter when he was at Rome: and the very same he deliuered as it were, from hande to hande vnto his successours. For these thinges be done by the Popes at this daye in Rome, and be so done, as though nothing else ought to be done. Or excepte paraduenture they had rather aunswere thus: that the Pope at this daye doth all those thinges, which we knowe Peter did in time paste: that he trauaileth heare and there in to all Coūtries: preaching the Gospell not only in opē assemblies, but also priually from howse to howse: y<SUP>t</SUP> he plieth his businesse in season, oute of season: in time, out of time: that he doth the duty of an Euāgelist: accom∣plisheth the ministery of Christ: becommeth a watch∣man ouer the howse of Israell: receiueth y<SUP>e</SUP> scriptures and worde of God, and as he hath receiued them, so de∣liuereth them againe to y<SUP>e</SUP> people: that he is the salt of y<SUP>e</SUP> earth: the light of the world: that he fedeth not himselfe, but hys flocke: that he dothe not entangle hymselfe with worldly buisines appertaining to this life, nor v∣surpeth no dominion ouer the Lords people: y<SUP>t</SUP> he seketh not to be serued himself of others, but rather himself to serue others: that he accoūteth all Bysshops for his fel∣lowes and equalles: that he is a subiect vnto Princes, as vnto those that are sent of God: giueth vnto Cesar that which appertaineth to Cesar: and that according, as the auncient Byshops of Rome did, without excep∣tion, he calleth the Emperour his Lorde: Now onles the Popes doe these thinges at this day: and except Pe∣ter
<PB N="66" REF="66"/>
doe those thinges which we spake of before, there is no cause why they should bragge so much of the name of Peter, and of this succession: and lesse a great deale why they should complaine of our departing, &amp; cal vs home againe vnto their faith and felowship. It is said, that a certaine Lacedemonian called Cobilo, what time he was sent Embassadour to make a league with the Kinge of Persia, and founde by chaunce certaine courtyers playing at the dise: by and by, without fur∣ther consideration of his busines, retourned home a∣gaine, and when he was asked, wherfore he had so lit∣tle regarde to the doing of those things, which he had in commission by common aucthoritie for to doe, he answered: that he thought it shoulde haue tourned to the slaunder of the common welth, if he should haue made a league w<SUP>t</SUP> diseplaiers. But if we should dispose our selues to retourn againe vnto the Pope and to his errors, and make a league not onli with diseplaiers, but also with men of much lewder condition then disers: this shoulde be not onely slaunderous towardes our good name, but also towardes the procuring of gods wrathe against vs, and the oppressyon and vtter ouer∣whelming of our owne consciences, full of presente myschyefe. For wee surelye departed from hym, whom we sawe had blynded the worlde nowe manye yeares together: from hym that was wonte ouer arrogantelye to auaunte hymselfe that hee coulde not erre: and what soeuer he dyd, that hee myght not be iudged of any mortall man: not of kinges, not of Emperours, not of the whole clergye, not of all the worlde together, no not if he shoulde carye with hym
<PB REF="67"/>
a thousande soules to Hell, from him that toke vpon him to commaunde not only men, but also the Angels of God, to goe, to come, to leade soules into purgatory, &amp; to bring them back againe when it liked him, whom Gregory did most plainly affirme to be the Uaunteur∣rer and standerdberer of Antichrist, and that he had re∣nounced the catholike Faith: frō whom not long agoe, those countrie men of oures, that be the ringleders of such as bende themself against the Gospell and against the knowne truth, did of their owne choyse and gladly, euery one of them disseuer themself: neither yet would they be vnwilling to doe it at this day, were it not that that the blemishe of inconstancye and shame and their estimatiō amongst the people did let them. To cōclude, we haue forsaken him, to whom we were not bounde, and who had nothing, except it were onely a certaine fonde ymagination of preeminence of the place and succession, that he coulde saye for hymselfe. And yet we of all other nations had most iust cause to de∣parte from him, for our Kinges, euen those also which most carefully inclined themselfe to obey the Authorite and faith of the Bishops of Rome, haue felt sufficiētly now long agoe the yoke &amp; tiranny of the Popes king∣dome. For both from our king Henry the second of that name, the Romaine Bysshops did plucke the Crowne from his heade, commaunding him, all his Maiestye laide a parte, and in a priuate arraye, to the intent he shoulde be a laughinge stocke to all hys people, to pre∣sent himselfe as an humble petitioner and suter before his legate: And also against oure king Ihon, armed the Byshops and Monks, and some parte also of the nobi∣litie, and discharged all his subiects of the othe of their
<PB N="67" REF="67"/>
allegeance, wherby thei were bound vnto him, and last of all, moste wyckedly they spoyled hym by trayterous meanes, not onely of his kingdome, but also of his lyfe. And vpon king Henry the eight of y<SUP>t</SUP> name a most noble Prince, thei thundered out their curses and lightnings of excommunication, and stirred vp against him some∣times the Emperoure, somtimes the Frenche king: &amp; so much as was in them, gaue ouer the whole Realme to the praie and to y<SUP>e</SUP> spoyle: doubtles very madde and foo∣lished men, that could beleue that either so great a kyng might be made a gaste with bugges and with clyckets: or that so mighty a kingdome might be so easily deuou∣red, as it were at one morsell. And as thoughe all these thinges had not been ynoughe: they woulde haue had the whole Realme, also to be tributary vnto them: and out of it moste vniustly they did exacte an yerely rent. So costlye forsooth was the frendship of the Citie of Rome vnto vs. But in as much as by crafty meanes and with lewde sleightes thei wrested out these things from vs: there is no cause why the same againe by lawefull meanes and good lawes might not be taken from them. Yea if our kings in those times of darknes, ledd by some opinion of their coūterfet holines, of their owne accorde and liberalitie, gaue them those thinges for Religion sake: yet afterwardes when the errour is espied of other kinges that haue the same aucthoritie, they may be taken away, for that gift is of none effect that is not approued by the will of the gyuer: but that can not seeme to be a will, which is darkened and em∣peched with errour.</P>
<P>Thou haste heard Christian reader that it is no new thing, y<SUP>t</SUP> at this day Christian Religion being re∣stored
<PB REF="68"/>
to his former estate, and as it were newe borne againe, be slaulderously and shamefully spoken of. For the same thing happened vnto Christ himselfe and to the Apostles. Neuertheles, least thou shouldest suffer thy selfe to be ledde out of the waye, and to be deceiued with these outraging clamors of our aduersaries, wee haue sett forth before the, the whole course of our Reli∣gion: what wee dooe beleue of God the Father, what of his onely sonne Iesus Christe, what of the holye Ghoste, what of the Church, what of the Sacramēts, what of the Ministery, what of the holy Scriptures, what of Ceremonyes, and what of euery parte of a Christian mans profession. We haue declared, how that we doe detest al olde Heresies, the which other the holy Scriptures or the auncient Councels haue condemned as pestilences and poysons of mens soules, and that as much as we can possiblie, we doe call home againe the discipline of the Church, the which our aduersaries haue vtterly brought to nothing: and doe punishe, ac∣cording to the auncient lawes of our forefathers, all losenes of lyfe and licencious manners: and that with such seueritie, as the cause doth require, and so farre as our power will stretche: that we doe vpholde the state of kingedomes, in the same condition that we founde them, without empairing or chaunging any thing: and doe maintaine to the best of our power the Maiesty of our Princes safe and sounde: that wee haue forsaken y<SUP>t</SUP> Church which these men had made a den of theeues, and wherein they had left nothing sounde or sauering of the Church of God, and which by their owne testi∣mony had erred in many thinges: none otherwise then as Loth in time past wēt out of Sodoma, or Abrahā
<PB N="68" REF="68"/>
out of Chaldey, not of a desire to cōtend, but by y<SUP>e</SUP> com∣maundement of God himselfe: and y<SUP>t</SUP> we haue sought out of the holy Scriptures, which we knowe can not deceiue vs, a certaine constant forme of Religion, and are now retourned vnto the primitiue Church of the Apostles and of the auncient fathers: y<SUP>t</SUP> is to say, to the first originall and to the beginnings, and as it were, to the very fountaines of Christes Church. True it is in dede, y<SUP>t</SUP> for the accomplishemēt hereof, we haue not at∣tended vpon the aucthoritie or consent of the councel of Trente, in which we coulde not hope to see any thinge vprightly and orderly done, specially where all mē are sworne to one man, where our Princes Embassadors ar cōtemned, where none of our diuines mai be heard, &amp; where men ar euidently enclined vnto partes and to ambition: but according as the holy fathers in tyme past and our predecessors haue done oft time, we refor∣med our Churches by a councel gathered in our owne prouince: and that as touching the yoke and tirannye of the Bysshop of Rome, vnto whome wee ought no dutye, and in whom there is no resemblance either of Christ, or of Petre, or of an Apostle, or in any point of a Bysshop, according as it behoued vs, we haue shakē of and cast away: And last of all, how y<SUP>t</SUP> we doe agree amongest our selues in all the principles and articles of Christian Religion, and with one mouthe and one spirit doe worshippe God and the father of our Lorde Iesus Christ.</P>
<P>Wherfore good Christiā reader, in as much as y<SUP>u</SUP> seest the reasons &amp; causes both of our doings touching the restitutiō of Religiō amōgst vs, &amp; also of our departing from the fellowship of these men, thou oughtest not
<PB REF="69"/>
to maruaile if y<SUP>t</SUP> we had rather obey our Iesus Christ then men. Paule dyd admonishe vs, that we shoulde not suffer, our selues to be caried out of the way with these variable doctrines: and thal specially wee should flye from them that woulde sowe any dissension from that doctrine which wee had receiued from Chryste, and from the Apostles. Their iuggeling toyes, euen as the owle at the rysing of the Sunne, beginne alre∣dy to fall and flye away at the presence and light of the Gospell: And although they were pyled and heaped vp, euen to the highe skyes: yet they fall downe againe vpon the least occasion and in manner of their owne accorde. For thou oughtest not to imagine that al these things are happened at a blind auenture or by chaūce: for it was goddes will that maugre the malice in ma∣ner of all men, the Gospell of Iesus Christ shoulde be spredde in these dayes throughout the worlde. Where∣fore men, beyng admonysshed by gods worde, haue of their owne accorde applyed themselues to the doctrine of Christe. Wee surely haue not sought to wynne vn∣to our selues either glory, either riches, either pleasure, eyther ease thereby. For all these thinges our aduer∣saries haue in great aboundance, and we also, what time we were amongest them, had such thinges more largely and more plentifully. Neither doe we abhorre from peace &amp; agrement: but for conseruation of world∣ly peace, we will wage no warres w<SUP>t</SUP> God.
<Q>Doubtles, saith Hylarius, the name of peace is sweete: but peace saith he, is one thing, and thraldome is an other.</Q>
For to assent, which is the thyng that these men doe seeke for, that Chryste shoulde bee commaunded to sylence, that the truthe of the Gospell shoulde bee betrayed,
<PB N="69" REF="69"/>
that wicked errours, should be dissembled, that the eyes of Christian menne shoulde be blered, that men should manifestly conspire agaynst God, is not an establysh∣ment of peace, but a moste horrible couenant of thral∣dome.
<Q>There is saythe Nazianzene a certayne kinde of peace, vnprofitable: ther is a profitable discorde. For we muste allowe peace with an exception, so farre as it is laweful, and so farre as we may.</Q>
For otherwise Christ himself brought not peace into the world, but a sword. Wherefore yt the Pope will haue vs to be friendes a∣gayne with him, lette him firste reconcile himselfe with God.
<Q>For hereof saythe Cyprian, scismes doe aryse, by∣cause the head is not sought for, and menne retorne not home to the fountaynes of the holy Scriptures, and the commaundementes of the heauenly doctor ar not kept. For that sayth he, is not peace, but warre: nother is he that is disseuered from the gospell, ioyned to the Churche, but these menne doe only set to sale the name of peace to their owne gayne: for that peace which thei so muche require, is nothyng but the ease and satisfac∣tion of idle beallies.</Q>
For all these matters might be en∣ded well ynough amongest vs, if ambition, bellychere and licencious liuyng were no hinderance therto. Frō hence cometh all the sorowe: their minde is vpon their platters. This is hit they crie and make all this buysi∣nes for, that thinges euill gotten, they might more fil∣thily and lewdly maintaine. Al Pardoners, Dataries, Collectors, Bawdes and others that thynke gayne, to be godlines, and serue not Iesus Christ but theyr own bellies, doe greuously complayne of vs at this day: For in time paste this kinde of men had good dayes in the olde worlde. But nowe what so euer increase cometh
<PB REF="70"/>
vnto Christe, that thinke they turneth them to losse. This is hit, whereon the Pope himself complaineth at this daye, that charitie forsoth is waxen could, bycause his rentes ar lesse nowe then they were wonte to be. Thus he bringeth vs into hatered al that he maye, and rayleth vpon vs and condemneth vs for heretikes: to the intent that they whiche vnderstande not the mat∣ter, should thinke there were no worse men vpō earth. Yet we for all this nother ar, nor ought to be ashamed of the gospell. For we regarde more the glory of God, then the estimation of menne. We knowe that all these thinges which we doe teache, ar trewe, neyther can we either vse violence agaynst the knowlege of our owne conscience, nother yet present our selfs as witnesses a∣gaynst God. For if we denie any parte of the gospel of Iesus Christe before menne, he on the other side, will denie vs agayne before his father. Now if there be any that will be offended and maye not endure the doctrine of Christe, they be blinde themself, and leaders of suche as ar blinde: Neuerthelesse the truthe must be preached and set forthe by our open profession of the same, and patiently we muste loke for the Iudgement of God to come. In the meane while let these menne take heede what they doe, let thē haue some regarde of their owne saluation, and let them ceasse to hate and to persequute the gospell of the sonne of God, leaste at the length they finde him to be the punisher and reuenger of his owne cause. God will not suffer himselfe to be mocked. Men doe see all ready how the matter goeth. This flame the more it is kepte vnder, so muche the more and more it breaketh out and flyeth abrode. Their vnfaythfulnesse shall not deface the fayth of God: but if they dispose not
<PB N="70" REF="70"/>
themselfe to laye awaye this hardnesse of their hartes and to receyue the gospell, the Publicanes and sinners shall goe before them into the kingdome of God.</P>
<P>God and the father of our Lord Iesus Christ open all their eyes, that they maye see that same blessed hope whereunto they ar called: that we maye all together in one, worshippe that same onely and true God, and that same Iesus Christ, whome he sente downe to vs from Heauen. To whome together with the Father and the holy Ghost, be giuen all honor and glory for euer and euer. Amen.</P>
