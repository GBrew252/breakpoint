<HEAD>JANUARY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now <HI>Ianuary,</HI> and winged Time (the measure of motion) begins to turne the Wheele of his Revolution. The smiling fields and youthfull meadows have lost their particoloured Live∣ries; The Woods have parted with their beautious verdour, and the amorous Trees that but the other day with out-stretcht armes embraced each other, stand now at a distance. In a word, the White hath routed the Greene Regiment, root and branch. The Squirrel now (that Hector that covers her back with her Tayle) survayes the Nut and the Maple all day, and at night goes to Bed in her Kell, whilst the proud Oake stoops to the Axe; and the Hedge-hog rowles up himself like a foot-ball, and with his natu∣rall fortification stands on his own guard. The Black-bird finds thin shelter in the bush, and therefore leaves not a berry on the thorne. The Fisherman hath now but a cold Trade, and the frost∣nipt Centinel keeps a hard watch, when he dares not for his ears stir off though he be ready to eat his fingers end. The Cook-room now is not the worst place in the Ship: And the Shepheard hath a bleak seat on the Mountaines. The dryed grasse is the horses Ordinary, and the Meale of Oats and Beanes makes him trot through the Mire. The Garden Earth is turned up for her Roots. The Load-horse hath his full back burthen to the Mill, and the Wench should not ride on it were she not light. The Thresher in the Barne tryes the strength of his flaile, and counts it better employment then washing of Sheep. To conclude; the Hills and the Valleys, and the flowery Meads doe pennance in a sheet of snow for their luxury and pride in the Spring; whilst the hard heart∣ed frost locks up the Wormes, and the Pismires, and the blind Velveteers in the earth.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have showne you in part what <HI>Ianuary</HI> is, which in∣deed is rather felt then understood. I now come to advise you, and in the first place, have a care of Bleeding, except in case of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ui∣ses by falls or otherwise, there your Physitian will advise you to it to prevent accidents that doe commonl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> attend such maladies: Or else in violent <HI>Haemorrages,</HI> or bleeding at Nose, for revulsi∣on sake; but truly as to Feavors or Plurysies they have their spee∣dier, safer, and more proper Cures without Phlebotomy. I there∣fore
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
give thee the same advice I meane to practise my self; that is, now and then in snow and frosty weather, to thaw your congea∣led veyns, and cherish it with a glasse or two of rich and rasie wines, which are chiefly chosen by these five F's, <HI>Fortia, Formosa, Fragrantia, Frigida, Frisca.</HI> Neither would I have you too busie with Physick without great occasion constraine, for mens bodyes are bound up as the earth in frosty weather, and therefore not without extream danger are purging medicines exhibited to open the pores of the body for cold and pernicious Aire to enter. Be sure you have a care of taking the least cold head or foot, for this Month Rheumes and Flegme doe extraordinarily encrease. To fast long is exceeding hurtfull, it fills the stomack and intestines with wind, and renders thee subject to Collicks, Convulsions, and Illiack passions. But to drink a draught of Ale and Wormewood wine mixt in a morning, comforts the heart, scowers the Maw, and purges the Ureters, and is good against gravell or stone. Let your diet be such as is naturally of a moderate heat, and you may eat a more liberall meale now then in Summer, for the heat of the Sto∣mack is more intense, and vigorous to concoct what it requires or receives, then it will be when the Sun with his nearer neighbour∣hood calls forth that now self-centered heat to the extimous and cutaneous parts of the body. As to Apparell, I hold it a needlesse thing to prescribe, for I presume frost and snow will convince thee that a freez Jacket, will doe ye more service then a Taffita doublet.</P>
<P>For the Country man if he live in stiffe simple clayes, let him in this Month in the first place, plow up his pease earth, that it may lye and take baite before it be sowne: But if he live in fertile and well mixt soyles, then in this month he shall begin to fallow the field he will lay to rest the next yeare; but if he live upon hard barren earths (of which chiefly I write) then in this Month he shall water his Meadows and pasture grounds, and drain his arable grounds, especially where he intends to sow pease, oats, or barley the Seed time following: also he shall stub up all such rough grounds as he intends to sow the next year.</P>
<P>Now measure and trim up your garden mould, and comfort with manure, sand, or lime the Roots of all barren fruit Trees, and cleanse away mosse and superfluous branches from them. You may plant, or transplant all manner of fruit-trees, as Apples, Peares, Plums, Cherries, Filbert, Walnut. The fittest time of setting all
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
manner of Plants or Quicksets (the weather open and the ground easie) is from the change to the first Quarter.</P>
<P>You may now geld such Cattle as ye intend (the state of the Moon alwayes considered) and such as are sick or weak ye may drench, Kine with Verjuice and London-Triacle, and Horses with your common Mashes of water, and ground Malt, and a little Bran. The time is good to reare Calves, and remove Bees.</P>
<P>Now for the recreations of this Month, they are within, or without doores, within, as it relates to Christmasse; it shares the chearfull carrolls of the wassell cup, Beasts, Fowls, and Fish come to a generall Execution, and Hecatombs are sacrificed to cold weather, and Cards and Dice purge many a purse, and the ven∣trous youth shew their agility in shooing the Wild-Mare. The Lord of misrule is no meane man for his time; a good fire heats all the house, and a full Alms-basket sets the beggar to his pray∣ers, Masking, and Mumming, and choosing King and Queen, the meeting of the friendly, and the mirth of the honest.</P>
<P>For out door Recreations. Now does the early Hunts-man prevent the Sun-rise, and watches the Stag to his Leire, (which this month he expects in the Corne fields of wheat and Rye) and having lodg'd him, home he comes for his Horne and his deep mouth'd Quire; now are the pampered Pransers trampling the Plaines as greedy of sport as their Masters. Now are the finders cast off, and after a ring or two about, in goe the full mouth'd cho∣rus, and now the Hunts-man comforts the Hounds with his Horn, and the sight of the Stagg. Now the Horses try their heels, and the Riders their throats, whilst the empty Woods Eccho the thunder with a double resound: The horses sweat, the Hunts-man frets, and the Stag is imbost, the next and last refuge is a sett, or a Soyle, then comes the death of the Deere, and the Talbot sup∣ples his Tongue, and his Master his hands with the reeking blood.</P>
<P>Now the Woodcock and the Pheasant pay their lives for their feed, and the Hare after a Course makes his Hearse in a Pye. The Oxe and the fat Weather now furnish the Market; and the poor Coney is so ferrited that she cannot keep in her Burrough; The Curryer, and the Lime-Rod are the death of the Fowle, and a long Peece, and a good water Spaniel are no bad company. The Faulcons Bells ring the Mallards knell, and the Hare and the
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
Hound put the Huntsman to the horne. The barren Doe subscribes to the dish, and the smallest seed makes sawce for the greatest flesh, but the shoulder of an hog is a shooing horne for good drink. The Maid is stirring betimes, and slipping on her shooes and her Petticoat, groaps for the tinder box, where after a con∣flict between the steele and the stone she begets a spark, at last the Candle lights on his March; then upon an old rotten foun∣dation of broaken boards she erects an artificiall fabrick of the black Bowels of New-Castle soyle, to which she sets fire with as much confidence as the Romans to their Funerall Pyles; the comfortable light whereof is the good fellows Cynosure, and be∣comes more magnetick then the Loadstone; for there he stayes till like the fly he scorches himself in the flame, which like that strange Lightning melts the Blade in the Scabberd, I mean the plate in his Pocket, whilst he is making his offering to <HI>Ceres</HI> and <HI>Bacchus.</HI> To conclude, this Month is the rich mans charge, and the poor mans misery.</P>

<P>NOw is the aspiring Sun got a Cock-stride of his climbing; and the humble Valleyes are covered with a Rug of snow, whilst the lofty Mountaines obvious to every blast are nipt to the heart with a cold. <HI>Neptune</HI> hath glazed his wavy Court, and left not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o much as a Casement for his scaly subjects and finny friends to look out at; who are therefore gone downe to his Cellars to carouze it to the Sun, that Ambassadour of Heaven, that ere long will dissolve their icy fetters, and pay his golden beames for their ransome. The Frog goes to seek out the Paddock; and the Crow, and the Rook mislike their old Mates. The Usurer now is lapt in his furres, and the poor makes his breath a fire to his fin∣gers ends. Beauty is maskt for feare of the Aire, and the flea hath his subterfuge in the wool of a blanket. Cards and Dice have scarce yet got their Harvest in, and Sack, and good Ale are the cause of civill Warres, <HI>Muscovia</HI> Commodities are now in much request, and down beds, and quilted Caps are in the pride of their service, whilst the Cook and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pantler are men of no meane office. An apple and a nutmeg make a merry Gossips feast; and the Ale and the Faggot are the Victuallers merchandise. The delay of Law-suits is the death of hope, and a cold almes mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the beggar shrug. The terme travellers makes the Shoo-makers Harvest, and the Chaundle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Cheese makes the Chalk walk apace. The Fishmonger sorts his water-work for <HI>Lent,</HI> and beats the poor Stock-fish for his stubbo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nness, whilst the Herring domineers as a Lord of great Service, and though but yestarday a sorry Jack∣sprat, he calls himself King of Fishes. The fruit of the Dairy makes a hungry Feast whilst fasting and mourning is the Life of the poor, and the Dogs are grown leane fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> want of bones, and make good Album Graecum a sca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce Commodity. The Beasts of the forrest have a bare feed, and the hard Crufts try the beggars teeth. The barefooted Colt hath a ragged coat, and the half mew∣ed h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isgraceth the Deere. The Shepheard hath but little pleasure in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pipe; and the Souldier finds cold comfort in the sconce. Penury pinches the Prisoners heart: and the deep fal∣lowes weary the Hunts-man. The Fisherman is now the Raker of the Sea, and every day sacrifices to his ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Net. The Aire is
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
sharp and piercing, and the winds blow cold: the Tavernes and the Inns seldome lack guests; and the Ostler knowes how to make p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ofit of his hay. The hunting Horse is at the heels of the Hound, whilst the ambling Nag carryes the Physitian and his foot cloth. The blood of youth begins to spring, and the sap to rise up out of the Root; Physick hath now work among weak bodies; and he looks well to himself that catches not an Ague before the end of this Month: there is nothing pleasing but hope that the dayes will lengthen and time be more comfortable. And for the small pleasure that I find in it, I will thus briefly conclude of it: It is the poor mans pick-purse, and the miser's Cut-throat; the enemy of pleasure, and the exercise of patience.</P>
<P>In this Month eschew all such things as oppilate and stop the Liver and Veines or doe thicken the blood, of which kind are Milk and Rice, and slimy fish; and yet also forbear medling with Physick or blood-letting, except necessity doth urge, and the Learned advise you. I gave you a hint of an Ague before, and if you have a mind to one catch cold and I will warrant you the other.</P>
<P>Now methinks I see <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Husbandman dresse afresh his rusty Plowshare to teare up the stiffer clay grounds, and the Garden∣er sending his Seeds their severall beds, and the Garden mould is made a Grave for the Beanes and the Pease.</P>
<P>The fliffer &amp; colder the ground is, begin so much the sooner to Plow Prune &amp; trim your fruit Trees, &amp; cleanse them from mosse and Cankers, and from super<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luous Branches, as in <HI>Ianuary.</HI> The best time of grafting from the time of removing your stock is the next Spring, for that saves a second wound and a repulse of Sap, if your Stock be of sufficient bignesse to take a graffe from as bigge as your thumb, to as big as a mans arme, you may graffe less (which I like) and bigger, which I like not so well. The best time of the yeare is in the last part of <HI>February</HI> or <HI>March,</HI> and the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> when the Sun with his heat begins to make the sap stir more rankly about the change of the Moon, before you see any great appearance of leafe or flowers, but only knots, and buds, and before they be proved, though it be sooner; Cherries, Pears, Apricock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Quinces, and Plums would be gathered, and grafted sooner in <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>Forward Conyes begin now to kindle, and the fat grounds are not without Lambs, and it is now a good time for Ewes to bring
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
forth, that their Lambs may be strong, and able before <HI>May</HI> day to follow their Damms over the rough fallow Lands and deep water furrowes which weak and feeble Lambs are not able to do; and although you yean thus early in the winter when there is lit∣tle or no grasse springing, and the sharpnesse of the weather also be dangerous, yet the Husbandman must provide sweet fodder and convenient shelter, and the Shepheard must bestirre himself, and be vigilant to prevent all incident evills and incon∣veniences, and though the Ewe at the first be somewhat scarce of milk, yet as the warme weather encreaseth and the grasse be∣ginneth to spring, so will her Milk spring also.</P>
<P>Now does the stood over-run his banks and imitates the Ocean, and the gaping Oyster leaves his shell in the streets, while the house topping Peacock is pie-bakt for his Pride. Now runs the poor Hare for neither Pins nor poynts, but her life, and like that Senatour of <HI>Rome</HI> is followed and found out by her scent, to the losse of her life; and unequall Fate she must run for't, or with <HI>Cocles</HI> duel an Army. All the night when her eyes should be shut, she is forced to open her mouth in natures be∣halfe, and all the day she sets melan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> in a Bush, her open eyes are her Watch-Towers, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> her Centinels, al∣wayes expecting an alarme from the enemy who too too often call her out and make her lead them a dance, but at last their deep notes are her knell and the Huntsmans Womb is her Tomb; as at fairest after a Course she makes her hearse in a Pye. Thus ends this eager pursuit after many doublings and windings squat∣tings and other shifts and sleights, and where is all the spoyle? but a pint of butter to a Kennel of Hounds; neverthelesse, though lit∣tle she is not without profit and worth the having: Her flesh, first, is good for all manner of Fluxes, her Brains good to make children breed their teeth with ease, her Wool excellent to stanch blood, her Gall soveraigne for the eyes, her blood to kill Rheume and Wormes, her stiffling bone being worne takes away the paine of the Crampe, with many other good things beside, and I beleeve her Furre-gown would doe no hurt to the knees that labour of a cold gout, especially in this cold moyst and raw Month of <HI>February.</HI></P>

The soft and delicate hands must not be ungloved; but the good Huswife hasts to the open fields, and bleaches her linnen with the breath of Aeolus, which in dirty <HI>De∣cember</HI> had gotten the yellow Jaundies, and this is the only time to purge them. The Sun is now risen a pretty step to his faire height, and Saint <HI>Valentine</HI> calls the Birds together, where Na∣ture is pleased with the variety of love, and the little winged Familists make election of their Mates for building, and keeping of house this Spring. The Fishes, and the Frogs fall to their man∣ner of Generation, leaving the spawn floating upon the face of the Brooks, and the Adder dyes to bring forth her unnaturall frye. Now the Brewer is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to store the Cellars with <HI>March</HI> Beer, which brewed in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> keeps excellently well, and hath the honour to be called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Air is sharp but the Sun is comfor∣table and cherisheth the Banks with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Beame, whilst the boysterous winds purge and saluti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the grosser Aire. The dayes begin to lengthen apace: the forward Gardens give many a fine Sallet, and a nose-gay of Violets is a present, for a Lady: The Prime-Rose is now in his Prime, and the Trees begin to bud, and the green spices of grasse to peep out of the earth Now is Nature as it were waking out of her sleep; and sends the Tra∣veller to survay the walks of the World. The Farrier now is the Horses Physitian, and horse spice and <HI>Diapent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> sets the Apothe∣caryes boyes at work. The Thrush and the Blackbird make a charme in the springs that are young and tender: and the fat dog feeds the sharp Faulcon in the Mew. The Milk Maid is up as soon as the Sun, and sings away sorrow to the Cimballs of the Cowes Teats whilst she robs the Calves of the bounty of nature, she with her best beloved talks away tiresomnesse to the Market, and where the meaning is honest kind words doe no hurt. The Foot-ball now tryes the legs of the strongest, and merry marches

continue good fellowship; but beware of your shins and a bro∣ken leg: In summe, It is a time of much labour, whereof I am about to discourse, and to be short, I hold it the servant of nature and the Schoolmaster of Art; the hope of labour and the subject of Reason.</P>
<P>It is now time, honest Country-man, to make an end of sowing of all sorts of small pulse, and to begin to sow Oats, Barley, and Rye, which is called March-Rye. Graffe all sorts of Fruit-trees, and with young Plants, and Syens replenish your Nurcery. Co∣ver the Roots of all Trees that are bared, and with fat and preg∣nant earth lay them close, and warme. If any Trees grow barren bore holes in the Roots, and drive pins or hard wedges of Oake wood therein, and that will produce fruitfulnesse. Transplant all sort of Summer Flowers, especially the Crown imperiall, Tu∣lips, Hyacinths, and <HI>Narcissus</HI> of all shapes and colours. Cut downe underwood for fewell and fencing; and look well to your Cowes, for this is the principall time of Calving; and if you would be for a March brood of Chickens, you must be sure to set your Hen in <HI>February</HI> in the increase of the Moon, so that she may hatch or disclose her Chickens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he increase of the next Moon, being in <HI>March,</HI> and one brood of <HI>March</HI> chickens is worth three broods of any other, for then you shall have the best largest and most kindly Chickens. You may if you please sett Hens from <HI>March</HI> till <HI>October,</HI> and have good Chickens but not after by any meanes, for the Winter is a great enemy to their breeding; yet some will attempt to sett them in Winter-time in Stows or Ovens, but it is of little or no use with us in <HI>England,</HI> and though it is confest they may by that means bring forth, yet will the chickens be never kindly good, nor profitable, but like the Planting of Lemon, Orange, and Pomegranate Trees in our colder Climate, the fruits whereof come a great deale short of the charges. If you chufe Hens to sett, chuse the eldest for they are constant, and will sett out their times. If you chuse to lay, take the youngest for they are lustier, and prone to the act of en∣gendring, but for neither purpose chuse a fat Hen, for if you sett her shee will forsake her nest, and if you keep her to lay, she will wax sloathfull, and neither delight in the one, nor the other act of nature, such then are fitter for the dish then the Hen-house.

Turkies in this Month and the next lay all their Eggs, and al∣wayes sit in <HI>April</HI> when the weather is warme, to bring forth their tender brood.</P>
<P>In this Month the Humours of mans body begin to increase the tenth of it being accounted the beginning of the Spring. Now look to your dyet, for grosse feeding breeds grosse and thick blood, and grosse humours, therefore use meats of good digesti∣on▪ and such as breeds good juyce (which Physitians call <HI>Euchy∣mia</HI>) and nourisheth the body, as Veal, Lamb, and sucking Rab∣bets, these are good for weak stomacks; Smallage and Nettle Pottage make good blood, and the dyet for the Rheume doth now many a good cure. It is now good to purge, and clarifie the bloud by potions, and to take away a little of the grosser bloud is good to breath the veins, which thereby will have more room for the rest to stir and clarifie it self in, or any such way as the learned Doctors shall prescribe the patient, or as the cause of the disease shall require: also this Month sweet meats and drink are commendable.</P>
<P>Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Months Recreation, it consists of profit as much as Sport: It is either sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>g or Hunting; shooting in Musquets or Fowling pieces at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cowes and such Vermine as constantly wait upon the yeaning Ewes to pick out the eyes of their new fallen weak and feeble Lambs. To the same end also is the exer∣cise of Hunting the Fox and Badger, which would else hunt the poor, silly Lambs and devout them to Feast his Cubbs. The Fox Chase is pleasant for the time, for so soone as ye have unkenneld him, by reason of his strong Scent there are few or no defaults, but a continued sport if you ob∣serve his Haunts, and stop up his Kennels, and prevent his earthing; the worst is, he runs bad ground either for horse or foot, but the enterprize is noble, and necessary. For the Badger, his is night work, and he is rather baited then hunted adayes. If you look for the Hare you shall be sure to have her in low grounds, for in <HI>March</HI> she alwayes sets wet bretch.</P>

<P>WElcome sweet <HI>Aprill</HI>! thou gentle Midwife of <HI>May</HI>'s Pride, and the Earths green Livery. Me∣thinks I heare the little sweet birds making ready their wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bling Accents to entertaine the Rising Sun and welcome him from the <HI>Antipodes</HI> and those remoter Regions that have all this Winter rob'd us of his comfortable beames and be∣nigne influence. But now the Cuckoe is come and the laborious Bees looke about for honey. The Nightingale begins to tune her melodious throat against <HI>May</HI>: and the Sunny showers perfume the Aire. The Dew hangs in Pearles upon the tops of the grasse; while the Turtles sit billing on the little green boughs. The beasts of the Wood look out into the plaines: And the Fishes out of the deep run up into the shallow waters. The Fowls of the Aire begin to build their Nests, and the sencelesse Creatures gather life into their bodyes. The Sun with his refulgent rayes enlightens and warmes the Aire, and the little Flyes to Flock and swarme in it. Now the Muses try the Poeta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters in the Pamflets. Time is now gracious in Nature, and Nature in time. The Air is wholsome, and the earth plea∣sant, and the Sea not uncomfortable. The Trowt begins to play in the Brooks, and the Salmon leaves the salt Sea, and in spite of Wind and Tide will sport it in the fresh Rivers, and like the Hyeroglyphick Snake, takes his Tayle in his Mouth, and mounts it over the Mill-Dams. The Garden Banks are full of gay Flowers; and the Thorne and the Plumme are white with faire blossomes. The <HI>March</HI> Colt begins to play; and the Cosset Lamb is learning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Chimney Corner. The youth of the Country m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke ready for the Morris-dance, and the Merry Milkmaid supplies them with ribbands her true Love had given her. The little Fishes lye nibling at the bait; and the Porpus playes in the pride of the Tide. The Shepheards Pipe entertains the

Princes of <HI>Arcadia</HI> with pleasant Roundelayes: And the healthfull Souldier hath a march of delight. The Aged feele a kind of youth; and youth hath a spirit full of life and acti∣vity: the Aged hairs refreshen; and the youthfull cheeks are as red as a Cherry: The Lark and the Lamb look up at the Sun, and the Labourer is abroad by the dawning of the day. The Sheeps eye in the Lambs head tell kind-hearted Maids strange tales; and Faith and Troth make the true Lovers Knot: It were a World to set down the worth of this Month; for it is Heavens blessing, and the Earths Comfort; It is the Messenger of many pleasures; the Courtiers Pro∣gresse, and the Farmers profit; the Labourers Harvest, and the Beggers Pilgrimage. In summe, there is much to be spoken of it, but to avoid tediousnesse I hold it in all that I can see in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the Jewell of Time, and the Joy of Nature.</P>
<P>In the month of <HI>Aprill</HI> finish up all your Barley Seed, and begin to sow your Hemp and Flax, sow your Garden Seeds and Plant all sorts of Hearbs, finish your graffing in the Stock, but begin your principall inauguration, for then the rind is most pliant and gentle. Open your Hives, and give your Bees free Liberty to look into the Garden and the blossoming buds; leave to succour them with food, and let them alone to labour for their living.</P>
<P>Now cut downe all great Oake timber, for now the Bark will rise and be in season for the Tanner. Now scower your Ditches, and gather such manure as you make in the Streets, or high wayes into great and convenient heaps together. Now also lay your Meadows and sleight your Corne ground; ga∣ther away stones, and repair your high-wayes; set Oziers and Willowes, and cast up the banks and mines of all decayed fen∣ces. As yet ye may graffe or proine Vines, and also set Ci∣trons, Melons, Cucumbers, Artichoaks, and Pole-hops. And you that are Tanners, it is your season now to look out for the ruffe skins of the lofty looking Oake that yields to good Day-men natures abundance.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="12"/>The best time to put your Stallion and Mares together is about the Middle of last Month, if you have any graffe, and you should have great care for that purpose, and one foal falling in <HI>March</HI> is worth two failing in <HI>May,</HI> because he passeth as it were two winters in a year, and is thereby so hardened, that almost nothing can afterward impaire him: And the best time to take your Horse from the Mares againe is at the end of <HI>April</HI> or middle of <HI>May,</HI> a months continuance together is ever sufficient; but be sure to put them together in the en∣crease of the Moone, for foals got in the Wane are not ac∣counted strong and healthfull.</P>
<P>In this instant Month of <HI>Aprill</HI> the pores of mans body are opened by the approach of the Sun, and apt to receive Physick, and they that refuse the same, I commit them to the benefit of Nature, for of all times of the year, this is the best to prevent causes of sicknesse, or for speedy Remedy in extremities, for now nature doth renew strength through all the body of man, so that where sicknesse happeneth she soone disburdeneth her self by the assistance of Physick, and of this be confident, what cannot be done now will hardly be ever capable of Remedy after: Take time therefore by his foretop for he is bald behind; you may very safely either take purging Medicines or any physick your approved Phy∣sitian shall advise you to. You may Bathe freely or bleed, provided the Patient be not under fourteene years, or above fifty six Old, or be exceeding fat or very lean; in such cases, by all means abstaine. Lastly, Use wholsome Dyet that breeds good sanguine Juyce, such as Pullets, Capons, sucking Veal, Beef not above three years Old, a draught of morning milk fasting from the Cow, Grapes, Raysons, and Figs be good be∣fore meat, Rice with Almond Milk, birds of the Field, Fea∣sants and Partridges, and fishes of Stony Rivers, Hen Eggs potcht and such like. Use wholsome recreation, for then mo∣derate exercise there is no better physick.</P>

Now gentle <HI>Zephyrus</HI> fans the sweet Buds, and dripping Clouds water fair <HI>Flor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> great Garden; the Sun-beams bring forth fair Blossoms; and the perfumed Ayre refresheth every spirit; the Flowry Queen now brings forth her Wardrobe, and richly Embroyder∣eth her green Apron. The Nymphs of the Woods in consort with the Muses, sing an <HI>Ave</HI> to the Morning, and a <HI>Vale</HI> to the Evening. The male Deer puts out the velvet head, and the pagged Doe is near her Fawning. The Sparhawk now is drawn out of the Mew, and the Fowler makes ready his Whistle for the Quail; the Lark sets the Morning Watch, and the Nigh∣tingale the Evening. The beautified Barges keep the Streams of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>weet Rivers, like so many pleasant Bowers; whilst the dappled Mackarel with the shade of a Cloud is taken prisoner in the Ocean. The tall young Oak is cut down for a May-pole, and the frolick Fry of the Town prevent the rising Sun, and with joy in their faces, and boughs in their hands, they march before it to the place of Erection; and if any kind Sweet-heart left her Maidenhead in a Bush, she has good luck if she finde it again next <HI>May</HI>-day; The Sythe and the Sick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e are the Mow∣ers furniture; and a moneth of fair Weather makes the La∣bourer merry. The Physitian now prescribes the cold Whey to his Patient, and the Apothecary gathers the Chrystal Dewy Drops for a Medicine. Butter and Sage are now the wholsome Breakfast, but fresh Cheese and Cream are meat for a dainty mouth; the early Peascods and Strawberries want no price with great Bellies; but the Chicken and the Duck are fatted for the Market; the sucking Rabbet is frequently taken in the Nest; and many a Gosling never lives to be a Goose. In a

word, it is the moneth wherein Nature hath her full of mirth, and the Senses are stored with delights; It is therefore from the Heavens a grace, and to the Earth a gladness; I hold it a sweet and delicate Season, the Variety of Pleasures, and the Paradice of Love.</P>
<P>In the moneth of <HI>May,</HI> sow Barley upon all light sands and burning grounds, so likewise order your Hemp or Flax, and also all sorts of tender Garden Seeds, as are Cucumbers, and Me∣lons, and all kinde of sweet smelling Herbs, and Flowers; Fallow your stiff Clayes; Summer-stir your mixt earth, and Soil all loose hot sands; prepare all barren earth for Wheat and Rye; Burn Bait, Stub Gorse, and Furres, and Root out Broom and Fern; Begin to Fold your Sheep, lead forth Manure, and bring home Fewel, and Fencing; Weed your Winter Corn, follow your common Works, and put all sorts of Grass either in Pasture, or Teather; You may this moneth also put your Mares to Horse; let nothing be wanting to furnish the Dayrie, and now look and Pot up your Butter; true it is, you may if you please Pot it up at any time betwixt <HI>May</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> observing to do it in the coolest time of the morning; yet the most principal season of all is in this moneth of <HI>May</HI>; so now the Ayr is most temperate, and the Butter will take Salt the best, and be the least subject to reesting.</P>
<P>If during the moneth of <HI>May</HI> before you Salt your Butter, you save a Lump thereof, and put it into an earthen pan, and so expose it to the Sun during the whole moneth you shall finde it exceeding soveraigne, and medicinable for wounds, strains, aches, and such like grievances.</P>
<P>Now put off all your winter-fed-Cattel, for now they are scarcest, and dearest; Put young Stiers, and dry Kine now to feed at fresh Grass, and away with all Pease-fed Sheep, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the sweetness of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as-Mutton will pull down their prizes.

<P>Now you that set any price by your healths, rise early in the morning, for <HI>May</HI> does not love any sluggards; Let such as be

in health, and able, walk into the Fields, and eat and drink be∣times; for it is good and wholsome: Abstain from all meats that be of a hot nature; and for such as be sick, it is a very good time to let blood, or to take Physick; for such as be whole, God keep them in health, and let them use Drinks that will cool, and purge the Blood, and all other such Physical preventions as Art and Observation shall direct them; for such as be sick, God send them good Physick, and learned Physiti∣ans; but above all things, beware of Mountebanks, and old Wives tales; the one hath no Ground, and the other no Truth, but are both nothing but senseless babble, and apparent cousenage.</P>
<P>If you take delight in Angling, I shall here suit your Baits and Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to the moneth, that with the more ease you may fol∣low your Recreation; and therefore know in the first place, If you angle for the <HI>Carp,</HI> you must have a strong Rod and Line, of at least seven or nine hairs, mixed either with green or wat∣chet silk, your Cork long, large, and smooth, your Lead smooth, and close, and fixed neer the Hook, and the Hook almost of a three-peny compass; he is very dainty to bite, but at some special hours, as very early in the morning, or very late at night, and therefore he must be very much enticed with Paste; His best baits are the <HI>Moss-worm,</HI> the <HI>Red-worm,</HI> or the <HI>Menew,</HI> for he seldome refuseth them, the <HI>Endis-worm</HI> is good for him next moneth; Let your Paste be of sour Ale, white of Egges, and Bread-crums, this much entiseth him.

<P>NOw is it <HI>Iune,</HI> and the stately Hart is at layre in the high Wood, while the Hare in a Furrow sits washing her face; the Leaves begin to whisper of the blessings of the Ayr, whilest with out-stretched Arms the Courtly Trees embrace each o∣ther; the Lambs and the Rabbers run at Base in the sandy War∣rens, and the Plow-lands are covered with Corn; the Bull makes his walk like a master of the field, and the broad-headed Oxe bears the Garland of the Market; the self-pleasing Angler with a Fly deceives the wanton Fish, while the little Merline hath the Partridge in the foot; the honey Dews sweeten the Ayr, and the Sunny Showers are the comfort of the Earth; the Greyhound on the plain makes the fair Course, and the deep-mouth'd Hound makes the Musick of the Woods; Idle Spirits are banish'd the Lists of Honour, while the studious Brain brings forth his Wonder; the azure Sky showes the Heavens are gracious, and the glorious Sun glads the spirit of Nature; the Hay-makers are mustered to make an Army for the field, where (not alwayes in Order) they march under the Bag and the Bottle, when betwixt the Fork and the Rake, there is seen great force of Arms; The Hook and the Sickle are making ready for Harvest, and the Cuckoe is still in his Note; the Me∣dow grounds are gaping for Rain, and the Corn in the Ear be∣gins to harden; the little Lads make them Pipes of the Straw, and they that cannot Dance, will yet be Hopping; the Ayre now groweth very warm, and the cooler W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds are very com∣fortable; the nimble Footman runs now with delight, and the Sun-burnt Sayler rides his Wooden Horse with pleasure: Now doth the broad-spreading Oak comfort the weary Laboure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, while under his Shady Boughs he sits singing to his Bread and Cheese; the Hay-cock is the poor man's Lodging, and the fresh gliding River is his gracious Neighbour; Now the Faulcon and the Tassel try their wings at the Partridge, and the fat Buck fills the great Pasty; the Trees are all in their rich Array, but the poor silly Sheep is turn'd out of his Coat; the Roses, and
<PB N="28" REF="17"/>
the sweet Herbs put the Distiller to his Cunning, while the green Apples on the Tree are ready for the great-bellyed Wives; Now begins the Hare to gather up her heels, and the Fox looks about him for fear of the Hounds. In brief, I thus con∣clude, I hold it a sweet season, the Senses perfume, and the Spi∣rits comfort.</P>
<P>In the moneth of <HI>Iune,</HI> carry Sand, Marl, Lime, and Manure of what kinde soever, to your Land; Bring home your Coals, and other necessary Fewel, fetcht far off; Cut rank low Mea∣dows, and make the first Return of your fat Cattel; Gather early Summer Fruits; It is now good time to distil all your Simple Waters, as Roses, and all manner of Herbs and Plants, and to make Syrups of Flowers and Juyces; Now also gather what Herbs you mean to lay up for Winter Service, but be sure you dry them in the shade, for the vigour of the Sun will else exhale all the vertue from them, and leave only the Terreity or earthy part, which signifies nothing in Physical Use; Never∣theless after you have dryed them in the shade, it is necessary to expose them in a Sive or brown Paper to the Sun, to exhaust the Flegme, and make them thorow dry, left when you paper them up, they do in moist weather give again, and mould. Good Husbands and Huswives are now be-weeding the Corn, and the Garden, and Shearing their early fat sheep. The Season serves to set Rosemary and Gilly-flowers; take heed of cutting Trees, Hedges, or Herbs with a knife, but rather gather them with your Fingers; Now you may set Saffron, carry out Compost, make Hay, rid Gardens of Snails, Ants, and Pismires.</P>
<P>I promised you in the conclusion of my last monethly Exer∣cise a further accompt of the Recreation of Angling, and there∣fore if you be for the <HI>Bleak, Ruffe,</HI> or <HI>Perch,</HI> you must know, they are Fishes which bite neither high nor low, but (for the most part) in the midst of the water, therefore your Line must be very lightly plumb'd, and far from the Hook; the Baits which most entice them, besides the red Worm, are the House-fly in the Summer, and fat of Bacon in the VVinter; In <HI>April, May,</HI> or <HI>Iune,</HI> they will bite at the Bob-worm, or the Maggot, and in all other Seasons, they seldome refuse any VVorm or Canker; your Line would be small, and well armed from the
<PB N="29" REF="17"/>
Hook, a handful at least, with small wyre, for the teeth of the Perch will else gnaw it asunder.</P>
<P>For a Chevern, the best standing to take him is, concealed, behinde a Tree, or an Arch of a Bridge, or a VVall; their haunts are in clear waters, which run upon Sand or Gravel; and they are in best season from <HI>March</HI> till <HI>Michaelmass.</HI></P>
<P>Now for the season in which all Baits are most profitable, you shall understand that the red VVorm will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erve for small Fish all the year long, the Maggot is good in <HI>Iuly,</HI> the Bob and Dor in <HI>May,</HI> the brown Flies in <HI>Iune,</HI> Frogs in <HI>March,</HI> Grashop∣pers in <HI>September,</HI> Snails in <HI>August</HI> for the Roch, Bleak or Gudgeon they serve the Pikes at any season; all Pastes are good in <HI>May, Iune,</HI> or <HI>Iuly,</HI> dryed VVasps in <HI>May,</HI> Sheeps-blood and Cheese in <HI>April</HI>; for Bramble-berries, Corn, and Seeds, they are good at the Fall of the Leaf; Lastly, for your dead Flies, which are most proper for the Trouts, or Graveling, you shall know that the Dun-fly is good in <HI>March,</HI> the Stone-fly is good in <HI>April,</HI> the red Fly, and yellow Fly in <HI>May,</HI> the black Fly, the dark yellow Fly, and the moorish Fly in <HI>Iune,</HI> the wasp Fly and the shell Fly in <HI>Iuly,</HI> and the cloudy dark Fly in <HI>Au∣gust,</HI> and lastly, the tawny Fly part in <HI>May,</HI> and part in <HI>Iune</HI>: You must understand, that these Flies are as well Artificial as Natural; but to shew you that, will be the work of the next sheet.</P>

<P>IT is now <HI>Iuly,</HI> and the Worlds great eye, the Sun, is moun∣ted on the highest loft of the Horizon. The grasse of the Mountaines withers, and the parched earth would be glad of a draught of Raine to slake her thirst. Now doth the Farmer make ready his Teame, and the Carter with his whip hath no small pride in his whistle. The Cannons of Heaven begin to rattle, and when the fire is put to the Charge, it breaketh out among the Clouds, and the Stones of congealed water cut off the ears of the Corne. The Cuckoe spits and storms, and the blacknesse of the Clouds affright the faint-hearted. The Stag and the Buck are now in their Pride and their prime, and the hardnesse of their Heads makes them fit for the Horner. Now hath the Sparhawk the Partridge in the foot: And the Ferret is tickling the Coney in the Burrough. The Sparrows make a charme upon the green Bushes, till the Fowler comes and take them by douzens. The Lark leads her young out of the Nest, for the Sythe and the Sickle will downe with the Grasse and the Corne. The old Partridge calls her Covey in the Morning, and the Shepheard folds his flock in the Evening. The Hedges are full of Berries, the high wayes of Rogues, and the lazy Limbs sleep out their dinner. Malt is now above wheat with a number of mad people. Pears and Plumbs now ripen apace, and being of a crude watery substance are the cause of many diseases. The Butler now hath the better of the Cook, and a fine shirt is as comfortable as a freeze Jerkin. The Pipe and the Tabor now follow the Markets, and he that hath money gets many a good Penny-worth. The Ant and the Bee are at work for their Winter provision: and after a frost the Grassehopper is no more seen. Milk, Butter and Cheese are the labourers dyet; and a pot of good Beer quick∣ens his spirit. If there be no plague the people are healthfull, for continuance of motion is Natures preservative. The fresh of the morning, and the coole of the evening are the time the Court walks; but the poor dusty Traveller treads out the
<PB N="33" REF="19"/>
whole day. The Smelt is now in season, and the Lamprey out of the River leaps into the Pye. The Souldier now hath a hot March, and the Lawyer sweats in his lined Gowne. <HI>Don Pedro</HI> the Pedler hath a long walk; and the dram of the bottle sets his face on a fire. In a word, this is a profitable season, The Labourers gaine, and the rich mans wealth.</P>
<P>Now Courteous Country man, make Hay while the Sun shines, for a day slackt is many pounds loft, chiefly when the weather is unconstant; sheare all manner of field Sheep, and Summer-stir rich stiffe grounds, soyle all mixt earths, and latter soyle all loose hot sands. Let Hearbs you would preserve now run to seed. Cut off the stalks of outlandish Flowers, and cover the Roots with new earth, so well mixed with manure as may be. Sell all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch Lambs as you feed for the Butcher, and still lead forth sand, marle, Lime, and other manure, fence up your Copses, graze your elder underwoods, and bring home all your field Timber.</P>
<P>In this Month use cold Hearbs and coole dyet, and abstaine from physick by reason of the intemperate heat of the weather. The Rivers now are more wholsome and delightfull then the Baths. Let the Sun be up before ye walk abroad in the time of contagious diseases, as plagues or pestilence. Keep your cham∣ber windowes shut, and open then only when the Sun shines with vigour, be sure every morning to perfume your house well with Tarr and Angelica Seeds burnt in a fire-pan, or cha∣fing dish of coales, then which nothing is better. It is good to drink a draught of Beer in a morning fasting, wherein <HI>Card<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Benedict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> hath been boyled, or else when you walk out in the morning, eat the quantity of a hasle Nut of Venice Triacle and old con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erve of Roses equally mixt, it is as good an Antidote as you can take, bleed not but upon necessity, and have a care of over-heating your bloud, and meddle neither with <HI>Bacchus</HI> nor <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P>The Recreations and Country contentments more properly appertaining to this Month are Bathing and swimming in the coole and Christall Rivolets; or shooting at Buts, Pricks, or Rivers. And Bowling (however tearmed like Cards and Dice
<PB N="34" REF="20"/>
unlawfull) I am sure is an healthfull exercise and good for the body, and hath been prescribed for a recreation to great per∣sons by the Learned Physitians, in which there is a great deale of art and judgment to be seen especially in the expert Bowler in choosing out his ground, and preventing the many hanging, win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, and many turning advantages of the same, whether it be in open wide places, or in Allies, and in this sport the choosing of the Bowle is not the least of the cunning belongs to it; your fla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bowles being best for close Allies, your round byassed bowles for open grounds of advantage, and your round Bowles like a Ball for greene swarths that are plaine and levell. Others are Fishing in the Christall current for the fine speckled Trout, whose baits are this Month either the Grashopper or the humble Bee, dryed Wasps or dryed Hornets, or some of their young brood in the Combs, these are your baits proper to the Season, and I think a word of caution and Direction is not much out of season.</P>
<P>Having gotten your baits you must look that they be good sweet and fine, for else they are uselesse, and you might as well have been at home as by the Riverside; then you must not angle in unseasonable times, for the Fish being not enclined to bite, it is a strange enticement that can compell them. You must also be carefull neither by your apparell motion or too open standing to give affright to the fish; for when they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cared they fly from you, and leave you seeking society in an empty house. Then you must labour in clear and untroubled waters, for when the Brooks are any whit white or Muddy, or thick through inundations or other trouble, it is impossible to get any thing with the Angle. In the next place, you must be sure to have a respect to the temper of the weather, for extream wind, or extream cold taketh away all manner of appetite from Fish, so doth likewise too violent heat, or Raine th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is heavy, great and beating, or any storms, snowes, haile or blusterings, especially that which cometh from the east, which of all is the worst. Those which blow from the South are the best, and those which come from the North or from the West are indifferent. Many other observations there are, but remember these and it may be sufficient.</P>

<P>NOw do the Reapers try their Backs and their Arms, and the lufty Youths pitch the sheafs into the Cart, the Fur∣menty pot welcomes home the Harvest Cart, and the Garland of Flowers crowns the Captain of the Reapers; the Battel of the Field is now stoutly fought, and the proud Rye must stoop to the Sickle; the Sun is somwhat towards his Declination, yet such is his heat, as hardneth the soft Clay, dries up the standing Ponds, withereth the sappy Leaves, and scorcheth the skin of the Naked; now begin the Gleaners to follow the Corn-Cart, and a little Bread to a great deal of Drink makes the Travellers Dinner; the Melon and the Cucumber are now in their season, and Oyl and Vinegar dance attendance to the Sallad-herbs; the Ale-house is more frequented then the Tavern, and a gently gliding River is more comfortable then a fiery Furnace; the Bath is now much visited by diseased bodies, and in the fair Ri∣vers, swimming is a sweet exercise; the Bowe, and the Bowl pick many a purse, and the Cocks with their heels kick away many a mans wealth: <HI>Zephyrus</HI> now with his sweet breath cools and perfumes the parching beams of <HI>Titan,</HI> while the ripened Fruits dangling down the Boughs, shew the wealth and the beauty of the Earth; the Pipe and the Taber are now busily set a work, and the Lad and the Lass will have no lead on their heels; the new Wheat makes the Gossips Cake, and the Bride-Cup is carryed above the heads of the whole Parish; O 'tis the merry time wherein honest Neighbours make good cheer, and God is glorified in his blessings on the Earth.

<P>The cure and prevention of this inconvenience, is the well-husbanding and managing of the Harvest, first with a careful and well-judging eye to look upon your Corn, and to know by the hanging downward of the Ear, whether it be ripe or not; for when it is so, it will look as it were back again to the ground, then to look into the cleanness of the Corn, as whether it be full of greeness, as grass, weeds, and such like; or clean of it self, without any mixture; If you finde there be any weeds mixt with it, then you may reap it so much the sooner, though the kernel be not so well hardened as you could wish; but ha∣ving shorn it so full of weeds, by no means sheaf it, but spread∣ing it thin in the Sun, let the grass wither all the day, which when you perceive to change colour, and grow dry, then binde it up in sheafs, and let it lye single a day, that the Wind and Sun may get into it, and dry the greeness more sufficiently, then lay it in shocks of six or eight sheafs a piece, and in those shocks turn the Ears so inward, that the other bigger ends may defend them from rain, wet, or dew that may fall upon them; then a day or two after lay them in shocks of twenty, or four and twenty sheafs a piece, and in those shocks let them take a Sweat; then b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eak them open in a bright Sun-shine day, and let the Ayr pass thorow them to dry them, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thwith lead the Grain home, and either house or stack it, and (be sure) when thus ordered and dryed, it can never take hurt.</P>
<P>Now ye may make the second return of your fat Sheep and Cattel; Gather all your greater Summer fruits, Plumbs, Apples, and Pears, make your Perry and Cyder; set slips of all sorts of
<PB N="39" REF="22"/>
Gilly-flowers, and Siens of other Flowers, and transplant them that were set the Spring before; and at the end of this moneth, begin to winter-rig all fruitful soyls whatsoever; you may now also very seasonably geld your Lambs, carry Manure from your Dove-cots, and put your Swine to the early or first Mast.</P>
<P>They that would have good seeds for their Gardens next Year, must now gather of their own, lest in buying their expecta∣tion be frustrate, and so they lose their labour, and their layings out; and such as desire to have Lettice, or other Herbs for the Winter, they must sow their seeds in the Increase of the Moon.</P>
<P>In <HI>August</HI> moderate diet is good Physick, for now there is danger of surfets, and take heed of heats, and then colds, for it is the high way to a Pleurisie, and use not to sleep much, especially after Noons, for fear of oppilations, and stopping Flegme, and for the avoiding of Agues, Head-ach, and Catarhs; avoid Phy∣sick, unless necessity compells, and abstain from Wine, shun Feasts and Banquets, and only take delight in diet and drinks that are cool, and temperate.</P>
<P>I had a touch at your Recreations before, and that your Cock may not kick your Coyn out of your pocket, I shall give you some marks to choose a good one by; know then, that the best characters observable in a fighting Cock, are his shape, colour, courage, and sharp heel; for his shape, the middle size is ever accounted best, because they be ever most matchable strong, nimble, and ready for your pleasure in his battel; and so the exceeding little Cock is as hard to match, and is commonly weak, and tedious in his manner of fighting; He would be of a proud and upright shape, with a small head, like a Spar-Hawk, quick large eye, and a strong back crookt, and big at the setting on, and in colour sutable to the plume of his feathers, as black, yellow, or reddish; the beam of his leg would be very strong, and according to his plume, blew, gray, or yellow, his spurs long, rough, and sharp, and a little bending, and looking inward; for his colour, the gray pyle, the yellow pyle, or the red with the blanck breast, is esteemed the best, the pyde is not so good, and the white and dun are the worst; if he be red about the head like scarlet, it is a signe of lust, strength, and courage; but if he be pale it is a signe of sickness and faintness; for his Courage,
<PB N="40" REF="23"/>
you shall observe it in his walk, by his treading, and the pride of his going, and in his Pen by his oft Crowing; for the sharp∣ness of his heel, it is only seen in his fighting, for that Cock is said to be sharp or narrow heel'd, which every time he riseth, hitteth and draws blood of his adversary, gilding his spurs in blood, and threatning at every blow an end of the Battel. I wish you such a Cock. Farewell.</P>

<HEAD>SEPTEMBER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now <HI>September,</HI> and the glittering Charioteer of heaven is driving down the hill apace, and the beauty of the earth is generally decaying, seeming no longer a lively act of Nature, but a meer Landskip, which the teeth of time has more then half defaced; the sap of the Trees sinks down into the earth, and the wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hering leaves fall after it; the lofty Ash that but the other day lockt up his moisture in his arms, and vertical boughs, now hath got a Palsie, and lets his keys fall. In a word, the whispering woods are now fain to quit their leavie pretences, and come to the naked truth; the Meadows are left bare by the mouths of the hungry Cattel, and the Hogs (those four-footed Swains) are become the Plowers of the Corn-fields; the wind begins to bluster among the Apples, and knock their heads together on the Trees, and the wind-falls are gathered to fill the Pies for the Houshold, except the old Sow return by chance from her Field-labour, and eat them raw to qualifie the heat of her stomack; the Saylors fall to work to get afore the wind, and if they spy a storm it puts them to prayer; the Souldier now begins to shrug at the weather, and prays for the dissolution of the Camp, that he may get to his Landladies fire side in a Garrison. The Law∣yer now is hard at his Harvest, and with his Tongue and his Tar∣box reaps most of the gain of his poor Clients Sickle, while his labouring hands pay for his lying tongue; the Inns now begin to provide for guests, and the night-eaters in the Stable pinch the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oor Traveller in his bed, while the Ostler behinde the Ma∣sters back, cheats his Horse to his face. Paper, pen, and Inke, are much in request, and the Quarter Sessions take order with the Vagabonds, and Way-layers; Wood, and Coals make toward the Chimney, and Sack, and good Ale are in account with good Fellows; the Butchers now knock down the great Beeves, and the Poulterers feathers make towards the Upholsters; now <HI>Wal∣fleet</HI> Oysters are the wealth of the Fishwife, and Pippins fine are the Costermongers Merchandize; the Flayl and the Fan fall to work in the Barn, and the Market is full of Bakers: the Porkers now are driven to the Woods, and the home-fed Pigs make Pork for the Market. In brief, I thus conclude of it, I hold it the Winters forewarning, and the Summers farewel.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="24"/>In the moneth of <HI>September</HI> reap your Peas, Beans, and all o∣ther Pulse whatsoever, making a final end of your Harvest; now bestow upon your wheat land your principal manure, and now sowe your Wheat and your Rye born in rich, and in barren Cli∣mates; now put your Swine to mast of all hands, gather your Winter fruit; now for your Winter fruit, you shall know its ripeness, by observing his change of colour upon the Tree, but you must be sure to gather it in a fair, Sunny, and dry day, in the wain of the Moon, and no winde in the East, also after the Sun hath exhaled the dew, for the least wet or moisture will make them subject to rot and mildew, you must also have an apron to gather in, and to empty into the great basket, and a hook to draw the boughs unto you, which you cannot reach with your hands at ease, the apron is to be an ell every way, loopt up to your girdle, so as it may serve for either hand without any trou∣ble, and when it is full, unloose one of your loops, and empty it gently into the great basket; for in throwing them down roughly, their own stalks may prick them, and those that be once prickt will ever rot; again, you must gather your fruits clean without either leaves or brunts, because the one hurts the Tree, (for every brunt would be a stalk for fruit to grow upon) the o∣ther hurts the fruit by pricking and bruifing it as it is laid toge∣ther, and there is nothing sooner rotteth fruit, then the green and withered leaves lying among them; neither must you ga∣ther them without any stalk at all, for such fruit will begin to rot where the stalk stood.</P>
<P>Quinces should not be kept with other fruit, for the scent is offensive both to the other fruit, and to them that keep it, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come amongst it; therefore lay them by themselves in sweet straw, where they may have Ayr enough; they must be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ckt with Medlars, and gathered with Medlars.</P>
<P>Now as touching Windfalls, or such fruit as falleth from the Tree, and are not gathered, they must not be laid with the fruit that is gathered; and of fallings there are two sorts, one that falls through ripeness, and they are best, and may be kept to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke or roast; the other beaten down by the wind, and they must be spent as fruit (nor being ripe) else they will wither and come to nothing; and therefore it is not good by any means to beat down fruit with poles, or to carry them in Carts, loose or jog∣ging,
<PB N="44" REF="25"/>
or in half filled Sacks, where they may be bruised; and thus much for fruits. Now to other Concerns.</P>
<P>Farmer, make fale of your Wool, and other Summer Com∣modities, now put off those stocks of Bees you mean to part with; or such as you mean to take for your own use, close thatch, and dawb warm all the surviving Hives, and look that no Drone, Mouse, or other Vermine be in or about them: Now thatch your Stocks and Reeks, Thrash your Seed, Rye, and Wheat, and make an end with your Cart of all Forraigne journeys.</P>
<P>Lastly, In this moneth such as have need, may safely take Physick, or if occasion be, may bathe, and bleed, all such things are in their proper Nature and Vertue; and such Fruits as are ripe, and not corrupted, may safely be eaten by those that have good stomacks; It is now good time to make Conserve of Quinces and Barberries; Winter Herbs may now be sown; now likewise is the time to set your Artichoaks, Rose-trees, Apple-trees, Wardens, Strawberries, Violets, Gilly-flowers, sowe Parsnips, and in dry weather gather your Hops, and it is no bad Huswifry to make Verjuyce, and pluck Hemp. They say so many dayes old the Moon is on <HI>Michaelmass</HI> day, so many Floods after.</P>

<P>NOw followes the merry-goe-sorrow of the blythe, and bleak Month of <HI>October.</HI> The Coaches rattle through the Street, and the Ladyes Ride in their Boots, while the finicall City Geese goe on Patterns. Muffing and Cuffing are now in request, and he that will goe to Billinsgate fort may have a Cuff on the ear: It is now not amisse to play at Hot-coc∣kles hot, unlesse Coals be the cheaper. The little Tom-Tit-mouse makes his Cell in a hollow Tree; and the black-bird sets close in the bottome of a hedge for fear an ill wind should blow him no good. The forward Deere begin to goe to ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and the barren Doe is not out of season. The Basket-makers now gather their rods, and Fishermen lay their Nets in the deeps. The lofty winds are the Hogs Caterer, and the falling of the Aco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns is the rising of their flesh, and puts them quite out of mind of Pearle. The Load horses goe apace to the Mill: and the Corn is in the flower puddings, and Pancakes are meat for the Lads, and — Pyes are the delight of the Lasses. The Hare on the hill makes the Greyhound a faire course; and the loosing of labour is the saving of life. The Fox just unkenneld makes the Huntsmen laugh, and the Hounds cry. The scarcity of people makes a plenty of Wares, but a smooth and soft tongue vents many a hard bargaine. The Marriner now bestirreth his stumps while the Merchant liveth in feare of the weather. The Cooks are preparing the great feasts for the City; but the poor must not beg for fear of the Stocks. A good fire and a paire of Cards keep the guesse in the Ordinary; and the smoak of Tobacco is precious, and held soveraigne for Catatths, and troublesome Rheums. The Shuttle-cock and Battledore is a good house ex∣ercise, and occupies the Lady before she be drest. Tennis and Baloon are sports of some charge, and a quick bandy is the Court keeps Commodity. Dancing and Fencing are now in some use; and true Lovers lye close to keep off the cold.

<P><PB N="47" REF="27"/>In the Month of <HI>October</HI> finish all your wheat seed; and scower all your ditches and ponds: Plash, and lay your Hedges and Quicksets; plant, or transplant all manner of fruit Trees of what nature or quality soever. Make your Winter Cidar and Perry: You may spare your private pastures, and feed up your Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n fields, and Commons; and now make an end of winter-ridging; draw furrowes to draine and keep dry your new sown Corne. Reare all those Calves that you mean shall fall; and weane those Foales from your draught Mares which the Spring before were foaled. Now sell all such Sheep as you will not Winter; give over your Foaling, and separate the Lambs from the Ewes which you purpose to keep for your own stock, and follow hard the making of your Malt, not forgetting the Pro∣verb, that <HI>Soft Fire makes sweet Malt.</HI> Nor shall I here think it amisse, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you (I hope) tedious, if I insert a few directi∣ons to the young and unexperienced touching the drying and cleansing your Malt.</P>
<P>Dry it with a gentle and soft fire, ever and anon turning it (is it dryeth on the Kilne) over and over with your hand, till you find it sufficiently well dryed. Now as soon as you see the Corne begin to shed, you shall in the turning the Malt rub it well between your hands, and scowre it to make the Come fall away; then finding it all sufficiently dryed, first put out your Fire, then let the Malt dryed coole upon the Kilne for four or five hours at lest, then raising up the foure corners of the hair cloath, and gathering the Malt together on a heap, empty it with the Come, and all into your Garner, and there let it lye (if you have not occasion to use it) for a month, or two, or three to ripen, but no longer, for as the Come or dust of the Kilne for such a space melloweth and ripeneth the Malt, making it better both for sale, or expence, so to lye too long doth en∣gender weevell, wormes and Vermine which doe destroy the graine.</P>
<P>Now for the dressing and cleansing of Malt at such time as it is either to be spent in the house, or sold in the Market; you shall first winnow it with a good wind either from the Aire, or the Fanner, and before the winnowing you shall rub it exceed∣ing
<PB N="48" REF="28"/>
well between your hands to get the Come or sproutings cleane away; for the beauty and goodnesse of Malt is when it is smug, cleane, bright, and likest to Barley in the view, for then there is least wast and greatest profit, for Come, and dust drinketh up the liquor, and gives an ill tast to the drink. After it is well rub'd and winnowed, you shall then Ree it over in a fine sieve, and if any of the Malt be uncleansed, then rub it a∣gaine into the sieve till it be pure, and the rubbings will rise on the top of the sieve, which you may cast off at pleasure, and both those rubbings from the sieve, and the chaffe, and dust which cometh from the winnowing should be safe kept, for they are very good swines meat and feed, well mixt with whey or swillings; and thus after the Malt is well Ree'd, you shall ei∣ther sack it up for especiall use, or put it into a well cleansed Garner, where it may lye till there be occasion for expense; and thus much I think sufficient to speak of Malt.</P>
<P>Now to your health. As for what concerns your health, take my counsell, refuse not any needfull physick if you be advised thereunto by your skilfull Physitian. If occasion serve use warme baths; get good hot meat and drink, and good and wholsome wines to nourish good blood. Keep your feet dry, and warme, and beware of taking cold, for quartane Agues are gotten this Month, and gotten rid of God knows when. Use all moderate Recreations, for any thing is good which by stir∣ring and warming the bloud reviveth the spirits.</P>

Herrings and Sack make a war in a weak stomack, while the poor man's pinch∣ing Fast is to be preferred to a gluttonous Surfet; Dishes and Trenchers are necessary servants, and they that have no meat may go scrape; a Spit and a Dripping pan would do well, if well furnish'd; and a lock to the Cupboord door keeps a bit for a need; now begins the Goshawk to weed the wood of the Phe∣sant, and the Mallard loves not to hear the Bells of the Faulcon; the wind now is cold, and the Ayr chill, and the poor perish because mens charity is colder then both; alas, she is now grown so barren, she hath no children; and so marble-hearted, she knows none but her self; she was alwayes said to begin at home, but now she will not look out of doors; Butter and Cheese begin to raise their price, for the Higlers forestall the Market; now the Chandler knows how to make the best of his Merchan∣dize, and Kitchin-stuff is a commodity that every one is not ac∣quainted with; In sum, with the conceit of the raw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd rustick constitution of it, I take this moneth of <HI>November</HI> to be the discomfort of Nature and the tryal of patience.</P>
<P>In this month you may sowe either Wheat or Rye in exceed∣ing
<PB N="52" REF="30"/>
hot Soyls, afterward you may remove all sorts of Fruit-trees, and plant great trees either for shelter, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>haddow; now cut down all sorts of Timber Trees for Ploughs, Carts, Axel-Trees Naves, Harrows, and other Husbandry Offices; make now the last return of your grass-fed Cattel; bring your Swine from the Mast, and feed them for slaughter; Rear what Calves soever fall, and break up all such Hemp and Flax as you intend to spin in the Winter season, concerning which Hemp or Flax, I shall a little in this place, because it comes in my way, give the good Wife a word or two of direction, and first for Hemp.</P>
<P>If you intend to have an excellent piece of Hempen Cloth, which shall equal a piece of very pure Linnen, then after you have beaten your Hemp excellently well, and Heckled it once over, you shall then rowl it up again, dry it as before, and beat it again as much as at the first, then Heckle it through a fine slaxen Heckle (and the Towe which falls from the Heckle, will make a principal Hemping) but the Leaf it self a cloth as pure as fine Huswifes linnen, the endurance and lasting whereof is rare and wonderful. But,</P>
<P>Now concerning Flax a word also; Flax, after it hath been twice swingled, needeth neither more drying or beating, as Hemp doth, but may be brought to the Heckle in the same man∣ner as you did Hemp, only the Heckle must be much finer and straiter, and (as you did before) the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst Heckle being much courser then the latter, holding the strike stisse in your hand, break it very well upon that Heckle, then the Hurds that come off you shall save to make fine Hurden cloth of, and the strike it self you shall pass thorow a finer Heckle, and the Hurds which come from thence, you shall save to make fine middle cloth of, and the tear it self for the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t linnen.</P>
<P>To dress Flax for the finest use that may be, as to make fair Holland cloth of great price, or thread for the most curious use, you shall take your Flax after it hath been handled as is before shewed, and laying three strikes together, plat them in a plat of three, so hard and close as is possible, joyning one to the end of another, till you have platted so much as you think convenient, and then begin another plat, and thus plat so much as you think will make a rowl like unto one of your Hemp-rowls, and then wreathing them hard together, make up the rowl, and so many rowls more or less, according to the purpose you dress them for;
<PB N="53" REF="30"/>
this done, put the rowls into a Hemp-trough, and beat them soundly, rather more then your Hemp, and then open and un∣plat it, and divide every strike from other very carefully; then heckle it through a finer Heckle then any formerly used, for of heckles there be ever three sorts, and this must be the finest, and in this Heckling you must be exceeding careful to do it gently, and deliberately, lest what you heckle from it should run to knots, as it is apt to do, but being done artificially, as it ought, you shall have it look and feel like fine Cotton, or Jersey wool, and this which thus looketh and feeleth, and falleth from the Heckle, will notwithstanding make a pure fine Linnen, and run at least two yards and half in the pound; But the Tear it self will make a perfect strong, and most fine Holland, and run at least five yards in the pound.</P>
<P>After your Tear is thus drest, you shall spin it either upon Rock or Wheel, but the Wheel is the swifter way, and the Rock maketh the finest thread; you shall draw your thread according to the tear, and as long as it is even, it cannot be too small, but if it be uneven, it will never make a durable cloth; now for as much as every Huswife is not able to spin in her own house, you shall make choice of the best Spinners you can hear of, and to them put forth your Tear, weighing it before it go, and weighing it again after it is spun, and dry, allowing weight for weight, or an ounce and half for waste at the most; as for the prices for spinning, they are according to the Natures of the Countrey, the fineness of the Tear, and the dearness of provision; some spin∣ning by the pound, some by the lay, and some by the day, as the bargain shall be made.</P>
<P>For your health, eat good, wholsome, and strong meats, very well spiced and drest, and free from rawness, and use meat nou∣rishing the blood, and drink sweet and insophisticate Wines, and for digestion, ever before apples, or cheese, or such trumperies, prefer good and moderate exercise, keep your body from head to foot warm and dry, lest Tooth-ach and Rheum make ye wish ye had; beware of Hot-houses this moneth, lest the pores of your body set open by violent heat, as violent and piercing colds make their entry, not easily to be driven or complemented out of their new possessions; and let me here advise what Physick you mean to take, to finish now till the next <HI>March</HI> or <HI>April,</HI> unless urgent occasion. If the 10. day be cloudy, it denunciates a wet; if dry, a sharp winter.</P>

<HEAD>DECEMBER.</HEAD>
<P>NOw doth the Lawyer make an end of his Harvest, and the clyent of his money, and he that walks the streets shall find dirt on his shooes, except he walk all in boots. Now Ca∣pons and Hens, besides Turkyes, Geese and Ducks, with Bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton, must all dye as a memoriall and a sacrifice to the Feast of the sacred, the great and the sole sacrifice; for in 12 dayes a multitude of people will not be fed with a little. The Asse that hath borne all the yeare must now take a little Rest. The Oxe and the Cow, and the Horse and the Mare shall have their christmasse provant. Now Plumbes and Spice, Sugar and Honey, square it among Pies and broath; and Gossip I drink to you, and how doe you, and you are heartily welcome, I pray be merry, and I thank you. Now are the Taylors and the Tyre∣makers full of work against the Hollidayes, and a journey man cares not a rush for his Master, though he beg his Plum-pottage all the 12 dayes. Now or never must the Musick be in tune, for the youth must dance and sing to get them a heat, while the aged set by the fire; Nature hath made it a Law, and reason finds no contradiction. The fat Oxe must dye, and the leane one live till he be more worthy the slaughter. The Footman now shall have many a fowle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tep; and the Ostler have work enough about the heels of the horses, while the talkative Tap∣stet (if he looks not to his hits) will lye drunk in the Cellar. The Country maid leaves half her Market, and must be sent a∣gaine, if she forgets a pair of cards on christmasse Even. Great is the contention of Holly and Ivy, whether Master or Dame weares the breeches. The price of meat riseth apace, and the Aparrell of the proud makes the Taylors rich, and as proud as themselves. Dice and the cards benefit the Butler; and if the cook doe not lack wit he will sweetly lick his fingers. Now Starchers and Laundresses have their hands full of work, and and periwigs; and paintings will not be a little set by; strange Stuffs will be well sold, strange tales well told, strange sights much sought, strange things much bought, and what else as falls
<PB N="49" REF="32"/>
out. To conclude, I hold it the costly purveyer of excesse, and the after-breeder of necessity; the practise of folly, and the purgatory of Reason.</P>
<P>In the month of <HI>December</HI> put your Sheep and Swine to the Pease reeks, and fat them for slaughter, or the Market. Now kill your small Porks, and large Bacon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, lop hedges and trees, saw out your timber for building, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd lay it to season; and if your Land be exceeding stiffe, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd rise up in an extraordinary furrow, then in this Month begin to plow up that ground whereon you meane to sow cleane Beane only. Now cover your dainty fruit-trees over with Canvase; and hide all your best flowers with rotten horse-litter from the impetuous tyranny of frosts and stormes. Now draine all your Corn-fields, and as oc∣casion shall present it self, so water and keep moyst your Mea∣dows for the utility of the soyle.</P>
<P>Now fish for the Carp, the Breame, Pike, Tench, Barbell, Peale, and Salmon; omitting the rest I shall give you a word of direction for angling for the Pike, the Barbell, the Breame, the Salmon. The Pike is a fish of great weight, in so much that you can hardly have a line of haire to hold him; therefore your best anglers use most commonly a chaulk line, your angle rod also must have no small top, but be all of one peece and bigness, and the Line made exceeding fast from slipping, your hoose would be of the strongest wire, white or yellow, and made dou∣ble, the poynts turning two contrary wayes, and then armed with strong wyer, a foot at least; his best bait is a little small Roch, Dace or Minim, the hook being put in at the Taile, and coming out at the Gills, and you must seldome or never let your b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it lye still in the water, but draw it up and downe, as though the fish did move in the water, and fled from the Pike, for this will make him more eager and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty to bite; and hav∣ing bit, you must be sure to tire him well before you venture to take him up. The yellow live Frog is also an excellent bait for the Pike, for you must understand they naturally delight not in any dead, or unmoving food.</P>
<P>There is also another way, which is to snickle a Pike, the manner thus, first find the Pike where she lyeth, (which about
<PB N="58" REF="33"/>
Noon you may easily doe) then take your chaulk-Line with a noose of small wyer at the end of it, put it gently into the water about two feet before the nose of the Pike, then when you feele it touch the ground, cause one to goe behind the Pike, and with a pole to stir him; then as he shooteth meet him with your noose and with a sudden and quick Jerk throw him upon the Land; in this sport you must be very nimble, ready, and quick-fighted, for if you give him the lest time he will escape you.</P>
<P>The Barbell or Graveling, which some call the Ember, is a very subtle and crafty f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh, you must therefore be carefull that your baits be sweet and new, and when you angle for them, doe in all things as you use for the Trout, for they bite aloft in the Summer, and at the bottome in the Winter; your line must be extraordinary strong, and your hooks of a three-penny compasse, for they are Fishes of very weighty bodies, and being struck must have liberty to play and tire themselves, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> else they will endanger the breaking of your rod, and therefore your line must be the longest size. The best season to angle for the Bream is from the latter end of <HI>February</HI> till <HI>September.</HI> He is a very lusty strong Fish also, and therefore your tools must be able, and good; the baits in which he most delighteth are the butter-flies, green-flyes, wormes of all sorts, past of bread-crumbs, or the brood of wasps.</P>
<P>Now Lastly, touching the angling for the Salmon, albeit he is a fish which in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth is unfit for your travell, but because he is too hege and cumbersome; as also in that he naturally delight∣eth to lye in the bottome of great deep Rivers, and as near as may be in the middle of the channel; yet forasmuch as many men esteeme that best which is got with most difficulty, and trouble: you shall understand that the baits in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e most delighteth are those that serve for the Trou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as paste or flyes in the Summer, and red wormes, Bobwormes or Cankers on the Water docks after Michaelmasse; and thus much for Fishing at this time.</P>
<P>You may also now seasonably become a Fowler, for all fowls whatsoever with Peece, Nets, or any manner of Engins, for in
<PB N="59" REF="33"/>
this Month no Fowle is out of season, and I presume a water∣spanniel is now better to keep, then to hang. Christmasse is come and the Wild Swan, the Teals, and the Mallard are meat for the Landlords mouth, and the Tenants too if he can get them.</P>
<P>For your health, keep your bodies warme, let your meat be hot of quality, abstaine from physick, and let your Kitchin be your Apotheca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies Shop, warme cloathing your Nurse, merry company your Keeper, and good hospitallity your exercise, so God send you a merry Christmasse.</P>
