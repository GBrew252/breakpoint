<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>2 Pet. 3. 3.</BIBL>
<Q>There shall come in the last daies scoffers, walk∣ing
after their own lusts, and saying, where
is the promise of his coming? For since the
Fathers fell asleep, all things continue as
they were from the beginning of the Crea∣tion.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE great business of Religion, is to ob∣lige
its Votaries to present duty by the awe
and expectation of future retribution: and
the particular design of the Gospel, the
Doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ, is to oblige
to this, by the assurance and belief that he who
came unto us heretofore to teach his Law, will
come again to execute the sanctions of it. Behold
saies St. <HI>John,</HI> Rev. 1. 7. <HI>He cometh with clouds,
and every eie shall see him, and they also which pierced
him.</HI> And he saies of himself, <HI>Behold I come quickly,
and my reward is with me, to give every man accord∣ing
as his work shall be.</HI> Rev. 22. 12.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<HI>Which weighty truth, tho abundantly establisht,
by all the miracles the types and prophecies that
attend the Gospel, is most particularly enforc'd
by the two inimitable expresses of Divinity, our
Saviors Resurrection from the dead, and his As∣cension
into Heaven. Concerning the former of
which St.</HI> Paul <HI>remonstrates, Acts</HI> 17. 30. The
times of ignorance God winked at, but now command∣eth
all men every where to repent: because he hath ap∣pointed
a day in which he will judg the world in
righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordain'd:
whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that
he hath rais'd him from the dead. <HI>The other is ex∣prest
by St.</HI> Peter, <HI>Act.</HI> 2. 19. Repent and be con∣verted
that your sins may be blotted out, when the times
of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.
And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was
preached unto you, whom the Heaven must receive
until the times of restitution of all things, which God
hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets, since
the world began.</P>
<P>Indeed this second advent is the foundation,
the support and end of our Religion. <HI>If in this
life only we had hope, we were of all men most mi∣serable,</HI>
1 Cor. 15. 19. If to the other Articles of
our Creed which concern our Savior, there had
not succeded the belief, that he shall come again
to judg both the quick and the dead, we were
as ridiculous as these mockers of the Text pre∣tend
us, hated and scorn'd by men, and deserted
by Almighty God.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="3"/>
It will therefore import us highly to examine
whether the Christian be so absurd a person as these
drols and merry men would make him, a creature
only useful, because he finds them sport and enter∣tainment.</P>
<P>And for a just survey hereof, twill be material to
consider,</P>
<P>First the personal qualifications of the Dispu∣ters
here describ'd, and</P>
<P>Secondly the force of their arguments and dis∣coursings:
according to those two prevailing To∣pics
in use among us, from the head of Autority, and
that of Reason. And this being well deduc'd, twill
not be hard to bring the whole debate to a short and
certain issue, both in regard of speculation, and what
is more important in reference to practice.</P>
<P>I begin to consider what I first propos'd, the
personal qualifications of the Disputers here de∣scrib'd.
They are said to be scoffers walking after
their own lusts.</P>
<P>To be a Scoffer is sure no very laudable Chara∣cter,
being the joint result of Pride and Malice,
the doing mischief, and the doing it in sport. So
that whereas tis said that the Flatterer is the worst
of tame beasts, and the Detractor of wild, the
Scoffer has the ferity of both. Amidst the preten∣ces
to Urbanity, and being plesant company, he
is the bane of all society, <HI>the poison of Asps is under
his lips, his teeth are spears and arrowes, and his
tongue a sharp sword,</HI> Psal. 5. 7. Any injury is sup∣portable,
that has not contemt and scorn super∣added
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
to it; we can better bear the wounds, then
the insultings of an enemy; or if we must submit
to that, we would not have our understandings
trampled on; be run down like fools and Idiots,
or fall the victims of petulant ill nature, edg'd with
envenom'd wit.</P>
<P>But as this temper is most injurious and unso∣ciable;
tis also ignorant and indocile. The sure
effect of knowledg, is an humble sense of the want
of it: the deeper we immerse our selves in any
Art or Science, the greater and more insuperable
difficulties are started by us: and the same event
happens to all industrious enquirers, which befel
<HI>Socrates;</HI> to arrive at last to this one great dis∣covery,
that they know nothing. Tis the pecu∣liar
priviledg of the ignorant and half-wited, by
thinking well of their own skill and acquisitions,
to make it impossible for them to have any. <HI>Seest
thou a man wise in his own eies,</HI> saies <HI>Solomon, there
is more hope of a fool then of him,</HI> Prov. 26. 12. and
at the 9. Chap. ver. 7, 8. <HI>He that reproveth a scorner
getteth himself a shame, and he that rebuketh a wick∣ed
man getteth himself a blot: rebuke not a scorner
least he hate thee: rebuke a wise man and he will
love thee.</HI> and Chap. 14. ver. 6. <HI>A scorner seeketh
wisdom, and findeth it not.</HI></P>
<P>But farther, over and above the before-men∣tion'd
ingredients, of pride, ill nature, and incor∣rigible
folly; the mockers of the Text are branded
with immorality and vice: to <HI>walk after their own
lusts.</HI> And sure there cannot be a more prodi∣gious
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
impudence, then that the guilty and obno∣xious,
persons liable to the severest punishments
as well as censures, should dare to awaken obser∣vation,
by being sharp on others. But so it is, the
man that walks in the <HI>counsel of the ungodly, and has
stood in the way of sinners,</HI> will not fail to recreate
himself by sitting down in the seat of the scornful.
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">ad Nicom. Eth. lib. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Aristotle</HI> truly resolv'd that the sensual or passio∣nate
were incapable of receiving moral knowledg,
and tis hard that they who are not in a possibility to
be learners, should take upon them to be judges.</P>
<P>But in the present case tis their great concern
and interest not to be instructed. To convince the
sensual man that there is a future doom, is to sour
all his joies, and torment him before the time.
So that to pass all other grounds of prejudice,
whatever is suggested by these mockers of the Text,
their testimony at least is not to be consider'd, they
being brib'd and led aside by interest to all that
they assert.</P>
<P>And let this suffice to have bin said of the per∣sonal
qualifications of the disputers against a future
judgment. I come now to examin the force of
their discoursings.</P>
<P>Where first, tis obvious to advert, that the En∣quiry,
<HI>Where is the promise of his coming,</HI> is very ex∣travagantly
made.</P>
<P>As the Apostle saies, that <HI>hope which is seen is
not hope,</HI> Rom. 8. 24. so a promise perform'd is not
a promise, all its obligation is ceast. But tho our
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
pacts and undertakings fall not under the notice
of our senses, it do's not therefore follow they are
nothing. Upon this transient blast of emty air,
hangs all the entercourse and traffic of the world.
If we will trust altogether to our eies, and nothing
to promises and words, we must expect the self
same diffidence from others; and so be enemies and
out-lawes to mankind.</P>
<P>Nor is the delaying of performance a prejudice
against it. Tis true the morrow is to us a distant
thing, however suddenly expected: and there∣fore
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Epig. lib. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Martial</HI> did not amiss to enquire of one who
still undertook for the next day, where his to mor∣row
dwelt, whether in <HI>Parthia</HI> or <HI>Armenia?</HI> But
with Almighty God, every thing however distant
it may seem, is actually present: and as whatever
really is, however contingently it happen'd, cer∣tainly
and necessarily is; so whatever he has pro∣mis'd,
must certainly and necessarily be: nay should
be reckon'd on as already don.</P>
<P>But the discoursings of the mockers in the Text,
if they amount to any thing will run thus. All
things continue as they were since the beginning
of the Creation, therefore our Saviors promise of
coming to judge the world is vain and frustane∣ous.
The weakness of which reasoning, the A∣postle
effectually laies open, by destroying every
part of it. First he denies the proposition, or sup∣posal
that all things continue as they were since
the Creation: and Secondly he denies the conse∣quence
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
drawn from thence, Tho all things did con∣tinue,
it no way follows they shall for ever do
so; and that the promise of a future change will
not hereafter be accomplisht.</P>
<P>As to the Proposition, it is observable, that
the Creation of the world is frankly here acknow∣ledg'd,
tho it be to the evident disadvantage of
the design'd Hypothesis. If the world were once
Created, in that Act however transient, it has
shew'd its self liable to the greatest change, since
there are the same steps from not being unto be∣ing,
as there are back again the contrary way:
with this variety, that it is easier to pass from a
habit to its privation, then it was from the pri∣vation
to advance into the habit: and therefore
as the Universe did not exist heretofore, so it may
likewise not exist hereafter.</P>
<P>But the truth is, the Origen of the World is
a matter so notorious, that even <HI>Epicurus</HI> and his
followers could not over-look it; and thought it
a less absurdity to make a casual concurse of A∣tomes,
produce all the powers, the motion, the
beauty, and order of the World, then to imagin
it to have no beginning. And to this they were
induced not only by attending the chain of causes,
which in a succession of finite beings, could not
be infinite: but more particularly, from the ob∣servation
of those evident marks of newness, which
appear every where thro-out the world; and which
are substantially urg'd by the Epicurean Apostle
<HI>Lucretius</HI> in his 5 Book. I mean, the growth of
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
Arts and Sciences, the plantation of Countries,
the date of Histories, the Analogy of Languages,
and the like.</P>
<P>But to pass forward. Whereas tis urg'd by our
Disputers, that since the Fathers fell asleep, all
things continue as they did since the Creation, tis
obvious to reply, that all things do not continue
as they were, because the Fathers are fallen asleep:
the destruction of all preceding generations, be∣ing
a very remarkable mutation in the Universe.
For however by constant successions the world has
bin supplied, yet since tis evident that all the parts
are in perpetual flux and motion, the whole which
is nothing but an aggregate of those parts, must
needs be of the same complexion. So that upon
the matter the argument comes to this. All things
continue as they were since the Creation, because
nothing continues as it was since the Creation.</P>
<P>Tis true the World has lasted a long time, but
so have divers other things, which many ages since
have perisht, as also others which we see are pe∣rishing.
Let us consider artificial compositions,
for instance Buildings; whereof the parts constant∣ly
decay and moulder: and tho by diligent repairs,
the fabric is maintain'd so as to be habitable for
several Ages, yet at last in spight of all supplies,
it sinks into a ruine. And thus it fares in that
other fabric of our Bodies, which we know are
liable to a thousand accidents, every one of which
is able to destroy us: and tho by the supply of
food, and careful tendance we are not only main∣tain'd
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
in life, but seem to grow and to be nurisht;
yet after a set period of years the whole drops
down, and by no art or care can be preserv'd. So
likewise in Societies, that Aggregate of separate
members allied together by civil bonds of union,
which we call the body Politic; these we see pre∣serve
the same establishment, and setled form of
government for several Centuries of years, and
notwithstanding many shocks and great mutati∣ons,
recover their pristin constitution: yet tis ob∣serv'd
that there awaits even them a fatal period,
and that after<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ptolem. Campanel.</NOTE> 6 or 700, or at most 1000 years they
are totally dissolv'd and overthrown.</P>
<P>From the which instances tis easy to collect,
that in Systems of all kinds, whether artificial, na∣tural,
or political, every thing is transient and
engag'd to dissolution. And tho the Universe in
proportion to its vaster bulk, have a much larger
term assign'd to its duration, then is prefixt to tri∣vial
little beings, all equally must share in the same
common law of fate, and at length perish by in∣evitable
ruine.</P>
<P>The age of Man is by <HI>David</HI> Ps. 90. declar'd to be
threescore years and 10, that of Nations and Go∣vernments
is esteem'd as 100 unto 10, so that 6 or
700 years makes up their ordinary period. Now
whether the Universe go on by like progression, and
in accordance to the celebrated tradition, its rate be
as 1000 is to 10, and after a Millenary week (and we
know that the Apostle saies 1000 years is with God
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
Almighty but as one day,) the everlasting Sabbath
shall commence, and<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Thalmud. Abod. Zara. c. 1. fol 9. R. Ketina. in Ps. 92. Hilar. in 17 Mat. Just. Mart. in Dial. cum Tryph. &amp; quaest. ad Orthod. 71. Iren. l. 5. c. 28. 30. Cypr. l. de exhort. Mart. Lactant. l. 7. c. 14.</NOTE> 2000 years having past be∣fore
the Law, 2000 under it, and 2000 in the Gos∣pel,
the seventh thousand shall bring on the period
of all accounts, when time shall be no more; I will
not go about to calculate. As God has conceled
from us the day of our death, and that of the destru∣ction
of Empires, so has he of the Universe. In the
mean time tis sure more reasonable from the pre∣mises
laid down, to inferr the future destruction
of the world and future doom, then the denial of
it; especially since in consequence to what has
bin surmis'd, the times wherein the Gospel was first
preacht, are distinctively said to be the <HI>last times,</HI>
Act. 2. 17. and they who then liv'd, to be those
upon whom, <HI>the ends of the world are come.</HI> To
which we may subjoin, that our Savior has inter∣pos'd
his promise, that the regular date shall not be
permitted to run out, and <HI>for the Elects sake those
daies shall be shortned.</HI> Luk. 24. 22.</P>
<P>But for a farther confutation of these Disputers,
the Apostle by a memorable instance, that of the
Flood, an event confest by the whole heathen
world, the notice of it being transmitted down by
general<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Abyden. Beros. Nic. Da∣masc. Plat. in Tim. Suidas in <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ex Apollin.</NOTE> tradition, by Histories of all Nations, and
by the Rites and Ceremonies of their Religions,
makes it manifest that all things have not, as they
suggest, continued as they were from the begin∣ning
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
of the Creation. <HI>This,</HI> saies the Apostle ver. 5.
<HI>they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of
God the Heavens were of Old, and the Earth standing
out of the water, and in the water, whereby the world
that then was, being overflowed with water perisht.
But the Heavens and the Earth which are now, by the
same word are kept in store, reserv'd unto fire, against
the day of Judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</HI>
That is, men (unless wilfully blind) must acknow∣ledg
the Creation to be an unaccountable riddle of
Omnipotence: the habitable Earth being so pla∣ced,
that it indeed stands out of the waters, but yet
so as to be really within the waters, the surface
of the liquid Element being convexe, and in its
workings demonstrably above the level of the
shores that bound it: and nothing but the word
of God that said unto the waves, <HI>Thus far shall
you go and no farther,</HI> during the first Ages of the
world with-held that general inundation, which
afterward succeeded; when, as the Scripture ex∣presses
it, <HI>the fountains of the great deep were broken
up, and the windowes of Heaven,</HI> till then shut up,
<HI>were open'd,</HI> Gen. 7. 11. whereupon immediatly
the <HI>waters prevail'd upon the Earth.</HI> And on the
other side, the force of the Promise of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me
God of truth, set down at the 21 verse of the 8
Chapter, is the only dam and fence which ever
since secures from a repeted ruine. Therefore the
Heaven and Earth subsist, because they are reserv'd
against the general conflagration. Which (by the
way) was the common expectation of the Hea∣then
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>
World, according to that known perswasion
of<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Plat. in Tim. Senec. Nat. quaest. 3. 13. Ep. ad Polyb. Minut. Fel. Ovid. Metam. l. 1. f. 7. Lucan. l. 1. Hystasp. in Euseb. Praep. Justin in Apol.</NOTE> <HI>Platonics, Stoics,</HI> and <HI>Epicureans</HI> also; and
celebrated frequently by the Doctors of Heathen
Theology the Poets. In the same manner we see
Prisons made strong, and safely guarded, that the
Malefactors may be forth coming at the Assize and
goal delivery. And therefore upon a true account,
the preservation of the world, is so far from be∣ing
an argument against a future Judgment, that
in reference to it, its fabric is kept up, and hi∣therto
continued.</P>
<P>In like manner also, whereas ill men please them∣selves
much in their impunity; and because they
have liv'd long without controul, think they shall
for ever do so; they have all reason to consider,
that this success is of ominous abode unto them:
their condition is the same with that of the guilty
prisoner, who is therefore fed upon the public
charge and carefully secur'd, because he is reserv'd
to be brought forth to Execution: when in the
interim the honest man is left at large, without that
care, or any notice taken of him.</P>
<P>Tis true indeed God has besides another more
kind intendment, when he indulges this impunity,
if wicked men would be receptive of it: they there∣fore
are repriev'd, that they may have an oppor∣tunity
to sue their pardon out, and reconcile them∣selves
to their offended Judg: for so it followes in
the context, ver. 9. <HI>The Lord is not slack concern∣ing
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>
his promise (as some men account slackness) but is
long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should
perish, but that all should come to repentance.</HI></P>
<P>And this consideration is of an astonishing im∣portance,
that the best argument men can frame
against the existence of Almighty God, and his
future Judgment, is that he is infinitly good, and
that he passes over those indignities, which in the
opinion of the guilty Authors are beyond all suf∣ferance.
They would not have him be a revenger
of their foul demerits; no more would he himself:
he would be a God to bless, to save and pardon, but
not to punish and destroy; and therefore, wretch∣ed
as they are, they would not have him be at all:
and madly throw away their hopes, when they
would rid themselves of fear. To such a miserable
issue do's brutish guilt engage; makes it the in∣terest
of men that there should be no Omnipo∣tence
to support the world, or Providence to guide
it; no power in Heaven to bless and to protect;
and what is yet more desperate, no mercy there
to pardon and forgive.</P>
<P>But farther, suppose no promise had bin made
of a future coming to Judgment, it will by no
means follow that there will be none; or that such
a dreadful, tho but contingent possibility, should
reasonably be laught at and contemn'd. Many
things are daily don by us which we never engag'd
before hand that we would do; and sure tis equal,
that the most free agent should be allowed the self
same liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="9"/>
But lastly, to make the most advantagious sup∣posal
for these Disputers of the Text, that God had
said, nay sworn that he would not come to Judg∣ment;
with what face can they, who frequently do
what they have bound themselves by horrid execra∣tions
never to attemt, expect a greater veracity
from others then they exercise themselves? Moreo∣ver
since in all things else they disbelieve Almighty
God, why should they credit him in this? or if
they will let him be veracious in this one instance,
how are they sure he meant in earnest what he
spoke, and did not rally, as they love to do? Tis
certain the time will come, when he will transcribe
their practice, and in their fatal exigence, <HI>laugh at
their calamity, and mock when their fear comes:</HI> nor
can they easily be sure, that he has not begun to
treat them in their own way already.</P>
<P>Now all this being put together, can any thing
be more unaccountable, then that men should by
such ropes of sand let themselves down to Hell;
by such pitiful inconsequences, which yet are the
best proofs the matter can afford, think they have
baffled all the expectations and fears, nay all the
possibilities; for nothing else can give security of
future Judgment?</P>
<P>Yet so it is, these stupid Arguers have voted
themselves to be the Masters of Reason, and so they
are resolv'd to be. A dull inconsequence, pointed
with a blasphemous scoffe, in despight of Logic and
common sense, is Wit and demonstration to boot:
and all they that own an awe of God, a love of
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>
Vertue, and fear of Hell, are fools and mad men,
and tis lost labor to dispute against it. These Do∣ctors
of the scorners Chair, are (if it may be) more
infallible then that of Rome.</P>
<P>I shall not therefore any farther attemt to un∣deceive
them: but having thus unravel'd the dis∣putings
of the Text in point of consequence and
argument, I shall now take leave to look upon them
in another light; as they are a recital of a Prophe∣cy,
and thereby offer to us a farther proof of all
that they propose: To wit</P>
<P>The appearance of these scoffers in the World
who laugh at all Religion, and despise a future
Judgment, when so ere it happens, is its self a very
signal mark of its approch.</P>
<P>I stir up, <HI>saies St.</HI> Peter, <HI>at the beginning of this
Chapter, and the words immediately preceding the
Text,</HI> your pure minds by way of remembrance: that
ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken be∣fore
by the holy Prophets, and of the commandment
of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior: knowing
this first, that there shall come in the last daies scoffers,
<HI>&amp;c. To which St.</HI> Jude <HI>exactly accords at the</HI> 17
<HI>and 18 verses of his Epistle,</HI> Beloved remember ye the
words which were spoken before of the Apostles of our
Lord Jesus Christ, how that they told you there should
be mockers in the last time, who should walk after
their own ungodly lusts. <HI>And St.</HI> Paul 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5. 1.
Of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need
that I write unto you, for you your selves know perfect∣ly,
that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>
night: for when they shall say peace and safety, then
sudden destruction cometh, <HI>&amp;c. All which is in the
same manner declar'd by our Savior himself, Mat.</HI>
24. 37. <HI>who saies that his coming will resemble that
of the Flood, which fell upon a generation of men
as</HI> they were eating and drinking, marrying and gi∣ving
in marriage, <HI>and despis'd the warning and
predictions of</HI> Noah <HI>the</HI> Preacher of righteousness,
<HI>as St</HI> Peter <HI>calls him in the fore-going Chapter to
the Text.</HI></P>
<P>Nor may it be suggested, that the scoffing at Re∣ligion
and a future Judgment, is no such new thing
in the world as to be any way remarkable, and
made the Character of the greatest revolution that
ever was. For tho there have bin alwaies debaucht
and profligate persons more then a good many;
yet to have them openly scoffe at Religion, do it
with assurance and impunity, is a thing so unusu∣al,
as may justly ground the observation laid upon
it. Indeed for a <HI>fool to say in his heart there is no
God,</HI> is not without example: but for a Sect of men
to say it with their mouth, dictate it as Philoso∣phy,
and for that be esteem'd Wits and Masters
of Reason, is utterly without the precedents of
ancient times, and an atchievment to commence
with the last dotage of the world: a prodigy great
enough to go hand in hand with <HI>the Suns being
darkned, and the Moons not giving her light, the
Stars falling from their orbs, and the powers of Hea∣ven
being shaken,</HI> mention'd by our Savior as the
prologues of his second coming at the 24 of St.
<HI>Mathew,</HI> the place before recited.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="10"/>
As no Nation in the world however barbarous
has bin found to be without Religion; so none
has bin without a concern for it. By Gods law
among the <HI>Jews,</HI> the Blasphemer was to be put
to death; and Levit. 24. we see that sanction
by Gods particular command put in Execution.
Which severity afterward obtain'd, even then when
the worship of the nation diverted to Idolatry:
for when <HI>Gideon</HI> had cut down the consecrated
Grove of <HI>Baal,</HI> and destroied his Altar, Judg. 6.
his life was required as an expiation of the fact.
<HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> tho a Heathen Prince, thought
himself oblig'd to vindicate the honor not only of
his <HI>Bel,</HI> but also of the God of <HI>Israel;</HI> and as we
read Dan. 3. 29. decreed that if any one should <HI>speak
amiss against him, he should be cut in pieces, and his
house be made a dunghill.</HI> At <HI>Ephesus,</HI> upon the
suggestion that the honor of <HI>Diana</HI> had bin toucht,
<HI>the whole city was put into a confusion,</HI> Act. 19.
and at the 17 we find St. <HI>Paul</HI> question'd at <HI>Athens</HI>
for being <HI>a setter forth of strange Gods,</HI> and pro∣bably
would not have escaped, had the accusation
run, that he deni'd the old. For in that place<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Suid. in Diag. Diog. Laert. Corn. Nep. in Alcib.</NOTE> <HI>Di∣agoras,
Theodorus, Anaxagoras, Stilpo, Protagoras</HI>
and others were on this account punisht by ba∣nishments,
pecuniary mulcts and confiscations, and
by death it self. Nay what is most remarkable,
and particular to our present purpose, when <HI>Al∣cibiades</HI>
had here in the jollity of a feast indulged
unto his Wit, and made sport upon the Rites of
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>
<HI>Ceres,</HI> in mockery personating the Priest, tho he
was their General in a most important war, they
recall'd him home, who not returning, they pro∣scrib'd
his Person, seiz'd his Estate, and publicly
devoted him by solemn execrations.</P>
<P>It would be endless to deduce this subject thro
ancient History: all the persecutions with so much
blood and fury rais'd against Christians, are so ma∣ny
instances of this very matter; they all arising
from no other ground then the zeal they had for
their false Gods, and an opinion that Christians
were Atheists and Blasphemers, that mockt at their
Devotions, and despis'd their Deities.</P>
<P>Now whether it be reasonable for us, to have
less veneration and esteem for the true God, then
they had for the false, and verify whatever was
suggested by the Heathen, it will not be difficult
to determin. But if after the preaching of the
Gospel, wherein are made discoveries of the Ma∣jesty
of God and of his mercy, beyond any vouch∣saf'd
to former ages, men shall have less regard of
Him and of his Honor, and after that his Son has
for our sakes expos'd himself to shame and mock∣ery,
and become of no reputation, we shall there∣fore
add to his inanition, and let him be of none
with us; converting all the obliging circumstances
of his life and death to his continued reproch; cru∣cify
him afresh, and put him to an open shame:
and farther, if these multiplied, these unaccoun∣table
indignities, which in former times had cer∣tainly
bin Capital, shall now become a Specimen
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>
of parts and education; be committed by the A∣ctors
with bold insolence, and by the Hearers en∣tertain'd
with plesure and applause; these practices
thus put together and enhanc'd, upon a sober esti∣mate
must prove, such as do carry with them as the
blackest guilt, so the most direful ominous abode.</P>
<P>That this Age of ours has somwhat of mockery
for its particular Genius, so that scarce any thing
is so entertaining, as to sport with the misadven∣tures
or failances of others; nor no faculty more
recommending then the being dextrous in turning
serious things to Ridicule, I think is a truth so no∣torious,
that I may say it without offence to any:
they that are passive in these skirmishes, being suf∣ficiently
sensible of what they suffer; and they that
are active, not desiring to concele or disown their
Talent: nay both sorts at one time or other being
active, those that have wit to shew it, and those
that have none to pretend to it. Tho alas, what
great proof is it of wit, to make others laugh? which
an Idiot can do as effectually by having none: and
as to what is the height of that celebrated faculty,
and is thought true bearing wit, the saying sharp
unexpected rambling things, tis most happily ac∣quir'd
by an approch to drunkenness or frenzy;
and twill be no very advantagious barter, to loose
our understandings to advance our wit.</P>
<P>The<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Arist. Rhet. l. 3. Quintil. Instit. l. 6.</NOTE> Masters of Greek and Roman Rhetoric
in their Institutions, discourse indeed of <HI>causing
laughter</HI> as a piece of the Art which they pretend
<PB N="20" REF="12"/>
to teach: but they tell us tis only to be allowed
in those causes which admit no other defence. The
Buffoon in a desperate exigence is to relieve the
Orator, impudence to supply the place of argu∣ment,
and wit fill up the room of sense: as we see
men who have no better weapon, think it no
shame to rake the canal, and secure themselves
by throwing dirt.</P>
<P>But what shall we say of those, who have in∣troduc'd
this way of fight into the Christian War∣fare?
those Schole divinity Drolls of this our Age,
who defend the Faith, by destroying Charity, at∣taque
their fellow-men by those opprobrions me∣thods
of disputing, by scoffs and <HI>railing accusations,</HI>
with which twere not allowable to oppose the De∣vil
himself, Jud. 9. Tis certainly great pity a
good cause should be asserted by such arguments
as libel and reproch it; such as cannot be urg'd
but by the worst of Men, and which even they
will not produce, till that all others fail them. And
were those flowers of Rhetoric weeded out of our
late controversial books, we should find large Vo∣lumes
shrink into Manuals, and be as little in their
bulk, as they are in their conviction. Where ere
this procedure takes place, tis not at all material
on what side the truth lies; a Jest will as effectu∣ally
provide an answer to a demonstration, as to
the most manifest inconsequence. The brightest
evidence and vertue disguis'd and render'd mon∣strous
by burlesque, like the Primitive Christians
in the skins of wild beasts, will easily be worried
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>
and destroied. Nay so it fares, that the most ve∣nerable
persons, things, and actions, are most liable
to be thus expos'd and made ridiculous: for what∣ever
this beloved acquisition proves, be it the gift
of Nature, meant certainly for better purposes, or
the product of drunkenness or frenzy, or what is
yet a shorter method, of spight or malice, it has
a peculiar faculty to pervert the best and most use∣ful
things, traducing sobriety for dulness, gravity
for foppishness, order for formality, learning for
pedantry, and is most immediatly prepar'd to cut
the nerves of Government, by <HI>despising Dominion,
and speaking evil of Dignities,</HI> Jude 8.</P>
<P>These are the men, who, as the roial Psalmist tells
us, <HI>make Songs of him,</HI> who pretend therein not on∣ly
to impunity, but authoritative right; and say,
they are <HI>those who ought to speake.</HI> When these
are once on the Tribunal, nothing can scape their
sentence, the modesty of Virgins, learning of Scho∣lars,
wisdom of Counsellors, integrity of Magi∣strates,
honor of Nobles, the dearest interests of all
conditions and estates are laught away, as things
not worth the keeping. Nay Majesty its self is
here obnoxious, treated as our Savior was in order
to his Crucifixion; arai'd in a ridiculous robe, arm'd
with a reed instead of a roial Scepter, then mockt
and bowed to in reproch, and then tis thought
high time to hang it on a tree. This leud familia∣rity
ends in the worst contemt, and nothing can be
so unhappy as Autority when baffled. The Coffee-house
Rebell is more mischievous, then he that
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>
takes the field; and a Prince is sooner murder'd with
a libell, then a sword. And therefore it will con∣cern
those who are in Autority to consider of what
effect it may be, that there are so many mockers of
this form and level, in these last times of ours.</P>
<P>My present enquiry is after those of a higher dis∣pensation,
who <HI>set their mouth against Heaven,</HI>
and defy God and Providence; which yet is but a
natural emprovement of the other, and no less
powerfully, if not much more destructive of Go∣vernment
and Lawes. And therefore it will also
be the Magistrates great interest, as tis their highest
duty, to be concern'd herein.</P>
<P>To these ungodly mockers, walking after their
own lusts, proud as they are, and confident that
the day of Judgment will either never be, or is
far off; I shall not add more words upon that Head
to their disturbance; but mind them of another
day, which they cannot deny to be approching, I
mean the day of Death, that <HI>sentence of the Lord
over all flesh,</HI> as the Wise man calls it, which is the
day of Judgment to each particular person, as that
of Doom is to the World.</P>
<P>And will these mockers ask in scorn where is
this promise of his coming? tho the Fathers are
faln asleep, do they hope by a peculiar privilege
to continue still, and reverse the general law of
the Creation? If the long day of the Fathers had
a night who after 7, 8, or 900 years went down
to sleep in dust, and when they did so there was
no inquisition in the grave, whether the date had
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>
bin so many hours, but all their labors vanisht as
they did, in dull forgetfulness and silence; shall
our winter Solstice day, whose Sun scarcely looks
over the Horizon, but instantly starts back again
to dwell upon the other World, so lye upon our
hands, as if the Sun were to stand still as it did in
<HI>Joshuas</HI> time, or to go back as it did in <HI>Hezechias,</HI>
that we might frolic it without disturbance, in e∣verlasting
riot and excess?</P>
<P>The sensual Epicure describ'd at the 12 of St.
Luke, who said unto his soul, <HI>Soul, thou hast much
goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat,
drink, and be merry:</HI> tho he only overlookt, and
not deni'd a Providence, was stopt in his carriere
by hasty vengeance, which pronounc'd this irre∣versible
decree, <HI>Thou fool, this night thy soul shall
be required of thee: and then whose shall those things
be which thou hast provided?</HI></P>
<P>And let our jolly men of dissolute ungodly life,
who notwithstanding the concerns of their immor∣tal
soul, are at leisure to make sport with every
thing however Sacred, who with scorn and greedi∣ness
pursue unlawful plesures, and bid defiance to
Almighty Justice, lay their hands upon their breast,
and ask themselves at what ensurance office they
have secur'd a longer date of life: how they come
to know their soul shall not be requir'd: or if it
be, how well they are prepar'd to give an answer
to the question but now askt. This very sentence
at this moment is really pronounc'd against many
thousands in the world, who ere to morrows night
<PB N="24" REF="14"/>
will breath their last; of which number not one
single person that now hears me, is sure that he is
not.</P>
<P>Have they debated calmly with themselves what
death is, how many unwelcome circumstances
are hudled up in that short word? Can they wil∣lingly
forego their houses and estates, their ta∣bles
and their beds, and bid a long farwell to their
dear company, their paramours and flatterers, lying
gastly, and cold, and senseless, imprison'd in a Cof∣fin,
and immur'd in Earth? To speak in the lan∣guage
of the Scripture, will <HI>the tender and delicate
women, who would scarce adventure to put their feet
unto the ground thro delicacy,</HI> Deut. 28. be content
to be despoil'd of their <HI>rings and jewels, the change∣able
suits of apparell, the mantles, the wimples, and
the crisping pins, the glasses and fine linen, the hoods
and veiles,</HI> Isa. 3. and, as he adds, take in exchange,
<HI>insted of a sweet smell a stink, insted of a girdle a rent,
iusted of well-set hair baldness, and burning insted
of beauty?</HI></P>
<P>But this is not all, will they be willing to come
to the Tribunal of their Maker, and render an
account of all the words, the thoughts, the actions
and omissions of an ill led life? answer for their
noon-day insolence, and mid-night revels; answer
for their own and others guilts: the sin of their
rebellion, and greater sin of their impenitence:
the accusations of offended justice, and deeper
charge of slighted Mercy?</P>
<P>Or lastly can they after the confusion and hor∣ror,
<PB N="25" REF="14"/>
of having all their guilts set in aray before
them, enhanc'd by the no less numerous overtures
of grace and mercy, out-brave that dreadful sen∣tence
of <HI>Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire, pre∣par'd
for the Devil and his Angels,</HI> Mat. 25. Will
they maintain the jolly humor there, and like the
three Children in the <HI>Babylonian</HI> furnace, sing in
the midst of flames, and resemble them in being
untoucht by pain, as they shall in not being wasted
and devour'd? Will they find arguments of mock∣ery
and laughter, in the <HI>place of weeping, and wail∣ing,
and gnashing of teeth?</HI></P>
<P>If they can do this, on Gods name let them mock
on, deny a future Judgment, or what is more ge∣nerous
and brave, let them provoke and dare it.
But if they cannot dwell <HI>with the devouring fire,
nor abide with everlasting burnings,</HI> Isa. 33. If they
cannot wrestle with Omnipotence, nor <HI>have an
arm like God;</HI> twill be advisable, to take a timely
warning, and according to the counsel given to
<HI>Job,</HI> Chap. 41. 8. to <HI>think upon the battell, and
do no more.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shall close all with the inference, and in the
words of St.</HI> Peter <HI>pursuant to my Text.</HI> The day
of the Lord will come as a thief in the night: in the
which the Heavens shall pass away with a great noise,
and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat, the
Earth also and the works that are therein shall be
burnt up. Seeing then that all these things shall be
dissolv'd, what manner of persons ought ye to be in
all holy conversation and godliness? looking for and
<PB N="26" REF="15" MS="y"/>
hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein
the Heavens being on fire shall be dissolv'd, and the
Elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless
we according to his promise look for new Heavens,
and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
Wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things,
be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, with∣out
spot, and blameless: and account that the long-suffering
of the Lord is Salvation. Ye therefore, see∣ing
you know these things before, beware least ye also
being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from
your own stedfastness. But grow in grace, and in
the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ: to him be
glory both now and for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
