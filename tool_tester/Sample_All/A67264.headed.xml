<P><MILESTONE N="I"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Invention in which</NOTE>2. Invention consists in an acute
Consideration, and particular
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
weighing of all circumstances, &amp;c.
out of which any argument may be
raised to advance the subject in
hand.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Of Com∣mon Places of Arguments.</NOTE> Therefore your Fancy, in
this ought not to be committed,
and left, to chance; gazing about,
and waiting, as it were, what may
by sudden Enthusiasm drop into it,
but to be excited and guided by
Reason; diligently beating and
examining the Causes, Effects, Ad∣juncts,
and whatever may have re∣lation
to your subject, that (at least)
some of them may afford materi∣als
to your design, Brief Tables
of which, and sufficiently exact, in
all the three kinds of Discourses,
Demonstrative, Judicial, Delibe∣rative,
see in <HI>Quintil. lib. 5. cap. 10.</HI>
and in <HI>Farnabi</HI>'s and other Modern,
Rhetoricks. A many of which
are also rudely put together in
these verses:
<Q><L>An? Quis? Quid? Cujus? Cui? Quo?
Quibus auxiliis? Cur?</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Quomodo? Circa quid? Qualis?</L>
<L>Quantum? Ex, In, &amp; à quo?</L>
<L>Quamdiu? Ubi? Quando? Quoties?</L>
<L>Quotuplex? Quot? &amp; Unde?</L></Q>Or in that shorter,<Q>

<L>Quis? Ubi? Quid? Quibus auxiliis?</L>
<L>Cur? Quomodo? Quando?</L>
<L>Who? What? How? When?</L>
<L>Where? and why?</L></Q></P>
<P>3. For Example; Common places for Argu∣ments;
* <HI>To prove any thing to be good,</HI> may be such as
these;—</P>
<P>—Because tis the chief end, all men, or the wisest of
men, aim at—all, or the wisest commend—because
it produceth some good—preventeth or remedieth
some evil—procures us much pleasure,—profit,
—reputation,—honors,—things, we account good.
—is rewarded—is difficult to attain—is contrary to
all excess, &amp;c.—is dictated by nature—is followed
with content—other things for its sake accounted
good, &amp;c.</P>
<P>4. * <HI>To prove any thing more good,</HI> such as these;</P>
<P>—Because tis the end, and so more worthy than
the means—chosen for its self, and not for another
—conducing to a better, worthier end—conversant
about a nobler object—can better be without the o∣ther,
than the other without it—is the cause of the
other—more beneficial—beneficial to more—more
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
rare—more beautiful—more lasting—more reward∣ed
—more easie to be procured (for on both sides ar∣guments
are probable)—more pursued by wise
men—better, according to circumstance of person,
time, place, action, &amp;c.—Any of whichmediums,
<HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> is perswasive.</P>
<P>5. The contraries serve, * <HI>To prove a thing evil, or less
good. * To aggravate a Crime,</HI> such as these, drawn</P>
<P>—From the greatness of the dammage—the im∣possibility
of reparation—from the quality of the per∣son,
by whom; to whom—from doing it alone; or
first; or often—with no, with small, benefit to him∣self
—with a determinate purpose, having no plausible
motive toit—not very feasible;—from its being a
thing contrary to nature—to express law—savour∣ing
of brutishness, and inhumanity—Done in a
holy place, in the court, &amp;c.—in such a time—against
a Kinsman, a Benefactor, a Magistrate—giving so
much scandal—so much encouragement.</P>
<P>6. * To extenuate a fault;</P>
<P>—That it was not done at all—not so done—
that it was done so; but that it was well done—
not well done; but yet of those things that are usu∣ally
pardoned—that it was not an injury—but an er∣ror;
a misfortune—not done with an ill mind—not
with deliberation—that not a part onely, but the whole
action be considered—not that action, but the whole
course of his life—what good, as well as what evil, he
hath done—not to regard the words of the Law, but
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
the intent of the Law-giver—not the Law (failing in
particulars,) but equity.</P>
<P>7. All Discourses are either
of <HI>Things; Persons;</HI> or <HI>Facts: In
Persons,</HI> considerable are; their De∣scent,
Nation, Countrey, Sex, Age,
Fortune, Manners, Education, Re∣lations,
of Father, Master, Citizen,
&amp;c. <HI>In facts;</HI> The Cause, Time,
Place, Instrument, the Manner,
&amp;c. <HI>In things,</HI>(that is, Substances,
and Qualities) the <HI>An sit, Quid sit,
Quale, Quotuplex;</HI> its Genus, Spe∣cies,
Properties, &amp;c.—In gross, for
all subjects (which are most-what
mixt of these three, <HI>i. e.</HI> Persons,
Actions, Qualities) Proofs are de∣rived
from Persons, Causes,
Times, Places, Antecedents, Con∣sequents,
Efficients, Effects, E∣vents,
Conjugates, Similies, Con∣traries,
Contradictories, Compari∣son
with Things Greater, Lesser,
Equal; from Correlates, Exam∣ples,
Suppositions, and Reduction
<HI>ad absurdum,</HI>(as is used in the Ma∣thematicks)
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
to a Consequence
that all grant to be false; from
their <HI>Genus, Definition, Division,</HI>
&amp;c. Amongst which * Similitudes
(<HI>i. e.</HI> Like Cases resembling it:)
* Contraries (which much manifest
one another:)* Examples, Instan∣ces,
Suppositions and Reduction
<HI>ad absurdum,</HI> are diligently to be
sought out; proving a thing many
times much more, than reasons to
our Auditory; who, when by the
one they see not how it can be
done; by the other they easily see
that it is done; and therefore <HI>Ex∣emplum</HI>
is not in vain made one
species of argumentation.</P>
<P>8. Several Examples of Arguments drawn from
such Topicks. As; <HI>From effects, Scipio</HI> was a better
General then <HI>Hannibal,</HI> he conquered <HI>Hannibal.</HI>—He
is valiant, for he feared not death.—<HI>From the Instrument;</HI>
He killed him, for his weapon was found in the wound—
<HI>From the Antecedents;</HI> He killed him, for hethreatned
his death, went out by night armed, way-layd him.
—<HI>From Circumstances; Cic. Clodius</HI> laid wait for <HI>Milo,</HI>
and not <HI>Milo</HI> for <HI>Clodius: He</HI> went forth with lusty
servants armed; <HI>This</HI> with a few women; <HI>He</HI> mount∣ed
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
on horse-back; <HI>This</HI> in a Coach.—<HI>From the Con∣sequents;
Sylla</HI> took not up arms for ambition sake,
witness the resigned Dictatorship.—<HI>A majori;</HI> If
lawful to kill an Adulterer, tis so to beat him.—Who
hath committed sacriledge, will not scruple to commit a
theft.—<HI>A minori;</HI> If Theft a capital crime,
much more Sacriledge. <HI>From Similies;</HI> If Continency
be a vertue, then such is Abstīnence.—As Mariners
can do nothing without a Pilot, so neither Souldiers
without a Commander.—<HI>From Conjugates;</HI> an honest
thing it is to learn, therefore to teach.—<HI>From Contra∣ries;</HI>
If War be the cause of all evils, Peace is the
remedy of them.—If he deserve pardon who wrongs
one unawares, he merits a reward, who purposely
doth one a favor.—<HI>From Contradictories;</HI> When he
refused to entertain him having all mens approbation,
would the same entertain him with so many mens of∣fence?
—<HI>From Division;</HI> That any one be a Citizen,
he must either be born, or made so; but he neither of
these—<HI>So from Dilemmas;</HI> where either side chosen
evinceth the same thing:—Putting a man to the rack, no
sure way to discover truth: for either he can endure
the pains, and then he will lie amidst his torment; or
he cannot endure them, and then he will say any thing,
to end them. See concerning these Topicks <HI>Quintil.
Instit. l. 5. c.</HI> 10. &amp;c. and the first and second Book
of <HI>Aristotles</HI> Rhetorick.</P>
<P>9. Now there being infinite other
places of Arguments besides these,
(especially where the subject is
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
more complexe) and many of these
not furnishing any one subject, ex∣cept
with very trivial and common
matter (which is to be rejected)
they are onely set down to give
hints to your invention whilest yet
unpractised; which, when more
exercised, will presently repair to
those chiefly serviceable, and less
accommodable to other subjects,
without at all saluting the rest.</P>
<P>10. Invention on most subjects is
to look two wayes. To prove in the
first place; in the second to dis∣prove:
to confirm, and then to
confute; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to state
first; and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to make
and answer objections. (There
being nothing, that so much can be
said for, but something also may
be said against it) which affords
a double field of matter to be
drawn from these, and such like
heads. The first part useth to be
more solid; the second, more acute.
Hence the natural parts of a dis∣course
are, 1. an Exordium or P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣face;
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
2. Declaring and proving
our own Positions. 3. Refuting
the contrary; 4. A short recapitu∣lation
and concluding, called <HI>Per∣oratio.</HI></P>
<P>11. In all our Proofs we have re∣course
to, either things of sense;
or common received Axioms, and
Truths, or Laws, and Customes,
or the Concessions of our Adver∣sary,
or of our Auditors. Neither
is it needful to ascend to the ulti∣mate
Causes of every thing, but
to stay our Probation at our Audi∣tors
grants.</P>
<P>12.<NOTE PLACE="marg">On these to exercise your own In∣vention fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st; and in this not to be too curious at first, for your m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter, or ex∣pression.</NOTE> In inventing take heed of tor∣turing
your fancy too much at first;
either in the quest of more curious
matter, or in setting it down in the
most exact form. For, besides that
the mind doth more heavily and
less accurately, perform many
things at once; the Wit especially,
is of so delicate a sharpness, that
any forcing presently turns the
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
edge; and where we make too
much difficulty, it becomes onely
amazed and astonished; and thus
circumscribed and limited to none
but extraordinary productions,
like a pent flame, it blazeth not
the more for this, but is rather
choked and put out. <HI>De ingenio suo
pessimè merentur</HI> (saith <HI>Quintil.)
qui diligentiam putant, facere sibi
scribendi difficultatem.</HI> The best
way therefore is, * to give it leave to
expatiate it self in its work, and
heat, and grow more active by de∣grees;
* to take what it sponta∣neously
produceth; and pass by,
what it doth not readily pass
through; which (like the deficient
memory) at another attempt, or,
by and by, at the same, answereth
of its own accord our formerly-frustrated
expectation. What order∣ly
matter therefore, it shall (un∣forced)
offer you, set down; that
by this, as a lower step, the Fancy
may ascend, and scrue it self up to
something more choice; which it
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
cannot so easily mount unto at the
first, without taking, by the way,
this meaner rise. But then we must
take the pains of twice writing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But in a se∣cond copying to reject what is slight, cor∣rect the order, expression, &amp;c.</NOTE>
that the second Copy may cast a∣way
(according to its better Provi∣sion)
what is ordinary and common
in the former.</P>
<P>13. <NOTE PLACE="marg">To expose them rude in writing, rather than burden the memory.</NOTE>Rather than reserve your com∣positions
in your mind, till they are
exactly formed, write them down
at first without curiosity, and cor∣rect
them after in your Paper: Tis
said of <HI>Virgil,</HI> that he drew out his
matter first in Prose, then compo∣sed
it in verse at large; then again
contracted those verses to a smal∣ler
number, and better expression.
Many things are, as easilier, so
sooner, done severally, then at
once: as our strength, in parcels,
quickly takes up the weight, which
united in one it can never move.
For the mind travelling with many
conceptions at once (undisburdned
of any) must needs be much sur∣charged,
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
retarded and confounded;
but she beholds them now much
more clearly and distinctly, when
thus by writing laid before her
face; by this she hath fewer busi∣nesses
to attend at once, more
room to perfect, and ease to range
them, now not so easily skipping
and withdrawing themselves out of
her sight, or interturbing one ano∣ther,
as when they were all confu∣sedly
floating in the fancy. * <HI>Intel∣lectus</HI>
(saith Sir <HI>Fr. Bacon) cogita∣tionibus
gravatus clarescit, &amp;c.
si literis mandentur. * Whosoever

good matter (without which
change, both the Orators fancy,

soon tired) you must not pursue
any one particular Argument too
far, and draw it out as it were to
the dreggs; for much, upon any
one head, cannot be said well: but
if well, perchance, by some pre∣gnant
wit; yet how much, upon
divers objects, will that wit say bet∣ter;
and by this advantage, go so
much beyond it self, as without it,
it doth beyond others? It is con∣venient
therefore, often to break
off the thread you are spinning;
and set your imagination on work
afresh, upon some other new cir∣cumstance,
as if nothing at all had
been meditated before. All which
variety of in-cohering matter is to

<P>I. <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Of disposing the invented matter in some order, and u∣nder certain heads.</NOTE>IN all your Compositions, e∣specially
those of any length,
upon all your Materials revised, a
Division, and distribution of them
under certain Heads, such as best
fits them, is alwayes to be cast, and
contrived; though not necessary
alwayes to be mentioned, yet in
many also not to be concealed.
Which Division as, by having the
several sorts of matter taken (as it
were) out of a confused heap, and
distinctly sorted by themselves, it
much cleareth the Discourse, help∣eth
the Auditors judgment, and
sheweth the Orators, so likewise
it exceedingly facilitates the Tran∣sitions,
assisteth the Memory,
<PB N="16" REF="12"/>
guides the Oration steady from an
uncertain and unequal fluctuation
(like a weather-driven ship desti∣tute
of her Pilot) and makes it
steer a certain and methodical
course to the Point, whither the
Orator designs it: By which also
the Oration is freed from tedious∣ness
<HI>(Partitiotaedium levat,</HI> Quint. l.
4. c. 2.) Whilst the Auditors atten∣tion
more patiently passeththrough
many moderate discourses, than
one long: and it seemeth excessive
to him for one subject, which for
many, seems but short, and reaso∣nable.
In which by the Orators
mentioning continually his Tran∣sitions
from one part to another he
is refreshed to see, how much is
already finished, and the bounds
also of what is yet to come, (<HI>minus
longum videtur, in quo, quid ultimum
sit, certum est. Quint.</HI>) and proceeds
to a new subject with a more ere∣cted
attention. For the same rea∣son,
after a long discourse, Recapi∣tulations
arenecessary, that the Au∣ditor
<PB N="17" REF="12"/>
may discern, that the Spea∣ker
is methodical.</P>
<P>2. Paucity of parts (not ordina∣rily
to exceed three or four) com∣mends
a division: and as a partiti∣on
is better, than the unity of a dis∣course;
so that partition is better,
that doth not much recede from it.
(<HI>Neque prudentia auditoris confusione
partium impedienda, neque memoria
multitudine</HI>). And in the distribu∣ting
of your matter, you are chief∣ly
to look out, what is fittest to be
first, and what to be last, said, that
the beginnings and endings of all
these may be the most weighty,
which by the Auditor are most
observed. (<HI>Quae primò, aut postremò

the <HI>last</HI> clause rather to be the <HI>lon∣ger.</HI>
Which is to be observed, not

<P>Wheresoever therefore you
perceive a halting in the Period,
some <HI>expletives</HI> (than which no∣thing

And nothing is more Orator-like
than this (especially in a sterile,
and jejune subject) to agitate,
spread and mould the same lump
of matter, after many divers fa∣shions;
<PB N="71" REF="39"/>
to change and invert the
figure, parts, order, ornaments,
of our speech, and in such a man∣ner,
rehearse the like, or indeed
the same, that it seems still diverse,
and quite another thing: At least
'tis, with the best Masters of this
Art, usual to render every sense in
a doubled expression, the latter of
which sometimes explains the for∣mer,
most-times riseth higher,
(as it were in emulation) and out-goes
it, and makes descant, on the
preceding plain song; the first, ex∣hibiting
the matter naked, the o∣ther,
adorning it. The <HI>Hebrew</HI>
and other <HI>Eastern</HI>-tongues use this
reduplication onely for the more
state, and gravity, without varying
at all the conceit. As:</P>
<P>O my people give ear to my law; encline your ears

<P>Of which there is no one sort

A <HI>short</HI> period loseth so
much of smoothness, as a <HI>long</HI> and

more harsh, and the other blunt.
One suits with reason; the other
with the passions, better: and the
Rhetorick of the one is more
sweet, of the other more power∣ful.
If the one seem more learned,
the other seems more natural and
unaffected; and if this hath an ele∣gancy,
the other hath a simplicity
that pleaseth one. One entertains

superfluous to the stricter
examination of a now passion-less
judgment. Either very long, or
very short, periods are subject to
obscurity: one not opening and
spreading the matter enough; the
other over-burdening the Audi∣tors

lose the acuteness and elegancy in
the one, or suffer the dismembring

<P><MILESTONE N="22"/> 2. For the second, where the
<HI>parenthesis</HI> is a short necessary ex∣plication,
or interpretation of a

word, it may be any where insert∣ed:
if not so; the matter there∣of
is 1. Either some <HI>praecognitum;</HI>
and then it is best placed next be∣fore
such a period. Or 2. some
reason and argument to confirm
somewhat there asserted; and then
it is either to be made part of the

the period: the intended sequence
of matter being removed to the
next, when the <HI>parenthesis</HI> hath
nearer relation; or (a <HI>memorandum</HI>

so, and may be so well husbanded,
this ingrafting of several matters
into one another by <HI>parenthesis,</HI> if
it argues a good wit, it shews a
weak and unthrifty Orator; whose
orderly production of his matter
is one of his greatest perfections;
besides the regard he is to have to
uniformity of stile, and the intel∣lect
of his Auditor, who much
<PB N="110" REF="59"/>
better discerns things severed,
than many intwisted together, and
offered all at once in a croud to his

thereof can neither well be premi∣sed,

<PB N="117" REF="62"/>
(which as it is somewhat hard for

mistake) but also concerning the
whole matter, disposition, and or∣naments,
of our work.</P>
<P>For 1. first what letteth, that
those, short of us in fancy, may ex∣ceed
us in judgment? Or 2. if
not, yet are we more dis-enabled
to this office by self-love to our
own productions, than they by ig∣norance,

also judge perfectlier of these,
when we have for a while laid them
aside, and the ardency of love,
which we have to any new parturi∣tion,
is by some space of time aba∣ted,
after that we have diverted to
some other imployment, amongst
which, as amongst children, com∣monly
the yongest is most affected.
Or, 3. if not this neither; yet since
our works are according to other
mens capacity, and not our judg∣ment,
estimated, and, as they are
composed by us, so, are, for them,
we ought perchance in something
<PB N="118" REF="63"/>
to depart even from the right,
where they disallow it. (It was
<HI>Pomponius Secundus</HI> his saying

Ep. 17.) For none is an Orator to
himself, but others; and there∣fore
what is not writ agreeable to
their apprehensions, is written to
small purpose; and what is most
accommodated to these, do not
themselves best determine? what
is writ for others, is either to pro∣fit,
or to delight them; but no∣thing
in this kind profits much,
which doth not first please; and
what best pleaseth them, they best
judge. Therefore since a discreet
Orator would onely use what they
may like, it is also very requisite,
that he trie how they like what he
useth. Onely in this he is to ob∣serve
not singular opinions, but
some more general consent in their
judgement; which, when in many
the same, is seldom mistaken.</P>

The heighth, the length, &amp; distance be∣tween
words, are still to be varied, and
that not onely in the conclusion, but
in every article and clause of a Period;
some words being spoken higher, some
lower; some swifter, and with force,
some slower and more mollified: Else
nothing said is made more or less con∣siderable,
than another; when yet al∣wayes
something is so. And so for <HI>pau∣ses;
comma's,</HI> and all other distinctions
require some, yet not all the same stay.
Nay several words have a different
stop from the several syllables of the
same word. <HI>(Est quoddam in ipsâ divi∣sione
verborum latens tempus.</HI> Quint.)
<PB N="120" REF="64"/>
And this not without much reason.
For besides that hereby, what is most
eminent in our reasoning is elevated,
and prolonged beyond the rest, and
the columns of our discourse singled
out for the Auditors special obser∣vance;
<HI>besides this,</HI> I say, as in all o∣ther
things men are both eased and
delighted with perpetual variety, and
change, so 'tis in <HI>Pronunciation;</HI> the va∣rying
whereof yields a great delight to
the ear, but also as great an ease and re∣freshment
to the voice. What gives
singing such a ravishing power over us,
but a well proportion'd variety of the
Notes? What advanceth Verse above
Prose, but a perpetual change of the
feet? (the harmony of which, when
placed in such an order, being once ob∣served,
made afterward a disposition of
them, a law for Verse) even the same
power these retain, * in the Orators
stile, as in verse, though it must needs
be more loose <HI>(non vacat exiguis)</HI> and
* in his <HI>pronunciation,</HI> as in a song;
though it must needs be less curious,
and affected.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/> Now those words which the voice is
<PB N="121" REF="64"/>
chiefly to stay upon, and give an extra∣ordinary
<HI>Emphasis</HI> to, are such, in which
there lies some figure, as all <HI>Antitheta's</HI>
and <HI>correspondents,</HI> and words relating
to another, and generally the <HI>mediums</HI>
(in which lies the greatest burden) of
our arguments. <HI>(Observandum quo loco

<P>Which as they were purchased <HI>by us,</HI> so provided <HI>for
them; they</HI> have the <HI>right</HI> of what we have the <HI>possession.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"/> And amongst the rest alwayes the
cadence of the Period, which is most
observed, and accordingly by the voice
usually most varied, ought to be fitted
for a more tunable pronounciation <HI>(Ra∣tio
pedum magis &amp; desideratur in claus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lis
&amp; apparet.</HI> Quint.—and—<HI>Aures tum
magis judicant, cum orationis impetus ste∣tit,

therefore the chiefest Orators, though
negligent of all the rest, have observed
certain measures and feet; <HI>placet
plerisque dichoraeus,</HI> saith <HI>Quintilian:</HI>
and <HI>Tully</HI>'s <HI>[esse videatur]</HI> is famous.
<PB N="122" REF="65"/>
Yet this strictness extends not to a∣bove
four or five of the last syllables.
A due and tunable clause therefore of
a Period after the last Pause that is
made before it (i. e. the Comma or
other Point that precedes &amp;c.) ought
to be ordinarily at least of four sylla∣bles;
because the voice begins its va∣riation
some Notes before the sylla∣ble
that concludes: (For who can
conclude handsomely that knowes
not of it, before he is enter'd into the
last word or syllable?) And these
syllables are better all <HI>long,</HI> than all
<HI>short▪</HI> those having more stability and
weight; better <HI>long</HI> and <HI>short</HI> interchan∣geably,
than all <HI>long;</HI> the <HI>short</HI> be∣ing
far more smooth and sweet, and
the voice also requiring by courses
some syllables, wherein to spare (as in
the <HI>short</HI>) and some again, wherein to
extend it self (as in the <HI>long.</HI>) By <HI>long,</HI>
I mean those whereon the <HI>emphasis</HI> of
the word resteth; and by <HI>short,</HI> those
which the voice usually toucheth more
lightly, as <HI>fa-</HI> in [<HI>favour</HI>] and <HI>-ward</HI>
in [<HI>reward</HI>] are to be accounted
long; <HI>-vour,</HI> and <HI>re-,</HI> short.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="65"/>
And therefore in verse (wherein
there is more care of Euphony in eve∣ry
part) though the <HI>English</HI> doth not
strictly observe set quantities, yet
hath it a great latitude of roughness
or smoothness, according as these are
well placed; nor flowes it so grace∣fully,
1. * unless ordinarily every se∣cond
syllable, or latter part of the
foot be <HI>long</HI> (especially the latter syl∣lable
of the first, and of the penultime,
foot). As this verse:</P>
<P>[These in the Summer of thy favor grow]
<HI>runs better than this:</HI></P>
<P>[<HI>In the Summer of thy favor these grow</HI>].
And note, that <HI>Iambicks</HI> are better
than <HI>Trochae's,</HI> and <HI>Spondae's</HI> than <HI>Da∣ctyles.</HI>
As for terminations, those u∣sually
<HI>short</HI> in the Latine (not regard∣ing
position) are so in the <HI>English,</HI> as
the <HI>Liquids,</HI> &amp;c. And those again <HI>long,</HI>
which have <HI>long vowels, double conso∣nants,</HI>
and endure a harder pronun∣ciation,
easily known to every ones
experience. And Secondly, * Un∣less
more frequently words ending
with a <HI>consonant</HI> be received by others
beginning with a <HI>vowel,</HI> and <HI>è contra.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="66"/>
<HI>Monosyllables,</HI> harsh, and requiring, as
several words, some little pause be∣tween
them, conclude not so tunably.
<HI>(Monosyllaba, si plura sunt, malè conti∣nuabuntur.</HI> Quint.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4"/> As for the rest of our stile, 'tis suf∣ficient
if the several clauses (any great
disparity of which sounds very harsh,
and unequal) be, as much as conveni∣ently
may be, of a like and proportio∣nable
extension; and that, neither ve∣ry
short, nor very long; not under
four syllables ordinarily, nor exceed∣ing
ten, or twelve: for the voice can∣not
vary under four, nor so tunably at
once pronounce above ten. Hence
five or six feet are the <HI>longest</HI> verse
usual in any Language; and two feet
the <HI>shortest.</HI> And by these metrical
members of Poetry (which were one∣ly
first used, because found more to
please; the Orators aim, as well as the
Poets) all our prose also is tacitely
modelled: though it must alwayes a∣void
the appearance thereof, lest it
should seem to be more affected, less
natural, less masculine, by so much
<PB N="125" REF="66"/>
trimming; as also to be strict therein would
be too troublesome.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5"/> That the voice may have its true compass,
both to notes higher and lower, as the
words and the passions do require, 'tis to be
placed in a middle key between both, to
rise and fall at pleasure. <HI>(Mediis inter acu∣tum
&amp; gravem utendum sonis, &amp; intermediis
imum supremum{que} spatiis.)</HI> Else put in a
<HI>Base,</HI> how can it descend, or ascend, in a
<HI>Treble?</HI> As a singing tone, and a verse∣like
cadence are alwayes to be avoided, so
that composition and pronunciation com∣ing
neerest them, is the best, and, that the
voice in speaking be rather elevated some∣what,
than depressed; because we are more
prone, for our ease, or from our mo∣desty,
to a low tone; which yet, be∣ing
too deep, and full, and less clear, and
making accordingly a weaker impression
upon the Auditor, is the worse, of the two ex∣tremes:
(<HI>Submisso illo murmure debilitatur
omnis intentio.</HI> Quint.). For the length of
your pronouncing, Tardity is to be chosen,
rather than precipitancy, and a scanning as
it were (though this also no small fault) of
all your syllables, rather than making per∣petual
<HI>Syneloepha's;</HI> and drowning that which
follows, by too much straining that which
goes before: whereas the articulation of all
ought to be distinct, and every syllable, to

share, of the pronunciation.</P>

is that finger called the <HI>Index</HI>). So the
<HI>hand</HI> is <HI>put forward</HI> with the <HI>thumb bended
in,</HI> for demonstrating. The <HI>first finger turn∣ed
down,</HI> for urging, and pressing as it were:
<HI>put up,</HI> for threatning: the <HI>middle finger</HI>
put out, for reproching: The <HI>left thumb</HI>
touched, by the <HI>Index</HI> of the right hand,
for reasoning, and disputing: the <HI>touching a
finger</HI> with the <HI>other hand,</HI> for distinguish∣ing,
and for numbering. The <HI>hand</HI> brought
<HI>toward one,</HI> in saying any thing of himself;
<HI>toward</HI> the <HI>head,</HI> when speaking of the un∣derstanding;
to the <HI>breast,</HI> when of the
soul, will or affections. <HI>Folding</HI> the <HI>arms</HI>
in sadness, &amp;c, And lastly; one, and that
no small, service of the <HI>Hand,</HI> is, that it
<HI>keeps time,</HI> in our speech, with our periods;
being in a kind of suspence and waving,
while the sentence is so, and, at the end
thereof, returning still to the first posture, as
the voice doth to such a tone.</P>

in his action, 1. must be free from
any imitations of levity, as of a <HI>Fidler,
Dancer,</HI> &amp;c. 2. must be aware of too
much finger-action, being not grave.
3. must not undecently extend his <HI>arms</HI>
too far any way, either upward, above the
<HI>eye,</HI> or down-ward, below rhe <HI>breast:</HI> or
much side-wayes, or backward, or circular∣ly.
4. must turn the action of the <HI>hand</HI>
the same way, as the <HI>voice.</HI> 5. must with∣draw,
and end the action of his <HI>hand</HI> with
his sentence; and in the same sentence
must not often change it. 6. must avoid
a perpetual similitude of gesture; but,
more than this, a mimical restless varia∣tion
(too little being a more tolerable fault,
than too much). In which the chief care
is to be, that it may not seem affected; but
forced from his passion: 7. Lastly, though
both the <HI>hands</HI> do more fully express the
Orators conceits, yet the <HI>left hand</HI> in acti∣on
many times needs not be used; must
never be used, as principal.</P>
