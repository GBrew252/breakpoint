<HEAD>THE CROWN OF Righteousness.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>2 TIM. 4. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteous∣nesse, which the Lord the righteous Judg shall give me at that day.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He wise GOD, that he may invite and encourage the sons of men to holi∣nesse of life, is pleased to set before their eies <HI>the recompence of reward,</HI> that if the equitie of his Precepts doth not prevail, the excellencie of his Promise may. God will have his people <HI>Volun∣tiers</HI> in Religion, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Psal. 110. 3.</NOTE> not forced with fear, but drawn with love; therefore he works upon them in such a way as is most alluring and perswasive: he would
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
catch men with a golden bait, and tempt them to obedience by shewing them what is laid up in heaven for them; so in the Text, <HI>Henceforth there is a Crown of Righteousnesse laid up, &amp;c.</HI> A Crown? Oh infinite! for a Delinquent to have a pardon is well, but to have a Crown set upon him, is no lesse rare, then stupen∣dious.</P>
<P>A true Saint hath a double Crown; one in this life, the other laid up. In this life he hath a Crown of <HI>Ac∣ceptance,</HI> Ephes. 1. 6. <HI>He hath made us accepted in the beloved.</HI> Some render the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, he hath made us favorites; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Chrysost. Theophilact.</NOTE> here is the <HI>Crown of acceptance,</HI> and in the life to come <HI>a Crown of Righteousnesse.</HI> The glorie of heaven is represented in Scripture under va∣rious Similies, and Metaphors: Somtimes heaven is compar'd to a <HI>place of rest, Heb.</HI> 4. 9. it is the souls center. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Eo feror quocunque fe∣tor. <HI>Aug. lib. Consess.</HI></NOTE> Somtimes to an <HI>house not made with hands,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 1. Somtimes to an <HI>inheritance in light,</HI> Go∣los. 1. 12. and in the Text the glorie of heaven is set forth by a <HI>Crown;</HI> the Circle is the most perfect figure. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Significat Corona perfe∣ctionem, rati∣one figurae cir∣cularis. <HI>Brondo.</HI></NOTE> This blessed Crown doth incircle within it all perfe∣ction. I shall first break up the ground of the Text by Explication, &amp; then come to sow the seed of Doctrine.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Henceforth</HI>] <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in posterum. <HI>Beza.</HI></NOTE> This word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>henceforth,</HI> is a relative word; either first it may bear date from the time of the Apostles conversion; <HI>Henceforth</HI> there is laid up a Crown: assoon as a man is implanted into Christ, he stands intituled to a Crown. Or secondly, this word <HI>Henceforth</HI> may relate to the end of his race and fight. <HI>Paul</HI> had run through all the several stages of Christianitie. <HI>He had finished his course,</HI> and from <HI>hence∣forth</HI> saith he, there is laid up a Crown. He knew his work was done, and there was nothing now remain∣ing,
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
but to step out of the world, and put on his Crown.</P>
<P>2. There is laid up for me <HI>a Crown of righteousness</HI>] <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">2. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Quest.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Quest.</HI> Why a Crown of Righteousnesse? it is a Crown of <HI>mercie;</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Psal. 103. 4.</NOTE> a Crown that free grace bestows; Why then is it called <HI>Corona justitiae,</HI> a Crown of righteousness? <HI>Answ. 1. Negatively;</HI> not that we can by<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI> I. <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g.</HI></NOTE> our righteousnesse merit this Crown. <HI>Bellarmine</HI> builds his Doctrine of Merit on this Text; <HI>Aquinas</HI> and <HI>Bonaventure</HI> say, that we merit this Crown <HI>ex condig∣no,</HI> by way of condignitie. But the whole current of our Orthodox Divines runs another way. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Opera san∣ctorum non esse talia ut eis ex condigno debeatur mer∣ces; asserunt. <HI>Gregorius, Hie∣rom, Origen, Durandus.</HI></NOTE> And the Apostle makes a clear distinction between a reward be∣stowed by Merit, and by Grace; <HI>Rom. 6. 23. The wages of sin is death, but the guift</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Rom. 6. 23.</NOTE> <HI>of God</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>is eternal life.</HI> Had the reward been by merit, the Apostle should have said, the <HI>wages</HI> of God is eternal life. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Gratia non est gratia ullo modo, nisi sir gratuita omni modo. <HI>Aug. contra Pelag. &amp; Celessium, lib. 2. c. 24. tom. 7.</HI></NOTE> Alas! how can we merit a Crown? before we merit we must satisfie, but we have nothing to satisfie. How can fi∣nite Obedience satisfie infinite Justice? Besides, what equalitie is there between our service, and the reward? What proportion between the shedding of a Tear, and a Crown? So that we cannot by our righteousnesse merit this Crown <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Munera sua coronat Deus, non meritatua. <HI>Aug. Ep.</HI> 105.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I Answer therefore 2. <HI>Affirmatively,</HI> it is called a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answ. 2. Assir.</NOTE> Crown of righteousnesse in a double sence. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Because it is <HI>Corona promissa,</HI> it is a Crown promised, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Promissum Dei cadit in debitum. <HI>Balduinus.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Re∣vel. 2. 10. I will give thee a Crown.</HI> God having made this promise, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Non dici∣mus Deo, red∣de quia acce∣pisti, sed red∣de quod tu promisisti. <HI>Aug</HI></NOTE> it is a righteous thing to bestow this Crown on us. <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Metcedem tribuit, non quod uilo ipsum obsequio praeveniamus, sed quia eodem quo er∣ga nos coepit liberalitatis tenore, priora sua dona posterioribus cumulat. <HI>Calvin.</HI></NOTE> 2. It is a Crown of righteousnesse, be∣cause it is <HI>Corona acquisita,</HI> a Crown purchased; it is a Crown bought with the price of blood. It was so
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
bought as it was given, else where were God's mercie? And it was so given as it was bought, else where were God's justice. This Crown swims to us through the blood of a Saviour. When Christ was hanging upon the Crosse, he was purchasing a Crown for us: and in this sence it is a <HI>Crown of righteousnesse;</HI> it is righteous with God to give us the Crown which Jesus Christ hath paid for so dearly.</P>
<P>3. This Crown is said to <HI>be laid up.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">3. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>]</P>
<P>The Crown is kept in reversion. God doth not pre∣sently broach the full vessels of glorie: he doth not presently install us into our honour: it is <HI>Corona recon∣dita,</HI> a Crown laid up. The Saints are heirs under age; God doth not crown them till they are of age: the sons of Kings are oft crown'd during their minori∣tie, some have been crown'd in their cradle; <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Hen. 6. Speed Chron. p. 662.</NOTE> but the heirs of glorie must be of perfect stature before they are crowned. God will give his children the ring, and the bracelets here, some of the comforts of his Spirit, but not the Crown, we are all for present pay; we are still putting off our repentance, yet would bee putting on our Crown; God will have us stay a while, the Crown is laid up.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> But why is it laid up, why is not the Crown<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quest. Answ. 1.</NOTE> presently put on? <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. It is not fit that we should yet wear it, and that for two reasons. 1. Our graces are <HI>imperfect</HI> in this life; <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Christianus mundus est &amp; mundandus. <HI>Aug. tract. 80. in Johan.</HI></NOTE> they are in their infancie and minoritie; therefore we are said to receive but <HI>primitias,</HI> the <HI>first fruits of the Spirit,</HI> Rom. 8. 23. <HI>non decimas,</HI> saith <HI>Luther;</HI> we are but Christians in <HI>fieri,</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Luther de profectu in Christian.</NOTE> we have onely some imperfect lineaments of grace drawn in us; our graces are mingled with much cor∣ruption, as Gold in the Oar is mingled with drosse; the
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
most refined soul hath some lees and dregs of sin left in it. The life of grace is said to be hid, <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 3. our faith is hid under unbelief, as the corn is hid under the chaff; now if God should set the Crown upon us in this life, he should crown our <HI>sins</HI> as well as our <HI>graces.</HI> There∣fore the Crown is laid up. 2. 'Tis not fit that wee should yet wear the Crown, for then it would take us off from doing our work; wee should be idle in the Vineyard. Who will take pains for a reward, when he hath the reward already; therefore the Crown is laid up. Wee must run the race before wee wear the Crown.</P>
<P>2 The Crown is laid up <HI>to make heaven the sweet∣er.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answ. 2.</NOTE> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Quo longius defertur, eo suaviùs laetatur. <HI>Greg. in mor.</HI></NOTE> The longer we stay for our Crown, the sweeter it will be when it comes. The absence of that which we desire, doth but endear it to us the more when we enjoy it. After all our sweating for heaven, all our praying, weeping, fasting, how welcom will a Crown bee? Therefore it is that God, though he will not de∣nie, yet hee will delay our reward; 'tis a Crown laid up.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> But if this Crown be laid up, when shall wee wear it? this brings me to the fourth and last particu∣lar in the Text.</P>
<P>4. <HI>In that day</HI>] <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">4. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Ter∣tullian.</NOTE> What day? <HI>Die obitûs mei,</HI> saith <HI>Tertullian.</HI> * In the day of my death. <HI>Justinus</HI> and others are of opinion, that the Saints shall not receive this Crown till the Resurrection. But <HI>Hierom</HI> con∣futes this opinion <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Elect is in morte datur vitae Corona. <HI>Hierom.</HI></NOTE> The Souls of the elect shall be presently Crown'd with joy and felicity; The body indeed shall lie in the grave, as in a bed of perfume, till the resurrection. <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Jacet in se∣pultura usque ad diem novis∣ssimi sui adven∣tus. <HI>Anselm.</HI></NOTE> That this rerurrection shall be is clear. <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Job. 19. 26. John. 5. 28.</NOTE> Therefore it is that some of the antients have
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
called the grave <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> a sleeping house, because this body shall awake again, and the <HI>Jewes</HI> called their burying place, <HI>The house of the living,</HI> s because they<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> believed that life would come into them again at the resurrection, and till then, the bodies of the Saints must wait for their preferment; but their Souls shall be immediately Crown'd after death.</P>
<P>Why else should Saint <HI>Paul</HI> desire to be dissolved, if he were not presently Crown'd with glory? It were better for believers to stay here, if they should not be imme∣diately with Christ. Here they are daily improving their stock of grace, they are increasing the jewels of their Crown; though they sit <HI>in the valley of teares,</HI> yet God often turns their water into wine, they have many <HI>Praelibamina</HI> sweet tasts of Gods love; they have the <HI>bunches of grapes;</HI> If <HI>Pauls</HI> Soul should sleep in his body (a drowsy opinion) then when he desired to be dissolved, he wished that which was to his losse, but this Crown shall be given <HI>in that day, die obitûs,</HI> the day of our death. It cannot be halfe a days journey between the Crosse and Paradise.</P>
<P>The words being thus opened, fall into these three parts.</P>
<P>1. Here is a glorious reward, a <HI>Crown.</HI></P>
<P>2. The adjournying of this reward, <HI>it is layd up.</HI></P>
<P>3. The persons on whom it is bestowed; <HI>viz. Paul,</HI> and the rest of believers. <HI>For me, and not for me onely, but for all them that love Christ's appearing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Doctr.</HI> That the righteous person shall wear the Crown of righteousnesse. For the illustration of this, I shall do four things.</P>
<P>1. I shall enquire who this righteous person is.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE></P>
<P>2. I shall evince it by Scripture, that the righ∣teous<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
person shall wear this blessed Crown.</P>
<P>3. I shall shew you, wherein the reward of Glo∣ry<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> is compared to a Crown.</P>
<P>4. Wherein this Crown of righteousnesse excells,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE> and out-shines all earthly Crowns.</P>
<P>I. Who this <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or righteous person is. I an∣swer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I.</NOTE> a man may be said to be righteous, two ways. 1. <HI>legally.</HI> Thus <HI>Adam</HI> while he did wear the robe of<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE> innocence was legally righteous; he had that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> a law of holiness written in his heart, and his life was a living commentary upon it. He went exact∣ly, according to every institute of God; as a well made Diall goes with the Sun; but this is lost and forfeited.</P>
<P>2. A man is said to bee righteous <HI>Evangelically:</HI> And this righteousnesse is two-fold; either a righteous∣nesse<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> by <HI>imputation.</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Rom. 4. 6.</NOTE> This righteousnesse is as truly ours to justifie, as it is Christ's to give. Or 2. a righteousnesse by <HI>implantation.</HI> <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Ezek 36. 29 27.</NOTE> The one is by the merit of Christ: The other is by the Spirit of Christ. Now this <HI>implanted</HI> righteousness is in the Soul as an <HI>in∣trinsecall quality;</HI> and if it be of the right kind, it must be there three manner of ways. 1. Righteousness must<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> be in the Soul, <HI>Extensively,</HI> <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Subject<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m denominatur à major<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> parte.</NOTE> in every part; we do not call a Blackmore white, because he hath white teeth.

Crown which God himself will set upon our head. <HI>The Lord, the righteous judge will give it me at that day,</HI> saith the Text. Therefore it is come by lawfully. Other crowns are often usurped; As histories abundantly witness; they may be called Crowns of unrighteousness, because they are unrighteously gotten. <HI>Julius Cesar</HI> was wont to say, For a Crown it was lawfull to violate any Oath. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Si violetur jus jurandum sit regni causa.</NOTE> The Saints have not their Crown by <HI>usurpati∣on,</HI> but by <HI>Election;</HI> They are chosen to a Crown <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">2 Thes. 2. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>2. This Crown of Righteousnesse exceeds <HI>in pure∣nesse.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> Other Crowns are of a more feculent, drossie mettle, They have their troubles.

Eternity is a jewell of the Saints Crown; after Millions of yeares, it will be as bright and splendent as at the first dayes wearing.</P>
<P>5. This Crown of Righteousness doth not <HI>draw envy</HI> to it. <HI>Davids</HI> own son envied him, and sought to take his Crown from off his head. A Crown of gold is often the marke for envy and ambition to shoot at: But this Crown of Righteousnesse is free from envy. The white Lilly of peace is a flower that grows in this Crown. One Saint in glory shall not envy another <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

<P>2 <HI>Branch.</HI> See here that which may raise in our hearts an holy indignation against sin, it will make us forfeit our Crown.

He was a great honourer and encourager of the lawfully Ordained Ministers; I seldom heard him speak of such as were conscientious without som testi∣mony of respect; This I observed of him, he ever pri∣zed those Ministers most (not who did <HI>smooth their tongues Jer.</HI> 23. 31. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>qui lemsicant pagnin.</HI></NOTE> or did use to gingle out their words in the Pulpit, whose preaching was rather <HI>musi∣call,</HI> then <HI>medicinall,</HI> but) who did speak most to the conscience; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Verba non tam inflant is quàm inflāmā∣tis. <HI>'Twas Bo∣naventures</HI> En∣comium,</NOTE> It was a good sign of a spiritual appetite, that he liked rather the savouriness of the meat, then the garnishing of the dish.</P>
<P>4. He was <HI>vir sine fuco;</HI> a most true hearted man to his friend.

have the honey of fair words in their mouth, and the sting of malice in their heart.</P>
<P>5. He was one that did not sinfully comply with the humors of men. There are too many who <HI>Froteus</HI> like, can change into any shape; who can sail with any winde, especially if it blows preferment; this I may say of him, though death did break him, the times could never bend him. He did often in my hearing b'ess God for that liberall allowance, which providence had carved out to him, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Fuit annona sua contentus.</NOTE> nor did he desire to increase his estate by increasing his guilt.</P>
<P>6. He was very Charitable to the poor; The age we live in, though it hath the <HI>Lamp</HI> of Profession, yet little of the <HI>Oil</HI> of Charity; 'Tis the sin of many rich men though they have a flourishing estate, yet they have a <HI>withered hand,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Luke 6. 6.</NOTE> and cannot stretch it out to good uses. It was a serious and weighty speech of <HI>Chrisostom.
