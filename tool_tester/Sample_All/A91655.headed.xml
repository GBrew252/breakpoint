<HEAD>TO THE HONOURED, NOBLE Translatour OF RABELAIS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><HI>RABELAIS</HI> whose wit <HI>prodigiously</HI> was made</L>
<L>All <HI>men, professions, actions</HI> to invade,</L>
<L>With so much <HI>furious</HI> vigour, as if it</L>
<L>Had liv'd, ore each of them and each had quit:</L>
<L>Yet with such happy <HI>slight</HI> and <HI>carelesse</HI> skill</L>
<L>As, like the <HI>serpent,</HI> doth with laughter kill;</L>
<L>So that although his noble leaves appear.</L>
<L><HI>Antick</HI> and <HI>Gottish,</HI> and <HI>dull</HI> souls forbear</L>
<L>To turne them o're, lest they should only finde</L>
<L>Nothing but savage <HI>Monsters</HI> of a minde;</L>
<L>No shapen beautuous thoughts; yet when the wise</L>
<L>Seriously strip him of his wilde disguise,</L>
<L>Melt down his drosse, refine his massie ore,</L>
<L>And polish that which seem'd rough-cast before,</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>
Search his deep sense, unveil his hidden mirth,</L>
<L>And make that fiery which before seem'd earth;</L>
<L>(Conquering those things of highest consequence,</L>
<L>What's difficult of language or of sense)</L>
<L>He will appear some noble table writ,</L>
<L>In th' old <HI>Egyptian Hieroglyphick</HI> wit:</L>
<L>Where though you Monsters and <HI>Grotescoes</HI> see,</L>
<L>You meet all <HI>mysteries</HI> of <HI>Philosophie.</HI></L>
<L>For he was wise and Sovereignly bred</L>
<L>To know what mankinde is, how't may be led:</L>
<L>He stoop'd unto them, like that wiseman, who</L>
<L>Rid on a stick when's children would do so.</L>
<L>For we are easie sullen things, and must</L>
<L>Be <HI>laught</HI> aright, and <HI>cheated</HI> into trust,</L>
<L>Whil'st a black piece of <HI>Flegme</HI> that laies about</L>
<L>Dull menaces, and terrifies the rout.</L>
<L>And <HI>Cajoles</HI> it with all its peevish strength</L>
<L>Pitiously stretch'd and botch'd up into length,</L>
<L>Whil'st the tir'd rabble sleepily obey</L>
<L>Such opiate talk, and snore away the day.</L>
<L>By all his noise as much their mindes releeves,</L>
<L>As caterwalling of wilde Cats frights theeves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But <HI>RABELAIS</HI> was another thing, a man</L>
<L>Made up of all that Art and Nature can</L>
<L>Forme from a fiery <HI>Genius,</HI> he was one</L>
<L>Whose soul so universally was throwne</L>
<L>Through all the Arts of life, who understood</L>
<L>Each stratagem by which we stray from good</L>
<L>So that he best might solid vertue teach,</L>
<L>As some 'gainst sinnes of their own bosomes preach:</L>
<L>He from wise choice did the true meanes preferre,</L>
<L>In the fooles coat acting th' Philosopher.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="3"/>
<L>Thus hoary <HI>Esop's</HI> beasts did mildly tame</L>
<L>Fierce man, and <HI>moralize</HI> him into <HI>shame;</HI></L>
<L>Thus brave <HI>Romances</HI> while they seeme to lay</L>
<L>Great traines of lust, <HI>Platonick</HI> love display;</L>
<L>Thus would old <HI>Sparta,</HI> if a seldome chance</L>
<L>Shew'd a drunk slave, teach children temperance;</L>
<L>Thus did the later Poets nobly bring</L>
<L>The scene to height, making the <HI>foole</HI> the King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And, noble Sir, you vigorously have trod</L>
<L>In this hard path, unknown, un-understood</L>
<L>By its own countreymen, 'tis you appeare</L>
<L>Our full enjoyment which was our despaire,</L>
<L>Scattering his mists, cheering his <HI>Cynick</HI> frowns</L>
<L>(For radiant brightnesse now dark <HI>Rabelais</HI> crownes.)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Leaving your brave Heroick cares which must</L>
<L>Make better mankinde and embalme your dust,</L>
<L>So undeceiving us that now we see</L>
<L>All wit in <HI>Gascone</HI> and in <HI>Cromartie,</HI></L>
<L>Besides that <HI>Rabelais</HI> is conveigh'd to us,</L>

<HEAD><HI>THE AUTHORS Prologue To the</HI> FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>OST Noble and Illustrious Drinkers, and you thrice precious Pockified blades; (for to you, and none else do I dedicate my writings) <HI>Al∣cibiades,</HI> in that Dialogue of <HI>Plato's,</HI> which is entituled <HI>The Banquet,</HI> whil'st he was setting forth the praises of his Schoolmaster <HI>Socrates</HI> (without all question the Prince of Philosophers) amongst other discourses to that purpose said, that he resem∣bled the <HI>Silenes. Silenes</HI> of old were little boxes, like those we now may see in the shops of Apothecaries, painted on the outside with
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
wanton toyish figures, as <HI>Harpyes, Satyrs, bridled Geese, horned Hares, saddled Ducks, flying Goats, Thiller Harts,</HI> and other such like counterfeted pictures at discretion, to excite people unto laughter, as <HI>Silenus</HI> himself, who was the foster-father of good <HI>Bacchus,</HI> was wont to do; but within those capricious caskets were carefully preserved and kept many rich jewels, and fine drugs, such us <HI>Balme, Ambergreece, Amamon, Musk, Civet,</HI> with several kindes of <HI>precious stones,</HI> and other things of great price. Just such another thing was <HI>Socrates,</HI> for to have eyed his outside, and esteemed of him by his exterior appearance, you would not have given the peel of an Oinion for him, so deformed he was in body, and ridiculous in his gesture: he had a sharp pointed nose, with the look of a Bull, and countenance of a foote: he was in his carriage simple, boorish in his ap∣parel, in fortune poore, unhappy in his wives, unfit for all offices in the Common-wealth, al∣wayes laughing, tipling, and merrily carousing to every one, with continual gybes and jeeres, the better by those meanes to conceale his divine knowledge: now opening this boxe you would have found within it a heavenly and inesti∣mable drug, a more then humane understand∣ing, an admirable vertue, matchlesse learning, invincible courage, unimitable sobriety, cer∣taine contentment of minde, perfect assurance, and an incredible misregard of all that, for
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
which men commonly do so much watch, run, saile, fight, travel, toyle and turmoile them∣selves.</P>
<P>Whereunto (in your opinion) doth this little flourish of a preamble tend? For so much as you, my good disciples, and some other jolly fooles of ease and leasure, reading the pleasant titles of some books of our invention, as <HI>Gar∣gantua, Pantagruel, Whippot,</HI> the dignity <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fessepineé</NOTE> of Cod-peeces, of Pease and Bacon with a Com∣mentary, &amp;c. are too ready to judge, that there is nothing in them but jests, mockeries, lascivious discourse, and recreative lies; because the out∣side (which is the Title) is usually (without a∣ny farther enquiry) entertained with scoffing and derision: but truly it is very unbeseeming to make so slight account of the works of men, seeing your selves avouch that it is not the habit makes the Monk, many being Monasteri∣ally accoutred, who inwardly are nothing lesse then monachal, and that there are of those that we are <HI>Spanish</HI> caps, who have but little of the valour of <HI>Spaniards</HI> in them. Therefore is it, that you must open the book, and seriously con∣sider of the matter treated in it, then shall you finde that it containeth things of farre higher value then the boxe did promise; that is to say, that the subject thereof is not so foolish, as by the Title at the first sight it would appear to be.</P>
<P>And put the case that in the literal sense, you
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
meet with purposes merry and solacious enough, and consequently very correspondent to their inscriptions, yet must not you stop there as at the melody of the charming Syrens, but endeavour to interpret that in a sublimer sense, which pos∣sibly you intended to have spoken in the jollitie of your heart; did you ever pick the lock of a cupboard to steale a bottle of wine out of it? Tell me truly, and if you did call to minde the countenance which then you had? or did you ever see a Dog with a marrow-bone in his mouth (the beast of all other, saies <HI>Plato, lib. 2. de Republica,</HI> the most Philosophical) if you have seene him, you might have remarked with what devotion and circumspectnesse he wards and watcheth it; with what care he keeps it: how fervently he holds it: how prudently he gobbets it: with what affection he breaks it: and with what diligence he sucks it: to what end all this? what mo∣veth him to take all these paines? what are the hopes of his labour? what doth he expect to reap thereby? nothing but a little marrow: True it is, that this little is more savoury and delicious then the great quantities of other sorts of meat, because the marrow <HI>(as</HI> Galen <HI>testifieth, 5. facult. nat. &amp; 11. de usu partium)</HI> is a nourishment most perfectly elaboured by nature.</P>
<P>In imitation of this Dog, it becomes you to be wise, to smell, feele and have in estimati∣on
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
these faire goodly books, stuffed with high conceptions, which though seemingly easie in the pursuit, are in the cope and encounter somewhat difficult; and then like him you must, by a sedulous Lecture, and frequent meditation, break the bone, and suck out the marrow; that is, my allegorical sense, or the things I to my self propose to be signified by these <HI>Pythagorical</HI> Symbols, with assured hope, that in so doing, you will at last attaine to be both well-advised and valiant by the reading of them; for in the perusal of this Treatise, you shall finde another kinde of taste, and a doctrine of a more profound and abstruse consideration, which will disclose unto you the most glorious Sacraments, and dreadful mysteries, as well in what concern∣eth your Religion, as matters of the publike State, and Life oeconomical.</P>
<P>Do you beleeve upon your conscience, that <HI>Homer</HI> whil'st he was a couching his <HI>Ili∣ads</HI> and <HI>Odysses,</HI> had any thought upon those Allegories, which <HI>Plutarch, Heraclides, Ponticus, Fristatius, Cornutus</HI> squeesed out of him, and which <HI>Politian</HI> silched againe from them: if you trust it, with neither hand nor foot do you come neare to my opinion, which judgeth them to have beene as little dreamed of by <HI>Homer,</HI> as the Gospel-sacra∣ments were by <HI>Ovid</HI> in his <HI>Metamorphosis,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Frere lu∣bin croq▪ lardon.</NOTE> though a certaine gulligut Fryer and true ba∣con-picker,
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
would have undertaken to prove it, if perhaps he had met with as very fools as himself (and as the Proverb saies) <HI>a lid worthy of such a kettle;</HI> if you give no credit thereto, why do not you the' same in these jovial new chronicles of mine; albeit when I did dictate them, I thought upon no more then you, who possibly were drinking (the whil'st) as I was; for in the composing of this lordly book, I never lost nor bestowed any more, nor any other time then what was appointed to serve me for taking of my bodi∣ly refection, that is, whil'st I was eating and drinking. And indeed that is the fittest, and most proper hour, wherein to write these high matters and deep Sciences: as <HI>Homer</HI> knew very well, the Paragon of all Philolo∣gues, and <HI>Ennius,</HI> the father of the Latine Poets (as <HI>Horace</HI> calls him) although a cer∣tain sneaking jobernol alledged that his Verses smelled more of the wine then oile.</P>
<P>So saith a <HI>Turlupin</HI> or a new start-up grub of my books, but a turd for him. The fragrant odour of the wine; O how much more dainty, pleasant, laughing, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Riant, priant, friand.</NOTE> celestial and delicious it is, then that smell of oile! and I will glory as much when it is said of me, that I have spent more on wine then oile, as did <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> when it was told him, that his expense on oile was greater then on wine; I truly held it for an honour and
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
praise to be called and reputed a frolick <HI>Gual∣ter,</HI> and a <HI>Robin</HI> goodfellow; for under this name am I welcome in all choise companies of <HI>Pantagruelists:</HI> it was upbraided to <HI>Demo∣sthenes</HI> by an envious surly knave, that his O∣rations did smell like the sarpler or wrapper of a foul and filthy oile-vessel; for this cause interpret you all my deeds &amp; sayings in the per∣fectest sense; reverence the cheese-like brain that feeds you with these faire billevezees, and trifling jollities, and do what lies in you to keep me alwayes merry. Be frolick now my lads, cheer up your hearts, and joyfully read the rest, with all the ease of your body and profit of your reines; but hearken joltheads, you vieda∣zes, or dickens take ye, remember to drink a health to me for the like favour again, and I will pledge you instantly, <HI>Tout ares metys.</HI></P>

<P>I Must referre you to the great Chronicle of <HI>Pantagruel</HI> for the knowledge of that Genealogy, and Antiquity of race by which <HI>Gargantua</HI> is come unto us; in it you may understand more at large how the Giants were born in this world, and how from them by a direct line issued <HI>Gargantua</HI> the father of <HI>Pantagruel:</HI> and do not take it ill, if for this time I passe by it, although the subject be such, that the oftener it were remember∣ed, the more it would please your worship∣full <HI>Seniorias;</HI> according to which you have the authority of <HI>Plato</HI> in <HI>Philebo</HI> and <HI>Gorgias;</HI> and of <HI>Flaccus,</HI> who saies that there are some kindes of purposes (such as these are without doubt) which the frequentlier they be repeat∣ed, still prove the more delectable.</P>
<P>Would to God every one had as certaine knowledge of his Genealogy since the time of the Arke of <HI>Noah</HI> untill this age. I think many are at this day Emperours, Kings, Dukes, Princes, and Popes on the earth,
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
whose extraction is from some porters, and pardon-pedlars, as on the contrary, many are now poor wandring beggars, wretched and miserable, who are descended of the blood and lineage of great Kings and Emperours, occasioned (as I conceive it) by the transport and revolution of Kingdomes and Empires from the <HI>Assyrians</HI> to the <HI>Medes,</HI> from the <HI>Medes</HI> to the <HI>Persians,</HI> from the <HI>Persians</HI> to the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> from the <HI>Macedonians</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> from the <HI>Romans</HI> to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> from the <HI>Greeks</HI> to the <HI>French, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And to give you some hint concerning my self, who speaks unto you, I cannot think but I am come of the race of some rich King or Prince in former times, for never yet saw you any man that had a greater desire to be a King, and to be rich, then I have; and that onely that I may make good chear, do no∣thing, nor care forany thing, and plentifully enrich my friends, and all honest and learned men: but herein do I comfort my self, that in the other world I shall be so, yea and great∣er too then at this present I dare wish: as for you, with the same or a better conceit conso∣late your selves in your distresses, and drink fresh if you can come by it.</P>
<P>To returne to our weathers, I say, that by the sovereign gift of heaven, the Antiquity and Genealogy of <HI>Gargantua</HI> hath been re∣served for our use more full and perfect then
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
any other except that of the <HI>Messias,</HI> whereof I mean not to speak; for it belongs not unto my purpose, and the Devils (that is to say) the false accusers, and dissembled gospellers will therein oppose me. This Genealogy was found by <HI>John Andrew</HI> in a meadow, which he had near the Pole-arch, under the Olive-tree, as you go to <HI>Marsay:</HI> where, as he was making cast up some ditches, the dig∣gers with their mattocks struck against a great brazen tomb, and unmeasurably long, for they could never finde the end thereof, by reason that it entered too farre within the Sluces of <HI>Vienne;</HI> opening this Tomb in a certain place thereof, sealed on the top with the mark of a goblet, about which was writ∣ten in <HI>Hetrurian</HI> letters HIC BIBI∣TUR; They found nine Flaggons set in such order as they use to ranke their kyles in <HI>Gasconie,</HI> of which that which was placed in the middle, had under it a big, fat, great, gray, pretty, small, mouldy, little pamphlet, smelling stronger, but no better then Roses. In that book the said Genealogy was found written all at length, in a Chancery hand, not in paper, not in parchment, nor in wax, but in the bark of an elme-tree, yet so worne with the long tract of time, that hardly could three letters together be there perfectly dis∣cerned.</P>
<P>I (though unworthy) was sent for thither,
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
and with much help of those Spectacles, whereby the art of reading dim writings, and letters that do not clearly appear to the sight, is practised, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> teacheth it, did translate the book as you may see in your <HI>pantagruelising,</HI> that is to say, in drink∣ing stifly to your own hearts desire; and read∣ing the dreadful and horrifick acts of <HI>Pan∣tagruel:</HI> at the end of the book there was a little Treatise entituled the <HI>Antidoted Fan∣freluches,</HI> or a <HI>Galimatia</HI> of extravagant con∣ceits. The rats and mothes, or (that I may not lie) other wicked beasts, had nibled off the beginning, the rest I have hereto sub∣joyned, for the reverence I beare to anti∣quity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>How</HI> Gargantua <HI>was carried eleven moneths in his mothers belly.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>GRangousier</HI> was a good fellow in his time, and notable jester; he loved to drink neat, as much as any man that then was in the world, and would willingly eate salt meat: to this intent he was ordinarily well furnished with gammons of Bacon, both of <HI>Westphalia, Mayence</HI> and <HI>Bayone;</HI> with store of dried Neats tongues, plenty of Links, Chitterlings and Puddings in their sea∣son; together with salt Beefand mustard, a good deale of hard rows of powdered mullet called <HI>Botargos,</HI> great provision of Sauciges, not of <HI>Bolonia</HI> (for he feared the <HI>Lombard boccone)</HI> but of <HI>Bigorre, Lon∣gaulnay, Brene,</HI> and <HI>Rouargue.</HI> In the vigor of his age he married <HI>Gargamelle,</HI> daughter to the King of the <HI>Parpaillons,</HI> a jolly pug, and well mouthed wench. These two did often times do the two backed beast together, joy∣fully rubbing &amp; frotting their Bacon 'gainst one another, insofarre, that at last she be∣came great with childe of a faire sonne, and went with him unto the eleventh moneth, for so long, yea longer may a woman carry
<PB N="19" REF="14"/>
her great belly, especially when it is some ma∣ster-piece of nature, and a person predestina∣ted to the performance, in his due time, of great exploits; as <HI>Homer</HI> saies, that the childe which <HI>Neptune</HI> begot upon the <HI>Nymph,</HI> was borne a whole year after the conception, that is, in the twelfth moneth; for as <HI>Aulus Gel∣lius</HI> saith, <HI>libr.</HI> 3. this long time was suitable to the majesty of <HI>Neptune,</HI> that in it the childe might receive his perfect forme: for the like reason <HI>Jupiter</HI> made the night, wherein he lay with <HI>Alcmena,</HI> last fourty eight houres, a shorter time not being suffi∣cient for the forging of <HI>Hercules,</HI> who cleansed the world of the Monstres and Ty∣rants, wherewith it was supprest. <HI>My masters,</HI> the ancient pantagruelists have confirmed that which I say, and withall declared it to be not onely possible, but also maintained the lawful birth and legitimation of the in∣fant borne of a woman in the eleventh moneth after the decease of her husband, <HI>Hypocrates, lib. de alimento.

I pray you, my good lusty springal lads, if you finde any of these females, that are worth the paines of untying the cod-peece-point, get up, ride upon them, and bring them to me; for if they happen within the third moneth to conceive, the childe shall be heire to the deceased, <HI>if before he died he had no other children, and the mother shall passe for an honest woman.</HI></P>
<P>When she is known to have conceived, thrust forward boldly, spare her not what∣ever betide you, seeing the paunch is full; as <HI>Julia</HI> the daughter of the Emperour <HI>Octa∣vian</HI> never prostituted her self to her belly-bumpers, but when she found her self with childe, after the manner of Ships that receive not their steers-man, till they have their ballast and lading; and if any blame them

for this their rataconniculation, and re∣iterated lechery upon their pregnancy and big-belliednesse, seeing beasts in the like exigent of their fulnesse, will never suffer the male-masculant to incroach them: their answer will be, that those are beasts, but they are women, very well skilled in the pretty vales, and small fees of the pleasant trade and mysteries of superfetation, as <HI>Populius</HI> heretofore answered, according to the re∣lation of <HI>Macrobius lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Saturnal.</HI> If the Devill will not have them to bagge, he must wring hard the spigot, and stop the bung∣hole.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>How</HI> Gargamelle, <HI>being great with</HI> Gargan∣tua, <HI>did eate a huge deale of tripes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe occasion and manner how <HI>Garga∣melle</HI> was brought to bed, and deliver∣ed of her childe, was thus: and if you do not beleeve it, I wish your bum-gut fall out, and make an escapade, her bum-gut in∣deed or fundament escaped her in an after∣noone, on the third day of <HI>February,</HI> with having eaten at dinner too many <HI>Godebillios, Godebillios</HI> are the fat tripes of <HI>coiros, coiros</HI> are beeves fatned at the cratch in Oxe stalls, or in the fresh <HI>guimo meadows, guimo mea∣dows</HI> are those that for their fruitfulnesse may be mowed twice a year: of those fat beeves they had killed three hundred sixty seven thousand and fourteen, to be salted at Shrovetide, that in the entring of the Spring they might have plenty of poudred beef wherewith to season their mouths at the be∣ginning of their meales, and to taste their wine the better.</P>
<P>They had abundance of tripes as you have heard, and they were so delicious, that every one licked his fingers, but the mischife was
<PB N="23" REF="16"/>
this, that for all men could do, there was no possibility to keep them long in that relish; for in a very short while they would have stunk, which had been an undecent thing: it was therefore concluded, that they should be all of them gulched up, without losing any thing; to this effect they invited all the Burguers of <HI>Sainais,</HI> of <HI>Suille,</HI> of the <HI>Roche clermand,</HI> of <HI>Vaugaudry,</HI> without omitting the <HI>Boudray, Monpensier,</HI> the <HI>Guedevede,</HI> and other their neighbours, all stiffe drinkers, brave fellows, and good players at the kyles. The good man <HI>Grangousier</HI> took great plea∣sure in their company, and commanded there should be no want nor pinching for any thing: neverthelesse he bade his wife eate sparingly, because she was near her time, and that these tripes were no very commendable meat: they would faine (said he) be at the chewing of ordure, that would eat the case wherein it was. Notwithstanding these ad∣monitions, she did eate sixteen quarters, two bushels, three pecks and a pipkin full: O the fair fecality wherewith she swelled, by the in∣grediency of such shitten stuffe; after din∣ner they all went out in a hurle, to the grove of the willows, where on the green grasse, to the sound of the merry Flutes, and plea∣sant Bagpipes, they danced so gallantly, that it was a sweet and heavenly sport to see them so frolick.</P>

Ha thou false Fever, wilt thou not be gone? by my figgins, godmother, I cannot as yet enter in the hu∣mour of being merry, nor drink so currant∣ly as I would, you have catch'd a cold gamer, yea forsooth Sir; by the belly of Sanct <HI>Buf</HI> let us talk of our drink, I never drink but at my hours, like the Popes Mule, and I never drink but in my breviary, like a faire father Gardien.

<P>What difference is there between a bottle <NOTE PLACE="marg">La bou∣teille est fermele a bouchon, etle flaccon a vis.</NOTE> and a flaggon? great difference, for the bot∣tle is stopped and shut up with a stoppel, but the flaggon with a vice, bravely and well plaid apon the words, Our fathers drank lu∣stily, and emptied their cans; well cack'd, well sung; come let us drink: will you send no∣thing to the river, here is one going to wash the tripes: I drink no more then a spunge, I drink like a Templer Knight: and I <HI>tan∣quam sponsus,</HI> and I <HI>sicut terra sine aqua,</HI> give me a <HI>synonymon</HI> for a gammon of bacon? it is the compulsory of drinkers: it is a <HI>pul∣ly;</HI> by a <HI>pully-</HI>rope wine is let down into a <HI>cellar,</HI> and by a gammon into the stomach, hei now boyes hither, some drink some drink, there is no trouble in it, <HI>respice personam, po∣ne pro duos, bus non est in usu.</HI> If I could get

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>How</HI> Gargantua <HI>was borne in a strange manner.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHilest they were on this discourse, &amp; pleasant tattle of drinking, <HI>Garga∣melle</HI> began to be a little unweil in her low∣er parts, whereupon <HI>Grangousier</HI> arose from off the grasse, and fell to comfort her very honestly and kindly, suspecting that she was in travel, and told her that it was best for her to sit down upon the grasse under the wil∣lows, because she was like very shortly to see young feet, and that therefore it was conve∣nient she should pluck up her spirits, and take a good heart of new at the fresh arrival of her baby, saying to her withal, that although the paine was somewhat grievous to her, it would be but of short continuance, and that the succeeding joy would quickly remove that sorrow, in such sort that she should not so much as remember it. On with a sheeps courage (quoth he) dispatch this boy, and we will speedily fall to work for the making of another. Ha (said she) so well as you speak at your own ease, you that are men; well then, in the name of God i'le do my best,
<PB N="31" REF="20"/>
seeing you will have it so, but would to God that it were cut off from you: what? (said <HI>Grangousier)</HI> ha (said she) you are a good man indeed, you understand it well enough; what my member? (said he) by the goats blood, if it please you that shall be done instantly, cause bring hither a knife; a las, (said she) the Lord forbid, I pray Jesus to forgive me, I did not say it from my heart, therefore let it alone, and do not do it neither more nor lesse any kinde of harme for my speaking so to you; but I am like to have work enough to do to day; and all for your member, yet God blesse you and it.</P>
<P>Courage, courage, (said he) take you no care of the matter, let the four formost oxen do the work. I will yet go drink one whiffe more, and if in the meane time any thing befall you that may require my presence, I will be so near to you, that at the first whist∣ling in your fist, I shall be with you forth∣with: a little while after she began to groane, lament and cry; then suddenly came the mid∣wives from all quarters; who groping her be∣low, found some <HI>peloderies,</HI> which was a cer∣taine filthy stuffe, and of a taste truly bad e∣nough, this they thought had been the childe, but it was her fundament, that was slipt out with the molification of her <HI>streight intrall,</HI> which you call the <HI>bum-gut,</HI> and that meerly by eating of too many tripes, as we have
<PB N="32" REF="21"/>
shewed you before: whereupon an old ugly trot in the company, who had the repute of an expert she-Physician, and was come from <HI>Brispaille</HI> near to Saint <HI>Gnou</HI> threescore yeers before, made her so horrible a restrictive, and binding medicine, and whereby all her <HI>Lar∣ris,</HI> arse-pipes and conduits were so opilated, stopped, obstructed, and contracted, that you could hardly have opened and enlarged them with your teeth, which is a terrible thing to think upon; seeing the Devill at the Masse at Saint <HI>Martins</HI> was puzled with the like task, when with his teeth he had lengthened out the parchment whereon he wrote the tittle tattle of two young mangy whoores; by this inconvenient the <HI>cotyle∣dons</HI> of her matrix, were presently loosed, through which the childe sprung up and leapt, and so entering into the hollow veine, did climbe by the diaphragm even above her shoulders, where that veine divides it self into two, and from thence taking his way towards the left side, issued forth at her left eare; as soone as he was borne, he cried not as other babes use to do, <HI>miez, miez, miez, miez,</HI> but with a high, sturdy and big voice shouted a loud, some drink, some drink, some drink, as inviting all the world to drink with him; the noise hereof was so extreamly great, that it was heard in both the Countreys at once, of <HI>Beauce</HI> and <HI>Bibarois.</HI> I doubt me that you
<PB N="33" REF="21"/>
do not throughly beleeve the truth of this strange nativity, though you beleeve it not I care not much: but an honest man, and of good judgement beleeveth still what is told him, and that which he findes written.</P>
<P>Is this beyond our Law, or our faith? a∣gainst reason or the holy Scripture? for my part, I finde nothing in the sacred Bible that is against it; but tell me, if it had been the will of God, would you say that he could not do it? ha for favour sake (I beseech you) never <HI>emberlucock</HI> or <HI>inpulregafize</HI> your spirits with these vaine thoughts and idle conceits; for I tell you, it is not impossible with God, and if he pleased all women henceforth should bring forth their children at the eare; was not <HI>Bacchus</HI> engendred out of the very thigh of <HI>Jupiter?</HI> did not <HI>Ro∣quetaillade</HI> come out at his mothers heele? and <HI>Crocmoush</HI> from the slipper of his nurse? was not <HI>Minerva</HI> born of the braine, even through the eare of <HI>Jove?

<P>THE good man <HI>Grangousier</HI> drinking and making merry with the rest, heard the horrible noise which his sonne had made as he entered into the light of this world, when he cried out, Some drink, some drink, some drink; whereupon he said in French, <HI>Que grand tuas et souple le gousier,</HI> that is to say, <HI>How great and nimble a throat thou hast;</HI> which the company hearing, said, that veri∣ly the childe ought to be called <HI>Gargantua;</HI> because it was the first word that after his birth his father had spoke in imitation, and at the example of the ancient Hebrewes, whereunto he condescended, and his mother was very well pleased therewith; in the meane while to quiet the childe, they gave him to drink <HI>a tirelarigot,</HI> that is, till his throat was like to crack with it; then was he carried to the Font, and there baptized, ac∣cording to the manner of good <HI>Christi∣ans</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="22"/>
Immediately thereafter were appointed for him seventeen thousand, nine hundred, and thirteen Cowes of the towns of <HI>Pautil∣le</HI> and <HI>Breemond</HI> to furnish him with milk in ordinary, for it was impossible to finde a Nurse sufficient for him in all the Countrey, considering the great quantity of milk that was requisite for his nourishment; although there were not wanting some Doctors of the opinion of <HI>Scotus,</HI> who affirmed that his own mother gave him suck, and that she could draw out of her breasts one thousand, four hundred, two pipes, and nine pailes of milk at every time.</P>
<P>Which indeed is not probable, and this point hath been found duggishly scandalous and offensive to tender eares, for that it sa∣voured a little of Heresie; thus was he hand∣led for one yeare and ten moneths, after which time by the advice of Physicians they began to carry him, and then was made for him a fine little cart drawn with Oxen, of the invention of <HI>Jan Denio,</HI> wherein they led him hither and thither with great joy, and he was worth the seeing; for he was a fine boy, had a burly physnomie, and almost ten chins; he cried very little, but beshit him∣self every hour: for to speak truly of him, he was wonderfully flegmatick in his poste∣riors, both by reason of his natural comple∣xion, and the accidental disposition which
<PB N="36" REF="23"/>
had befallen him by his too much quaffing of the septembral juyce. Yet without a cause did not he sup one drop; for if he happened to be vexed, angry, displeased or sorry; if he did fret, if he did weep, if he did cry, and what grievous quarter soever he kept in bringing him some drink, he would be in∣stantly pacified, reseated in his own temper, in a good humour againe, and as still and quiet as ever. One of his governesses told me (swearing by her fig) how he was so accu∣stomed to this kinde of way, that, at the sound of pintes and flaggons he would on a sudden fall into an extasie, as if he had then tasted of the joyes of Paradise: so that they upon consideration of this his divine com∣plexion, would every morning to cheare him up, play with a knife upon the glasses, on the bottles with their stopples, and on the pottle-pots with their lids and covers, at the sound whereof he became gay, did leap for joy, would loll and rock himself in the cra∣dle, then nod with his head, monocor∣sing his fingers, and barytonising with his taile.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>How they apparelled</HI> Gargantua.</HEAD>
<P>BEing of this age, his father ordained to have clothes made to him in his owne livery, which was white and blew. To work then went the Tailors, and with great expe∣dition were those clothes made, cut, and sewed, according to the fashion that was then in request. I finde by the ancient Records or Pancarts, to be seene in the chamber of accounts, or Count of the Exchequer at <HI>Montforeo,</HI> that he was accoutred in manner as followeth. To make him every shirt of his were taken up nine hundred ells of <HI>Cha∣telero</HI> linnen, and two hundred for the guis∣sets, in manner of cushions, which they put under his arm-pits; his shirt was not gather∣ed nor plaited, for the plaiting of shirts was not found out, till the Seamsters (vvhen the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Besonger du cul,</HI> English'd, <HI>The eye of the needle.</HI></NOTE> point of their needles vvas broken) began to vvork and occupie vvith the taile; there vvere taken up for his doublet, eight hun∣dred and thirteen ells of white Satin, and for his points fifteen hundred and nine dogs skins and a half. Then vvas it that men began to tie their breeches to their doublets, and
<PB N="38" REF="24"/>
not their doublets to their breeches: for it is against nature, as hath most amply been shewed. <HI>Ockam</HI> upon the explonibles of Master <HI>Hautechaussade.</HI></P>
<P>For his breeches were taken up eleven hun∣dred and five ells, and a third of white broad cloth; They were cut in forme of pillars, chamfered, channel'd and pinked behinde, that they might not over-heat his reines: and were within the panes, puffed out with the lining of as much blew damask as was needful: and remark, that he had very good Leg-harnish, proportionable to the rest of his stature.</P>
<P>For his Codpeece were used sixteen ells, and a quarter of the same cloth, and it was fashioned on the top like unto a Trium∣phant Arch, most gallantly fastened with two enamell'd Clasps, in each of which was set a great Emerauld, as big as an Orange; for, as sayes <HI>Orpheus lib. de lapidibus,</HI> and <HI>Plinius libr. ultimo,</HI> it hath an erective vertue and comfortative of the natural member. The extiture, out-jecting or out-standing of his Codpiece, was of the length of a yard, jagged and pinked, and withal bagging, and strouting out with the blew damask lining, after the manner of his breeches: but had you seen the faire Embroyderie of the small needle-work purle, and the curiously inter∣laced knots, by the Goldsmiths Art, set out
<PB N="39" REF="24"/>
and trimmed with rich Diamonds, precious Rubies, fine Turquoises, costly Emeraulds, and <HI>Persian</HI> pearles; you would have com∣pared it to a faire <HI>Cornucopia,</HI> or Horne of a∣bundance, such as you see in Anticks, or as <HI>Rhea</HI> gave to the two Nymphs, <HI>Amalthea</HI> and <HI>Ida,</HI> the Nurses of <HI>Jupiter.</HI></P>
<P>And like to that Horn of abundance, it was still gallant, succulent, droppie, sappie, pi∣thie, lively, alwayes flourishing, alwayes fructifying, full of juice, full of flower, full of fruit, and all manner of delight. I avow God, it would have done one good to have seen him, but I will tell you more of him in the book which I have made of the dig∣nity of Codpieces: One thing I will tell you, that as it was both long and large, so was it well furnished and victualled within, nothing like unto the hypocritical Codpie∣ces of some fond Wooers, and Wench-courters, which are stuffed only with wind, to the great prejudice of the female sexe.</P>
<P>For his shoes, were taken up foure hun∣dred and six elles of blew Crimson-velvet, and were very neatly cut by parallel lines, joyned in uniforme cylindres: for the soling of them were made use of eleven hundred Hides of brown Cowes, shapen like the taile of a Keeling.</P>
<P>For his coat were taken up eighteen hun∣dred elles of blew velvet, died in grain, em∣broidered
<PB N="40" REF="25"/>
in its borders with faire Gilliflow∣ers, in the middle decked with silver purle, intermixed with plates of gold, and store of pearles, hereby shewing, that in his time he would prove an especial good fellow, and singular whip-can.</P>
<P>His girdle was made of three hundred elles and a halfe of silken serge, halfe white and half blew, if I mistake it not. His sword was not of <HI>Valentia,</HI> nor his dagger of <HI>Sara∣gosa,</HI> for his father could not endure these <HI>hidalgos borrachos maranisados como dia∣blos:</HI> but he had a faire sword made of wood, and the dagger of borled leather, as well painted and guilded as any man could wish.</P>
<P>His purse was made of the cod of an Ele∣phant, which was given him by <HI>Herre Prae∣contal,</HI> Proconsul of <HI>Lybia.</HI></P>
<P>For his Gown were employed nine thou∣sand six hundred elles, wanting two thirds, of blew velvet, as before, all so diagonally purled, that by true perspective issued thence an unnamed colour, like that you see in the necks of Turtle-doves or Turkie-cocks, which wonderfully rejoyceth the eyes of the beholders. For his Bonnet or Cap were taken up three hundred two elles, and a quarter of white velvet, and the forme thereof was wide and round, of the bignesse of his Head; for his father said, that the
<PB N="41" REF="25"/>
Caps of the <HI>Mirabaise</HI> fashion, made like the Cover of a Pastie, would one time or other bring a mischief on those that wore them. For his Plume, he wore a faire great blew feather, plucked from an <HI>Onocrotal</HI> of the countrey of <HI>Hircania</HI> the wilde, very pretti∣ly hanging down over his right eare: For the Jewel or broach which in his Cap he carried; he had in a Cake of gold, weighing three∣score and eight marks, a faire piece ena∣mell'd, wherein was portrayed a mans bo∣dy with two heads, looking towards one an∣other, foure armes, foure feet, two arses, such as <HI>Plato in Symposio</HI> sayes, was the my∣stical beginning of mans nature; and about it was written in Ionick letters, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or rather, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, <HI>Vir &amp; Mulier junctim pro∣priissimé homo.</HI> To wear about his neck, he had a golden chaine, weighing twenty five thousand and sixty three marks of gold, the links thereof being made after the manner of great berries, amongst which were set in work green Jaspers ingraven, and cut Dra∣gon-like, all invironed with beams and sparks, as King <HI>Nicepsos</HI> of old was wont to weare them, and it reached down to the very bust of the rising of his belly, whereby he reaped great benefit all his life long, as the Greek Physicians knew well enough. For his Gloves were put in work sixteen Otters
<PB N="42" REF="26"/>
skins, and three of <HI>lougarous</HI> or men-eating wolves, for the bordering of them: and of this stuffe were they made, by the appoint∣ment of the Cabalists of <HI>Sanlono.</HI> As for the Rings which his father would have him to weare to renew the ancient mark of Nobili∣ty; He had on the forefinger of his left hand a Carbuncle as big as an Ostrige's Egge, inchased very daintily in gold of the finenesse of a <HI>Turkie Seraph.</HI> Upon the middle finger of the same hand, he had a Ring made of foure metals together, of the strongest fa∣shion that ever was seen; so that the steel did not crash against the gold, nor the silver crush the copper. All this was made by Captain <HI>Chappins,</HI> and <HI>Alcofribas</HI> his good Agent. On the medical finger of his right hand, he had a Ring made Spire wayes, wherein was set a perfect baleu rubie, a pointed Diamond, and a Physon Emerald of an inestimable value; for <HI>Hans-carvel</HI> the King of <HI>Melinda</HI>'s Jeweller, esteemed them at the rate of threescore nine millions, eight hundred ninety foure thousand and elgh∣teen French Crowns of <HI>Berrie,</HI> and at so much did the foucres of <HI>Auspurg</HI> prize them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>The Colours and Liveries of</HI> Gargantua.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GArgantua</HI>'s colours were white and blew, as I have shewed you before, by which his father would give us to understand, that his sonne to him was a heavenly joy, for the white did signifie gladnesse, plea∣sure, delight and rejoycing, and the blew, celestial things. I know well enough, that in reading this you laugh at the old drinker, and hold this exposition of colours to be very extravagant, and utterly disagreeable to reason, because white is said to signifie faith, and blew constancy. But without mo∣ving, vexing, heating or putting you in a chafe, (for the weather is dangerous) answer me if it please you; for no other compulso∣ry way of arguing will I use towards you, or any else; only now and then I will mention a word or two of my bottle. What is it that induceth you? what stirs you up to believe, or who told you that white signifieth faith; and blew, constancy? An old paultry book, say you, sold by the hawking Pedlars and Balladmongers, entituled <HI>The Blason of Co∣lours:</HI> Who made it? whoever it was, he was wise in that he did not set his name
<PB N="44" REF="27"/>
to it; but besides, I know not what I should rather admire in him, his presumption or his sottishnesse: his presumption and overween∣ing, for that he should without reason, with∣out cause, or without any appearance of truth, have dared to prescribe by his private authority, what things should be denotated and signified by the colour: which is the custome of Tyrants, who will have their will to bear sway in stead of equity; and not of the wise and learned, who with the evidence of reason satisfie their Readers: His sottish∣nesse and want of spirit, in that he thought, that without any other demonstration or suf∣ficient argument, the world would be plea∣sed to make his blockish, and ridiculous im∣positions, the rule of their devices. In ef∣fect, (according to the Proverb, <HI>To a shitten taile failes never ordurre,)</HI> he hath found (it seems) some simple Ninnie in those rude times of old, when the wearing of high round Bonnets was in fashion, who gave some trust to his writings, according to which they carved and ingraved their apophthegms and motto's, trapped and caparisoned their Mules and Sumpter-horses, apparelled their Pages, quartered their breeches, bordered their gloves, fring'd the courtains and vallens of their beds, painted their ensignes, com∣posed songs, and which is worse, placed ma∣ny deceitful juglings, and unworthy base
<PB N="45" REF="27"/>
tricks undiscoveredly, amongst the very chastest Matrons, and most reverend Scien∣ces. In the like darknesse and mist of ignorance, are wrapped up these vain∣glorious Courtiers, and name-transposers, who going about in their impresa's, to sig∣nifie <HI>esperance,</HI> (that is, hope) have portray∣ed a sphere and birds pennes for peines: <HI>An∣cholie</HI> (which is the flower colombine) for melancholy: A waning Moon or Cressant, to shew the increasing or rising of ones for∣tune; A bench rotten and broken, to sig∣nifie bankrout: <HI>non</HI> and a <HI>corslet</HI> for <HI>non dur habit,</HI> (otherwise <HI>non durabit,</HI> it shall not last) <HI>un lit sanc ciel,</HI> that is, a bed without a te∣sterne, for <HI>un licencié,</HI> a graduated person, as Batchelour in Divinity, or utter Barrester at law; which are aequivocals so absurd and witlesse, so barbarous and clownish, that a foxes taile should be fastened to the neck∣piece of, and a Vizard made of a Cowsheard, given to every one that henceforth should offer, after the restitution of learning, to make use of any such fopperies in <HI>France;</HI> by the same reasons (if reasons I should call them, and not ravings rather, and idle triflings about words,) might I cause paint a panier, to signifie that I am in peine: a Mustard-pot, that my heart tarries much for't: one pis∣sing upwards for a Bishop: the bottom of a paire of breeches for a vessel full of far∣things:
<PB N="46" REF="28"/>
a Codpiece for the office of the Clerks of the sentences, decrees or judge∣ments, or rather (as the <HI>English</HI> beares it,) for the taile of a Cod-fish; and a dogs turd, for the dainty turret, wherein lies the love of my sweet heart. Farre otherwise did hereto∣fore the Sages of <HI>Egypt,</HI> when they wrote by letters, which they called Hieroglyphicks, which none understood who were not skil∣led in the vertue, propertie and nature of the things represented by them: of which <HI>Orus Apollon</HI> hath in Greek composed two books, and <HI>Polyphilus</HI> in his dream of love set down more: In <HI>France</HI> you have a taste of them, in the device or impresa of my Lord Admiral, which was borne before that time by <HI>Octavian Augustus.</HI> But my little skiffe alongst these unpleasant gulphs and sholes, will saile no further, therefore must I return to the Port from whence I came: yet do I hope one day to write more at large of these things, and to shew both by Philosophical arguments and authorities, received and ap∣proved of by and from all antiquity, what, and how many colours there are in nature, and what may be signified by every one of them, if God save the mould of my Cap, which is my best Wine-pot, as my Gran∣dame said.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Of that which is signified by the Colours, white and blew.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe white therefore signifieth joy, so∣lace and gladnesse, and that not at ran∣dom, but upon just and very good grounds: which you may perceive to be true, if laying aside all prejudicate affections, you will but give eare to what presently I shall expound unto you.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> saith, that supposing two things contrary in their kinde, as good and evill, vertue and vice, heat and cold, white and black, pleasure and pain, joy and grief: And so of others, if you couple them in such man∣ner, that the contrary of one kinde may a∣gree in reason with the contrary of the other, it must follow by consequence, that the o∣ther contrary must answer to the remanent opposite to that wherewith it is conferred; as for example, vertue and vice are contrary in one kinde, so are good and evil: if one of the contraries of the first kinde, be consonant to one of those of the second, as vertue and good nesse, for it is clear that vertue is good, so shall the other two contraries, (which are
<PB N="48" REF="29"/>
evil and vice) have the same connexion, for vice is evil.</P>
<P>This Logical rule being understood, take these two contraries, joy and sadnesse: then these other two, white and black, for they are Physically contrary; if so be then that black do signifie grief, by good reason then should white import joy. Nor is this signifi∣cation instituted by humane imposition, but by the universal consent of the world recei∣ved, which Philosophers call <HI>Jus Gentium,</HI> the Law of Nations, or an uncontrolable right of force in all countreyes whatsoever: for you know well enough, that all people, and all languages and nations, (except the an∣cient <HI>Syracusans,</HI> and certain <HI>Argives,</HI> who had crosse and thwarting soules) when they mean outwardly to give evidence of their sorrow, go in black; and all mourning is done with black, which general consent is not without some argument, and reason in nature, the which every man may by himself very suddenly comprehend, without the in∣struction of any; and this we call the Law of nature: By vertue of the same natural in∣stinct, we know that by white all the world hath understood joy, gladnesse, mirth, plea∣sure and delight. In former times, the <HI>Thra∣cians</HI> and <HI>Crecians</HI> did mark their good, pro∣pitious, and fortunate dayes with white stones: and their sad, dismal and unfortunate
<PB N="49" REF="29"/>
ones with black, is not the night mournful, sad and melancholick? it is black and dark by the privation of light; doth not the light comfort all the world? and it is more whitet hen any thing else, which to prove, I could direct you to the book of <HI>Laurentius Valla</HI> against <HI>Bartolus,</HI> but an Evangelical testimony I hope will content you, <HI>Matth.</HI> 7. it is said, that at the transfiguration of our Lord, <HI>Vestimenta ejus facta sunt alba sicut lux,</HI> his apparel was made white like the light, by which lightsome whitenesse he gave his three Apostles to understand the <HI>Idea</HI> and figure of the eternal joyes; for by the light are all men comforted, according to the word of the old woman, who although she had never a tooth in her head, was wont to say, <HI>Bona lux:</HI> and <HI>Tobit, chap.</HI> 5. after he had lost his sight, when <HI>Raphael</HI> saluted him, answered, <HI>What joy can I have, that do not see the light of Heaven?</HI> In that colour did the Angels testifie the joy of the whole world, at the Resurrection of our Saviour, <HI>John</HI> 20. and at his Ascension, <HI>Acts</HI> 1. with the like colour of vesture did St. <HI>John</HI> the Evangelist, <HI>Apoc.</HI> 4. 7. see the faithful clo∣thed in the heavenly and blissed <HI>Jeru∣salem.</HI></P>
<P>Reade the ancient both <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI> histories, and you shall finde that the town of <HI>Alba,</HI> (the first patern of <HI>Rome,)</HI> was
<PB N="50" REF="30"/>
founded, and so named by reason of a white sow that was seen there: You shall likewise finde in those stories, that when any man, af∣ter he had vanquished his enemies, was by decree of the Senate to enter into <HI>Rome</HI> tri∣umphantly, he usually rode in a chariot drawn by white horses: which in the Ova∣tion triumph was also the custome; for by no signe or colour would they so significant∣ly expresse the joy of their coming, as by the white: You shall there also finde, how <HI>Pericles,</HI> the General of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> would needs have that part of his Army, unto whose lot befel the white beanes, to spend the whole day in mirth, pleasure and ease, whilest the rest were a fighting. A thousand other examples and places could I alledge to this purpose, but that it is not here where I should do it.</P>
<P>By understanding hereof, you may re∣solve one Problem, which <HI>Alexander Aphro∣diseus</HI> hath accounted unanswerable, why the Lion, who with his only cry and roaring affrights all beasts, dreads and feareth only a white cock? for (as <HI>Proclus</HI> saith, <HI>libro de Sacrificio &amp; Magia)</HI> it is because the presence of the vertue of the Sunne, which is the Or∣gan and Promptuarie of all terrestrial and <HI>syderial</HI> light, doth more symbolize and agree with a white cock, as well in regard of that colour, as of his property and specifical qua∣lity,

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Of the youthful age of</HI> Gargantua.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GArgantua</HI> from three yeares upwards unto five, was brought up and instruct∣ed in all convenient discipline, by the com∣mandment of his father; and spent that time like the other little children of the countrey, that is, in drinking, eating and sleeping: in eating, sleeping and drinking: and in sleeping, drinking and eating: still he wallowed and rowled up and down him∣self in the mire and dirt: he blurred and sul∣lied his nose with filth: he blotted and smutch't his face with any kinde of scurvie stuffe, he trode down his shoes in the heele: At the flies he did oftentimes yawn, and ran very heartily after the Butterflies, the Empire whereof belonged to his father. He pissed in his shoes, shit in his shirt, and wi∣ped his nose on his sleeve: He did let his snot and snivel fall in his pottage, and dabled, padled and slabbered every where: He would drink in his slipper, and ordinarily rub his belly against a Panier: He sharpened his teeth with a top, washed his hands with his broth, and combed his head with a bole:
<PB N="54" REF="32"/>
He would sit down betwixt two stooles, and his arse to the ground, would cover him∣self with a wet sack, and drink in eating of his soupe: He did eate his Cake sometimes without bread, would bite in laughing, and laugh in biting; Oftentimes did he spit in the basin, and fart for fatnesse; pisse against the Sunne, and hide himself in the water for fear of raine. He would strike out of the cold iron, be often in the dumps, and frig and wriggle it. He would flay the Fox, say the Apes Paternoster, return to his sheep, and turn the Hogs to the Hay: He would beat the Dogs before the Lion, put the Plough be∣fore the Oxen, and claw where it did not itch: He would pump one to draw somewhat out of him, by griping all would hold fast nothing, and alwayes eat his white bread first. He shoo'd the Geese, kept a self-tickling to make himself laugh, and was very stedable in the Kitchin: made a mock at the gods, would cause sing <HI>Magnificat</HI> at <HI>Matines,</HI> and found it very connenient so to do: He would eat cabbage, and shite beets; knew flies in a dish of milk, and would make them lose their feet: He would scrape paper, blur parch∣ment, then run away as hard as he could: He would pul at the Kids leather, or vomit up his dinner, then reckon without his Host: He would beat the bushes without catching the birds, thought the Moon was made of
<PB N="55" REF="32"/>
green cheese, and that bladders are lan∣ternes: out of one sack he would take two moutures or fees for grinding; would act the Asses part to get some bran, and of his fist would make a Mallet: He took the cranes at the first leap, and would have the Mail-coats to be made link after link: He alwayes look∣ed a given horse in the mouth, leaped from the cock to the asse, and put one ripe between two green: By robbing <HI>Peter</HI> he payed <HI>Paul,</HI> he kept the Moon from the wolves, and hoped to catch Larks if ever the Heavens should fall: He did make of necessity vertue, of such bread such pottage, and cared as little for the peeled as for the shaven: Every morning he did cast up his gorge, and his fa∣thers little dogs eat out of the dish with him, and he with them: He would bite their eares and they would scratch his nose: he would blow in their arses, and they would lick his chaps. But hearken good fellows, the spi∣got ill betake you, and whirle round your braines, if you do not give eare: This little Lecher was alwayes groping his Nurses and Governesses, upside down, arswerzie, top∣siturvie, <HI>harribourr quet,</HI> with a <HI>Yacco haick, hyck gio,</HI> handling them very rudely in jum∣bling and tumbling them to keep them go∣ing; for he had already begun to exercise the tooles, and put his Codpiece in practice; which Codpiece or <HI>Braguette,</HI> his Governes∣fes

did every day deck up and adorn with faire nosegayes, curious rubles, sweet flow∣ers, and fine silken tufts, and very pleasant∣ly would passe their time, in taking you know what between their fingers, and dand∣ling it, till it did revive and creep up to the bulk and stiffenesse of a suppository, or <HI>streat magdaleon,</HI> which is a hard rowled up salve, spread upon leather. Then did they burst out in laughing, when they saw it lift up its eares, as if the sport had liked them; one of them would call it her little dille, her staffe of love, her quillety, her faucetin, her dandilollie: Another her peen, her jolly kyle, her bableret, her membretoon, her quick∣set Imp: Another again, her branch of coral, her female adamant, her placket-racket, her cyprian scepter, her jewel for Ladies: and some of the other women would give it these names, my bunguetee, my stopple too, my busherusher, my gallant wimble, my pretty boarer, my coney-borow ferret, my little piercer, my augretine, my dangling hangers, down right to it, stiffe and stout, in &amp; to, my pusher, dresser, pouting stick, my hony pipe, my pretty pillicock, linkie pinkie, futilletie, my lustie andouille, and crimson chitterlin: my little couille bredouille, my pretty rogue, and so forth: It belongs to me said one: it is mine said the other: What, quoth a third, shall I have no share in it? by my faith I will

<P>AFterwards, that he might be all his life∣time a good Rider, they made to him a faire great horse of wood, which he did make leap, curvete, yerk out behinde, and skip forward, all at a time: to pace, trot, rack, gallop, amble, to play the hobbie, the hackney-guelding: go the gate of the camel &amp; of the wild asse. He made him also change his colour of hair, as the Monks of <HI>Coultibo,</HI> (according to the variety of their holy-days) use to do their clothes, from bay, brown, to sorrel, daple-gray, mouse-dun, deer-colour, roan, cow-colour, gingioline, skued colour, pybal'd, and the colour of the savage elk.</P>
<P>Himself of an huge big post made a hunt∣ing nag: and another for daily service, of the
<PB N="58" REF="34"/>
beam of a Vine-presse: and of a great Oak, made up a mule, with a foot-cloth for his chamber. Besides this, he had ten or twelve spare horses, and seven horses for post; and all these were lodged in his own chamber, close by his bed-side. One day the Lord of <HI>Breadinbag</HI> came to visit his father in great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Painen sac Franc∣repas mouille¦vent.</NOTE> bravery, and with a gallant traine: and at the same time to see him came likewise the Duke of <HI>Free-meale,</HI> and the Earle of <HI>Wet∣gullet.</HI> The house truly for so many guests at once was somewhat narrow, but especial∣ly the stables; whereupon the steward and harbinger of the said Lord <HI>Breadinbag,</HI> to know if there were any other empty stables in the house, came to <HI>Gargantua,</HI> a little young lad, and secretly asked him where the stables of the great horses were, thinking that children would be ready to tell all? Then he led them up along the stairs of the Castle, passing by the second Hall unto a broad great Gallery, by which they entred into a large Tower, and as they were going up at another paire of staires, said the harbinger to the steward, this childe deceives us, for the stables are never on the top of the house: You may be mistaken (said the steward,) for I know some places at <HI>Lyons,</HI> at the <HI>Basmette,</HI> at <HI>Chaunon,</HI> and elsewhere, which have their stables at the very tops of the houses, so it may be, that behinde the house there is a way
<PB N="59" REF="34"/>
to come to this ascent, but I will question with him further. Then said he to <HI>Gargan∣tua,</HI> My pretty little boy, whither do you lead us? To the stable (said he) of my great horses, we are almost come to it, we have but these staires to go up at, then leading them alongst another great Hall, he brought them into his chamber, and opening the door said unto them, This is the stable that you ask for: this is my gennet, this is my gelding, this my courser, and this my hackney, and laid on them with a great Leaver: I will be∣stow upon you (said he) this <HI>Frizeland</HI> horse, I had him from <HI>Francfort,</HI> yet will I give him you; for he is a pretty little nagge, and will go very well, with a tessel of goosehawk, halfe a dosen of spaniels, and a brace of grey-hounds, thus are you King of the hares and partridges for all this winter. By St. <HI>John</HI> (said they) now we are payed, he hath gleek∣ed us to some purpose, bobbed we are now for ever: I deny it (said he) he was not here above three dayes, judge you now, whether they had most cause, either to hide their heads for shame, or to laugh at the jest: as they were going down again thus amazed, he asked them, Will you have a <HI>whimwham?</HI> What is that, said they? It is (said he) five turds <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aubeliere.</NOTE> to make you a muzzel: To day (said the steward,) though we happen to be rosted, we shall not be burnt, for we are pretty well
<PB N="60" REF="35"/>
quipped and larded in my opinion. O my jolly daper boy, thou hast given us a gudge∣on, I hope to see thee Pope before I die: I think so (said he) my self: and then shall you be a <HI>puppie,</HI> and this gentle <HI>popinjeay</HI> a perfect <HI>papelard,</HI> that is, dissembler: Well, well, (said the harbinger,) But (said <HI>Gargan∣tua;)</HI> guesse how many stitches there are in my mothers smock: Sixteen (quoth the har∣binger,) You do not speak Gospel (said <HI>Gar∣gantua)</HI> for there is sent before, and sent be∣hinde, and you did reckon them ill, consi∣dering the <HI>two under holes:</HI> When (said the harbinger?) Even then (said <HI>Gargantua,)</HI> when they made a shovel of your nose to take up a quarter of dirt, and of your throat a funnel, wherewith to put it into another vessel, be∣cause the bottom of the old one was out. <HI>Cocksbod</HI> (said the steward) we have met with a Prater. Farewel (Master tatler) God keep you, so goodly are the words which you come out with, and so fresh in your mouth, that it had need to be salted.</P>
<P>Thus going down in great haste, under the arch of the staires, they let fall the great Lea∣ver, which he had put upon their backs, whereupon <HI>Gargantua</HI> said, what a deedle, you are (it seems) but bad horsemen, that suffer your bilder to faile you, when you need him most, if you were to go from hence to <HI>Chausas,</HI> whether had you rather ride on a

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. <HI>How</HI> Gargantua's <HI>wonderful understanding, became known to his father</HI> Grangou∣sier, <HI>by the invention of a</HI> Torch∣cul <HI>or</HI> Wipebreech.</HEAD>
<P>ABout the end of the fifth yeare, <HI>Gran∣gousier</HI> returning from the Conquest of the <HI>Canarians,</HI> went by the way to see his sonne <HI>Gargantua,</HI> there was he filled with joy, as such a father might be at the sight of such a childe of his: and whilest he kist him and embrac'd him, he asked many childish questions of him about divers mat∣ters, and drank very freely with him and with his governesses, of whom in great ear∣nest, he asked amongst other things, whether they had been careful to keep him clean and sweet? To this <HI>Gargantua</HI> answered, that he had taken such a course for that himself, that in al the country there was not to be found a
<PB N="62" REF="36"/>
cleanlier boy then he. How is that (said <HI>Gran∣gousier?)</HI> I have (answered <HI>Gargantua)</HI> by a long and curious experience found out a meanes to wipe my bum, the most lordly, the most excellent, and the most convenient that ever was seen? What is that. (said <HI>Grangousier,)</HI> how is it? I will tell you by and by (said <HI>Gargantua,)</HI> once I did wipe me with a Gentlewomans Velvet-mask, and found it to be good; for the softnesse of the silk was very voluptuous and pleasant to my fundament. Another time with one of their Hoods, and in like manner that was comfortable: At another time with a Ladies Neck-kerchief, and after that I wiped me with some ear-pieces of hers made of Crim∣son sattin, but there was such a number of golden spangles in them (turdie round things, a pox take them) that they fetched away all the skin of my taile with a vengeance. Now I wish St. <HI>Anthonies</HI> fire burn the bum-gut of the Goldsmith that made them, and of her that wore them: This hurt I cured by wiping my self with a Pages cap, garnished with a feather after the <HI>Suitsers</HI> fashion.</P>
<P>Afterwards, in dunging behinde a bush, I found a March-Cat, and with it wiped my breech, but her clawes were so sharp that they scratched and exulcerated all my perinee; Of this I recovered the next morning there∣after, by wiping my self with my mothers
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>
gloves, of a most excellent perfume and sent of the <HI>Arabian Benin.</HI> After that I wi∣ped me with sage, with fennil, with anet with marjoram, with roses, with gourd-leavs, with beets, with colewort, with leaves of the vine-tree, with mallowes, wool-blade, (which is a tail-scarlet) with latice and with spinage leaves. All this did very great good to my leg. Then with Mercurie, with pursley, with nettles, with comfrey, but that gave me the bloody flux of <HI>Lumb ardie,</HI> which I healed by wiping me with my braguette; then I wi∣ped my taile in the sheets, in the coverlet, in the curtains, with a cushion, with Arras hangings, with a green carpet, with a table∣cloth, with a napkin, with a handkerchief, with a combing cloth, in all which I found more pleasure then do the mangie dogs when you rub them. Yea, but (said <HI>Gran∣gousier)</HI> which torchecul didst thou finde to be the best? I was coming to it (said <HI>Gargantua)</HI> and by and by shall you heare the <HI>tu autem,</HI> and know the whole mysterie and knot of the matter: I wiped my self with hay, with straw, with thatch-rushes, with flax, with wooll, with paper, but</P>

<P>Now say that I can do nothing, by the <HI>Merdi</HI> they are not of my making, but I heard them of this good old grandam, that you see here, and ever since have retained them in the budget of my memory.</P>
<P>Let us return to our purpose (said <HI>Gran∣gousier,)</HI> What (said <HI>Gargantua)</HI> to skite? No (said <HI>Grangousier)</HI> but to wipe our taile; But (said <HI>Gargantua)</HI> will not you be content to pay a punchion of Britton-wine, if I do not blank and gravel you in this matter, and put you to a <HI>non-plus?</HI> Yes truly (said <HI>Gran∣gousier.)</HI></P>
<P>There is no need of wiping ones taile (said <HI>Gargantua)</HI> but when it is foule; foule it cannot be unlesse one have been a skiting; skite then we must before we wipe our tailes. O my pretty little waggish boy (said <HI>Grangousier,)</HI> what an excellent wit thou hast? I will make thee very shortly proceed Doctor in the jovial quirks of gay learning,
<PB N="66" REF="38"/>
and that by G—, for thou hast more wit then age; now I prethie go on in this torchecula∣ife, orw ipe-bummatory discourse, and by my beard I swear, for one puncheon thou shalt have threescore pipes, I mean of the good <HI>Breton</HI> wine, not that which growes in <HI>Britain,</HI> but in the good countrey of <HI>Verron.</HI> Afterwards I wiped my bum (said <HI>Gargan∣tua,)</HI> with a kerchief, with a <HI>pillow,</HI> with a <HI>pantoufle,</HI> with a pouch, with a pannier, but that was a wicked and unpleasant torchecul; then with a hat, of hats note that some are shorne, and others shaggie, some velveted, others covered with taffitie's, and others with sattin, the best of all these is the shaggie hat, for it makes a very neat abstersion of the fe∣cal matter.</P>
<P>Afterwards I wiped my taile with a hen, with a cock, with a pullet, with a calves skin, with a hare, with a pigeon, with a cor∣morant, with an Atturneyes bag, with a montero, with a coife, with a faulconers lure; but to conclude, I say and maintain, that of all torcheculs, arsewisps, bumfodders, tail-napkins, bunghole-cleansers and wipe-breeches, there is none in the world com∣parable to the neck of a goose, that is well douned, if you hold her head betwixt your legs: and beleeve me therein upon mine ho∣nour, for you will thereby feele in your nockhole a most wonderful pleasure, both
<PB N="67" REF="38"/>
in regard of the softnesse of the said doune, and of the temperate heat of the goose, which is easily communicated to the bum-gut, and the rest of the inwards, insofarre as to come even to the regions of the heart and braines; and think not, that the felicity of the <HI>heroes</HI> and <HI>demigods</HI> in the <HI>Elysian</HI> fields, consisteth either in their <HI>Asphodele, Am∣brosia,</HI> or <HI>Nectar,</HI> as our old women here use to say; but in this, (according to my judge∣ment) that they wipe their tailes with the neck of a goose, holding her head betwixt their legs, and such is the opinion of <HI>Master John</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> aliàs <HI>Scotus.</HI></P>

<P>THe good man <HI>Grangousier,</HI> having heard this discourse, was ravished with admiration, considering the high reach, and marvellous understanding of his sonne <HI>Gar∣gantua,</HI> and said to his governesses, <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Macedon</HI> knew the great wit of his sonne <HI>Alexander,</HI> by his skilful managing of a horse; for his horse <HI>Bucephalus</HI> was so fierce and unruly, that none durst adventure
<PB N="68" REF="39"/>
to ride him, after that he had given to his Ri∣ders such devillish falls, breaking the neck of this man, the other mans leg, braining one, and putting another out of his jaw-bone. This by <HI>Alexander</HI> being considered, one day in the <HI>hippodrome,</HI> (which was a place ap∣pointed for the breaking and managing of great horses,) he perceived that the fury of the horse proceeded meerly from the feare he had of his own shadow, whereupon get∣ting on his back, he run him against the Sun, so that the shadow fell behinde, and by that meanes tamed the horse, and brought him to his hand: whereby his father, knowing the divine judgement that was in him, caused him most carefully to be instructed by <HI>Aristotle,</HI> who at that time was highly renowned a∣bove all the Philosophers of <HI>Greece:</HI> after the same manner I tell you, that by this only dis∣course, which now I have here had before you with my sonne <HI>Gargantua;</HI> I know that his understanding doth participate of some divinity, and that if he be well taught, and have that education which is fitting, he will attain to a supreme degree of wisdome. Therefore will I commit him to some learn∣ed man, to have him indoctrinated accord∣ing to his capacity, and will spare no cost, Presently they appointed him a great So∣phister-Doctor, called Master <HI>Tubal Holo∣phernes,</HI> who taught him his A B C, so well,
<PB N="69" REF="39"/>
that he could say it by heart backwards; and about this he was five yeares and three moneths. Then read he to him, <HI>Donat, facet, theodolet,</HI> and <HI>Alanus in parabolis:</HI> About this he was thirteen years, six moneths, and two weeks; but you must remark, that in the mean time he did learn to write in <HI>Got∣tish</HI> characters, and that he wrote all his books, for the Art of printing was not then in use, and did ordinarily carry a great pen and inkhorne, weighing above seven thou∣sand quintals, (that is, 700000 pound weight,) the penner whereof was as big and as long, as the great pillar of <HI>Enay,</HI> and the horne was hanged to it in great iron chaines, it being of the widenesse of a tun of mer∣chand ware. After that he read unto him the book <HI>de modis significandi,</HI> with the Com∣mentaries of <HI>Hurtbise,</HI> of <HI>Fasquin,</HI> of <HI>Tropi∣feu,</HI> of <HI>Gualhaut,</HI> of <HI>Jhon Calf,</HI> of <HI>Billonio,</HI> of <HI>Berlinguandus,</HI> and a rabble of others, and herein he spent more then eighteen yeares and eleven monethes, and was so well versed in it, that to try masteries in School disputes with his condisciples, he would recite it by heart backwards: and did sometimes prove on his fingers ends to his mother, <HI>quod de mo∣dis significandi non erat scientia.</HI> Then did he reade to him the compost, for knowing the age of the Moon, the seasons of the year, and tides of the sea, on which he spent sixteen

yeares and two moneths, and that justly at the time that his said <HI>Praeceptor</HI> died of the <HI>French</HI> Pox, which was in the yeare one thousand foure hundred and twenty. After∣wards he got an old coughing fellow to teach him, named Master <HI>Jobelin Bride,</HI> or muz∣led doult, who read unto him <HI>Hugotio, Fle∣bard, Grecisme,</HI> the <HI>doctrinal,</HI> the <HI>parts,</HI> the <HI>quid est,</HI> the <HI>supplementum, Marmoretus de moribus in mensa servandis,</HI> Seneca <HI>de quatu∣or virtutibus cardinalibus,</HI> Passavantus <HI>cum commentar:</HI> and <HI>dormi securè</HI> for the holy days and some other of such like mealie stuffe, by reading whereof he became as wise as any we ever since baked in an Oven.</P>

That it is so, take (said he) any young boy of this time, who hath only studied two yeares, if he have not a better judgement, a better discourse, and that expressed in better termes then your sonne, with a compleater carriage and ci∣vility to all manner of persons, account me for ever hereafter a very clounch, and bacon∣slicer of <HI>Brene.</HI> This pleased <HI>Grangousier</HI> very well, and he commanded that it should be done. At night at supper, the said <HI>Des Marays</HI> brought in a young page of his, of <HI>Ville-gouges,</HI> called <HI>Eudemon,</HI> so neat, so trim, so handsom in his apparel, so spruce, with his haire in so good order, and so sweet and comely in his behaviour, that he had the resemblance of a little Angel more then of a humane creature. Then he said to <HI>Grangou∣sier,</HI> Do you see this young boy▪ he is not as yet full twelve yeares old; let us try (if it please you) what difference there is betwixt the knowledge of the doting <HI>Mateologians</HI> of old time, and the young lads that are now. The trial pleased <HI>Grangousier,</HI> and he com∣manded the Page to begin. Then <HI>Eudemon,</HI>

asking leave of the Vice-King his Master so to do, with his cap in his hand, a clear and open countenance, beautiful and ruddie lips, his eyes steadie, and his looks fixed up∣on <HI>Gargantua,</HI> with a youthful modesty; standing up streight on his feet, began very gracefully to commend him; first for his vertue and good manners; secondly for his knowledge; thirdly for his nobility; fourth∣ly for his bodily accomplishments: and in the fifth place most sweetly exhorted him to reverence his father with all due observancy, who was so careful to have him well brought up; in the end he prayed him, that he would vouchsafe to admit of him amongst the least of his servants; for other favour at that time desired he none of heaven, but that he might do him some grateful and acceptable service: all this was by him delivered with such pro∣per gestures, such distinct pronunciation, so pleasant a delivery, in such exquisite fine termes, and so good <HI>Latine,</HI> that he seemed rather a <HI>Gracchus,</HI> a <HI>Cicero,</HI> an <HI>Aemilius</HI> of the time past, then a youth of this age: but all the countenance that <HI>Gargantua</HI> kept was, that he fell to crying like a Cow, and cast down his face, hiding it with his cap, nor could they possibly draw one word from him, no more then a fart from a dead Asse; whereat his father was so grievously vexed, that he would have killed Master <HI>Jobelin,</HI> but the said, <HI>Des

how it is said, that <HI>Africk</HI> alwayes is productive of some new thing: she was as big as six elephants, and had her feet cloven into fingers, like <HI>Julius Caesars</HI> horse, with slouch-hanging eares, like the goats in <HI>Lan∣guedoc,</HI> and a little horne on her buttock, she was of a burnt sorel hue, with a little mixture of daple gray spots, but above all she had a horrible taile; for it was little more or lesse, then every whit as great as the Steeple-pillar of St. <HI>Mark</HI> beside <HI>Langes▪</HI> and squared as that is, with tuffs and <HI>enni∣croches,</HI> or haire-plaits wrought within one another, no otherwise then as the beards are upon the eares of corne.</P>

This forrest was most horribly fertile and copi∣ous in dorflies, hornets and wasps, so that it was a very Purgatory for the poor mares, asses and horses: But <HI>Gargantua</HI>'s mare did avenge her self handsomly of all the out-ra∣ges therein committed upon beasts of her kinde, and that by a trick whereof they had no suspicion; for assoon as ever they were entred into the said forest, and that the wasps had given the assault, she drew out and un∣sheathed her taile, and therewith skirmish∣ing, did so sweep them, that she overthrew all the wood alongst and athwart, here and there, this way and that way, longwise and sidewise, over and under, and felled every where the wood with as much ease, as a mow∣er doth the grasse, in such sort that never since hath ther been there, neither wood,

In the mean while there came a master begar of the Fryers of S. <HI>Anthonie,</HI> to demand in his cant∣ting way the usual benevolence of some hog∣gish stuffe, who, that he might be heard afar off, and to make the bacon, he was in quest of, shake in the very chimneys, made account to filch them away privily.

left them behinde very honestly, not for that they were too hot, but that they were some∣what too heavy for his carriage. This was not he of <HI>Bourg,</HI> for he was too good a friend of mine.

<P>THe Sophister had no sooner ended, but <HI>Ponocrates</HI> and <HI>Eudemon</HI> burst out in a laughing so heartily, that they had al∣most split with it, and given up the ghost, in rendering their souls to God: even just as <HI>Crassus</HI> did, seeing a lubberly Asse eate thistles; and as <HI>Philemon,</HI> who for seeing an Asse eate those figs which were provided for his own dinner, died with force of laughing: together with them Master <HI>Jonatus</HI> fell a laughing too as fast as he could, in which mood of laughing they continued so long, that their eyes did water by the vehement concussion of the substance of the braine, by which these lachrymal humidities, being prest out, glided through the optick nerves, and so to the full represented <HI>Democritus He∣raclitising,</HI> and <HI>Heraclitus Democritising.</HI> When they had done laughing, <HI>Gargantua</HI> consulted with the prime of his retinue, what should be done. There <HI>Ponocrates</HI> was
<PB N="86" REF="48"/>
of opinion, that they should make this faire Orator drink again, and seeing he had shew∣ed them more pastime, and made them laugh more then a natural soule could have done, that they should give him ten baskets full of sauciges, mentioned in his pleasant speech, with a paire of hose, three hundred great billets of log-wood, five and twenty hogsheads of wine, a good large down-bed, and a deep capacious dish, which he said were necessary for his old age; All this was done as they did appoint: only <HI>Gargantua</HI> doubt∣ing that they could not quickly finde out breeches fit for his wearing, because he knew not what fashion would best become the said Orator, whether the martingal fa∣shion of breeches, wherein is a spunghole with a draw-bridge, for the more easie ca∣guing: or the fashion of the Marriners, for the greater solace and comfort of his kid∣neyes: or that of the <HI>Switsers,</HI> which keeps warm the <HI>bedondaine</HI> or belly-tabret: or round breeches with streat cannions, having in the seat a piece like a Cods taile; all which considered, for feare of over-heating his reines, he caused to be given him seven elles of white cloth for the linings. The wood was carried by the Porters, the Masters of Arts carried the sauciges and the dishes, and Master <HI>Janotus</HI> himself would carry the cloth. One of the said Masters, (called <HI>Jesse

Bandouille,)</HI> shewed him that it was not seemly nor decent for one of his condition to do so, and that therefore he should deli∣ver it to one of them: Ha, said <HI>Janotus, Bau∣det, Baudet,</HI> or Blockhead, Blockhead, thou dost not conclude <HI>in modo &amp; figura;</HI> for loe, to this end serve the suppositions, <HI>&amp; parva Logicalia: pannus, pro quo supponit?

The best was, that when this cougher in a full act or assembly held at the <HI>Mathurins,</HI> had with great confidence required his breeches and sauciges, and that they were flatly denied him, because he had them of <HI>Gargantua,</HI> ac∣cording to the informations thereupon made, he shewed them that this was <HI>gratis,</HI> and out of his liberality, by which they were not in any sort quit of their promises. Not∣withstanding this, it was answered him, that he should be content with reason, without ex∣pectation of any other bribe there. Reason? (said <HI>Janotus,)</HI> we use none of it here, un∣luckie traitors, you are not worth the hang∣ing: the earth beareth not more arrant Vil∣lains then you are, I know it well enough;

Halt not before the lame; I have practised wickednesse with you: by Gods rattle I will inform the King of the enormous abuses that are forged here, and carried underhand by you, and let me be a Leper, if he do not burn you alive like <HI>Sodomites,</HI> Traitors, He∣reticks and Seducers, enemies to God and vertue. Upon these words they framed ar∣ticles against him: he on the other side warned them to appear: In summe, the Processe was retained by the Court, and is there as yet.

what meanes, in so long time, his old Ma∣sters had made him so sottish and ignorant. He disposed therefore of his time in such fa∣shion, that ordinarily he did awake betwixt eight and nine a clock, whether it was day or not, (for so had his ancient governours or∣dained,) alledging that which <HI>David</HI> saith, <HI>Vanum est vobis ante lucem surgere.</HI> Then did he tumble and tosse, wag his legs, and wal∣low in the bed sometime, the better to stirre up, and rouse his vital spirits, and apparel∣led himself according to the season: but willingly he would weare a great long gown of thick freeze, furred with fox-skins. Af∣terwards he combed his head with an <HI>Alman</HI> combe, which is the foure fingers and the thumb: for his <HI>Praeceptor</HI> said, that to comb himself otherwayes, to wash and make him∣self neat, was to lose time in this world. Then he dung'd, pist, spued, belched, crack∣ed, yawned, spitted, coughed, yexed, sneez∣ed and snotted himself like an <HI>Arch-deacon:</HI> and to suppresse the dew and bad aire, went to breakfast, having some good fried tripes, faire rashers on the coales, excellent ga∣mons of bacon, store of fine minced meat, and a great deal of sippet brewis, made up of the fat of the beef-pot, laid upon bread, cheese and chop't pursley strewed together. <HI>Ponocrates</HI> shewed him, that he ought not to eat so soon after rising out of his bed, un∣lesse

he had performed some exercise before∣hand: <HI>Gargantua</HI> answered, What have not I sufficiently well exercised my self?

I am very well after it, and dine but the better: and Master <HI>Tubal,</HI> (who was the first Licenciat at <HI>Paris,)</HI> told me that it was not enough to run apace, but to set forth betimes; so doth not the total welfare of our humanity depend upon per∣petual drinking in a rible rable, like ducks, but on drinking early in the morning: <HI>unde versus,</HI></P>

<P>After that he had throughly broke his fast, he went to Church, and they carried to him in a great basket, a huge <HI>impantousted</HI> or thick-covered breviary, weighing what in grease, clasps, parchment and cover, little more or lesse then eleven hundred and six pounds. There he heard six and twenty or thirty Masses: This while, to the same place
<PB N="92" REF="51"/>
came his orison-mutterer <HI>impaletocked,</HI> or lap't up about the chin, like a tufted whoop, and his breath pretty well antidoted with store of the Vine-tree-sirrup: with him he mumbled all his <HI>Kiriele,</HI> and dunsical brebo∣rions, which he so curiously thumbed and fingered, that there fell not so much as one graine to the ground; as he went from the Church, they brought him upon a Dray drawn with oxen, a confused heap of <HI>Pati∣notres</HI> and <HI>Aves</HI> of <HI>Sante Claude,</HI> every one of them being of the bignesse of a hat∣block; and thus walking through the cloy∣sters, galleries or garden, he said more in turning them over, then sixteen Hermites would have done. Then did he study some paltry half-houre with his eyes fixed upon his book; but (as the Comick saith,) his minde was in the Kitchin. Pissing then a full Urinal, he sate down at table: and be∣cause he was naturally flegmatick, he began his meale with some dozens of gammons, dried neats tongues, hard rowes of mullet, called <HI>Botargos, Andouilles</HI> or sauciges, and such other forerunners of wine; in the mean while, foure of his folks did cast into his mouth one after another continually mu∣stard by whole shovels full. Immediately after that, he drank a horrible draught of white-wine for the ease of his kidneys. When that was done, he ate according to
<PB N="93" REF="51"/>
the season meat agreeable to his appetite, and then left off eating when his belly be∣gan to strout, and was like to crack for ful∣nesse; as for his drinking, he had in that nei∣ther end nor rule; for he was wont to say, that the limits and bounds of drinking were, when the cork of the shoes of him that drinketh, swelleth up half a foot high.</P>

<P>After he had thus well played, reveled, past and spent his time, it was thought fit to
<PB N="98" REF="54"/>
drink a little, and that was eleven glassefuls the man, and immediately after making good cheer again, he would stretch himelf upon a faire bench, or a good large bed, and there sleep two or three houres together, without thinking or speaking any hurt. After he was awakened he would shake his eares a little. In the mean time they brought him fresh wine, there he drank better then ever. <HI>Pono∣crates</HI> shewed him, that it was an ill diet to drink so after sleeping. It is (answered <HI>Gar∣gantua,)</HI> the very life of the Patriarchs and holy Fathers; for naturally I sleepe salt, and my sleep hath been to me in stead of so ma∣ny gamons of bacon. Then began he to study a little, and out came the <HI>patenotres</HI> or rosary of beads: which the better and more formally to dispatch, he got up on an old mule, which had served nine Kings, and so mumbling with his mouth, nodding and dodling his head, would go see a coney fer∣retted or caught in a grinne; At his return he went into the Kitchin, to know what roste meat was on the spit, and what otherwayes was to be drest for supper: and supped very well upon my conscience: and commonly did invite some of his neighbours that were good drinkers, with whom carousing and drinking merrily, they told stories of all sorts from the old to the new. Amongst others, he had for domesticks the Lords of <HI>Fou,</HI> of
<PB N="99" REF="54"/>
<HI>Gourville,</HI> of <HI>Griniot,</HI> and of <HI>Marigny.</HI> After supper were brought in upon the place the faire wooden Gospels, and the books of the foure Kings, that is to say, many paires of tables and cardes: or the faire flusse, one, two, three: or at all to make short work: or else they went to see the wenches there-abouts with little small banquets, intermix∣ed with collations and reer-Suppers.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. <HI>How</HI> Gargantua <HI>was instructed by</HI> Ponocrates, <HI>and in such sort disciplinated, that he lost not one houre of the day.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHen <HI>Ponocrates</HI> knew <HI>Gargantua</HI>'s vicious manner of living, he resol∣ved to bring him up in another kinde; but for a while he bore with him, considering that nature cannot endure a sudden change, without great violence. Therefore to begin his work the better, he requested a learned Physician of that time, called Master <HI>Theo∣dorus,</HI> seriously to perpend (if it were pos∣sible,) how to bring <HI>Gargantua</HI> unto a better course; the said Physician purged him cano∣nically
<PB N="100" REF="55"/>
with <HI>Anticyrian ellebore,</HI> by which medicine he cleansed all the alteration, and perverse habitude of his braine. By this meanes also <HI>Ponocrates</HI> made him forget all that he had learned under his ancient <HI>Praece∣ptors,</HI> as <HI>Timothie</HI> did to his disciples, who had been instructed under other Musicians. To do this the better, they brought him into the company of learned men, which were there, in whose imitation he had a great desire and affection to study otherwayes, and to improve his parts. Afterwards he put himself into such a road and way of studying, that he lost not any one houre in the day, but employed all his time in learning, and honest knowledge. <HI>Gargantua</HI> awaked them about foure a clock in the morning; whilest they were in rubbing of him, there was read unto him some chapter of the holy Scripture aloud and clearly, with a pronunciation fit for the matter, and hereunto was appointed a young page borne in <HI>Basche,</HI> named <HI>Ana∣gnostes,</HI> according to the purpose and argu∣ment of that lesson, he oftentimes gave him∣self to worship, adore, pray, and send up his supplications to that good God, whose Word did shew his majesty and marvellous judgement. Then went he unto the secret places to make excretion of his natural dige∣stions: there his Master repeated what had been read, expounding unto him the most
<PB N="101" REF="55"/>
obscure and difficult points; in returning, they considered the face of the sky, if it was such as they had observed it the night be∣fore, and into what signes the Sun was en∣tering, as also the Moon for that day. This done, he was apparelled, combed, curled, trimmed and perfumed, during which time they repeated to him the lessons of the day before: he himself said them by heart, and upon them would ground some practical ca∣ses concerning the estate of man, which he would prosecute sometimes two or three houres, but ordinarily they ceased assoon as he was fully clothed. Then for three good houres he had a lecture read unto him. This done, they went forth, still conferring of the substance of the lecture, either unto a field near the University called the <HI>Brack,</HI> or unto the medowes where they played at the ball, the long-tennis, and at the <HI>Piletrigone, (which is a play wherein we throw a triangu∣lar piece of iron at a ring, to passe it,)</HI> most gallantly exercising their bodies, as former∣ly they had done their mindes. All their play was but in liberty, for they left off when they pleased, and that was commonly when they did sweat over all their body, or were otherwayes weary. Then were they very well wiped and rubbed, shifted their shirts, and walking soberly, went to see if dinner were ready. Whilest they stayed for that,
<PB N="102" REF="56"/>
they did clearly and eloquently pronounce some sentences that they had retained of the lecture, in the mean time Master Appetite came, and then very orderly sate they down at table; at the beginning of the meale, there was read some pleasant history of the warlike actions of former times, until he had taken a glasse of wine. Then (if they thought good) they continued reading, or began to discourse merrily together; speaking first of the vertue, propriety, efficacy and nature of all that was served in at the table: of bread, of wine, of water, of salt, of fleshes, fishes, fruits, herbs, roots, and of their dres∣sing; by meanes whereof, he learned in a little time all the passages competent for this that were to be found in <HI>Plinie, Athe∣naeus, Dioscorides, Julius Pollux, Galen, Por∣phirie, Oppian, Polybius, Heliodore, Aristotle, Elian,</HI> and others. Whilest they talked of these things, many times to be the more cer∣tain, they caused the very books to be brought to the table, and so well and per∣fectly did he in his memory retain the things abovesaid, that in that time there was not a Physician that knew half so much as he did. Afterwards they conferred of the lessons read in the morning, and ending their repast with some conserve or marmelade of quinces: he pick't his teeth with mastick tooth-pickers; wash't his hands and eyes with faire fresh
<PB N="103" REF="56"/>
water, and gave thanks unto God in some fine Canticks, made in praise of the divine bounty and munificence. This done, they brought in cards, not to play, but to learn a thousand pretty tricks, and new inventions, which were all grounded upon <HI>Arithmetick:</HI> by this meanes he fell in love with that nu∣merical science, and every day after dinner and supper he past his time in it as pleasant∣ly, as he was wont to do at cardes and dice: so that at last he understood so well both the Theory and Practical part thereof; that <HI>Tun∣stal</HI> the <HI>Englishman,</HI> who had written very largely of that purpose, confessed that veri∣ly in comparison of him he had no skill at all. And not only in that, but in the other <HI>Mathematical</HI> Sciences, as <HI>Geometrie, Astro∣nomie, Musick, &amp;c.</HI> for in waiting on the concoction, and attending the digestion of his food, they made a thousand pretty instru∣ments and <HI>Geometrical</HI> figures, &amp; did in some measure practise the <HI>Astronomical</HI> canons.</P>
<P>After this, they recreated themselves with singing <HI>musically,</HI> in foure or five parts, or upon a set theme or ground at random, as it best pleased them; in matter of <HI>musical</HI> in∣struments, he learned to play upon the Lute, the Virginals, the Harp, the Allman Flute with nine holes, the Viol, and the Sackbut. This houre thus spent, and digestion finish∣ed, he did purge his body of natural excre∣ments,
<PB N="104" REF="57"/>
then betook himself to his principal study for three houres together, or more, as well to repeat his matutinal lectures, as to proceed in the book wherein he was, as also to write handsomly, to draw and forme the <HI>Antick</HI> and <HI>Romane</HI> letters. This being done, they went out of their house, and with them a young Gentleman of <HI>Touraine,</HI> named the Esquire <HI>Gymnast,</HI> who taught him the Art of riding; changing then his clothes, he rode a <HI>Naples</HI> courser, a <HI>Dutch</HI> roussin, a <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> gennet, a barded or trapped steed, then a light fleet horse, unto whom he gave a hun∣dred carieres, made him go the high saults, bounding in the aire, free the ditch with a skip, leap over a stile or pale, turne short in a ring both to the right and left hand. There he broke not his lance; for it is the greatest foolery in the world, to say, I have broken ten lances at tilt, or in fight, a Carpenter can do even as much: but it is a glorious and praise-worthy action, with one lance to break and overthrow ten enemies: therefore with a sharp, stiffe, strong and well-steeled lance, would he usually force up a door, pierce a har∣nesse, beat down a tree, carry away the ring, lift up a cuirasier saddle, with the male-coat and gantlet; all this he did in compleat armes from head to foot. As for the prancing flou∣rishes, and smacking popismes, for the bet∣ter cherishing of the horse, commonly used
<PB N="105" REF="57"/>
in riding, none did them better then he. The cavallerize of <HI>Ferrara</HI> was but as an Ape compared to him. He was singularly skilful in leaping nimbly from one horse to another, without putting foot to ground, and these horses were called <HI>desultories:</HI> he could like∣wise from either side, with a lance in his hand, leap on horseback without stirrups, and rule the horse at his pleasure without a bridle, for such things are useful in military engagements. Another day he exercised the battel-axe, which he so dextrously wield∣ed, both in the nimble, strong and smooth management of that weapon, and that in all the feats practiseable by it, that he past Knight of Armes in the field, and at all Es∣sayes. Then tost he the pike, played with the two-handed sword, with the backsword, with the spanish tuck, the dagger, poiniard, armed, unarmed, with a buckler, with a cloak, with a targuet. Then would he hunt the Hart, the Roe-buck, the Beare, the fallow Deer, the wilde Boare, the Hare, the Phesant, the Par∣tridge and the Bustard. He played at the ba∣loon, and made it bound in the aire, both with fist and foot. He wrestled, ran, jump∣ed, not at three steps and a leap <HI>(called the hops,)</HI> nor at <HI>clochepied, (called the Hares leap,)</HI> nor yet at the <HI>Almanes;</HI> for (said <HI>Gymnast,)</HI> these jumps are for the warres altogether unprofitable, and of no use: but at one leap
<PB N="106" REF="58"/>
he would skip over a ditch, spring over a hedge, mount six paces upon a wall, ramp and grapple after this fashion up against a window, of the full height of a lance. He did swim in deep waters on his belly, on his back, sidewise, with all his body, with his feet only, with one hand in the air, wherin he held a book, crossing thus the bredth of the river of <HI>Seine,</HI> without wetting it, and dragged along his cloak with his teeth, as did <HI>Julius Caesar;</HI> then with the help of one hand, he entred forcibly into a boat, from whence he cast himself again headlong into the water, sound∣ed the depths, hollowed the rocks, and plun∣ged into the pits and gulphs. Then turned he the boat about, governed it, led it swiftly or slowly with the stream and against the stream, stopped it in its course, guided it with one hand, and with the other laid hard about him with a huge great Oare, hoised the saile, hied up along the mast by the shrouds, ran upon the edge of the decks, set the com∣passe in order, tackled the boulins, and steer'd the helme. Coming out of the wa∣ter, he ran furiously up against a hill, and with the same alacrity and swiftnesse ran down again; he climbed up at trees like a cat; and leaped from the one to the other like a squirrel; he did pull down the great boughes and branches, like another <HI>Milo;</HI> then with two sharp well-steeled daggers,
<PB N="107" REF="58"/>
and two tried bodkins, would he run up by the wall to the very top of a house like a cat; then suddenly came down from the top to the bottom, with such an even composition of members, that by the fall he would catch no harme.</P>
<P>He did cast the dart, throw the barre, put the stone, practise the javelin, the boar-spear or partisan, and the halbard; he broke the strongest bowes in drawing, bended against his breast the greatest crosse-bowes of steele, took his aime by the eye with the hand-gun, and shot well, traversed and planted the Ca∣non, shot at but-marks, at the papgay from below upwards, <HI>or to a height;</HI> from above downwards, <HI>or to adescent,</HI> then before him, sidewise, and behinde him, like the <HI>Parthi∣ans.</HI> They tied a cable-rope to the top of a high Tower, by one end whereof hanging near the ground, he wrought himself with his hands to the very top: Then upon the same tract came down so sturdily and firme that you could not on a plaine meadow have run with more assurance. They set up a great pole fixed upon two trees, there would he hang by his hands, and with them alone, his feet touching at nothing, would go back and sore along the foresaid rope with so great swiftnesse, that hardly could one over∣take him with running; and then to exer∣cise his breast and lungs, he would shout like
<PB N="108" REF="59"/>
all the Devils in hell; I heard him once call <HI>Eudemon</HI> from St. <HI>Victors</HI> gate to <HI>Monmar∣tre: Stentor</HI> had never such a voyce at the siege of <HI>Troy.</HI> Then for the strengthening of his nerves or sinewes, they made him two great sows of lead, each of them weigh∣ing eight thousand and seven hundred kintals, which they called <HI>Alteres;</HI> those he took up from the ground in each hand one, then lifted them up over his head, and held them so without stirring three quarters of an hour and more, which was an inimitable force; he fought at Barriers with the stout∣est and most vigorous Champions: and when it came to the cope he stood so sturdi∣ly on his feet, that he abandoned himself unto the strongest, in case they could remove him from his place, as <HI>Milo</HI> was wont to do of old; in whose imitation likewise he held a Pomgranat in his hand, to give it unto him that could take it from him: The time be∣ing thus bestowed, and himself rubbed, cleansed, wiped, and refresht with other clothes, he returned fair and softly; and passing through certain meadows, or other grassie places, beheld the trees and plants, comparing them with what is written of them in the books of the Ancients, such as <HI>Theophrast, Dioscorides, Marinus, Plinie, Nicander, Macer,</HI> and <HI>Galen,</HI> and carried home to the house great handfuls of them,
<PB N="109" REF="59"/>
whereof a young Page called <HI>Rizotomos</HI> had charge; together with little Mattocks, Pick∣axes, Grubbing-hooks, Cabbies, Pruning-knives, and other instruments requisite for herborising. Being come to their lodging, whilest supper was making ready, they re∣peated certain passages of that which hath been read, and sate down at table. Here re∣mark, that his dinner was sober and thrifty, for he did then eat only to prevent the gnawings of his stomack, but his supper was copious and large; for he took then as much as was fit to maintaine and nourish him; which indeed is the true diet prescribed by the Art of good and sound <HI>Physick.</HI> Al∣though a rabble of loggerheaded Physicians, nuzzeled in the brabling shop of <HI>Sophisters,</HI> counsel the contrary; during that repast was continued the lesson read at dinner as long as they thought good: the rest was spent in good discourse, learned and profitable. Af∣ter that they had given thanks, he set himself to sing vocally, and play upon harmonious instruments, or otherwayes passed his time at some pretty sports, made with cards or dice; or in practising the feats of <HI>Legerde∣main,</HI> with cups and balls. There they stay∣ed some nights in frolicking thus, and ma∣king themselves merrie till it was time to go to bed; and on other nights they would go make visits unto learned men, or to such as
<PB N="110" REF="60"/>
had been travellers in strange and remote countreys. When it was full night before they retired themselves, they went unto the most open place of the house to see the face of the sky, and there beheld the comets, if a∣ny were, as likewise the figures, situations, aspects, oppositions and conjunctions of the both fixed starres and planets.</P>
<P>Then with his Master did he briefely re∣capitulate after the manner of the <HI>Pythagore∣ans,</HI> that which he had read, seen, learned, done and understood in the whole course of that day.</P>
<P>Then prayed they unto <HI>God</HI> the Creator, in falling down before him, and strength∣ening their faith towards him, and glori∣fying him for his boundlesse bounty, and giving thanks unto him for the time that was past, they recommended themselves to his divine clemency for the future, which being done, they went to bed, and betook themselves to their repose and rest.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. <HI>How</HI> Gargantua <HI>spent his time in rainie weather.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF it happened that the weather were any thing cloudie, foul &amp; rainie, all the forenoon was employed, as before specified, according to custom, with this difference only, that they had a good clear fire lighted, to correct the distempers of the aire: but after dinner, in stead of their wonted exercitations they did abide within, and by way of <HI>Apotherapie,</HI> (that is, <HI>a making the body healthful by exer∣cise,)</HI> did recreate themselves in botteling up of hay, in cleaving and sawing of wood, and in threshing sheaves of corn at the Barn. Then they studied the Art of painting or carving; or brought into use the antick play of tables, as <HI>Leonicus</HI> hath written of it, and as our good friend <HI>Lascaris</HI> playeth at it. In play∣ing they examined the passages of ancient Authors, wherein the said play is mentioned, or any metaphore drawn from it. They went likewise to see the drawing of mettals, or the casting of great ordnance: how the Lapidaries did work, as also the Goldsmiths and Cutters of precious stones: nor did they
<PB N="112" REF="61"/>
omit to visit the Alchymists, money-coin∣ers, Upholsters, Weavers, Velvet-workers, Watchmakers, Looking-glasse-framers, Printers, Organists, and other such kinde of Artificers, and every where giving them somewhat to drink, did learne and consider the industry and invention of the trades. They went also to heare the publick le∣ctures, the solemn commencements, the re∣petitions, the acclamations, the pleadings of the gentle Lawyers, and Sermons of E∣vangelical Preachers. He went through the Halls and places appointed for fencing, and there played against the Masters themselves at all weapons, and shewed them by experi∣ence, that he knew as much in it as (yea more then) they. And instead of her borising, they visited the shops of Druggists, Herbalists and Apothecaries, and diligently considered the fruits, roots, leaves, gums, seeds, the grease and ointments of some forreign parts, as al∣so how they did adulterate them. He went to see the Juglers, Tumblers, Mountebanks and Quacksalvers; and considered their cun∣ning, their shifts, their summer-saults and smooth tongue, especially of those of <HI>Chau∣ny</HI> in <HI>Picardie,</HI> who are naturally great pra∣ters, and brave givers of fibs in matter of green apes. At their return they did eate more soberly at supper then at other times, and meats more desiccative and extenuating;
<PB N="113" REF="61"/>
to the end that the intemperate moisture of the aire, communicated to the body by a necessary confinitie, might by this means be corrected, and that they might not receive any prejudice for want of their ordinary bo∣dily exercise. Thus was <HI>Gargantua</HI> govern∣ed, and kept on in this course of education, from day to day profiting, as you may un∣derstand such a young man of his age may of a pregnant judgement with good disci∣pline well continued. Which although at the beginning it seemed difficult, became a little after so sweet, so easie, and so delight∣ful, that it seemed rather the recreation of a King, then the study of a Scholar. Never∣thelesse <HI>Ponocrates,</HI> to divert him from this vehement intension of the spirits, thought fit once in a month, upon some fair and clear day to go out of the City betimes in the morning, either towards <HI>Gentilly,</HI> or <HI>Boulogne,</HI> or to <HI>Montrouge,</HI> or <HI>Charantou-bridge,</HI> or to <HI>Vanures,</HI> or St. <HI>Clou,</HI> and there spent all the day long in making the greatest chear that could be devised, sporting, making merry, drinking healths, playing, singing, dancing, tumbling in some faire medow, unnestling of sparrowes, taking of quailes, and fishing for frogs and crabs; but although that day was past without books or lecture, yet was it not spent without profit; for in the said medowes they usually repeated certain
<PB N="114" REF="62"/>
pleasant verses of <HI>Virgils</HI> Agriculture, of <HI>Hesiod</HI> and of <HI>Politians</HI> husbandrie, would set a broach some wittie Latine Epigrams, then immediately turned them into round-lays and songs for dancing in the French language. In their feasting, they would som∣times separate the water from the wine that was therewith mixed, as <HI>Cato</HI> teacheth <HI>de re rustica,</HI> and <HI>Plinie</HI> with an ivie cup: would wash the wine in a basin full of water, then take it out again with a funnel as pure as e∣ver. They made the water go from one glasse to another, and contrived a thou∣sand little <HI>automatarie</HI> Engines, that is to say, moving of themselves.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. <HI>How there was great strife and debate, raised betwixt the Cake-bakers of</HI> Lerne, <HI>and those of</HI> Gargantua<HI>'s countrey-whereupon were waged great warres.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AT that time, which was the season of Vintage, in the beginning of Harvest, when the countrey shepherds were set to keep the Vines, and hinder the Starlings from eating up the grapes: as some cake-bakers
<PB N="115" REF="62"/>
of <HI>Lerne</HI> happened to passe along in the broad high way, driving unto the City ten or twelve horses loaded with cakes, the said shepherds courteously intreated them to give them some for their money, as the price then ruled in the market; for here it is to be remarked, that it is a celestial food to eate for breakfast hot fresh cakes with grapes, especially the frail clusters, the great red grapes, the muscadine, the verjuice grape and the luskard, for those that are costive in their belly; because it will make them gush out, and squirt the length of a Hunters staffe, like the very tap of a barrel; and often-times thinking to let a squib, they did all-to-besquatter and conskite themselves, whereupon they are commonly called the Vintage-thinkers. The Bunsellers or Cake-bakers were in nothing inclinable to their request; but (which was worse) did injure them most outragiously, calling them prat∣ling gablers, lickorous gluttons, freckled bit∣tors, mangie rascals, shiteabed scoundrels, drunken roysters, slie knaves, drowsie loi∣terers, slapsauce fellows, slabberdegullion druggels, lubbardly lowts, cosening foxes, ruffian rogues, paultrie customers, syco∣phant-varlets, drawlatch hoydons, flouting milksops, jeering companions, staring clowns, forlorn snakes, ninnie lobcocks, scurvie sneaksbies, fondling fops, base lowns,
<PB N="116" REF="63"/>
sawcie coxcombs, idle lusks, <HI>scoffing Brag∣gards, noddie meacocks, blockish grutnols, dod-di-pol-jolt-heads, jobernol goosecaps, foolish loggerheads, slutch calf-lollies, grouthead gnat∣snappers, lob-dotterels, gaping changelings, codshead loobies, woodcock slangams, ninnie∣hammer flycatchers, noddiepeak simpletons;</HI> Turdie gut, shitten shepherds, and other such like defamatory epithetes, saying fur∣ther, that it was not for them to eate of these dainty cakes, but might very well con∣tent themselves with the course unraung∣ed bread, or to eat of the great brown houshold loaf. To which provoking words, one amongst them, called <HI>Forgier,</HI> (an honest fellow of his person, and a notable springal,) made answer very calmly thus: How long is it since you have got hornes, that you are become so proud? indeed formerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us have any for our money? This is not the part of good neighbours, nei∣ther do we serve you thus when you come hi∣ther to buy our good corn, wherof you make your cakes and buns: besides that, we would have given you to the bargain some of our grapes, but <HI>by his Zounds,</HI> you may chance to repent it, and possibly have need of us at an∣other time, when we shall use you after the like manner, and therefore remember it. Then <HI>Marquet,</HI> a prime man in the confra∣ternity
<PB N="117" REF="63"/>
of the cake-bakers, said unto him, Yea Sir, thou art pretty well crest-risen this morning, thou didst eat yesternight too much millet and bolymoug, come hither <HI>Sirrah,</HI> come hither, I will give thee some cakes: whereupon <HI>Forgier</HI> dreading no harm, in all simplicity went towards him, and drew a sixpence out of his leather sach∣el, thinking that <HI>Market</HI> would have sold him some of his cakes; but in stead of cakes, he gave him with his whip such a rude lash overthwart the legs, that the marks of the whipcord knots were apparent in them; then would have fled away, but <HI>Forgier</HI> cried out as loud as he could, O murther, murther, help, help, help, and in the mean time threw a great cudgel after him, which he carried under his arme, wherewith he hit him in the <HI>coronal</HI> joynt of his head, upon the <HI>crotaphick</HI> arterie of the right side thereof, so forcibly, that <HI>Marquet</HI> fell down from his mare, more like a dead then living man. Mean-while the farmers and countrey-swaines that were watching their walnuts near to that place, came running with their great poles and long staves, and laid such load on these cake-bakers, as if they had been to thresh up∣on green rie. The other shepherds and shepherdesses hearing the lamentable shout of <HI>Forgier,</HI> came with their slings and slack∣ies following them, and throwing great
<PB N="118" REF="64"/>
stones at them, as thick as if it had been haile. At last they overtook them, and took from them about foure or five dosen of their cakes: neverthelesse they payed for them the ordi∣nary price, and gave them over and above one hundred egges, and three baskets full of mulberries. Then did the cake-bakers help to get up to his mare<HI>-Marquet,</HI> who was most shrewdly wounded, and forthwith returned to <HI>Lerne,</HI> changing the resolution they had to go to <HI>Pareille,</HI> threatning very sharp and boistrously the cowherds, shepherds and far∣mers of <HI>Sevile</HI> and <HI>Sinays.</HI> This done, the shepherds and shepherdesses made merry with these cakes and fine grapes, and sport∣ed themselves together at the sound of the pretty small pipe, scoffing and laughing at those vain-glorious cake-bakers, who had that day met with a mischief for want of crossing themselves with a good hand in the morning. Nor did they forget to apply to <HI>Forgiers</HI> leg some faire great red medicinal grapes, and so handsomly drest it and bound it up, that he was quickly cured.</P>

<P>THe Cake-bakers being returned to <HI>Lerne,</HI> went presently, before they did either eat or drink, to the <HI>Capitol,</HI> and there before their King called <HI>Picrochole,</HI> the third of that name; made their complaint, shewing their paniers broken, their caps all crumpled, their coats torn, their cakes taken away, but above all <HI>Marquet</HI> most enormously wound∣ed, saying, that all that mischief was done by the shepherds and herdsmen of <HI>Grangousier,</HI> near the broad high way beyond <HI>Sevile: Pi∣chrocole</HI> incontinent grew angry and furious; and without asking any further what, how, why or wherefore? commanded the <HI>ban</HI> and <HI>arriere ban</HI> to be sounded through out all his countrey, that all his vassals of what con∣dition soever, should upon paine of the hal∣ter come in the best armes they could, unto the great place before the Castle, at the houre of noone, and the better to strengthen

his designe, he caused the drum to be beat about the town. Himself, whilest his dinner was making ready, went to see his artillery mounted upon the carriage, to display his co∣lours, and set up the great royal standard, and loaded waines with store of ammunition both for the field and the belly, armes and victuals: at dinner he dispatch't his com∣missions, and by his expresse Edict my Lord <HI>Shagrag</HI> was appointed to command the Vanguard, wherein were numbered sixteen thousand and fourteen harquebusiers or fire∣locks, together with thirty thousand and eleven Voluntier-adventurers. The great <HI>Touquedillion,</HI> Master of the horse, had the charge of the Ordnance, wherein were reckoned nine hundred and fourteen bra∣zen pieces, in cannons, double cannons, ba∣silisks, <HI>serpentines, culverins,</HI> bombards or murtherers, falcons, <HI>bases</HI> or <HI>passevolans, spiroles</HI> and other sorts of great guns. The Reerguard was committed to the <HI>Duke of Scrapegood:</HI> In the maine battel was the King, and the Princes of his Kingdome. Thus being hastily furnished, before they would set forward, they sent three hundred light horsemen under the conduct of Cap∣tain <HI>Swillwind,</HI> to discover the countrey, clear the avenues, and see whether there was any ambush laid for them: but after they had made diligent search, they found all the
<PB N="121" REF="65"/>
land round about in peace and quiet, with∣out any meeting or convention at all; which <HI>Picrochole</HI> understanding, command∣ed that every one should march speedily un∣der his colours: then immediately in all dis∣order, without keeping either rank or file, they took the fields one amongst another, wasting, spoiling, destroying and making havock of all whereever they went, not spa∣ring poor nor rich, priviledged nor unprivi∣ledged places, Church nor Laity, drove a∣way oxen and cowes, bulls, calves, heifers, wethers, ewes, lambs, goats, kids, hens, capons, chickens, geese, ganders, goslings, hogs, swine, pigs and such like. Beating down the walnuts, plucking the grapes, tear∣ing the hedges, shaking the fruit-trees, and committing such incomparable abuses, that the like abomination was never heard of. Neverthelesse, they met with none to resist them, for every one submitted to their mer∣cy, beseeching them, that they might be dealt with courteously, in regard that they had alwayes carried themselves, as became good and loving neighbours, and that they had never been guilty of any wrong or out∣rage done upon them, to be thus suddenly surprised, troubled and disquieted, and that if they would not desist, God would punish them very shortly; to which expostulations and remonstrances no other answer was

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII. <HI>How a Monk of</HI> Sevile <HI>saved the Closse of the Abbey from being ransacked by the enemie.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SO much they did, and so farre they went pillaging and stealing, that at last they came to <HI>Sevile,</HI> where they robbed both men and women, and took all they could catch: nothing was either too hot or too heavie for them. Although the plague was there in the most part of all the houses, they neverthe∣lesse entered every where; then plundered and carried away all that was within; and yet for all this not one of them took any hurt, which is a most wonderful case. For the Curates, Vicars, Preachers, Physicians, Chirurgions and Apothecaries, who went to visit, to dresse, to cure, to heale, to preach unto, and admonish those that were sick were all dead of the infection; and these devillish robbers and murtherers caught ne∣ver any harme at all. Whence comes this to passe, (my masters) I beseech you think upon it? the town being thus pillaged, they
<PB N="123" REF="66"/>
went unto the Abbey with a horrible noise and tumult, but they found it shut and made fast against them; whereupon the body of the army marched forward towards a passe or ford called the <HI>Sue de vede,</HI> except seven companies of foot, and two hundred lan∣ciers, who staying there, broke down the walls of the Closse, to waste, spoile and make havock of all the Vines and Vintage within that place. The Monks (poor devils) knew not in that extremity to which of all their Sancts they should vow themselves; never∣thelesse, at all adventures they rang the bells <HI>ad capitulum capitulantes:</HI> there it was de∣creed, that they should make a faire Processi∣on, stnssed with good lectures, prayers and letanies, <HI>contra hostium insidias,</HI> and jollie responses <HI>pro pace.</HI></P>
<P>There was then in the Abbey a claustral Monk, called <HI>Freer Ihon</HI> of the funnels and gobbets, in French <HI>des entoumeures,</HI> young, gallant, frisk, lustie, nimble, <HI>quick, active,</HI> bold, adventurous, resolute, tall, lean, wide-mouthed, long-nosed, a faire dispatcher of morning prayers, unbridler of masses, and runner over of vigils: and to conclude sum∣marily in a word, a right Monk, if ever there was any, since the Monking world monked a Monkerie: for the rest a Clerk, even to the teeth in matter of breviary. This Monk hearing the noise that the enemy made with∣in
<PB N="124" REF="67"/>
the inclosure of the Vineyard, went out to see what they were doing; and perceiving that they were cutting and gathering the grapes, whereon was grounded the foun∣dation of all their next yeares wine, return∣ed unto the quire of the Church where the other Monks were, all amazed and astonish∣ed like so many Bell-melters, whom when he heard sing, <HI>im, nim, pe, ne, ne, ne, ne, nene, tum, ne, num, num, ini, i mi, co, o, no, o, o, neno, ne, no, no, no, rum, nenum, num.</HI> It is well shit, well sung, (said he) by the vertue of God, why do not you sing Paniers fare∣well, Vintage is done; The devil snatch me, if they be not already within the middle of our Closse, and cut so well both Vines and Grapes, that <HI>by cods body</HI> there will not be found for these four yeares to come so much as a gleaning in it. <HI>By the belly of Sanct James,</HI> what shall we <HI>(poor devils)</HI> drink the while? Lord God! <HI>da mihi potum.</HI> Then said the Prior of the Covent, What should this drunken fellow do here, let him be carried to prison for troubling the divine service: Nay, said the Monk, the wine service, let us be∣have our selves so, that it be not troubled; for you your self, <HI>my Lord Prior,</HI> love to drink of the best, and so doth every honest man. Never yet did a man of worth dislike good wine, it is a monastical apophthegme. But these responses that you chant here by G.-
<PB N="125" REF="67"/>
are not in season: wherefore is it that our devotions were instituted to be short in the time of Harvest and Vintage, and long in the Advent, and all the winter? The late Friar, <HI>Massepelosse</HI> of good memory, a true zealous man, (or else I give my self to the devil) of our religion, told me, and I re∣member it well, how the reason was, that in this season we might presse and make the wine, and in Winter whiffe it up. Heark you, my masters, you that love the wine, <HI>Cops body</HI> follow me, for <HI>Sanct Antonie</HI> burn me as freely as a fagot, if they get leave to taste one drop of the liquour, that will not now come and fight for relief of the Vine. Hogs belly, the goods of the Church! Ha, no, no: what the devil, <HI>Sanct Thomas</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> was well content to die for them; if I died in the same cause, should not I be a <HI>Sanct</HI> likewise? Yes: yet shall not I die there for all this, for it is I that must do it to o∣thers and send them a packing. As he spake this, he threw off his great Monks habit, and laid hold upon the staffe of the crosse, which was made of the heart of a sorbaple-tree, it being of the length of a lance, round, of a full gripe, and a little poudred with lilies called <HI>flower de luce,</HI> the workmanship whereof was almost all defaced and worn out. Thus went he out in a faire long-skirted jacket, putting his frock scarfewayes athwart his breast, and
<PB N="126" REF="68"/>
in this equipage, with his staffe, shaft or truncheon of the crosse, laid on so lustily, brisk and fiercely upon his enemies, who without any order, or ensigne, or trumpet, or drum, were busied in gathering the grapes of the Vineyard; for the Cornets, Guidons and Ensigne-bearers, had laid down their standards, banners, and colours by the wall∣sides: the Drummers had knock't out the heads of their Drums on one end, to fill them with grapes: The Trumpeters were loaded with great bundles of bunches, and huge knots of clusters: In summe, every one of them was out of aray, and all in dis∣order. He hurried therefore upon them so rudely, without crying <HI>gare</HI> or beware, that he overthrew them like hogs, tumbled them over like swine, striking athwart and alongst, and by one means or other laid so about him, after the old fashion of fencing, that to some he beat out their braines, to others he crush∣ed their armes, battered their legs, and be∣thwacked their sides till their ribs cracked with it; to others again he unjoynted the spondyles <HI>or knuckles of the neck,</HI> disfigured their chaps, gashed their faces, made their cheeks hang flapping on their chin, and so swinged and belammed them, that they fell down before him like hay before a Mower: to some others he spoiled the frame of their kidneys, marred their backs, broke their
<PB N="127" REF="68"/>
thigh-bones, pash't in their noses, poached out their eyes, cleft their mandibules, tore their jaws, dung in their teeth into their throat, shook asunder their omoplates or shoulder-blade, <HI>sphacelated</HI> their shins, mor∣tified their shanks, inflamed their ankles, hea∣ved off of the hinges their ishies, their <HI>scia∣tica</HI> or hip-gout, dislocated the joints of the knees, squattered into pieces the boughts or pestles of their thighs, and so thumped, mawled and belaboured them every where, that never was corne so thick and threefold thresh't upon by Plowmens flailes, as were the pitifully disjoynted members of their mangled bodies, under the mercilesse baton of the crosse. If any offered to hide himself amongst the thickest of the Vines, he laid him squat as a flounder, bruised the ridge of his back, and dash't his reines like a dog. If any thought by flight to escape, he made his head to flie in pieces by the <HI>Lambdoidal com∣missure, which is a seame in the hinder part of the scull.</HI> If any one did scramble up into a tree, thinking there to be safe, he rent up his perinee, and impaled him in at the funda∣ment. If any of his old acquaintance happen∣ed to cry out, Ha <HI>Fryar Ihon</HI> my friend, <HI>Fryar Ihon,</HI> quarter, quarter, I yield my self to you, to you I render my self: So thou shalt (said he) and must whether thou would∣est or no, and withal render and yield up thy

soul to all the devils in hell, then sudden∣ly gave them <HI>Dronos,</HI> that is, so many knocks, thumps, raps, dints, thwacks and bangs, as sufficed to warne <HI>Pluto</HI> of their com∣ing, and dispatch them a going: if any was so rash and full of temerity as to resist him to his face, then was it he did shew the strength of his muscles, for without more ado he did transpierce him, by running him in at the breast, through the mediastine and the heart. Others again he so quashed and bebumped, that with a sound bounce under the hollow of their short ribs, he overturned their sto∣machs so that they died immediately: to some with a smart souse on the <HI>Epigaster,</HI> he would make their midrif swag, then redoub∣ling the blow; gave them such a home-push on the navel, that he made their puddings to gush out. To others through their ballocks he pierced their bum-gut, and left not bow∣el, tripe nor intral in their body, that had not felt the impetuosity, fiercenesse and fu∣ry of his violence. Beleeve that it was the most horrible spectacle that ever one saw: some cried unto <HI>Sanct Barbe,</HI> others to <HI>St. George;</HI> O the holy <HI>Lady Nytouch,</HI> said one, the good Sanctesse; <HI>O our Lady of Succours,</HI> said another, help, help: others cried, Our Lady of <HI>Cunaut,</HI> of <HI>Loretta,</HI> of good tidings on the other side of the water St. <HI>Mary over:</HI> some vowed a pilgrimage to St. <HI>James,</HI> and
<PB N="129" REF="69"/>
others to the holy handkerchief at <HI>Cham∣berrie,</HI> which three moneths after that burnt so well in the fire, that they could not get one thread of it saved: others sent up their vowes to St. <HI>Cadouin;</HI> others to St. <HI>Ihon d' Angelie,</HI> and to St. <HI>Eutropius</HI> of <HI>Xaintes:</HI> o∣thers again invoked St. <HI>Mesmes</HI> of <HI>Chinon,</HI> St. <HI>Martin</HI> of <HI>Candes,</HI> S. <HI>Clouod</HI> of <HI>Sinays,</HI> the holy relicks of <HI>Laurezay,</HI> with a thousand other jolly little Sancts and Santrels: Some died without speaking, others spoke without dy∣ing; some died in speaking, others spoke in dying. Others shouted as loud as they could, Confession, Confession, <HI>Confiteor, miserere, in manus;</HI> so great was the cry of the wound∣ed, that the <HI>Prior</HI> of the Abbey with all his <HI>Monks</HI> came forth, who when they saw these poor wretches so slain amongst the Vines, and wounded to death, confessed some of them: but whilest the Priests were busied in confessing them, the little <HI>Mon∣kies</HI> ran all to the place where <HI>Friar Ihon</HI> was, and asked him, wherein he would be plea∣sed to require their assistance? To which he answered, that they should cut the throats of those he had thrown down upon the ground. They presently leaving their outer habits and cowles upon the railes, began to throttle and make an end of those whom he had al∣ready crushed: Can you tell with what in∣struments they did it? with faire <HI>gullics,</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="70"/>
which are little hulchback't demi-knives, the iron toole whereof is two inches long, and the wooden handle one inch thick, and three inches in length, wherewith the little boyes in our countrey cut ripe walnuts in two, (while they are yet in the shell,) and pick out the kernel, and they found them very fit for the expediting of that wezand-slitting ex∣ploit. In the mean time <HI>Friar Ihon</HI> with his formidable baton of the Crosse, got to the breach which the enemies had made, and there stood to snatch up those that endea∣voured to escape: Some of the <HI>Monkito's</HI> carried the standards, banners, ensignes, gui∣dons and colours into their cells and cham∣bers, to make garters of them. But when those that had been shriven, would have gone out at the gap of the said breach, the sturdy <HI>Monk</HI> quash't and fell'd them down with blowes, saying, These men have had confessi∣on and are penitent soules, they have got their absolution, and gained the pardons: they go into Paradise as streight as a sickle, or as the way is to <HI>Faye, (like Crooked-Lane at Eastcheap.)</HI> Thus by his prowesse and va∣lour were discomfited all those of the army that entred into the Closse of the Abbey, unto the number of thirteen thousand, six hundred, twenty and two, besides the wo∣men and little children, which is alwayes to be understood. Never did <HI>Maugis</HI> the Her∣mite

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII. <HI>How</HI> Picrochole <HI>stormed and took by assault the rock</HI> Clermond, <HI>and of</HI> Grangou∣siers <HI>unwillingnesse and aversion from the undertaking of warre.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHilest the Monk did thus skirmish, as we have said, against those which were entred within the Closse; <HI>Picrochole</HI> in great haste passed the ford of <HI>Vede,</HI> (a ve∣ry especial passe) with all his souldierie, and set upon the rock <HI>Clermond,</HI> where there was made him no resistance at all: and be∣cause it was already night, he resolved to quarter himself and his army in that town, and to refresh himself of his pugnative cho∣ler. In the morning he stormed and took the Bulwarks and Castle, which afterwards he fortified with rampiers, and furnished with all ammunition requisite, intending to
<PB N="132" REF="71"/>
make his retreat there, if he should happen to be otherwise worsted; for it was a strong place, both by Art and Nature, in regard of the stance and situation of it. But let us leave them there, and return to our good <HI>Gargantua,</HI> who is at <HI>Paris</HI> very assiduous and earnest at the study of good letters, and ath∣letical exercitations, and to the good old man <HI>Grangousier</HI> his father, who after supper warmeth his ballocks by a good, clear, great fire, and waiting upon the broyling of some chestnuts, is very serious in drawing scratches on the hearth, with a stick burnt at the one end, wherewith they did stirre up the fire, telling to his wife and the rest of the family pleasant old stories and tales of for∣mer times. Whilest he was thus employed, one of the shepherds which did keep the Vines, (named <HI>Pillot)</HI> came towards him, and to the full related the enormous abuses which were committed, and the excessive spoil that was made by <HI>Picrochole</HI> King of <HI>Lerne,</HI> upon his lands and territories, and how he had pillaged, wasted and ransacked all the coun∣trey, except the inclosure at <HI>Sevile,</HI> which Friar <HI>Ihon des entoumeures</HI> to his great ho∣nour had preserved: and that at the same present time the said King was in the rock <HI>Clermond:</HI> and there with great industry and circumspection, was strengthening himself and his whole army. <HI>Halas, halas, alas,</HI> (said
<PB N="133" REF="71"/>
<HI>Grangousier,)</HI> what is this good people? do I dream, or is it true that they tell me? <HI>Picro∣chole</HI> my ancient friend of old time, of my own kinred and alliance, comes he to in∣vade me? what moves him? what provokes him? what sets him on? what drives him to it? who hath given him this counsel? <HI>Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,</HI> my God, my Saviour, help me, inspire me, and advise me what I shall do. I protest, I swear before thee, so be thou fa∣vourable to me, if ever I did him or his sub∣jects any damage or displeasure, or commit∣ted any the least robbery in his countrey; but on the contrary I have succoured and supplied him with men, money, friendship and counsel upon any occasion, wherein I could be steadable for the improvement of his good; that he hath therefore at this nick of time so outraged and wronged me, it cannot be but by the malevolent and wicked spirit. Good God, thou knowest my courage, for nothing can be hidden from thee; if perhaps he be grown mad, and that thou hast sent him hither to me for the bet∣ter recovery &amp; re-establishment of his brain: grant me power and wisdome to bring him to the yoke of thy holy will by good disci∣pline. <HI>Ho, ho, ho, ho,</HI> my good people, my friends and my faithful servants, must I hin∣der you from helping me? alas, my old age required henceforward nothing else but
<PB N="134" REF="72"/>
rest, and all the dayes of my life I have la∣boured for nothing so much as peace: but now I must (I see it well) load with armes my poor, weary and feeble shoulders; and take in my trembling hand the lance and horse∣mans mace, to succour and protect my ho∣nest subjects: reason will have it so; for by their labour am I entertained, and with their sweat am I nourished, I, my children and my family. This notwithstanding, I will not undertake warre, until I have first tried all the wayes and meanes of peace, that I resolve upon. Then assembled he his counsel, and proposed the matter as it was indeed, whereupon it was concluded, that they should send some discreet man unto <HI>Picrochole,</HI> to know wherefore he had thus suddenly broken the Peace, and invaded those lands unto which he had no right nor title. Furthermore, that they should send for <HI>Gargantua,</HI> and those under his command, for the preservation of the countrey, and defence thereof now at need. All this plea∣sed <HI>Grangousier</HI> very well, and commanded that so it should be done. Presently there∣fore he sent the <HI>Basque</HI> his Lackey, to fetch <HI>Gargantua</HI> with all diligence, and wrote to him as followeth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. <HI>The tenor of the letter which</HI> Grangousier <HI>wrote to his sonne</HI> Gargantua.</HEAD>
<P>THe fervency of thy studies did require, that I should not in a long time recall thee from that Philosophical rest thou now enjoyest: if the confidence reposed in our friends and ancient confederates had not at this present disappointed the assurance of my old age: But seeing such is my fatal destiny, that I should be now disquieted by those in whom I trusted most: I am forced to call thee back to help the people and goods, which by the right of nature belong unto thee; for even as armes are weak abroad if there be not counsel at home: so is that stu∣dy vaine, and counsel unprofitable, which in a due and convenient time is not by ver∣tue executed and put in effect. My delibe∣ration is not to provoke, but to appease: not to assault, but to defend: not to con∣quer, but to preserve my faithful subjects and hereditary dominions: into which <HI>Pi∣crochole</HI> is entred in a hostile manner without any ground or cause, and from day to day pursueth his furious enterprise with that
<PB N="136" REF="73"/>
height of insolence that is intolerable to free-born spirits. I have endeavoured to moderate his tyrannical <HI>choler,</HI> offering him all that which I thought might give him sa∣tisfaction: and oftentimes have I sent lo∣vingly unto him, to understand wherein, by whom, and how he found himself to be wronged? but of him could I obtain no o∣ther answer, but a meer defiance, and that in my lands he did pretend only to the right of a civil correspondency and good behavi∣our, whereby I knew that the eternal God hath left him to the disposure of his own free will and sensual appetite, which cannot chuse but be wicked, if by divine grace it be not continually guided: and to contain him within his duty, and bring him to know himself, hath sent him hither to me by a grievous token. Therefore, my beloved son, as soon as thou canst, upon sight of these let∣ters, repaire hither with all diligence, to suc∣cour not me so much (which neverthelesse by natural Piety thou oughtest to do,) as thine own People, which by reason thou mayest save and preserve. The exploit shall be done with as little effusion of blood as may be; and if possible, by meanes far more expedient, such as military policy, devices and stratagems of warre; we shall save all the souls, and send them home as merry as crick∣ets unto their own houses. My dearest Son,

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX. <HI>How</HI> Ulrich Gallet <HI>was sent unto</HI> Picrochole.</HEAD>
<P>THe letters being dictated, signed and sealed, <HI>Grangousier</HI> ordained that <HI>Ul∣rich Gallet,</HI> Master of the requests (a very wise and discreet man, of whose prudence and sound judgement he had made trial in several difficult and debateful matters) to go unto <HI>Picrochole,</HI> to shew what had been de∣creed amongst them. At the same houre departed the good man <HI>Gallet,</HI> and having past the ford, asked at the Miller that dwelt there, in what condition <HI>Picrochole</HI> was: who answered him, that his souldiers had left him neither cock nor hen, that they were retired and shut up into the rock <HI>Clermond,</HI> and that he would not advise him to go any further for feare of the Scouts, because they were enormously furious; which he easily beleeved, and therefore lodged that night
<PB N="138" REF="74"/>
with the Miller. The next morning he went with a Trumpeter to the gate of the Castle, and required the guards he might be admit∣ted to speak with the King of somewhat that concerned him. These words being told un∣to the King, he would by no means consent that they should open the gate; but getting upon the top of the bulwark, said unto the Ambassadour, What is the newes? what have you to say? then the Ambassadour began to speak as followeth.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI. <HI>The speech made by</HI> Gallet <HI>to</HI> Picrochole.</HEAD>
<P>THere cannot arise amongst men a juster cause of grief, then when they receive hurt and damage, where they may justly expect for favour and good will; and not without cause, (though without reason,) have many, after they had fallen into such a calamitous accident, esteemed this indigni∣ty lesse supportable then the losse of their own lives, in such sort, that if they have not been able by force of armes, nor any other means, by reach of wit or subtilty, to stop them in their course, and restrain their fury, they have fallen into desparation, and utterly
<PB N="139" REF="74"/>
deprived themselves of this light. It is therefore no wonder if King <HI>Grangousier</HI> my Master be full of high displeasure, and much disquieted in minde upon thy outragious and hostile coming: but truly it would bea mar∣vel, if he were not sensible of, and moved with the incomparable abuses and injuries perpetrated by thee and thine upon those of his countrey, towards whom there hath been no example of inhumanity omitted; which in it self is to him so grievous for the cordial affection, wherewith he hath alwayes che∣rished his subjects, that more it cannot be to any mortal man; yet in this (above humane apprehension) is it to him the more grievous, that these wrongs and sad offences have been committed by thee and thine, who time out of minde from all antiquity, thou and thy Predecessors have been in a continual league and amity with him, and all his Ancestors; which, even until this time, you have as sa∣cred together inviolably preserved, kept and entertained, so well, that not he and his on∣ly, but the very barbarous Nations of the <HI>Poictevins, Bretons, Manceaux,</HI> and those that dwell beyond the isles of the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and that of <HI>Isabella,</HI> have thought it as easie to pull down the firmament, and to set up the depths above the clouds, as to make a breach in your alliance; and have been so afraid of it in their enterprises, that they have never
<PB N="140" REF="75"/>
dared to provoke, incense or indamage the one for feare of the other. Nay, which is more, this sacred league hath so filled the world, that there are few Nations at this day inhabiting throughout all the continent and isles of the Ocean, who have not ambiti∣ously aspired to be received into it, upon your own covenants and conditions, hold∣ing your joynt confederacie in as high e∣steem as their own territories and domini∣ons; in such sort, that from the memory of man, there hath not been either Prince or league so wilde and proud, that durst have offered to invade, I say not your countreys, but not so much as those of your confede∣rates: and if by rash and headie counsel they have attempted any new designe against them, assoon as they heard the name and title of your alliance, they have suddenly desisted from their enterprises. What rage and madnesse therefore doth now incite thee, all old alliance infringed, all amity trod under foot, and all right violated, thus in a hostil manner to invade his countrey, with∣out having been by him or his in any thing prejudiced, wronged or provoked? where is faith? where is law? where is reason? where is humanity? where is the feare of God? dost thou think that these atrocious abuses are hidden from the eternal spirits, and the supreme God, who is the just re∣warder
<PB N="141" REF="75"/>
of all our undertakings? if thou so think, thou deceivest thy self; for all things shall come to passe, as in his incomprehen∣sible judgement he hath appointed. Is it thy fatal destiny, or influences of the stars that would put an end to thy so long enjoyed ease and rest? for that all things have their end and period, so as that when they are come to the superlative point of their great∣est height, they are in a trice tumbled down again, as not being able to abide long in that state. This is the conclusion and end of those who cannot by reason and temperance moderate their fortunes and prosperities. But if it be predestinated that thy happi∣nesse and ease must now come to an end, must it needs be by wronging my King? him by whom thou wert established? If thy house must come to ruine, should it there∣fore in its fall crush the heels of him that set it up? The matter is so unreasonable, and so dissonant from common sense, that hard∣ly can it be conceived by humane under∣standing, and altogether incredible unto strangers, till by the certain and undoubted effects thereof it be made apparent, that no∣thing is either sacred or holy to those, who having emancipated themselves from God and reason, do meerly follow the perverse affections of their own depraved nature. If any wrong had been done by us to thy sub∣jects
<PB N="142" REF="76"/>
and dominions: if we had favoured thy ill-willers: if we had not assisted thee in thy need: if thy name and reputation had been wounded by us: or (to speak more truly) if the calumniating spirit, tempting to induce thee to evil, had by false illusions and de∣ceitful fantasies, put into thy conceit the im∣pression of a thought, that we had done un∣to thee any thing unworthy of our ancient correspondence and friendship, thou ought∣est first to have enquired out the truth, and afterwards by a seasonable warning to ad∣monish us thereof; and we should have so sa∣tisfied thee, according to thine own hearts desire, that thou shouldest have had occasi∣on to be contented. But, O eternal God, what is thy enterprise? wouldest thou like a perfidious tyrant, thus spoile and lay waste my Masters Kingdome? hast thou found him so silly and blockish, that he would not: or so destitute of men and mo∣ney, of counsel and skill in military disci∣pline, that he cannot withstand thy unjust in∣vasion? March hence presently, and to mor∣row some time of the day retreat unto thine own conntrey, without doing any kinde of violence or disorderly act by the way: and pay withal a thousand <HI>besans of gold,</HI> (which in <HI>English</HI> money, amounteth to five thou∣sand pounds) for reparation of the damages thou hast done in his countrey: halfe thou

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII. <HI>How</HI> Grangousier <HI>to buy Peace, caused the Cakes to be restored.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WIth that the good man <HI>Gallet</HI> held his peace, but <HI>Picrochole</HI> to all his discourse answered nothing but Come and fetch them, come and fetch them: they have ballocks faire and soft, they will knead and provide some cakes for you. Then re∣turned he to <HI>Grangousier,</HI> whom he found up∣on his knees bare-headed, crouching in a little corner of his cabinet, and humbly pray∣ing unto God, that he would vouchsafe to asswage the choler of <HI>Picrochole,</HI> and bring him to the rule of reason without proceed∣ing by force. When the good man came back, he asked him, Ha, my friend, my friend, what newes do you bring me? There is neither hope nor remedy, (said <HI>Gallet)</HI> the man is quite out of his wits, and forsaken of
<PB N="144" REF="77"/>
God. Yea but (said <HI>Grangousier,)</HI> my friend, what cause doth he pretend for his outrages? He did not shew me any cause at all (said <HI>Gallet,)</HI> only that in a great anger, he spoke some words of cakes. I cannot tell if they have done any wrong to his Cake-bakers. I will know (said <HI>Grangousier,)</HI> the matter throughly, before I resolve any more upon what is to be done; then sent he to learn con∣cerning that businesse, and found by true in∣formation, that his men had taken violent∣ly some cakes from <HI>Picrocholes</HI> people, and that <HI>Marquets</HI> head was broken with a <HI>slackie</HI> or short cudgel: that neverthelesse all was well paid, and that the said <HI>Marquet</HI> had first hurt <HI>Forgier</HI> with a stroke of his whip a∣thwart the legs; and it seemed good to his whole counsel, that he should defend himself with all his might. Notwithstanding all this (said <HI>Grangousier,)</HI> seeing the question is but about a few cakes, I will labour to content him; for I am very unwilling to wage warre against him. He enquired then what quan∣tity of cakes they had taken away, and un∣derstanding that it was but some foure or five dozen, he commanded five cart-loads of them to be baked that same night: and that there should be one full of cakes made with fine butter, fine yolks of egges, fine saffron and fine spice, to be bestowed upon <HI>Marquet,</HI> unto whom likewise he directed to be given
<PB N="145" REF="77"/>
seven hundred thousand and three <HI>Philips,</HI> (that is, at three shillings the piece, one hun∣dred five thousand pounds and nine shillings of <HI>English</HI> money) for reparation of his losses and hinderances, and for satisfaction of the Chirurgion that had dressed his wound: and furthermore setled upon him and his for ever in freehold the Apple-Orchard cal∣led <HI>La Pomardiere;</HI> for the conveyance and passing of all which was sent <HI>Gallet,</HI> who by the way as they went made them gather near the willow-trees great store of boughs, canes and reeds, wherewith all the Cariers were injoyned to garnish and deck their carts, and each of them tocarry one in his hand, as himself likewise did, thereby to give all men to understand that they demanded but Peace, and that they came to buy it.</P>
<P>Being come to the gate, they required to speak with <HI>Picrochole</HI> from <HI>Grangousier. Picro∣chole</HI> would not so much as let them in, nor go to speak with them, but sent them word that he was busie, and that they should de∣liver their minde to Captain <HI>Touquedillon,</HI> who was then planting a piece of Ordnance upon the wall. Then said the good man un∣to him, <HI>My Lord,</HI> to ease you of all this la∣bour, and to take away all excuses why you may not return unto our former alliance, we do here presently restore unto you the Cakes upon which the quarrel arose: five
<PB N="146" REF="78"/>
dozen did our people take away, they were well payed for; we love Peace so well, that we restore unto you five cartloads, of which this cart shall be for <HI>Marquet,</HI> who doth most complain; besides, to content him en∣tirely, here are seven hundred thousand and three <HI>Philips,</HI> which I deliver to him: and for the losses he may pretend to have sustain∣ed, I resigne for ever the farme of the <HI>Po∣mardiere,</HI> to be possessed in fee-simple by him and his for ever, without the payment of any duty, or acknowledgement of ho∣mage, fealtie, fine or service whatsoever: and here is the tenor of the deed, and for Gods sake let us live henceforward in Peace, and withdraw your selves merrily into your own countrey from within this place, unto which you have no right at all, as your selves must needs confesse, and let us be good friends as before. <HI>Touquedillon</HI> related all this to <HI>Picrochole,</HI> and more and more ex∣asperated his courage, saying to him, These clowns are afraid to some purpose: by G<HI>—Grangousier</HI> conskites himself for feare; the poor drinker he is not skilled in warfare, nor hath he any stomach for it, he knows better how to empty the flaggons, that is his Art. I am of opinion that it is fit we send back the carts and the money; and for the rest, that very speedily we fortifie our selves here, then prosecute our fortune. But what do
<PB N="147" REF="78"/>
they think to have to do with a <HI>ninnie-whoop,</HI> to feed you thus with cakes? You may see what it is; the good usage, and great famili∣arity which you have had with them hereto∣fore, hath made you contemptible in their eyes. <HI>Anoint a villain, he will prick you: prick a villain, and he will anoint you:</HI> Sa, sa, sa, (said <HI>Picrochole,)</HI> by St. <HI>James</HI> you have <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ungentem pungit. pungentem rusticus ungit.</NOTE> given a true character of them. One thing I will advise you (said <HI>Touquedillon,)</HI> we are here but badly victualled, and furnished with mouth-harnasse very slenderly: if <HI>Gran∣gousier</HI> should come to besiege us, I would go presently, and pluck out of all your soul∣diers heads and mine own all the teeth ex∣cept three to each of us, and with them alone we should make an end of our provision, but too soon we shall have (said <HI>Picrochole,)</HI> but too much sustenance and feeding-stuffe: came we hither to eat or to fight? To fight indeed (said <HI>Touquedillon,)</HI> yet from the panch comes the dance, and where famine rules force is exiled. Leave off your prating (said <HI>Picrochole,)</HI> and forthwith seize upon what they have brought. Then took they money and cakes, oxen and carts, and sent them away without speaking one word, on∣ly that they would come no more so near, for a reason that they would give them the morrow after. Thus without doing any thing, returned they to <HI>Grangousier,</HI> and re∣lated
<PB N="148" REF="79"/>
the whole matter unto him, subjoyn∣ing that there was no hope left to draw them to Peace, but by sharp and fierce warres.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV. <HI>How</HI> Gargantua <HI>left the City of</HI> Paris, <HI>to suc∣cour his countrey, and how</HI> Gymnast <HI>en∣countered with the enemy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN this same very houre <HI>Gargantua,</HI> who was gone out of <HI>Paris,</HI> assoon as he had read his fathers letters, coming upon his great mare had already past the Nunnerie-bridge himself, <HI>Ponocrates, Gymnast</HI> and <HI>Eu∣demon,</HI> who all three, the better to inable them to go along with him took Post-hor∣ses: the rest of his traine came after him by even journeys at a slower pace, bringing with them all his books and Philosophical in∣struments; assoon as he had alighted at <HI>Pa∣rille,</HI> he was informed by a farmer of <HI>Gouget,</HI> how <HI>Picrochole</HI> had fortified himself within the rock <HI>Clermond,</HI> and had sent Captain <HI>Tripet</HI> with a great army to set upon the wood of <HI>Vede</HI> and <HI>Vaugaudry,</HI> and that they had already plundered the whole countrey, not leaving cock nor hen, even as farre as to the wine-presse of <HI>Billiard.</HI> These strange and almost incredible newes of the enormous abuses, thus committed over all the land, so affrighted <HI>Gargantua,</HI> that he knew not what
<PB N="156" REF="83"/>
to say nor do: but <HI>Ponocrates</HI> counselled him to go unto the Lord of <HI>Vauguyon,</HI> who at all times had been their friend and confede∣rate, and that by him they should be better advised in their businesse: which they did in∣continently, and found him very willing, and fully resolved to assist them, and there∣fore was of opinion, that they should send some one of his company, to scout along and discover the countrey, to learn in what condition and posture the enemy was, that they might take counsel, and proceed accord∣ing to the present occasion. <HI>Gymnast</HI> offer∣ed himself to go; whereupon it was conclu∣ded, that for his safety, and the better expe∣dition, he should have with him some one that knew the wayes, avenues, turnings, windings and rivers thereabout. Then away went he and <HI>Prelingot,</HI> (the Querry or Gentleman of <HI>Vauguyons</HI> horse,) who scout∣ed and espied as narrowly as they could up∣on all quarters without any feare. In the mean time <HI>Gargantua</HI> took a little refresh∣ment, ate somewhat himself, the like did those who were with him, and caused to give to his mare a <HI>Picotine</HI> of Oats, that is, three∣score and fourteen quarters and three bush∣els. <HI>Gymnast</HI> and his Camerade rode so long, that at last they met with the enemies forces, all scattered and out of order, plundering, stealing, robbing and pillaging all they could
<PB N="157" REF="83"/>
lay their hands on: and as far off as they could perceive him, they ran thronging upon the back of one another in all haste towards him, to unload him of his money, and untrusse his Portmantles. Then cried he out unto them, (My Masters,) I am a poor devil, I desire you to spare me, I have yet one Crown left, come, we must drink it; for it is <HI>aurum po∣tabile,</HI> and this horse here shall be sold to pay my welcome: afterwards take me for one of your own; for never yet was there any man that knew better how to take, lard, rost and dresse, yea by G—to teare asunder and devoure a hen, then I that am here: and for my <HI>Proficiat</HI> I drink to all good fellowes. With that he unscrued his <HI>Borracho,</HI> (which was a great <HI>dutch</HI> leathern bottle,) and with∣out putting in his nose drank very honestly: the <HI>marousle</HI> Rogues looked upon him, open∣ing their throats a foot wide, and putting out their tongues like Greyhounds, in hopes to drink after him: but Captain <HI>Tripet,</HI> in the very nick of that their expectation, came running to him to see who it was. To him <HI>Gymnast</HI> offered his bottle, saying, Hold, Captain, drink boldly and spare not; I have been thy taster, it is wine of <HI>La fay monjau.</HI> What? (said <HI>Tripet)</HI> this fellow gybes and flowts us; Who art thou? (said <HI>Tripet)</HI> I am (said <HI>Gymnast)</HI> a poor devil, <HI>(pauvre diable:)</HI> Ha, (said <HI>Tripet)</HI> seeing thou art a poor de∣vil,

it is reason that thou shouldest be per∣mitted to go whithersoever thou wilt, for all poor devils passe every where without toll or taxe; but it is not the custome of poor devils to be so wel mounted, therfore, Sir de∣vil, come down, and let me have your horse, and if he do not carry me well, you, Master devil, must do it; for I love a life that such a devil as you should carry me away.</P>

<P>WHen they heard these words, some amongst them began to be afraid, and blest themselves with both hands, think∣ing indeed that he had been a devil disguised: insomuch that one of them, named <HI>good Ihon,</HI> Captain of the trained bands of the Countrey bumpkins, took his Psalter out of his Codpiece, and cried out aloud, <HI>Hagios ho theos.</HI> If thou be of God speak: if thou be of the other spirit avoid hence, and get thee going: yet he went not away; which words being heard by all the souldiers that were there, divers of them being a little inwardly
<PB N="159" REF="84"/>
terrified, departed from the place: all this did <HI>Gymnast</HI> very well remark and consider, and therefore making as if he would have alighted from off his horse, as he was poy∣sing himself on the mounting side, he most nimbly (with his short sword by his thigh,) shifting his feet in the stirrup, performed the stirrup-leather feat, whereby after the incli∣ning of his body downwards, he forthwith lanch't himself aloft in the aire, and placed both his feet together on the saddle, stand∣ing upright with his back turned towards the horses head; Now (said he) my case goes backward. Then suddenly in the same ve∣ry posture wherein he was, he fetched a gam∣bole upon one foot, and turning to the left hand, failed not to carry his body perfectly round, just into its former stance, without missing one jot. Ha (said <HI>Tripet,)</HI> I will not do that at this time, and not without cause. Well, (said <HI>Gymnast)</HI> I have failed, I will undo this leap: then with a marvellous strength and agility, turning towards the right hand he fetch't another frisking gambole, as before, which done, he set his right hand thumb upon the hinde bowe of the saddle, raised himself up, and sprung in the aire, poysing and upholding his whole body, upon the muscle and nerve of the said thumb: and so turned and whirled himself about three times: at the fourth re∣versing
<PB N="160" REF="85"/>
his body, and overturning it upside down, and foreside back, without touching any thing he brought himself betwixt the horses two eares, springing with all his body into the aire, upon the thumb of his left hand, and in that posture turning like a windmill, did most actively do that trick which is called the Millers Passe. After this, clapping his right hand flat upon the middle of the saddle, he gave himself such a jerking swing, that he thereby seated himself upon the crupper, after the manner of Gentle∣womens sitting on horseback: this done, he easily past his right leg over the saddle, and placed himself like one that rides in croup: But, said he, it were better for me to get in∣to the saddle; then putting the thumbs of both hands upon the crupper before him, and thereupon leaning himself, as upon the only supporters of his body, he incontinent∣ly turned heels over head in the aire, and streight found himself betwixt the bowe of the saddle in a good settlement. Then with a <HI>summer-sault</HI> springing into the aire again, he fell to stand with both his feet close toge∣ther upon the saddle, and there made above a hundred frisks, turnes and demi-pom∣mads, with his armes held out acrosse, and in so doing, cried out aloud, I rage, I rage, devils, I am stark mad; devils, I am mad, hold me, devils, hold me, hold, devils, hold, hold.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="85"/>
Whilest he was thus vaulting, the Rogues in great astonishment said to one another, By cocks death he is a goblin or a devil thus dis∣guised, <HI>Ab hoste maligno libera nos, Domine,</HI> and ran away in a ful flight, as if they had been routed, looking now and then behinde them like a dog that carrieth away a goose-wing in his mouth. Then <HI>Gymnast</HI> spying his ad∣vantage, alighted from his horse, drew his sword, &amp; laid on great blows upon the thick∣est, and highest-crested amongst them, and overthrew them in great heaps, hurt, wound∣ed and bruised, being resisted by no body, they thinking he had been a starved devil, as well in regard of his wonderful feats in vaulting, which they had seen, as for the talk <HI>Tripet</HI> had with him, calling him poor devil: only <HI>Tripet</HI> would have traiterously cleft his head with his horsemans sword, or lanse-knight fauchion; but he was well armed, and felt nothing of the blow, but the weight of the stroke; whereupon turning suddenly about, he gave <HI>Tripet</HI> a home-thrust, and up∣on the back of that, whilest he was about to¦ward his head from a flash, he in ran him at the breast with a hit, which at once cut his sto∣mack, the fifth gut called the <HI>Colon;</HI> and the half of his liver, wherewith he fell to the ground, and in falling gushed forth above foure pottles of pottage, and his soule ming∣led with the pottage.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="86"/>
This done, <HI>Gymnast</HI> withdrew himself, very wisely considering, that a case of great adventure and hazard, should not be pursu∣ed unto its utmost period, and that it be∣comes all Cavaliers modestly to use their good fortune, without troubling or stretch∣ing it too farre; wherefore getting to horse, he gave him the spurre, taking the right way unto <HI>Vauguyon,</HI> and <HI>Prelingot</HI> with him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI. <HI>How</HI> Gargantua <HI>demolished the Castle at the Ford of</HI> Vede, <HI>and how they past the Ford.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS soon as he came, he related the estate and condition wherein they had found the enemie, and the stratagem which he a∣lone had used against all their multitude, af∣firming that they were but rascally rogues, plunderers, thieves and robbers, ignorant of all military discipline, and that they might boldly set forward unto the field; it being an easie matter to fell and strike them down like beasts. Then <HI>Gargantua</HI> mounted his great Mare, accompanied as we have said be∣fore, and finding in his way a high and great tree, (which commonly was called by the
<PB N="163" REF="86"/>
name of St. <HI>Martins</HI> tree, because heretofore St. <HI>Martin</HI> planted a Pilgrims staffe there, which in tract of time grew to that height and greatnesse,) said, This is that which I lacked; this tree shall serve me both for a staffe and lance: with that he pulled it up easily, pluck∣ed off the boughs, and trimmed it at his pleasure: in the mean time his Mare pissed to ease her belly, but it was in such abun∣dance, that it did overflow the countrey seven leagues, and all the pisse of that Uri∣nal flood, ran glib away towards the Ford of <HI>Vede,</HI> wherewith the water was so swollen, that all the Forces the enemy had there, were with great horrour drowned, except some who had taken the way on the left hand to∣wards the hills. <HI>Gargantua</HI> being come to the place of the wood of <HI>Vede,</HI> was informed by <HI>Eudemon,</HI> that there was some remainder of the enemy within the Castle, which to know, <HI>Gargantua</HI> cried out as loud as he was able, Are you there, or are you not there? if you be there, be there no more; and if you be not there, I have no more to say. But a ruffian gunner, whose charge was to attend the Portcullis over the gate, let flie a can∣non-ball at him, and hit him with that shot most furiously on the right temple of his head, yet did him no more hurt, then if he had but cast a prune or kernel of a wine-grape at him: What is this? (said <HI>Gargantua)</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="87"/>
do you throw at us grape-kernels here? the Vintage shall cost you dear, thinking indeed that the bullet had been the kernel of a grape, or raisin-kernel.</P>
<P>Those who were within the Castle, being till then busie at the pillage, when they heard this noise, ran to the towers and for∣tresses, from whence they shot at him above nine thousand and five and twenty falcon∣shot and harcabusades, aiming all at his head, and so thick did they shoot at him, that he cried out, <HI>Ponocrates</HI> my friend, these flies here are like to put out mine eyes, give me a branch of those willow-trees to drive them away, thinking that the bullets and stones shot out of the great ordnance had been but dunflies. <HI>Ponocrates</HI> looked and saw that there were no other flies, but great shot which they had shot from the Castle. Then was it that he, rusht with his great tree a∣gainst the Castle, and with mighty blowes overthrew both towers and fortresses, and laid all level with the ground, by which meanes all that were within were slaine and broken in pieces. Going from thence, they came to the bridge at the Mill, where they found all the Ford covered with dead bo∣dies, so thick, that they had choaked up the Mill, and stopped the current of its water, and these were those that were destroyed in the Urinal deluge of the Mare. There they
<PB N="165" REF="87"/>
were at a stand, consulting how they might passe without hinderance by these dead car∣casses. But <HI>Gymnast</HI> said, If the devils have past there, I will passe well enough. The de∣vils have past there (said <HI>Eudemon,)</HI> to carry away the damned soules. By St. <HI>Rhenian</HI> (said <HI>Ponocrates,)</HI> then by necessary conse∣quence he shall passe there: Yes, yes, (said <HI>Gymnastes)</HI> or I shall stick in the way: then set∣ting spurs to his horse, he past through free∣ly, his horse not fearing, nor being any thing affrighted at the sight of the dead bo∣dies; for he had accustomed him (according to the doctrine of <HI>Aelian)</HI> not to feare ar∣mour, nor the carcasses of dead men; and that not by killing men as <HI>Diomedes</HI> did the <HI>Thracians,</HI> or as <HI>Ulysses</HI> did in throwing the Corpses of his enemies at his horses feet, as <HI>Homer</HI> saith, but by putting a Jack-a-lent a∣mongst his hay, &amp; making him go over it or∣dinarily, when he gave him his oates. The other three followed him very close, except <HI>Eudemon</HI> only, whose horses foreright or far forefoot, sank up to the knee in the paunch of a great fat chuffe, who lay there upon his back drowned, and could not get it out: there was he pestered, until <HI>Gargan∣tua</HI> with the end of his staffe thrust down the rest of the Villains tripes into the water, whilest the horse pulled out his foot; and (which is a wonderful thing in <HI>Hippiatrie,)</HI>
<PB N="166" REF="88"/>
the said horse was throughly cured of a ringbone which he had in that foot, by this touch of the burst guts of that great loobie.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVIII. <HI>How</HI> Gargantua <HI>did eate up six Pilgrims in a sallet.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe story requireth, that we relate that which happened unto six Pilgrims, who came from <HI>Sebastian</HI> near to <HI>Nantes:</HI> and who for shelter that night, being afraid of the enemy, had hid themselves in the garden upon the chichling pease, among the
<PB N="170" REF="90"/>
cabbages and lettices. <HI>Gargantua</HI> finding himself somewhat dry, asked whether they could get any lettice to make him a sallet; and hearing that there were the greatest and fairest in the countrey (for they were as great as plum-trees, or as walnut-trees) he would go thither himself, and brought thence in his hand what he thought good, and withal carried away the six Pilgrims, who were in so great feare, that they did not dare to speak nor cough.</P>
<P>Washing them therefore first at the foun∣tain, the Pilgrims said one to another soft∣ly, What shall we do? we are almost drowned here amongst these lettice, shall we speak? but if we speak, he will kill us for spies: and as they were thus deliberating what to do, <HI>Gar∣gantua</HI> put them with the lettice into a plat∣ter of the house, as large as the huge tun of the <HI>white Friars</HI> of the <HI>Cistertian</HI> order, which done, with oile, vineger and salt he ate them up, to refresh himself a little be∣fore supper: and had already swallowed up five of the Pilgrims, the sixth being in the platter, totally hid under a lettice, except his <HI>bourdon</HI> or <HI>staffe</HI> that appeared, and no∣thing else. Which <HI>Grangousier</HI> seeing, said to <HI>Gargantua,</HI> I think that is the horne of a shell-snail, do not eat it. Why not, (said <HI>Gar∣gantua)</HI> they are good all this moneth, which he no sooner said, but drawing up the staffe,
<PB N="171" REF="90"/>
and therewith taking up the Pilgrim, he ate him very well, then drank a terrible draught of excellent white wine. The Pilgrims thus devoured, made shift to save themselvs as wel as they could, by withdrawing their bodies out of the reach of the grinders of his teeth, but could not escape from thinking they had been put in the lowest dungeon of a prison. And when <HI>Gargantua</HI> whiffed the great draught, they thought to have been drown∣ed in his mouth, and the flood of wine had almost carried them away into the gulf of his stomack. Neverthelesse skipping with their bourdons, as St. <HI>Michaels</HI> Palmers use to do, they sheltered themselves from the dan∣ger of that inundation, under the banks of his teeth. But one of them by chance, gro∣ping or sounding the countrey with his staffe, to try whether they were in safety or no, struck hard against the cleft of a hollow tooth, and hit the mandibulary sinew, or nerve of the jaw, which put <HI>Gargantua</HI> to very great pain, so that he began to cry for the rage that he felt; to ease himself there∣fore of his smarting ache, he called for his tooth-picker, and rubbing towards a young walnut-tree, where they lay skulking, un∣nestled you my Gentlemen Pilgrims.</P>
<P>For he caught one by the legs, another by the scrip, another by the pocket, another by the scarf, another by the band of the

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX. <HI>How the Monk was feasted by</HI> Gargantua, <HI>and of the jovial discourse they had at supper.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHen <HI>Gargantua</HI> was set down at table, after all of them had some∣what stayed their stomacks by a snatch or two of the first bits eaten heartily; <HI>Grangou∣sier</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="92"/>
began to relate the source and cause of the warre, raised between him and <HI>Picro∣chole:</HI> and came to tell how <HI>Friar Ihon</HI> of the <HI>Funnels,</HI> had triumphed at the defence of the close of the Abbey, and extolled him for his valour above <HI>Camillus, Scipio, Pompey, Caesar</HI> and <HI>Themistocles.</HI> Then <HI>Gargantua</HI> de∣sired that he might be presently sent for, to the end that with him they might consult of what was to be done; whereupon by a joynt consent his steward went for him, and brought him along merrily, with his staffe of the Crosse upon <HI>Grangousiers</HI> Mule: when he was come, a thousand huggings, a thousand embracements, a thousand good dayes were given: Ha Friar <HI>Ihon</HI> my friend, Friar <HI>Ihon</HI> my brave cousin, Friar <HI>Ihon</HI> from the de∣vil: let me clip thee (my heart) about the neck, to me an armesful; I must gripe thee (my ballock) till thy back crack with it; Come (my cod,) let me coll thee till I kill thee; and Friar <HI>Ihon</HI> the gladdest man in the world, never was man made welcomer, ne∣ver was any more courteously and graciously received then Friar <HI>Ihon.</HI> Come, come, (said <HI>Gargantua,</HI> a stool here close by meat this end: I am content, (said the Monk) seeing you will have it so. Some water (Page) fill, my boy fill, it is to refresh my liver; give me some <HI>(childe)</HI> to gargle my throat withal. <HI>Depositâ cappâ,</HI> (said <HI>Gymnast)</HI> let us pull off

this frock. Ho, by G—Gentleman (said the Monk) there is a chapter <HI>in statutis ordinis,</HI> which opposeth my laying of it down; Pish (said <HI>Gymnast)</HI> a fig for your chapter, this frock breaks both your shoul∣ders, put it off. My friend (said the Monk) let me alone with it; for by G—I'le drink the better that it is on: it makes all my body jocund; if I should lay it aside, the waggish Pages would cut to themselves garters out of it, as I was once served at <HI>Coulaines:</HI> and which is worse, I should lose my appetite: but if in this habit I sit down at table, I will drink by G—both to thee and to thy horse, and so courage, frolick, God save the company: I have already sup't, yet will I eat never a whit the lesse for that; for I have a paved stomack, as hollow as a But of malvoisie, or St. <HI>Benedictus</HI> boot, and al∣wayes open like a Lawyers pouch. Of all fishes, but the tench, take the wing of a Partridge, or the thigh of a Nunne; Doth not he die like a good fellow that dies with a stiffe <HI>Catso?</HI> Our <HI>Prior</HI> loves exceedingly the white of a capon: In that (said <HI>Gymnast)</HI> he doth not resemble the foxes; for of the capons, hens and pullets which they carry a∣way, they never eat the white: Why? (said the Monk) Because (said <HI>Gymnast)</HI> they have no Cooks to dresse them; and if they be not competently made ready, they remaine

red and not white, the rednesse of meats be∣ing a token that they have not got enough of the fire, whether by boyling, rosting or o∣therwise, except the shrimps, lobsters, crabs and crayfishes, which are <HI>cardinalised</HI> with boyling: by Gods feast-gazers (said the Monk) the Porter of our Abbey then hath not his head well-boyled, for his eyes are as red as a mazer made of an elder-tree. The thigh of this lerevet, is good for those that have the gout. To the purpose of the truel, what is the reason that the thighs of a Gentle∣woman are alwayes fresh and coole: This Probleme (said <HI>Gargantua)</HI> is neither in <HI>A∣ristotle,</HI> in <HI>Alexander Aphrodiseus,</HI> nor in <HI>Plutarch.</HI> There are three causes (said the Monk) by which that place is naturally re∣freshed. <HI>Primò,</HI> because the water runs all along by it. <HI>Secundò,</HI> because it is a shadie place, obscure and dark, upon which the Sun never shines. And thirdly, because it is continually flabbell'd, blown upon and aired by the northwindes of the <HI>hole arstick,</HI> the fan of the <HI>smock,</HI> and <HI>flipflap</HI> of the Codpiece.

Oh that I were but King of <HI>France</HI> for fourescore or a hundred yeares! by G—I should whip like curtail-dogs these run-awayes of <HI>Pavie:</HI> A plāgue take them, why did not they chuse rather to die there, then to leave their good Prince in that pinch and necessity?

of the mumps, (which disease in horses is cal∣led the mourning in the chine;) Our late Abbot was wont to say, that it is a monstrous thing to see a learned Monk by G—. Master, my friend, <HI>Magis magnos clericos non sunt, magis magnos sapientes.</HI> You ne∣ver saw so many hares as there are this year. I could not any where come by a gosse-hawk, nor tassel of falcon: my Lord <HI>Belo∣niere</HI> promised me a <HI>Lanner,</HI> but he wrote to me not long ago, that he was become pursie. The Partridges will so multiply henceforth, that they will go near to eat up our eares: I take no delight in the stalking-horse; for I catch such cold, that I am like to founder my self at that sport; if I do not run, toile, travel and trot about, I am not well at ease. True it is, that in leaping over hedges and bushes my frock leaves alwayes some of its wooll behinde it. I have recovered a dainty greyhound; I give him to the devil if he suffer a hare to escape him. A groom was leading him to my Lord <HI>Hunt-little,</HI> and I robbed him of him; did I ill? No, <HI>Friar Ihon,</HI> (said <HI>Gymnast,)</HI> no by all the devils that are, no: So (said the Monk) do I attest these same devils so long as they last, or ra∣ther vertue G—, what could that gow∣tie Limpard have done with so fine a dog? by the body of G—he is better pleased, when one presents him with a good yoke of

<HEAD>CHAP. XL. <HI>Why Monks are the out-casts of the world? and wherefore some have bigger no∣ses then others?</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY the faith of a <HI>Christian</HI> (said <HI>Eude∣mon)</HI> I do wonderfully dote, and enter in a great extasie, when I consider the ho∣nesty and good fellowship of this Monk; for he makes us here all merry. How is it then that they exclude the <HI>Monks</HI> from all good companies? calling them feast-troublers, marrers of mirth, and disturbers of all civil conversation, as the bees drive away the drones from their hives; <HI>Ignavum fucos pe∣cus</HI> (said <HI>Maro) à praesepibus arcent.</HI> Here∣unto answered <HI>Gargantua,</HI> There is nothing so true, as that the frock and cowle draw unto it self the opprobries, injuries and ma∣ledictions of the world, just as the winde cal∣led <HI>Cecias</HI> attracts the clouds: the perem∣ptory reason is, because they eat the or∣dure and excrements of the world, that is
<PB N="180" REF="95"/>
to say, the sins of the people, and like dung∣chewers and excrementitious eaters, they are cast into the privies and secessive places; that is, the Covents and Abbeys separated from Political conversation, as the jakes and retreats of a house are: but if you conceive how an Ape in a family is alwayes mocked, and provokingly incensed, you shall easily apprehend how Monks are shunned of all men, both young and old. The Ape keeps not the house as a dog doth: He drawes not in the plow as the oxe: He yields neither milk nor wooll as the sheep: He carrieth no burthen as a horse doth; that which he doth, is only to conskite, spoil and defile all, which is the cause wherefore he hath of all men mocks, frumperies and bastonadoes.</P>
<P>After the same manner a Monk (I mean those lither, idle, lazie Monks) doth not labour and work, as do the Peasant and Artificer: doth not ward and defend the countrey, as doth the man of warre: cureth not the sick and diseased, as the Physician doth: doth neither preach nor teach, as do the Evangeli∣cal Doctors and Schoolmasters: doth not import commodities and things necessary for the Common-wealth, as the Merchant doth: therefore is it, that by and of all men they are hooted at, hated and abhorred. Yea, but (said <HI>Grangousier,)</HI> they pray to God for us. Nothing lesse, (answered <HI>Gar∣gentua.)</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="95"/>
True it is, that with a tingle tangle jangling of bells they trouble and disquiet all their neighbours about them: Right, (said the Monk,) a masse, a matine, a vespre well rung are half said. They mumble out great store of Legends and Psalmes, by them not at all understood: they say many <HI>pate∣notres,</HI> interlarded with <HI>ave-maries,</HI> without thinking upon, or apprehending the mean∣ing of what it is they say, which truly I call mocking of God, and not prayers. But so help them God, as they pray for us, and not for being afraid to lose their victuals, their manchots, and good fat pottage. All true <HI>Christians,</HI> of all estates and conditions, in all places and at all times send up their pray∣ers to God, and the Mediatour prayeth and intercedeth for them, and God is gra∣cious to them. Now such a one is our good <HI>Friar Ihon,</HI> therefore every man desireth to have him in his company, he is no <HI>bigot</HI> or hypocrite, he is not torne and divided be∣twixt reality and appearance, no wretch of a rugged and peevish disposition, but ho∣nest, jovial, resolute and a good fellow: he travels, he labours, he defends the oppressed, comforts the afflicted, helps the needie, and keeps the close of the Abbey: Nay (said the Monk) I do a great deal more then that; for whilest we are in dispatching our matines and anniversaries in the quire; I make with∣al

some crossebowe-strings, polish glasse-bottles and boults; I twist lines and weave purse-nets, wherein to catch coneys; I am never idle; but now hither come, some drink, some drink here, bring the fruit. These chestnuts are of the wood of <HI>Estrox,</HI> and with good new wine are able to make you a fine cracker and composer of bum-sonnets. You are not as yet (it seems) well moistened in this house with the sweet wine and must, by G—I drink to all men freely, and at all Fords like a Proctor or Promoters horse. <HI>Friar Ihon,</HI> (said <HI>Gymnast)</HI> take away the snot that hangs at your nose. Ha, ha, (said the Monk,) am not I in dan∣ger of drowning, seeing I am in water even to the nose? No, no, <HI>quare? quia,</HI> though some water come out from thence, there never goes in any; for it is well antidoted with pot-proof-armour, and sirrup of the Vine-leaf.</P>
<P>O my friend, he that hath winter-boots made of such leather, may boldly fish for oysters, for they will never take water. What is the cause (said <HI>Gargantua)</HI> that <HI>Friar Ihon</HI> hath such a faire nose? Because (said <HI>Gran∣gousier)</HI> that God would have it so, who fra∣meth us in such forme, and for such end, as is most agreeable with his divine Will, even as a Potter fashioneth his vessels. Because (said <HI>Ponocrates)</HI> he came with the first to the
<PB N="183" REF="96"/>
faire of noses, and therefore made choice of the fairest and the greatest. Pish, (said the Monk) that is not the reason of it, but, ac∣cording to the true Monastical Philosophy, it is because my Nurse had soft teats, by ver∣tue whereof, whilest she gave me suck, my nose did sink in as in so much butter. The hard breasts of Nurses make children short∣nosed. But <HI>hey gay, Ad formam nasi cog∣noscitur ad te levavi.</HI> I never eat any con∣fections, <HI>Page,</HI> whilest I am at the bibbery; <HI>Item,</HI> bring me rather some tosts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLI. <HI>How the Monk made</HI> Gargantua <HI>sleep, and of his houres and breviaries.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SUpper being ended, they consulted of the businesse in hand, and concluded that about midnight they should fall unawares upon the enemie, to know what manner of watch and ward they kept, and that in the mean while they should take a little rest, the better to refresh themselves. But <HI>Gargantua</HI> could not sleep by any meanes, on which side soever he turned himfelf. Whereupon the Monk said to him, I never sleep soundly, but when I am at Sermon or Prayers; Let
<PB N="184" REF="97"/>
us therefore begin, you and I, the seven pe∣nitential <HI>Psalmes,</HI> to try whether you shall not quickly fall asleep. The conceit pleased <HI>Gargantua</HI> very well, and beginning the first of these <HI>Psalmes,</HI> assoon as they came to the words <HI>Beati quorum,</HI> they fell asleep both the one and the other. But the Monk for his being formerly accustomed to the houre of Claustral matines, failed not to awake a little before midnight, and being up himself awa∣ked all the rest, in singing aloud, and with a full clear voice, the song,</P>
<Q><L><HI>Awake, O</HI> Reinian; <HI>Ho, awake;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Awake, O</HI> Reinian, <HI>Ho:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Get up, you no more sleep must take,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Get up; for we must go.</HI></L></Q>
<P>When they were all rowsed and up, he said, <HI>My Masters,</HI> it is a usual saying, that we begin matines with coughing, and supper with drinking; let us now (in doing clean contrarily) begin our matines with drinking, and at night before supper we shall cugh as hard as we can. What? (said <HI>Gargantua)</HI> to drink so soon after sleep, this is not to live ac∣cording to the diet and prescript rule of the Physicians, for you ought first to scoure and cleanse your stomack of all its superfluities and excrements. O well physicked, (said the <HI>Monk)</HI> a hundred devils leap into my body,
<PB N="185" REF="97"/>
if there be not more old drunkards, then old Physicians: I have made this paction and covenant with my appetite, that it alwayes lieth down, and goes to bed with my self, (for to that I every day give very good or∣der,) then the next morning it also riseth with me, and gets up when I am awake. Minde you your charges, (Gentlemen) or tend your cures as much as you will; I will get me to my <HI>Drawer,</HI> (in termes of falconrie, my <HI>tiring.)</HI> What <HI>drawer</HI> or <HI>tiring</HI> do you mean? (said <HI>Gargantua.)</HI> My breviary (said the Monk,) for just as the Falconers, before they feed their hawks, do makethem draw at a hens leg, to purge their braines of flegme, and sharpen them to a good appe∣tite: so by taking this merry little breviary, in the morning I scoure all my lungs, and am presently ready to drink.</P>
<P>After what manner (said <HI>Gargantua)</HI> do you say these faire houres and prayers of yours? After the manner of <HI>Whipfield,</HI> said the Monk, by three Psalmes, and three <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fessecamp <HI>and cor∣ruptly</HI> Fe∣can.</NOTE> Lessons, or nothing at all, he that will: I ne∣ver tie my self to houres, prayers and sacra∣ments: for they are made for the man, and not the man for them; therefore is it that I make my Prayers in fashion of stirrup-lea∣thers; I shorten or lengthen them when I think good. <HI>Brevis or atio penetrat coelos, &amp; longa potatio evacuat Scyphos:</HI> where is
<PB N="186" REF="98"/>
that written? by my faith (said <HI>Ponocrates,)</HI> I cannot tell (my <HI>Pillicock;)</HI> but thou art more worth then gold: Therein (said the <HI>Monk)</HI> I am like you: but, <HI>venite, apotemus.</HI> Then made they ready store of <HI>Carbonadoes,</HI> or rashers on the coales, and good fat <HI>soupes,</HI> or brewis with sippets; and the <HI>Monk</HI> drank what he pleased. Some kept him company, and the rest did forbear, <HI>for their stomachs were not as yet opened.</HI> Afterwards every man began to arme and befit himself for the field; and they armed the <HI>Monk</HI> against his will; for he desired no other armour for back and breast, but his frock, nor any other weapon in his hand, but the staffe of the Crosse: yet at their pleasure was he com∣pleatly armed <HI>cap-a-pe,</HI> and mounted upon one of the best horses in the Kingdome, with a good slashing sable by his side, toge∣ther with <HI>Gargantua, Ponocrates, Gymnast, Eudemon,</HI> and five and twenty more of the most resolute and adventurous of <HI>Grangou∣siers</HI> house, all armed at proof with their lances in their hands, mounted like St. <HI>George,</HI> and every one of them having a harquebu∣sier behinde him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLII. <HI>How the Monk encouraged his fellow-cham∣pions, and how he hanged upon a tree.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THus went out those valiant champi∣ons on their adventure, in full reso∣lution, to know what enterprise they should undertake, and what to take heed of, and look well to, in the day of the great and horrible battel. And the <HI>Monk</HI> encouraged them, saying, My children, do not feare nor doubt, I will conduct you safely; God and Sanct <HI>Benedict</HI> be with us. If I had strength answerable to my courage, <HI>by Sdeath</HI> I would plume them for you like ducks. I feare no∣thing but the great ordnance; yet I know of a charm by way of Prayer, which the sub∣sexton of our Abbey taught me, that will preserve a man from the violence of guns, and all manner of fire-weapons and en∣gines, but it will do me no good, because I do not believe it. Neverthelesse, I hope my staffe of the crosse shall this day play devillish pranks amongst them; by G—whoever of our Party shall offer to play the duck, and shrink when blowes are a dealing, I give my self to the devil, if I do not make a Monk
<PB N="188" REF="99"/>
of him in my stead, and hamper him within my frock, which is a sovereign cure against cowardise. Did you never heare of my Lord <HI>Meurles</HI> his grey-hound, which was not worth a straw in the fields; he put a frock about his neck, by the body of G—there was neither hare nor fox that could e∣scape him, and which is more, he lined all the bitches in the countrey, though before that he was feeble-reined, and <HI>ex frigidis &amp; maleficiatis.</HI> The Monk uttering these words in choler, as he past under a walnut-tree, in his way towards the Causey, he broached the vizor of his helmet, on the stump of a great branch of the said tree: ne∣verthelesse, he set his spurres so fiercely to the horse, who was full of mettal, and quick on the spurre, that he bounded forwards, and the Monk going about to ungrapple his vi∣zor, let go his hold of the bridle, and so hanged by his hand upon the bough, whilest his horse stole away from under him. By this meanes was the Monk left, hanging on the walnut-tree, and crying for help, mur∣ther, murther, swearing also that he was be∣trayed: <HI>Eudemon</HI> perceived him first, and calling <HI>Gargantua,</HI> said, <HI>Sir,</HI> come and see <HI>Absalom</HI> hanging. <HI>Gargantua</HI> being come, considered the countenance of the Monk, and in what posture he hanged; wherefore he said to <HI>Eudemon,</HI> You were mistaken in com∣paring
<PB N="189" REF="99"/>
him to <HI>Absalom;</HI> for <HI>Absalom</HI> hung by his haire, but this shaveling Monk hang∣eth by the eares. Help me (said the Monk) in the devils name, is this a time for you to prate? you seem to me to be like the decre∣talist Preachers, who say, that whosoever shall see his neighbour in the danger of death, ought upon paine of trisulk excom∣munication, rather choose to admonish him to make his Confession to a Priest, and put his conscience in the state of Peace, then o∣therwise to help and relieve him.</P>
<P>And therefore when I shall see them fallen into a river, and ready to be drowned, I shall make them a faire long sermon <HI>de con∣temptu mundi▪ &amp; fuga seculi;</HI> and when they are stark dead, shall then go to their aide and succour in fishing after them: Be quiet (said <HI>Gymnast,)</HI> and stirre not my mi∣nion; I am now coming to unhang thee, and to set thee at freedome, for thou art a pretty little gentle <HI>Monachus; Monachus inclaustro non vdlet ova duo; sed quando est extra bene valet triginta:</HI> I have seen above five hundred hanged, but I never saw any have a better countenance in his dangling and <HI>pendilatory</HI> swagging; truly if I had so good a one, I would willingly hang thus all my life-time; What? (said the Monk) have you almost done preaching: help me in the name of God, seeing you will not in the
<PB N="190" REF="100"/>
name of the other spirit, or by the habit which I wear you shall repent it, <HI>tempore &amp; loco praelibatis.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Gymnast</HI> allghted from his horse, and climbing up the walnut-tree, lifted up the <HI>Monk</HI> with one hand, by the gush∣ets of his armour under the arm-pits, and with the other undid his vizor from the stump of the broken branch, which done, he let him fall to the ground and himself after: Assoon as the <HI>Monk</HI> was down, he put off all his armour, and threw away one piece af∣ter another about the field, &amp; taking to him-again his staffe of the Crosse, remounted up to his horse, which <HI>Eudemon</HI> had caught in his running away. Then went they on mer∣rily, riding along on the high way.</P>

This <HI>Picrochole</HI> did not fully beleeve, though he doubted not much of it: Therefore sent he under the command and conduct of the Count <HI>Draw-forth,</HI> for discovering of the countrey, the number of sixteen hundred horsemen, all well-mounted upon light hor∣ses for skirmish, and throughly besprinkled with holy water; and every one for their field-mark or cognizance had the signe of a starre in his scarf, to serve at all adventures, in case they should happen to incounter with devils; that by the vertue, as well of that <HI>Gregorian</HI> water, as of the starres which they wore, they might make them disappear and evanish.</P>
<P>In this equipage, they made an excursion upon the countrey, till they came near to the <HI>Vauguyon, (which is the valley of</HI> Guyon) and to the spittle, but could never finde any body to speak unto; whereupon they re∣turned a little back, and took occasion to passe above the aforesaid hospital, to try what intelligence they could come by in those parts, in which resolution riding on, and by chance in a pastoral lodge, or shep∣herds

With this he cried out, Charge, <HI>devils,</HI> charge; which when the enemies heard, they thought certainly that they had been very devils, and therefore even then began all of them to run away as hard as they could drive, <HI>Draw-forth</HI> only excepted, who immediately setled his lance on its rest, and therewith hit the <HI>Monk</HI> with all his force on the very middle of his breast, but coming against his horrifick frock, the point of the iron, being with the blow either broke off or blunted, it was in matter of executi∣on, as if you had struck against an Anvil with a little wax-candle.</P>
<P>Then did the <HI>Monk</HI> with his staffe of the Crosse, give him such a sturdie thump and whirret betwixt his neck and shoulders,
<PB N="193" REF="101"/>
upon the <HI>Acromion</HI> bone, that he made him lose both sense and motion, and fall down stone dead at his horses feet; and seeing the signe of the starre which he wore scarfwayes, he said unto <HI>Gargantua,</HI> these men are but Priests, which is but the beginning of a Monk; by St. <HI>Ihon</HI> I am a perfect Monk, I will kill them to you like flies: Then ran he after them at a swift and full gallop, till he overtook the reere, and felled them down like tree-leaves, striking athwart and alongst and every way. <HI>Gymnast</HI> presently asked <HI>Gargantua</HI> if they should pursue them? To whom <HI>Gargantua</HI> answered, by no means; for, according to right military discipline, you must never drive your enemy unto despair, for that such a strait doth multiply his force, and increase his courage, which was before broken and cast down; neither is there any better help, or outgate of relief for men that are amazed, out of heart, toiled and spent, then to hope for no favour at all. How many victories have been taken out of the hands of the Victors by the vanquished, when they would not rest satisfied with rea∣son, but attempt to put all to the sword, and totally to destroy their enemies, without leaving so much as one to carry home newes of the defeat of his fellowes? Open there∣fore unto your enemies all the gates and wayes, and make to them a bridge of silver
<PB N="194" REF="102"/>
rather then faile, that you may be rid of them. Yea, but (said <HI>Gymnast)</HI> they have the <HI>Monk:</HI> Have they the <HI>Monk?</HI> (said <HI>Gargantua)</HI> Upon mine honour then it will prove to their cost: but to prevent all dangers, let us not yet retreat, but halt here quietly, as in an am∣bush; for I think I do already understand the policie and judgement of our enemies, they are truly more directed by chance and meer fortune, then by good advice and coun∣sel. In the mean while, whilest these made a stop under the walnut-trees, the <HI>Monk</HI> pursued on the chase, charging all he over∣took, and giving quarter to none, until he met with a trouper, who carried be∣hinde him one of the poor Pilgrims, and there would have rifled him. The Pilgrim, in hope of relief at the sight of the <HI>Monk,</HI> cried out, Ha, my Lord <HI>Prior,</HI> my good friend, my Lord <HI>Prior,</HI> save me, I beseech you, save me; which words being heard by those that rode in the van, they instantly faced a∣bout, and seeing there was no body but the <HI>Monk</HI> that made this great havock &amp; slaugh∣ter among them, they loded him with blows as thick as they use to do an Asse with wood: but of all this he felt nothing, especially when they struck upon his frock, his skin was so hard. Then they committed him to two of the Marshals men to keep, and looking about, saw no body coming against them,
<PB N="195" REF="102"/>
whereupon they thought that <HI>Gergantua</HI> and his Party were fled: then was it that they rode as hard as they could towards the wal∣nut-trees to meet with them, and left the <HI>Monk</HI> there all alone, with his two foresaid men to guard him. <HI>Gargantua</HI> heard the noise and neighing of the horses, and said to his men, <HI>Camerades,</HI> I hear the track and beating of the enemies horse-feet, and with∣all perceive that some of them come in a troupe and full body against us; let us rallie and close here, then set forward in order, and by this means we shall be able to re∣ceive their charge, to their losse and our honour.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIV. <HI>How the</HI> Monk <HI>rid himself of his Keep∣ers, and how</HI> Picrocholes <HI>forlorne hope was defeated.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Monk seeing them break off thus without order, conjectured that they were to set upon <HI>Gargantua</HI> and those that were with him, and was wonderfully grieved that he could not succour them; then consi∣dered he the countenance of the two keepers in whose custody he was, who would
<PB N="196" REF="103"/>
have willingly runne after the troops to get some booty and plunder, and were alwayes looking towards the valley unto which they were going; farther, he syllogized, saying, These men are but badlys killed in matters of warre, for they have not required my paroll, neither have they taken my sword from me; suddenly hereafter he drew his brackmard or horsemans sword, wherewith he gave the keeper which held him, on the right side such a sound slash, that he cut clean thorough the <HI>jugularie</HI> veins, and the <HI>sphagitid</HI> or transpa∣rent arteries of the neck, with the fore-part of the throat called the <HI>gargareon,</HI> even un∣to the two <HI>Adenes,</HI> which are throat-ker∣nels; and redoubling the blow, he opened the <HI>spinal</HI> marrow betwixt the second and third <HI>vertebrae;</HI> there fell down that keeper stark dead to the ground. Then the <HI>Monk</HI> reining, his horse to the left ranne upon the other, who seeing his fellow dead, and the <HI>Monk</HI> to have the advantage of him, cried with a loud voice, Ha, my Lord <HI>Prior,</HI> quarter, I yeeld, my Lord <HI>Prior,</HI> quarter, quarter, my good friend, my Lord <HI>Prior:</HI> and the <HI>Monk</HI> cried likewise, My Lord <HI>Posterior,</HI> my friend, my Lord <HI>Posterior,</HI> you shall have it upon your <HI>posteriorums:</HI> Ha, said the keeper, my Lord <HI>Prior,</HI> my Minion, my Gentile, Lord <HI>Prior,</HI> I pray God make you an <HI>Abbot;</HI> By the habit (said the <HI>Monk)</HI> which I weare, I
<PB N="197" REF="103"/>
will here make you a Cardinal; what do you use to pay ransomes to religious men? you shall therefore have by and by a red hat of my giving: and the fellow cried, Ha, my Lord <HI>Prior,</HI> my Lord <HI>Prior,</HI> my Lord <HI>Abbot</HI> that shall be, my Lord <HI>Cardinal,</HI> my Lord all, <HI>ha, ha, hes,</HI> no my Lord <HI>Prior,</HI> my good little Lord the <HI>Prior,</HI> I yeeld, render and deliver my self up to you: and I deliver thee (said the <HI>Monk)</HI> to all the Devils in hell; then at one stroak he struck off his head, cutting his <HI>scalp</HI> upon the <HI>temple-bones,</HI> and lifting up in the upper part of the <HI>scul</HI> the two triangu∣larie bones called <HI>sincipital,</HI> or the two bones <HI>bregmatis,</HI> together with the <HI>sagittal</HI> commissure or dart-like seame which distin∣guisheth the right side of the head from the left, as also a great part of the coronal or forehead-bone, by which terrible blow like∣wise he cut the two meninges or filmes which inwrap the braine, and made a deep wound in the braines two posterior ventricles, and the <HI>cranium</HI> or <HI>skull</HI> abode hanging upon his shoulders, by the skin of the <HI>pericranium</HI> be∣hinde, in forme of a Doctors bonnet, black without and red within. Thus fell he down also to the ground stark dead.</P>
<P>And presently the Monk gave his horse the spurre, and kept the way that the enemy held, who had met with <HI>Gargantua</HI> and his companions in the broad high-way, and
<PB N="198" REF="104"/>
were so diminished of their number, for the enormous slaughter that <HI>Gargantua</HI> had made with his great tree amongst them, as also <HI>Gymnast, Ponocrates, Eudemon,</HI> and the rest, that they began to retreat disorderly and in great haste, as men altogether affrighted and troubled in both sense and understanding; and as if they had seen the very proper <HI>speci∣es</HI> and forme of death before their eyes; or rather as when you see an Asse with a <HI>brizze</HI> or gad-bee under his taile, or flie that stings him, run hither and thither without keeping any path or way, throwing down his load to the ground, breaking his bridle and reines, and taking no breath nor rest, and no man can tell what ailes him, for they see not any thing touch him: so fled these people desti∣tute of wit, without knowing any cause of flying, onely pursued by a <HI>panick</HI> terror, which in their mindes they had conceived. The <HI>Monk</HI> perceiving that their whole in∣tent was to betake themselves to their heels, alighted from his horse, and got upon a big large rock, which was in the way, and with his great <HI>Brackmard</HI> sword laid such load up∣on those runawayes, and with maine strength fetching a compasse with his arme without feigning or sparing, slew and overthrew so many, that his sword broke in two peces, then thought he within himself that he had slaine and killed sufficiently, and that the rest
<PB N="199" REF="104"/>
should escape to carry newes; therefore he took up a battle-axe of those that lay there dead, and got upon the rock againe, passing his time to see the enemy thus flying, and to tumble himself amongst the dead bo∣dies, only that he suffered none to carry Pike, Sword, Lance nor Gun with him, and those who carried the Pilgrims bound, he made to alight, and gave their horses unto the said Pilgrims, keeping them there with him under the hedge, and also <HI>Touchefaucet,</HI> who was then his prisoner.</P>

As he spake these words, in came the <HI>Monk</HI> very resolute, and asked them, whence are you, you poor wretches? of Saint <HI>Ge∣nou</HI> (said they;) And how (said the <HI>Monk)</HI> doth the Abbot <HI>Gulligut</HI> the good drinker, and the Monks, what cheere make they? by G—body they'll have a fling at your wives, and breast them to some purpose whilest you are upon your roaming rant and gadding Pil∣grimage: <HI>Hin, hen</HI> (said <HI>sweertogo)</HI> I am not a∣fraid of mine; for he that shall see her by day, will never break his neck to come to her in the night-time: Yea mary (said the <HI>Monk)</HI> now you have hit it, let her be as ugly as ever was <HI>Proserpina,</HI> she will once by the Lord G—be over-turned, and get her skin-coat shaken, if there dwell any Monks near to her, for a good Carpenter will make use of any kinde of timber: let me be pepper'd with the pox, if you finde not all your wives with childe at your returne; for the very shadow of the steeple of an <HI>Abbey</HI> is fruitful: It is (said <HI>Gargantua)</HI> like the water of <HI>Nilus</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> if you beleeve <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Plinie, lib.</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVI. <HI>How</HI> Grangousier <HI>did very kindly entertain</HI> Touchefaucet <HI>his Prisoner.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>TOuchefaucet</HI> was presented unto <HI>Gran∣gousier,</HI> and by him examined upon the enterprise and attempt of <HI>Picrochole,</HI> what it was he could pretend to, or aim at, by the rustling stirre, and tumultuary coyle of this his sudden invasion: whereunto he answer∣ed, that his end and purpose was to conquer all the countrey, if he could, for the injury done to his cake-bakers: It is too great an undertaking (said <HI>Grangousier;)</HI> and (as the Proverb is) He that gripes too much, holds fast but little: the time is not now as for∣merly, to conquer the Kingdomes of our neighbour Princes, and to build up our own greatnesse upon the losse of our nearest Christian brother: this imitation of the an∣cient <HI>Herculeses, Alexanders, Hannibals, Scipios, Caesars,</HI> and other such heroes is quite contrary to the Profession of the Gos∣pel of Christ, by the which we are com∣manded to preserve, keep, rule and govern every man his own countrey and lands, and not in a hostile manner to invade others,
<PB N="205" REF="107"/>
and that which heretofore the <HI>Barbars</HI> and <HI>Saracens</HI> called prowesse and valour, we do now call robbing, theevery and wickednes; It would have been more commendable in him to have contained himself within the bounds of his own territories, royally governing them, then to insult and domineer in mine, pillaging and plundering every where like a most unmerciful enemy; for by ruling his own with discretion, he might have increas't his greatnesse, but by robbing me he cannot escape destruction; Go your wayes in the name of God, prosecute good enterprises, shew your King what is amisse, and never counsel him with regard unto your own par∣ticular profit, for the publick losse will swal∣low up the private benefit. As for your ransome, I do freely remit it to you, and will that your armes and horse be restored to you: so should good neighbours do, and ancient friends; seeing this our difference is not properly warre, as <HI>Plato, lib.</HI> 5. <HI>de re∣pub.</HI> would not have it called warre but se∣dition, when the <HI>Greeks</HI> took up armes a∣gainst one another, and that therefore when such combustions should arise amongst them, his advice was to behave themselves in the managing of them, with all discretion and modesty. Although you call it warre, it is but superficial, it entereth not into the clo∣set and inmost cabinet of our hearts; for
<PB N="206" REF="108"/>
neither of us hath been wronged in his ho∣nour, nor is there any question betwixt us in the main, but only how to redresse by the by some petty faults committed by our men; I mean, both yours and ours, which although you knew you ought to let passe; for these quarrelsome persons deserve rather to be contemned then mentioned, especially seeing I offered them satisfaction according to the wrong. God shall be the just Judge of our variances, whom I beseech by death rather to take me out of this life, and to per∣mit my goods to perish and be destroyed before mine eyes, then that by me or mine he should in any sort be wronged. These words uttered, he called the <HI>Monk,</HI> and be∣fore them all spoke thus unto him: <HI>Friar Ihon,</HI> my good friend, is it you that took prisoner the Captain <HI>Touchfaucet</HI> here pre∣sent? Sir (said the Monk) seeing himself is here, and that he is of the yeares of discreti∣on, I had rather you should know it by his confession then by any words of mine. Then said <HI>Touchfaucet,</HI> My sovereign Lord, it is he indeed that took me, and I do therefore most freely yield my self his prisoner. Have you put him to any ransom, said <HI>Grangousier</HI> to the <HI>Monk?</HI> No, (said the <HI>Monk,)</HI> of that I take no care: How much would you have for having taken him? nothing, nothing, (said the <HI>Monk,)</HI> I am not swayed by that,
<PB N="207" REF="108"/>
nor do I regard it; Then <HI>Grangousier</HI> com∣manded, that in presence of <HI>Touchefaucet,</HI> should be delivered to the Monk for taking him, the summe of threescore and two thou∣sand saluts <HI>(in</HI> English <HI>money fifteen thousand and five hundred pounds)</HI> which was done, whilest they made a collation or little ban∣quet to the said <HI>Touchfaucet,</HI> of whom <HI>Gran∣gousier</HI> asked, if he would stay with him, or if he loved rather to return to his King? <HI>Touchfaucet</HI> answered, that he was content to take whatever course he would advise him to; Then (said <HI>Grangousier)</HI> return unto your King, and God be with you.</P>
<P>Then he gave him an excellent sword of <HI>Avienue</HI> blade, with a golden scabbard wrought with Vine-branch-like flourishes, of faire Goldsmiths work, and a coller or neck-chain of gold, weighing seven hundred and two thousand marks <HI>(at eight ounces each,)</HI> garnished with precious stones of the finest sort, esteemed at a hundred and sixty thousand ducats, and ten thousand crownes more, as an honourable donative, by way of present.</P>
<P>After this talk, <HI>Touchefaucet</HI> got to his horse, and <HI>Gargantua</HI> for his safety allowed him the guard of thirty men at armes, and six score archers to attend him under the conduct of <HI>Gymnast,</HI> to bring him even un∣to the gate of the rock <HI>Clermond,</HI> if there
<PB N="208" REF="109"/>
were need. Assoon as he was gone, the <HI>Monk</HI> restored unto <HI>Grangousier</HI> the three∣score and two thousand saluts, which he had received, saying, Sir it is not as yet the time for you to give such gifts, stay till this warre be at an end, for none can tell what accidents may occurre, and war begun without good provision of money before-hand for going through with it, is but as a breathing of strength, and blast that will quickly passe away; coine is the sinews of warre. Well then (said <HI>Grangousier)</HI> at the end I will con∣tent you by some honest recompence, as also all those who shall do me good ser∣vice.</P>

hearty thanks, said that he would compose and order the warre by such a device, that there should not be found great need to put so many honest men to trouble in the mana∣ging of it; And therefore was content at that time to give order only for bringing a∣long the legions, which he maintained in his ordinary Garison-townes of the <HI>Devi∣niere,</HI> of <HI>Chavignie,</HI> of <HI>Granot,</HI> and of <HI>Quin∣quenais,</HI> amounting to the number of two thousand cuirasiers, threescore and six thou∣sand foot-souldiers, six and twenty thou∣sand dragoons, attended by two hundred pieces of great ordnance, two and twenty thousand Pioneers, and six thousand light horsemen, all drawn up in troupes, so well befitted and accommodated with their com∣missaries, sutlers, ferriers, harnasse-makers, and other such like necessary members in a military camp; so fully instructed in the Art of warfare, so perfectly knowing and following their colours, so ready to hear and obey their Captains, so nimble to run, so strong at their charging, so prudent in their adventures, and every day so well discipli∣ned, that they seemed rather to be a consort of organ-pipes, or mutual concord of the wheels of a clock, then an infantry and ca∣valry, or army of souldiers.</P>
<P><HI>Touchefaucet</HI> immediately after his return, presented himself before <HI>Picrochole,</HI> and re∣lated
<PB N="211" REF="110"/>
unto him at large all that he had done and seen, and at last endeavoured to per∣swade him with strong and forcible argu∣ments, to capitulate and make an agreement with <HI>Grangousier,</HI> whom he found to be the honestest man in the world, saying further, that it was neither right nor reason thus to trouble his neighbours, of whom they had never received any thing but good: and in regard of the main point, that they should never be able to go through stitch with that warre, but to their great damage and mis∣chief: for the forces of <HI>Picrochole</HI> were not so considerable, but that <HI>Grangousier</HI> could easily overthrow them.</P>
<P>He had not well done speaking, when <HI>Rash∣calf</HI> said out aloud, Unhappy is that Prince, which is by such men served, who are so ea∣sily corrupted, as I know <HI>Touchefaucet</HI> is; for I see his courage so changed, that he had willingly joyned with our enemies to fight against us and betray us, if they would have received him; but as vertue is of all, both friends and foes, praised and esteemed, so is wickednes soon known and suspected, and although it happen the enemies to make use thereof for their profit, yet have they al∣wayes the wicked, and the traitors in abomi∣nation.</P>
<P><HI>Touchefaucet</HI> being at these words very im∣patient, drew out his sword, and there with
<PB N="212" REF="111"/>
ran <HI>Rashcalf</HI> through the body, a little un∣der the nipple of his left side, whereof he di∣ed presently, and pulling back his sword out of his body, said boldly, <HI>So let him perish, that shall a faithful servant blame. Picrochole</HI> incontinently grew furious, and seeing <HI>Touchefaucets</HI> new sword and his scabbard so richly diapred with flourishes of most excel∣lent workmanship, said, Did they give thee this weapon, so felloniously therewith to kill before my face my so good friend <HI>Rash∣calf?</HI> then immediately commanded he his guard to hew him in pieces, which was in∣stantly done, and that so cruelly, that the chamber was all died with blood: After∣wards he appointed the corps of <HI>Rashcalf</HI> to be honourably buried, and that of <HI>Touche∣faucet,</HI> to be cast over the walls into the ditches.</P>
<P>The newes of these excessive violences were quickly spread through all the Army; wherupon many began to murmure against <HI>Picrochole,</HI> insofarre that <HI>Pinchpennie</HI> said to him, My sovereign Lord, I know not what the issue of this enterprise will be; I see your men much dejected, and not well resolved in their mindes, by considering that we are here very ill provided of victu∣all, and that our number is already much diminished by three or foure sallies.

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVIII. <HI>How</HI> Gargantua <HI>set upon</HI> Picrochole, <HI>with∣in the rock</HI> Clermond, <HI>and utter∣ly defeated the Army of the said</HI> Picrochole.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GArgantua</HI> had the charge of the whole Army, and his father <HI>Grangousier</HI> stayed in his Castle, who encouraging them with good words, promised great rewards unto those that should do any notable service. Having thus set forward, assoon as they had gained the Passe at the Ford of <HI>Vede,</HI> with boats and bridges speedily made, they past over in a trice, then considering the situation of the town, which was on a high and advan∣tageous place, <HI>Gargantua</HI> thought fit to call his counsel, and passe that night in deli∣beration upon what was to be done: But <HI>Gymnast</HI> said unto him, My sovereign Lord,
<PB N="214" REF="112"/>
such is the nature and complexion of the <HI>frenches,</HI> that they are worth nothing, but at the first push, then are they more fierce then devils; but if they linger a little, and be wea∣ried with delays, they'l prove more faint and remisse then women: my opinion is there∣fore, that now presently after your men have taken breath, and some small refecti∣on, you give order for a resolute assault, and that we storme them instantly. His ad∣vice was found very good, and for effectua∣ting thereof, he brought forth his army in∣to the plain field, and placed the reserves on the skirt or rising of a little hill. The <HI>Monk</HI> took along with him six companies of foot, and two hundred horsemen well armed, and with great diligence crossed the marish, and valiantly got up on the top of the green hil∣lock, even unto the high-way which leads to <HI>Loudin.</HI> Whilest the assault was thus begun, <HI>Picrocholes</HI> men could not tell well what was best, to issue out and receive the Assailants, or keep within the town and not to stirre: Him∣self in the mean time, without deliberation, sallied forth in a rage with the cavalry of his guard, who were forthwith received, and royally entertained with great cannon-shot, that fell upon them like haile from the high grounds, on which the Artillery was plant∣ed; whereupon the <HI>Gargantuists</HI> betook themselves unto the valleys, to give the ord∣nance
<PB N="215" REF="112"/>
leave to play, and range with the larger scope.</P>
<P>Those of the town defended themselves as well as they could, but their shot past o∣ver us, without doing us any hurt at all: Some of <HI>Picrocholes</HI> men that had escaped our Artillery, set most fiercely upon our souldiers, but prevailed little; for they were all let in betwixt the files, and there knock't down to the ground, which their fellow-souldiers seeing, they would have retreated, but the <HI>Monk</HI> having seised upon the Passe, by the which they were to return, they run away and fled in all the disorder and confu∣sion that could be imagined.</P>
<P>Some would have pursued after them, and followed the chase, but the <HI>Monk</HI> withheld them, apprehending that in their pursuit the Pursuers might lose their ranks, and so give occasion to the besieged to sallie out of the town upon them. Then staying there some space, and none coming against him, he sent the Duke <HI>Phrontist,</HI> to advise <HI>Gargantua</HI> to advance towards the hill up on the left hand, to hinder <HI>Picrocholes</HI> retreat at that gate, which <HI>Gargantua</HI> did with all expedition, and sent thither foure brigades under the conduct of <HI>Sebast,</HI> which had no sooner reach't the top of the hill, but they met <HI>Picrochole</HI> in the teeth, and those that were with him scat∣tered.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="113"/>
Then charged they upon them stoutly, yet were they much indamaged by those that were upon the walles, who galled them with all manner of shot, both from the great ordnance, small guns and bowes. Which <HI>Gargantua</HI> perceiving, he went with a strong Partie to their relief, and with his Artillery began to thunder so terribly upon that can∣ton of the wall, and so long, that all the strength within the town, to maintain and fill up the breach, was drawn thither. The <HI>Monk</HI> seeing that quarter which he kept be∣sieged, void of men and competent guards, and in a manner altogether naked and aban∣doned, did most magnanimously on a sud∣den lead up his men towards the Fort, and never left it till he had got up upon it, know∣ing that such as come to the reserve in a con∣flict, bring with them alwayes more feare and terrour, then those that deal about them with their hands in the fight.</P>
<P>Neverthelesse he gave no alarm till all his souldiers had got within the wall, except the two hundred horsemen, whom he left without to secure his entry. Then did he give a most horrible shout, so did all these who were with him, and immediately thereafter without resistance, putting to the edge of the sword the guard that was at that gate, they opened it to the horsemen, with whom most furiously they altogether ran towards the
<PB N="217" REF="113"/>
East-gate, where all the hurlie burlie was, and coming close upon them in the reer, over∣threw all their forces. The besieged see∣ing that the <HI>Gargantuists</HI> had won the town upon them, and that they were like to be secure in no corner of it, submitted them∣selves unto the mercy of the <HI>Monk,</HI> and asked for quarter, which the <HI>Monk</HI> very nobly granted to them, yet made them lay down their armes; then shutting them up within Churches, gave order to seise upon all the staves of the Crosses, and placed men at the doores to keep them from coming forth; then opening that East-gate, he issued out to succour and assist <HI>Gargantua:</HI> but <HI>Pi∣crochole,</HI> thinking it had been some relief co∣ming to him from the towne, adventured more forwardly then before, and was upon the giving of a most desperate home-charge, when <HI>Gargantua</HI> cried out, Ha, Friar <HI>Ihon,</HI> my friend, Friar <HI>Ihon,</HI> you are come in a good houre; which unexpected accident so affrighted <HI>Picrochole</HI> and his men, that gi∣ving all for lost, they betook themselves to their heels, and fled on all hands. <HI>Gargantua</HI> chased them till they came near to <HI>Vaugau∣dry,</HI> killing and slaying all the way, and then sounded the retreat.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIX. <HI>How</HI> Picrochole <HI>in his flight fell into great misfortunes, and what</HI> Gargantua <HI>did after the battel.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>PIcrochole</HI> thus in despaire, fled towards the <HI>Bouchard</HI> island, and in the way to <HI>Rivere</HI> his horse stumbled and fell down, whereat he on a sudden was so incensed, that he with his sword without more ado killed him in his choler; then not finding any that would remount him, he was about to have taken an Asse at the Mill that was thereby: but the Millers men did so baste his bones, and so soundly bethwack him, that they made him both black and blew with strokes; then stripping him of all his clothes, gave him a scurvie old canvas jacket wherewith to cover his nakednesse. Thus went along this poor cholerick wretch, who passing the water at <HI>Porthuaux,</HI> and relating his misadventurous disasters, was fore∣told by an old <HI>Lourpidon</HI> hag, that his Kingdome should be restored to him at the coming of the <HI>Cocklicranes,</HI> which she called <HI>Coquecigrues.</HI> What is become of him since we cannot certainly tell, yet was I told that
<PB N="219" REF="114"/>
he is now a porter at <HI>Lyons,</HI> as testie and pet∣tish in humour as ever he was before, and would be alwayes with great lamentation enquiring at all strangers of the coming of the <HI>Cocklicranes,</HI> expecting assuredly, (ac∣cording to the old womans prophecie, that at their coming he shall be re-established in his Kingdom. The first thing <HI>Gargantua</HI> did after his return into the town, was to call the Muster-roll of his men, which when he had done, he found that there were very few either killed or wounded, only some few foot of Captain <HI>Tolmeres</HI> company, and <HI>Po∣nocrates</HI> who was shot with a musket-ball through the doublet. Then he caused them all at and in their several posts and divisions to take a little refreshment, which was very plenteously provided for them in the best drink and victuals that could be had for mo∣ney, and gave order to the Treasurers and Commissaries of the Army, to pay for and defray that repast, and that there should be no outrage at all, nor abuse committed in the town, seeing it was his own. And further∣more commanded, that immediately after the souldiers had done with eating and drink∣ing for that time sufficiently, and to their own hearts desire, a gathering should be beaten for bringing them altogether, to be drawn up on the <HI>Piazza</HI> before the Castle, there to receive six moneths pay compleat∣ly,
<PB N="220" REF="115"/>
all which was done. After this by his di∣rection, were brought before him in the said place, all those that remained of <HI>Picrocholes</HI> Party; unto whom in the presence of the Princes, Nobles and Officers of his Court and Army, he spoke as followeth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. L. Gargantua's <HI>speech to the vanquished.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Our forefathers and Ancestors of all times, have been of this nature and disposition, that upon the winning of a battel, they have chosen rather for a signe and memorial of their triumphs and victo∣ries, to erect trophies and monuments in the hearts of the vanquished by clemencie, then by architecture in the lands which they had conquered; for they did hold in greater esti∣mation, the lively remembrance of men purchased by liberality, then the dumb in∣scription of arches, pillars and pyramides, subject to the injury of stormes and tem∣pests, and to the envie of every one. You may very well remember of the courtesie, which by them was used towards the <HI>Bre∣tons,</HI> in the battel of St. <HI>Aubin</HI> of <HI>Cormier,</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="115"/>
and at the demolishing of <HI>Partenay.</HI> You have heard, and hearing admire their gentle comportment towards those at the barreers of <HI>Spaniola,</HI> who had plundered, wasted and ransacked the maritime borders of <HI>Olone</HI> and <HI>Talmondois.</HI> All this hemisphere of the world was filled with the praises and con∣gratulations, which your selves and your fa∣thers made, when <HI>Alpharbal</HI> King of <HI>Ca∣narre,</HI> not satisfied with his own fortunes, did most furiously invade the land of <HI>Onyx,</HI> and with cruel Piracies molest all the <HI>Armorick</HI> islands, and confine regions of <HI>Britanie;</HI> yet was he in a set naval fight justly taken and vanquished by my father, whom God preserve and protect. But what? whereas o∣ther Kings and Emperours, yea those who entitle themselves Catholiques, would have dealt roughly with him, kept him a close pri∣soner, and put him to an extream high ran∣som: he intreated him very courteously, lodged him kindly with himself in his own Palace, and out of his incredible mildnesse and gentle disposition sent him back with a safe conduct, loaden with gifts, loaden with favours, loaden with all offices of friendship: what fell out upon it? Being re∣turned into his countrey, he called a Parlia∣ment, where all the Princes and States of his Kingdom being assembled, he shewed them the humanity which he had found in
<PB N="222" REF="116"/>
us, and therefore wished them to take such course by way of compensation therin, as that the whole world might be edified by the ex∣ample, as well of their honest graciousnesse to us, as of our gracious honesty towards them. The result hereof was, that it was voted and decreed by an unanimous con∣sent, that they should offer up entirely their Lands, Dominions and Kingdomes, to be disposed of by us according to our plea∣sure.</P>
<P><HI>Alpharbal</HI> in his own person, presently re∣turned with nine thousand and thirty eight great ships of burden, bringing with him the treasures, not only of his house and royal linage, but almost of all the countrey be∣sides; for he imbarking himself, to set saile with a <HI>West-North-East</HI> winde, every one in heaps did cast into the ship gold, silver, rings, jewels, spices, drugs, and aromatical parfumes, parrets, pelicans, monkies, civet-cats, black-spotted weesils, porcupines, &amp;c. He was ac∣counted no good Mothers son, that did not cast in all the rare and precious things he had.</P>
<P>Being safely arrived, he came to my said father, and would have kist his feet: that action was found too submissively low, and therefore was not permitted, but in ex∣change he was most cordially embraced: he offfered his presents, they were not received,
<PB N="223" REF="116"/>
because they were too excessive: he yielded himself voluntarily a servant and vassal, and was content his whole posterity should be liable to the same bondage; this was not ac∣cepred of, because it seemed not equitable: he surrendered by vertue of the decree of his great Parliamentarie councel, his whole Countreys and Kingdomes to him, offering the Deed and Conveyance, signed, sealed and ratified by all those that were concerned in it; this was altogether refused, and the parchments cast into the fire. In end, this free good will, and simple meaning of the <HI>Canarriens,</HI> wrought such tendernesse in my fathers heart, that he could not abstain from shedding teares, and wept most profusely: then by choise words very congruously adapted, strove in what he could to dimi∣nish the estimation of the good offices which he had done them, saying, that any cour∣tesie he had conferred upon them, was not worth a rush, and what favour soever he had shewed them, he was bound to do it. But so much the more did <HI>Alpharbal</HI> augment the repute thereof. What was the issue? where∣as for his ransom in the greatest extremity of rigour, and most tyrannical dealing, could not have been exacted above twenty times a hundred thousand crownes, and his eldest sons detained as hostages, till that summe had been payed, they made themselves per∣petual
<PB N="224" REF="117"/>
tributaries, and obliged to give us e∣very year twomillions of gold at foure and twenty carats fine: The first year we received the whole sum of two millions: the second yeare of their own accord they payed freely to us three and twenty hundred thousand crowns: the third year six and twenty hun∣dred thousand; the fourth year three milli∣ons, and do so increase it alwayes out of their own good will, that we shall be constrained to forbid them to bring us any more. This is the nature of gratitude and true thank∣fulnesse. For time which gnawes and dimi∣nisheth all things else, augments and increa∣seth benefits; because a noble action of li∣berality done to a man of reason, doth gnaw continually, by his generous thinking of it, and remembring it.</P>
<P>Being unwilling therefore any way to de∣generate from the hereditary mildnesse and clemency of my Parents; I do now forgive you, deliver you from all fines and impri∣sonments, fully release you, set you at liber∣ty, and every way make you as frank and free as ever you were before. Moreover, at your going out of the gate, you shall have every one of you three moneths pay to bring you home into your houses and fami∣lies, and shall have a safe convoy of six hun∣dred cuirasiers and eight thousand foot un∣der the conduct of <HI>Alexander,</HI> Esquire of
<PB N="225" REF="117"/>
my body, that the Clubmen of the Coun∣trey may not do you any injury. <HI>God be with you.</HI> I am sorry from my heart that <HI>Picro∣chole</HI> is not here; for I would have given him to understand, that this warre was un∣dertaken against my will, and without any hope to increase either my goods or renown: but seeing he is lost, and that no man can tell where nor how he went away, it is my will that his Kingdom remain entire to his sonne; who because he is too young, (he not being yet full five yeares old) shall be brought up and instructed by the ancient Princes, and learned men of the Kingdom. And because a Realm thus desolate, may easily come to ruine; if the covetousnesse and avarice of those, who by their places are obliged to ad∣minister justice in it, be not curbed and re∣strained: I ordain and will have it so, that <HI>Pono∣crates</HI> be overseer &amp; superintendent above all his governours, with whatever power and au∣thority is requisite thereto, &amp; that he be con∣tinually with the childe, until he finde him a∣ble &amp; capable to rule and govern by himself.</P>
<P>Now I must tell you, that you are to un∣derstand how a too feeble and dissolute faci∣lity in pardoning evil-doers, giveth them oc∣casion to commit wickednesse afterwards more readily, upon this pernicious confi∣dence of receiving favour; I consider, that <HI>Moses,</HI> the meekest man that was in his time
<PB N="226" REF="118"/>
upon the earth, did severely punish the mu∣tinous and seditious people of <HI>Israel:</HI> I consider likewise, that <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> who was so gracious an Emperour, that <HI>Cicero</HI> said of him, that his fortune had nothing more excellent then that he could; and his vertue nothing better, then that he would alwayes save and pardon every man: He notwithstanding all this, did in certain pla∣ces most rigorously punish the authors of rebellion; After the example of these good men, it is my will and pleasure, that you de∣liver over unto me before you depart hence, first, that fine fellow <HI>Marquet,</HI> who was the prime cause, origin and ground-work of this warre, by his vain presumption and o∣verweening: secondly, his fellow-cakeba∣kers, who were neglective in checking and reprehending his idle haire-brain'd humour in the instant time: and lastly, all the Coun∣cellors, Captains, Officers and Domesticks of <HI>Picrochole,</HI> who had been incendiaries or fomenters of the warre, by provoking, prai∣sing or counselling him to come out of his li∣mits thus to trouble us.</P>

<P><PB N="227" REF="118"/>
WHen <HI>Gargantua</HI> had finished his speech, the seditious men whom he required, were delivered up unto him, except <HI>Swashbuckler, Durtaille</HI> and <HI>Smaltrash,</HI> who ran away sixe houres before the battel, one of them as farre as to <HI>Lainielneck</HI> at one course, another to the valley of <HI>Vire,</HI> and the third even unto <HI>Logroine,</HI> without looking back, or taking breath by the way; and two of the Cake-bakers who were slaine in the fight, <HI>Gargantua</HI> did them no other hurt, but that he appointed them to pull at the Presses of his Printing-house, which he had newly set up: then those who died there he caused to be honourably buried in <HI>Black-soile-</HI>valley, and <HI>Burn-hag-field,</HI> and gave order that the wounded should be drest and had care of in his great Hospital or <HI>Nosocome.</HI> Af∣ter this, considering the great prejudice done to the towne and its inhabitants, he re-im∣bursed their charges, and repaired all the los∣ses that by their confession upon oath could appear they had sustained: and for their bet∣ter defence and security in times coming a∣gainst all sudden uproars and invasions, com∣manded a strong cittadel to be built there with a competent Garison to maintaine it; at his departure he did very graciously thank all the souldiers of the brigades that had been at this overthrow, and sent them back to their winter-quarters in their several stations
<PB N="228" REF="119"/>
and Garisons; the <HI>Decumane Legion</HI> onely excepted, whom in the field on that day he saw do some great exploit, and their Cap∣tains also, whom he brought along with him∣self unto <HI>Grangousier.</HI></P>
<P>At the sight and coming of them, the good man was so joyful, that it is not possi∣ble fully to describe it; he made them a feast the most magnificent, plentiful, and delici∣ous that ever was seen since the time of the King <HI>Assuerus;</HI> at the taking up of the table he distributed amongst them his whole cup∣board of plate, which weighed eight hundred thousand &amp; fourteen <HI>Besants</HI> of gold, in great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Each <HI>Besant</HI> is worth five pounds English money.</NOTE> antick vessels, huge pots, large basins, big tas∣ses, cups, goblets, candlesticks, comfit-boxes, and other such plate, all of pure massie gold besides the precious stones, enameling and workmanship, which by all mens estimation was more worth then the matter of the gold; then unto every one of them out of his cof∣fers caused he to be given the summe of twelve hundred thousand crownes ready money: and further he gave to each of them for ever and in perpetuity (unlesse he should happen to decease without heires) such Ca∣stles and neighbouring lands of his as were most commodious for them: to <HI>Ponocrates</HI> he gave the rock <HI>Clermond;</HI> to <HI>Gymnast,</HI> the <HI>Coudray;</HI> to <HI>Eudemon, Monpensier, Rinan,</HI> to <HI>Tolmere;</HI> to <HI>Ithibolle, Montsaurean;</HI> to <HI>Aca∣mas,

<P>THere was left onely the Monk to pro∣vide for, whom <HI>Gargantua</HI> would have made Abbot of <HI>Seville,</HI> but he refused it; he would have given him the Abby of <HI>Bourgu∣eil,</HI> or of Sanct <HI>Florent</HI> which was better, or both, if it pleased him; but the Monk gave him a very peremptory answer, that he would never take upon him the charge nor government of Monks; For how shall I be able (said he) to rule over others, that have not full power and command of my self: if you think I have done you, or may hereafter do any acceptable service, give me leave to found an Abby after my owne minde and fancie; the motion pleased <HI>Gargantua</HI> very well, who thereupon offered him all the Countrey of <HI>Tholem</HI> by the river of <HI>Loire,</HI>
<PB N="230" REF="120"/>
till within two leagues of the great forrest of <HI>Port-huaut:</HI> the <HI>Monk</HI> then requested <HI>Gar∣gantua</HI> to institute his religious order contra∣ry to all others. First then (said <HI>Gargantua)</HI> you must not build a wall about your con∣vent, for all other Abbies are strongly wal∣led and mured about: See (said the <HI>Monk)</HI> and not without cause <HI>(seeing wall and mure signifie but one and the same thing;)</HI> where there is <HI>Mur</HI> before, and <HI>Mur</HI> behinde, there is store of <HI>Murmur,</HI> envie, and mutual con∣spiracie. Moreover, seeing there are certain convents in the world, whereof the custome is, if any woman come in (I mean chaste and honest women) they immediately sweep the ground which they have trod upon; there∣fore was it ordained that if any man or woman entered into religious orders, should by chance come within this new Abbey, all the roomes should be throughly washed and cleansed through which they had passed; and because in all other Monasteries and Nunneries all is compassed, limited, and re∣gulated bv houres, it was decreed that in this new structure there should be neither Clock nor Dial, but that according to the opportu∣nities, and incident occasions, all their hours should be disposed of; for (said <HI>Gargantua)</HI> The greatest losse of time that I know, is to count the hours, what good comes of it? nor can there be any greater dotage in the world,
<PB N="231" REF="120"/>
then for one to guide and direct his courses by the sound of a Bell, and not by his owne judgement and discretion.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> Because at that time they put no wo∣men into Nunneries, but such as were either purblinde, blinkards, lame, crooked, ill-fa∣voured, mis-shapen, fooles, senselesse, spoyl∣ed or corrupt; nor encloystered any men, but those that were either sickly, subject to de∣fluxions, ill-bred lowts, simple sots, or pee∣vish trouble-houses: but to the purpose; (said the <HI>Monk)</HI> A woman that is neither faire nor good, to what use serves she? To make a Nunne of, said <HI>Gargantua:</HI> Yea said the <HI>Monk)</HI> and to make shirts and smocks; there∣fore was it ordained that into this religious order should be admitted no women that were not faire, well featur'd, and of a sweet disposition; nor men that were not comely, personable and well conditioned.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> Because in the convents of women men come not but under-hand, privily, and by stealth; it was therefore enacted that in this house there shall be no women in case there be not men, nor men in case there be not women.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> Because both men and women that are received into religious orders after the expi∣ring of their noviciat or probation-year, were constrained and forced perpetually to stay there all the days of their life; it was therfore
<PB N="232" REF="121"/>
ordered, that all whatever, men or women, admitted within this Abbey, should have full leave to depart with peace and contentment, whensoever it should seem good to them so to do.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> for that the religious men and women did ordinarily make three Vows, to wit, those of chastity, poverty &amp; obedience, it was ther∣fore constituted and appointed, that in this Convent they might be honourably marri∣ed, that they might be rich, and live at liberty. In regard of the legitimat time of the persons to be initiated, and years under and above, which they were not capable of reception, the women were to be admitted from ten till fifteen, and the men from twelve til eighteen.</P>

crowns of the Sunne, and as many of the seven starres, to be charged all upon the re∣ceit of the custom. For the foundation and maintenance thereof for ever, he setled a perpetual fee-farm-rent of three and twenty hundred, threescore and nine thousand, five hundred and fourteen rose nobles, exempted from all homage, fealty, service or burden whatsoever, and payable every yeare at the gate of the Abbey; and of this by letters pat∣tent passed a very good grant. The Archi∣tecture was in a figure hexagonal, and in such a fashion, that in every one of the six corners there was built a great round tow∣er of threescore foot in diameter, and were all of alike forme and bignesse. Upon the north-side ran along the river of <HI>Loire,</HI> on the bank whereof was situated the tower called <HI>Arctick:</HI> going towards the East, there was another called <HI>Calaer,</HI> the next following <HI>Anatole;</HI> the next <HI>Mesembrine:</HI> the next <HI>Hesperia,</HI> and the last <HI>Criere.</HI> Every tower was distant from other the space of three hundred and twelve paces. The whole Aedifice was every where six stories high, reckoning the Cellars under ground for one: the second was arched after the fashion of a basket-handle; the rest were seeled with pure wainscot, flourished with <HI>Flanders</HI> fret∣work, in the forme of the foot of a lamp: and covered above with fine slates, with

<P>This same building was a hundred times more sumptuous and magnificent then e∣ver was <HI>Bonnivet, Chambourg</HI> or <HI>Chantillie;</HI> for there were in it nine thousand, three hundred and two and thirty chambers, eve∣ry one whereof had a withdrawing room, a handsom closet, a wardrobe, an oratory, and neat passage, leading into a great and spacious hall.

In the midst there was a wonderful scalier or winding∣staire, the entry whereof was without the house, in a vault or arch six fathom broad. It was made in such symmetrie and large∣nesse, that six men at armes with their lances in their rests, might together in a breast ride all up to the very top of all the Palace; from the tower <HI>Anatole</HI> to the <HI>Mesembrine</HI> were faire spacious galleries, all coloured over and painted with the ancient prowesses, histo∣ries and descriptions of the world.

<HEAD>CHAP. LV. <HI>What manner of dwelling the</HI> Thele∣mites <HI>had.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the middle of the lower Court there was a stately fountain of faire Alabaster; upon the top thereof stood the three Graces, with their <HI>cornucopias,</HI> or hornes of abun∣dance, and did jert out the water at their breasts, mouth, eares, eyes, and other open passages of the body; the inside of the build∣ings in this lower Court stood upon great pillars of <HI>Cassydonie</HI> stone, and <HI>Porphyrie</HI> marble, made arch-wayes after a goodly an∣tick fashion. Within those were spacious galleries, long and large, adorned with cu∣rious pictures, the hornes of Bucks and Uni∣corns:
<PB N="241" REF="125"/>
with <HI>Rhinoceroses,</HI> water-horses cal∣led <HI>Hippopotames,</HI> the teeth and tusks of Ele∣phants, and other things well worth the be∣holding. The lodging of the Ladies <HI>(for so we may call those gallant women)</HI> took up all from the tower <HI>Arctick</HI> unto the gate <HI>Me∣sembrine:</HI> the men possessed the rest, be∣fore the said lodging of the Ladies, that they might have their recreation betweeen the two first towers. On the out-side were placed the tilt-yard, the barriers or lists for turnements, the <HI>hippodrome</HI> or riding Court, the <HI>theater</HI> or publike play-house, and <HI>Na∣tatorie</HI> or place to swim in, with most ad∣mirable bathes in three stages, situated above one another, well furnished with all neces∣sary accommodation, and store of myrtle∣water. By the river-side was the faire garden of pleasure: and in the midst of that the glorious labyrinth. Between the two other towers were the Courts for the tennis and the baloon. Towards the tower <HI>Criere</HI> stood the Orchard full of all fruit-trees, set and ranged in a <HI>quincuncial</HI> order. At the end of that was the great Park, abounding with all sort of Venison. Betwixt the third couple of towers were the buts and marks for shooting with a snap work-gun, an ordi∣nary bowe for common archery, or with a Crosse-bowe. The office-houses were with∣out the tower <HI>Hesperie,</HI> of one story high.
<PB N="242" REF="126"/>
The stables were beyond the offices, and be∣fore themstood the falconrie, managed by Ostridge-keepers and Falconers, very ex∣pert in the Art, and it was yearly supplied and furnished by the <HI>Candians, Venetians, Sarmates</HI> (now called <HI>Moscoviters)</HI> with all sorts of most excellent hawks, <HI>eagles, gerfal∣cons, gosehawkes, sacres, lanners, falcons, sparrowhawks, Marlins,</HI> and other kindes of them, so gentle and perfectly well manned, that flying of themselves sometimes from the Castle for their own disport, they would not faile to catch whatever they encountred. The Venerie where the Beagles and Hounds were kept, was a little farther off drawing towards the Park.</P>
<P>All the halls, chambers, and closets or ca∣binets, were richly hung-with tapestrie, and hangings of divers sorts, according to the va∣riety of the seasons of the year. All the pavements and floors were covered with green cloth: the beds were all embroi∣dered: in every back-chamber or with∣drawing room there was a looking-glasse of pure crystal set in a frame of fine gold, garnished all about with pearles, and was of such greatnesse, that it would represent to the full the whole lineaments and propor∣tion of the person that stood before it. At the going out of the halls, which belong to the Ladies lodgings, were the perfumers and
<PB N="243" REF="126"/>
trimmers, through whose hands the gallants past when they were to visit the Ladies; those sweet Artificers did every morning furnish the Ladies chambers with the spirit of roses, orange-flower-water and <HI>Angelica;</HI> and to each of them gave a little precious casket vapouring forth the most odorife∣rous exhalations of the choicest aromatical sents.</P>

<DIV2 N="56" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LVI. <HI>How the men and women of the religious order of</HI> Theleme <HI>were apparelled.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Ladies at the foundation of this order, were apparelled after their own pleasure and liking: but since that of their own accord and free will they have reform∣ed themselves, their accountrement is in man∣ner as followeth. They wore stockins of scar∣let crimson, or ingrained purple die, which reached just three inches above the knee, having a list beautified with exquisite em∣broideries, and rare incisions of the Cutters Art. Their garters were of the colour of their bracelets, and circled the knee a little, both over and under. Their shoes, pumps and slippers were either of red, violet, or crimfon-velvet, pinked and jagged like Lob∣ster wadles.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="127"/>
Next to their smock they put on the pret∣ty kirtle or vasquin of pure silk chamlet: above that went the taffatie or tabie vardin-gale, of white, red, tawnie, gray, or of any other colour; Above this taffatie petticoat they had another of cloth of tissue or broca∣do, embroidered with fine gold, and inter∣laced with needle-work, or as they thought good, and according to the temperature and disposition of the weather, had their upper coats of sattin, damask or velvet, and those either orange, tawnie, green, ash-coloured, blew, yelow, bright, red, crimson or white, and so forth; or had them of cloth of gold, cloth of silver, or some other choise stuffe, inrich∣ed with purle, or embroidered according to the dignity of the festival dayes and times wherein they wore them.</P>
<P>Their gownes being still correspondent to the season, were either of cloth of gold friz∣led with a silver-raised work; of red sattin, covered with gold purle: of tabie, or taffa∣tie, white, blew, black, tawnie, &amp;c. of silk serge, silk chamlot, velvet, cloth of silver, silver tissue, cloth of gold, gold wire, figu∣red velvet, or figured sattin tinselled and overcast with golden threads, in divers vari∣ously purfled draughts.</P>
<P>In summer some dayes in stead of gowns they wore light handsome mantles, made ei∣ther of the stuffe of the aforesaid attire, or
<PB N="245" REF="127"/>
like <HI>Moresco</HI> rugs, of violet, velvet frizled, with a raised work of gold upon silver purle: or with a knotted cord-work of gold em∣broiderie, every where garnished with little <HI>Indian</HI> pearles. They alwayes carried a faire <HI>Pannache,</HI> or plume of feathers, of the co∣lour of their muffe, bravely adorned and tricked out with glistering spangles of gold. In the winter-time they had their taffatie gownes of all colours, as above-named: and those lined with the rich furrings of hinde-wolves, or speckled linxes, black-sported weesils, martlet-skins of <HI>Calabria,</HI> sables, and other costly furres of an inestimable value. Their beads, rings, bracelets, collars, carcanets and neck-chaines were all of pre∣cious stones, such as carbuncles, rubies, ba∣leus, diamonds, saphirs, emeralds, turkoises, garnets, agates, berilles, and excellent mar∣garits. Their head-dressing also varied with the season of the yeare, according to which they decked themselves. In winter it was of the <HI>French</HI> fashion, in the spring of the <HI>Spa∣nish:</HI> in summer of the fashion of <HI>Tuscanie,</HI> except only upon the holy dayes and Sun∣dayes, at which times they were accoutred in the <HI>French</HI> mode, because they accounted it more honourable, and better befitting the garb of a matronal pudicity.</P>
<P>The men were apparelled after their fashi∣on: their stockins were of tamine or of cloth-serge,
<PB N="246" REF="128"/>
of white, black, scarlet, or some o∣ther ingrained colour: their breeches were of velvet, of the same colour with their stockins, or very near, embroidered and cut according to their fancy: their doublet was of cloth of gold, of cloth of silver, of velvet, sattin, damask, taffaties, &amp;c. of the same co∣loures, cut, embroidered, and suitably trim∣med up in perfection: the points were of silk of the same colours; the tags were of gold well enameled: their coats and jerkins were of cloth of gold, cloth of silver, gold, tissue or velvet embroidered, as they thought fit: their gownes were every whit as costly as those of the Ladies: their girdles were of silk, of the colour of their doublets▪ every one had a gallant sword by his side, the hilt and handle whereof were gilt, and the scabbard of velvet, of the colour of his breeches, with a chape of gold, and pure Goldsmiths work: the dagger was of the same: their caps or bonnets were of black velvet, adorned with jewels and buttons of gold: upon that they wore a white plume, most prettily aud minion-like, parted by so many rowes of gold spangles, at the end whereof hung dangling in a more sparkling resplendencie faire rubies, emeralds, dia∣monds, &amp;c. but there was such a sympathy betwixt the gallants &amp; the Ladies, that every day they were apparelled in the same livery:
<PB N="247" REF="128"/>
and that they might not misse, there were certain Gentlemen appointed to tell the youths every morning what vestments the Ladies would on that day weare; for all was done according to the pleasure of the Ladies. In these so handsome clothes, and a∣biliaments so rich, think not that either one or other of either sexe did waste any time at all; for the Masters of the wardrobes had all their raiments and apparel so ready for every morning, and the chamber-Ladies so well skilled, that in a trice they would be dressed, and compleatly in their clothes from head to foot. And to have those ac∣coutrements with the more conveniency; there was about the wood of <HI>Teleme</HI> a row of houses of the extent of half a league, ve∣ry neat and cleanly, wherein dwelt the Goldsmiths, Lapidaries, Jewellers, Embroi∣derers, Tailors, Gold-drawers, Velvet-wea∣vers, Tapestrie-makers and Upholsters, who wrought there every one in his own trade, and all for the aforesaid jollie Friars and Nuns of the new stamp; they were furnish∣ed with matter and stuffe from the hands of the Lord <HI>Nausiclete,</HI> who every year brought them seven ships from the <HI>Perlas</HI> &amp; <HI>Cannibal</HI>-islands, laden with ingots of gold, with raw silk, with pearles and precious stones. And if any <HI>margarites</HI> (called <HI>unions)</HI> began to grow old, and lose somewhat of their natural

whitenesse and lustre, those with their Art they did renew, by tendering them to eat to some pretty cocks, as they use to give casting unto hawkes.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="57" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LVII. <HI>How the</HI> Thelemites <HI>were governed, and of their manner of living.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL their life was spent not in lawes, sta∣tutes or rules, but according to their own free will and pleasure. They rose out of their beds, when they thought good: they did eat, drink, labour, sleep, when they had a minde to it, and were disposed for it. None did awake them, none did offer to constrain them to eat, drink, nor to do any other thing; for so had <HI>Gargantua</HI> establish∣ed it. In all their rule, and strictest tie of their order, there was but this one clause to be observed.</P>
<Q><P>Do what thou wilt.</P></Q>
<P>Because men that are free, well-borne, well-bred, and conversant in honest com∣panies, have naturally an instinct and spurre that prompteth them unto vertuous actions,
<PB N="249" REF="129"/>
and withdraws them from vice, which is cal∣led <HI>honour.</HI> Those same men, when by base subjection and constraint they are brought under and kept down, turn aside from that noble disposition, by which they formerly were inclined to vertue, to shake off and break that bond of servitude, wherein they are so tyrannously inslaved; for it is agree∣able with the nature of man to long after things forbidden, and to desire what is de∣nied us.</P>
<P>By this liberty they entered into a very laudable emulation, to do all of them what they saw did please one; if any of the gal∣lants or Ladies should say, <HI>Let us drink,</HI> they would all drink: if any one of them said, <HI>Let us play,</HI> they all played; if one said, <HI>Let us go a walking into the fields,</HI> they went all: if it were to go a hawking or a hunting, the Ladies mounted upon dainty well-paced nags, seated in a stately palfrey saddle, carried on their lovely fists miniard∣ly begloved every one of them, either a Sparhawk, or a Laneret, or a Marlin, and the young gallants carried the other kinds of Hawkes: so nobly were they taught, that there was neither he nor she amongst them, but could read, write, sing, play upon several musical instruments, speak five or sixe seve∣ral languages, and compose in them all very quaintly, both in Verse and Prose: never
<PB N="250" REF="130"/>
were seene so valiant Knights, so noble and worthy, so dextrous and skilful both on foot and a horseback, more brisk and lively, more nimble and quick, or better handling all man∣ner of weapons then were there. Never were seene Ladies so proper and handsome, so mi∣niard and dainty, lesse froward, or more rea∣dy with their hand, and with their needle, in every honest and free action belonging to that sexe then were there: for this reason when the time came, that any man of the said Abbey, either at the request of his parents, or for some other cause, had a minde to go out of it, he carried along with him one of the Ladies, namely her whom he had before that chosen for his Mistris, and were married together: and if they had formerly in <HI>The∣leme</HI> lived in good devotion and amity, they did continue therein and increase it to a greater height in their state of matrimony: and did entertaine that mutual love till the very last day of their life, in no lesse vigour and fervency, then at the very day of their wedding: here must not I forget to set down unto you a riddle, which was found under the ground, as they were laying the foundation of the Abbey, ingraven in a copper plate; and it was thus as followeth.</P>

<HEAD>A Propheticall Riddle.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>POor mortals, who wait for a happy day,</L>
<L>Cheer up your hearts, and hear what I shall say:</L>
<L>If it be lawful firmly to beleeve,</L>
<L>That the celestial bodies can us give</L>
<L>Wisdom to judge of things that are not yet:</L>
<L>Or if from Heav'n such wisdom we may get,</L>
<L>As may with confidence make us discourse</L>
<L>Of years to come, their destinie and course;</L>
<L>I to my hearers give to understand,</L>
<L>That this next Winter, though it be at hand,</L>
<L>Yea and before, there shall appear a race</L>
<L>Of men, who loth to sit still in one place</L>
<L>Shall boldly go before all peoples eyes,</L>
<L>Suborning men of divers qualities,</L>
<L>To draw them unto covenants and sides,</L>
<L>In such a manner, that whate're betides,</L>
<L>They'l move you, if you give them eare (no doubt)</L>
<L>With both your friends and kinred to fall out.</L>
<L>They make a vassal to gain-stand his Lord,</L>
<L>And children their own Parents, in a Word</L>
<L>All reverence shall then be banished:</L>
<L>No true respect to other shall be had:</L>
<L>They'l say that every man should have his turn,</L>
<L>Both in his going forth, and his return;</L>
<L><PB N="252" REF="131"/>
And hereupon there shall arise such woes,</L>
<L>Such jarrings, and confused toos and froes,</L>
<L>That never were in history such coyles</L>
<L>Set down as yet, such tumults and garboyles.</L>
<L>Then shall you many gallant men, see by</L>
<L>Valour stirr'd up, and youthful fervencie,</L>
<L>Who trusting too much in their hopeful time,</L>
<L>Live but a while, and perish in their prime.</L>
<L>Neither shall any who this course shall run,</L>
<L>Leave off the race which he hath once begun,</L>
<L>Till they the heavens with noise by their contention</L>
<L>Have fill'd, and with their steps the earths dimension.</L>
<L>Then those shall have no lesse authority,</L>
<L>That have no faith, then those that will not lie;</L>
<L>For all shall be governed by a rude,</L>
<L>Base, ignorant, and foolish multitude;</L>
<L>The veriest lowt of all shall be their Judge.</L>
<L>O horrible, and dangerous deluge!</L>
<L>Deluge I call it, and that for good reason,</L>
<L>For this shall be omitted in no season:</L>
<L>Nor shall the earth of this foule stirre be free,</L>
<L>Till suddenly you in great store shall see</L>
<L>The waters issue out, with whose streams the</L>
<L>Most moderate of all shall moist'ned be,</L>
<L>And justly too; because they did not spare</L>
<L>The flocks of beasts that innocentest are,</L>
<L>But did their sinews, and their bowels take,</L>
<L>Not to the gods a sacrifice to make,</L>
<L>But usually to serve themselves for sport;</L>
<L>And now consider, I do you exhort,</L>
<L>In such commotions so continual,</L>
<L><PB N="253" REF="131"/>
What rest can take the globe terrestrial?</L>
<L>Most happy then are they, that can it hold,</L>
<L>And use it carefully as precious gold,</L>
<L>By keeping it in Goale, whence it shall have</L>
<L>No help but him, who being to it gave:</L>
<L>And to increase his mournful accident,</L>
<L>The Sunne, before it set in th' occident;</L>
<L>Shall cease to dart upon it any light,</L>
<L>More then in an eclipse, or in the night.</L>
<L>So that at once its favour shall be gone,</L>
<L>And liberty with it be left alone.</L>
<L>And yet before it come to ruine thus,</L>
<L>Its quaking shall be as impetuous</L>
<L>As <HI>Aetna</HI>'s was, when <HI>Titan</HI>'s sons lay under,</L>
<L>And yeeld, when lest, a fearful sound like thunder.</L>
<L><HI>Inarime</HI> did not more quickly move,</L>
<L>When <HI>Typheûs</HI> did the vast huge hills remove,</L>
<L>And for despite into the sea them threw.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus shall it then be lost by wayes not few,</L>
<L>And changed suddenly, when those that have it</L>
<L>To other men that after come shall leave it.</L>
<L>Then shall it be high time to cease from this</L>
<L>So long, so great, so tedious exercise;</L>
<L>For the great waters told you now by me,</L>

<P>No sooner was this aenigmatical monu∣ment read over, but <HI>Gargantua</HI> fetching a very deep sigh, said unto those that stood by, It is not now only (I perceive) that People called to the faith of the Gospel, and convinced with the certainty of Evange∣lical truths are persecuted; but happy is that man that shall not be scandalized, but shall alwayes continue to the end, in aiming at that mark, which God by his dear Son hath set before us, without being distracted or diverted by his carnal affections and depra∣ved nature.</P>

After the two chases are made, he that was in the up∣per end of the tennis-court goeth out, and the other cometh in. They beleeve the first, that saith the ball was over or under the line. The waters are the heats that the players take till they sweat again. The cords of the rackets are made of the guts of sheep or goats. The Globe terrestrial is the tennis-ball. After playing, when the game is done, they refresh themselves before a clear fire, and change their shirts: and very willingly they make all good cheer, but most merrily those that have gained; And so farewel.</P>

company of just that number; and that therefore the charging of the whole Impression with it, is meerly to be imputed to the negligence of the Presse-men, who receiving it about the latter end of the night, were so eager before the next morning to afford compleat books, that as they began, they went on, without animadverting what was recommended to their discretion: This is hoped will suffice to assure the ingenuous</HI> Reader, <HI>that in no Treatise of the Translators, (whether Original or Translatitious) shall wil∣lingly be offered the meanest rub to the reputa∣tion of any worthy Gentleman, and that how∣ever Providence dispose of him, no misfortune shall be able to induce his minde to any compla∣cency in the disparagement of another.</HI></P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Ost Illustrious and thrice valour∣ous Champions, Gentlemen and others, who willingly ap∣ply your mindes to the enter∣tainment of pretty conceits, and honest harmlesse knacks of wit: You have not long ago seen, read and un∣derstood the great and inestimable Chronicle of the huge and mighty Gyant</HI> Gargantua, <HI>and like upright Faithfullists, have firmly beleeved all to be true that is contained in them, and have very often past your time with them, amongst Honourable Ladies and Gentlewomen, telling them faire long stories, when you were out of all other talk, for which you are worthy of great praise and sempiternal memory: and I do hear∣tily wish that every man would lay aside his own businesse, meddle no more with his Professi∣on nor Trade, and throw all affaires concerning himself behinde his back, to attend this wholly, without distracting or troubling his minde

with any thing else, until he have learned them without book; that if by chance the Art of printing should cease, or in case that in time to come all books should perish, every man might truly teach them unto his children, and deliver them over to his successors and survivors from hand to hand, as a religious</HI> Cabal; <HI>for there is in it more profit, then a rabble of great pockie Loggerheads are able to discern, who surely un∣derstand far lesse in these little merriments, then the foole</HI> Raclet <HI>did in the institutions of</HI> Ju∣stinian.</P>
<P><HI>I have known great and mighty Lords, and of those not a few, who going a Deer-hunting, or a hawking after wilde Ducks, when the chase had not encountred with the blinks, that were cast in her way to retard her course, or that the Hawk did but</HI> plaine <HI>and smoothly fly without moving her wings, perceiving the prey by force of flight to have gained bounds of her, have been much chafed and vexed, as you understand well enough; but the comfort unto which they had refuge, and that they might not take cold, was to relate the inestimable deeds of the said</HI> Gargantua. <HI>There are others in the world, (These are no flimflam stories, nor tales of a tub) who being much troubled with the tooth-ache, after they had spent their goods upon Phy∣sicians, without receiving at all any ease of their pain, have found no more ready remedy, then to put the said</HI> Chronicles <HI>betwixt two pieces of
<PB REF="139"/>
linnen cloth made somewhat hot, and so apply them to the place that smarteth, synapising them with a little powder of projection, other∣wayes called</HI> doribus.</P>
<P><HI>But what shall I say of those poor men, that are plagued with the Pox and the Gowt? O how often have we seen them, even immediate∣ly after they were anointed and throughly greased, till their faces did glister like the Key-hole of a powdering tub, their teeth dance like the jacks of a paire of little Organs or Virginals, when they are played upon, and that they foamed from their very throats like a boare, which the Mon∣grel Mastiffe-hounds have driven in, and over∣thrown amongst the foyles: what did they then? All their consolation was to have some page of the said Roll-book read unto them: and we have seen those who have given themselves to a hundred punchions of old devils, in case that they did not feele a manifest ease and asswage∣ment of paine, at he hearing of the said book read, even when they were kept in a purgatory of torment; no more nor lesse then women in travel use to sinde their sorrow abated, when the life of St.</HI> Margarite <HI>is read unto them: is this nothing? finde me a book in any language, in any faculty or science whatsoever, that hath such vertues, properties and prerogatives, and I will be content to pay you a quart of tripes. No, my Masters, no, it is peerlesse, incomparable, and not to be matched; and this am I resolved
<PB REF="139"/>
for ever to maintaine even unto the fire</HI> ex∣clusive. <HI>And those that will pertinaciously hold the contrary opinion, let them be account∣ed Abusers, Predestinators, Impostors and Se∣ducers of the People; it is very true, that there are found in some gallant and stately books, wor∣thy of high estimation, certain occult and hid properties; in the number of which are reck∣oned</HI> Whippot, Orlando furio so, Robert the devil, Fierabras, William without feare, Hu∣on <HI>of</HI> Bourdeaux, Monteville, <HI>and</HI> Mata∣brune: <HI>but they are not comparable to that which we speak of; and the world hath well known by infallible experience, the great emolu∣ment and utility which it hath received by this</HI> Gargantuine <HI>Chronicle; for the Printers have sold more of them in two moneths time, then there will be bought of Bibles in nine yeares.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I therefore (your humble slave) being very willing to increase your solace and recreation yet a little more, do offer you for a Present another book of the same stamp, only that it is a little more reasonable and worthy of credit then the other was; for think not, (unlesse you wilfully will erre against your knowledge) that I speak of it as the</HI> Jewes <HI>do of the Law; I was not born under such a Planet, neither did it ever be∣fall me to lie, or affirme a thing for true that was not: I speak of it like a lustie frolick</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Onocra∣tal <HI>is a bird not much unlike a Swaa, which sings like an Asses bray∣ing.</HI></NOTE> O∣nocrotarie, <HI>I should say</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Croteno∣taire <HI>or</HI> no∣taire crotré croqueno∣taire <HI>or</HI> no∣taire cro∣qué <HI>are but allusions in decision of</HI> Protono∣taire, <HI>which signifieth a</HI> Pregno∣tarie.</NOTE> Crotenotarie, <HI>of the martyrised Lovers and</HI> Croquenotarie <HI>of love:</HI>

<P><HI>And therefore to make an end of this Pro∣logue, even as I give my selfe to an hundred Panniers-full of faire devils, body and soule, tripes and guts, in case that I lie so much as one single word in this whole History: After the like manner, St.</HI> Anthonies <HI>fire burne you:</HI> Mahooms <HI>disease whirle you; the squinance with a stitch in your side, and the</HI> Wolfe <HI>in your stomack trusse you, the bloody flux seize upon you, the curst sharp inflammations of wilde fire, as slender and thin as Cowes haire, strengthened with quick silver, enter into your fundament, and like those of</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrha, <HI>may you fall into sulphur, fire and bottomlesse pits, in case you do not firmly beleeve all that I shall relate unto you in this present</HI> Chronicle.</P>

the balance known by the name of <HI>Libra,</HI> which are cases very terrible, and mat∣ters so hard and difficult, that <HI>Astrologians</HI> cannot set their teeth in them; and indeed their teeth had been pretty long if they could have reached thither.</P>
<P>However account you it for a truth, that every body then did most heartily eat of those medlars, for they were faire to the eye, and in taste delicious: but even as <HI>Noah</HI> that holy man, (to whom we are so much behold∣ing, bound and obliged, for that he planted to us the Vine, from whence we have that nectarian, delicious, precious, heavenly, joy∣ful and deifick liquour, which they call the <HI>piot</HI> or <HI>tiplage)</HI> was deceived in the drinking of it, for he was ignorant of the great vertue and power thereof: so likewise the men and women of that time did delight much in the eating of that faire great fruit, but divers and very different accidents did ensue thereupon; for there fell upon them all in their bodies a most terrible swelling, but not upon all in the same place, for some were swollen in the belly, and their belly strouted out big like a great tun, of whom it is written <HI>ventrem om∣nipotentem,</HI> who were all very honest men, and merry blades: and of this race came <HI>St. Fatgulch</HI> and <HI>Shrovetuesday;</HI> Others did swell <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pansart mardigras.</NOTE> at the shoulders, who in that place were so crump and knobbie; that they were therefore
<PB N="4" REF="142"/>
called <HI>Montifers,</HI> (which is as much to say as <HI>Hill-carriers,)</HI> of whom you see some yet in the world of divers sexes and degrees: of this race came <HI>Aesop,</HI> some of whose excel∣lent words and deeds you have in writing: some other <HI>puffes</HI> did swell in length by the member, which they call the Labourer of nature, in such sort that it grew marvellous long, fat, great, lustie, stirring and Crest∣risen, in the Antick fashion, so that they made use of it as of a girdle, winding it five or six times about their waste: but if it happened the foresaid member to be in good case, spooming with a full saile bunt faire before the winde, then to have seen those strouting Champions, you would have taken them for men that had their lances setled on their Rest, to run at the ring or tilting <HI>whintam:</HI> of these beleeve me the race is utterly lost and quite extinct, as the women say; for they do la∣ment continually, that there are none extant now of those great, &amp;c. you know the rest of the song.

<P>I know that reading this passage, you will make a doubt within your selves, and that grounded upon very good reason: which is this, how it is possible that this relation can be true, seeing at the time of the flood all the world was destroyed, except <HI>Noah,</HI> and
<PB N="9" REF="144"/>
seven persons more with him in the Ark, in∣to whose number <HI>Hurtali</HI> is not admitted; doubtlesse the demand is well made, and ve∣ry apparent, but the answer shall satisfie you, or my wit is not rightly caulked: and because I was not at that time to tell you any thing of my own fancie, I will bring unto you the authority of the <HI>Massorets,</HI> good honest fel∣lows, true <HI>ballokeering</HI> blades, and exact <HI>He∣braical</HI> bagpipers, who affirm that verily the said <HI>Hurtali</HI> was not within the Ark of <HI>Noah,</HI> (neither could he getin, for he was too big) but he sate astride upon it, with one leg on the one side, and another on the other, as little children use to do upon their wooden hor∣ses: or as the great Bull of <HI>Berne,</HI> which was killed at <HI>Marinian,</HI> did ride for his Hackney the great murthering piece called the <HI>Canon∣perrier,</HI> a pretty beast of a faire and pleasant amble without all question.</P>
<P>In that posture, he after God, saved the said Ark from danger, for with his legs he gave it the brangle that was needful, and with his foot turned it whither he pleased, as a ship answereth her rudder. Those that were within sent him up victuals in abundance by a Chimney, as people very thankfully ac∣knowledging the good that he did them; And sometimes they did talk together as <HI>Va∣romenippus</HI> did to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> according to the report of <HI>Lucian.</HI> Have you understood all

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the Nativity of the most dread and redoubt∣ed</HI> Pantagruel.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GArgantua</HI> at the age of foure hundred, fourescore fourty and foure yeares be∣gat his sonne <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> upon his wife na∣med <HI>Badebec,</HI> daughter to the King of the <HI>Amaurots</HI> in <HI>Utopia,</HI> who died in childe-birth, for he was so wonderfully great and lumpish, that he could not possibly come forth into the light of the world, without thus suffoca∣ting his mother. But that we may fully un∣derstand the cause and reason of the name of <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> which at his Baptism was given him, you are to remark, that in that yeare there was so great drought over all the coun∣trey of <HI>Affrick,</HI> that there past thirty and six moneths, three weeks, foure dayes, thirteen houres, and a little more without raine, but with a heat so vehement, that the whole earth was parched and withered by it: neither was it more scorched and dried up with heat in the dayes of <HI>Eliah,</HI> then it was at that time; for there was not a tree to be seen, that had either
<PB N="11" REF="145"/>
leafe or bloom upon it: the grasse was with∣out verdure or greennesse, the rivers were drained, the fountaines dried up, the poore fishes abandoned and forsaken by their pro∣per element, wandring and crying upon the ground most horribly: the birds did fall down from the aire for want of moisture and dew, wherewith to refresh them: the wolves, foxes, harts, wild-boares, fallow-deer, hares, coneys, weesils, brocks, badgers, and other such beasts were found dead in the fields with their mouthes open; in respect of men, there was the pity, you should have seen them lay out their tongues like hares that have been run six houres: many did throw themselves into the wells: others entred within a Cowes belly to be in the shade; those <HI>Homer</HI> calls <HI>A∣libants:</HI> all the Countrey was idle, and could do no vertue: it was a most lamentable case to have seen the labour of mortals in defend∣ing themselves from the vehemencie of this horrifick drought; for they had work enough to do to save the holy water in the Churches from being wasted; but there was such order taken by the counsel of my Lords the Car∣dinals, and of our holy Father, that none did dare to take above one lick: yet when any one came into the Church, you should have seen above twenty poor thirsty fellows hang upon him that was the distributer of the wa∣ter, and that with a wide open throat, gaping
<PB N="12" REF="146"/>
for some little drop, (like the rich glutton in <HI>Luke,)</HI> that might fall by, lest any thing should be lost. O how happy was he in that yeare, who had a coole Cellar under ground, well plenished with fresh wine!</P>
<P>The Philosopher reports in moving the question, wherefore it is that the sea-water is salt? that at the time when <HI>Phoebus</HI> gave the government of his resplendent chariot to his sonne <HI>Phaeton,</HI> the said <HI>Phaeton,</HI> unskilful in the Art, and not knowing how to keep the ecliptick line betwixt the two tropicks of the latitude of the Sunnes course, strayed out of his way, and came so near the earth, that he dried up all the Countreys that were under it, burning a great part of the Hea∣vens, which the <HI>Philosophers</HI> call <HI>via lactea,</HI> and the <HI>Huffsnuffs,</HI> St. <HI>James</HI> his way, al∣though the most coped, lofty, and high-crest∣ed Poets affirme that to be the place where <HI>Juno's</HI> milk fell, when she gave suck to <HI>Her∣cules.</HI></P>
<P>The earth at that time was so excessively heated, that it fell into an enormous sweat, yea such a one as made it sweat out the sea, which is therefore salt, because all sweat is salt; and this you cannot but confesse to be true, if you will taste of your own, or of those that have the pox, when they are put into a sweating, it is all one to me. Just such an∣other case fell out this same yeare: for on a
<PB N="13" REF="146"/>
certain <HI>Friday,</HI> when the whole people were bent upon their devotions, and had made goodly Processions, with store of Letanies, and faire preachings, and beseechings of God Almighty, to look down with his eye of mer∣cy upon their miserable and disconsolate con∣dition, there was even then visibly seen issue out of the ground great drops of water, such as fall from a puff-bagg'd man in a top sweat; and the poore Hoydons began to rejoyce, as if it had been a thing very profitable unto them; for some said that there was not one drop of moisture in the aire, whence they might have any rain, and that the earth did supply the default of that. Other learned men said, that it was a showre of the <HI>Antipodes,</HI> as <HI>Se∣neca</HI> saith in his fourth book <HI>Quaestionum na∣turalium,</HI> speaking of the source and spring of <HI>Nilus:</HI> but they were deceived, for the Procession being ended, when every one went about to gather of this dew, and to drink of it with full bowles; they found that it was nothing but pickle, and the very brine of salt, more brackish in taste then the saltest water of the sea: and because in that very day <HI>Pantagruel</HI> was borne, his father gave him that name; for <HI>panta</HI> in <HI>Greek</HI> is as much to say as <HI>all,</HI> and <HI>Gruel</HI> in the <HI>Hagarene</HI> language doth signifie <HI>thirsty;</HI> inferring here∣by, that at his birth the whole world was a dry and thirstie, as likewise foreseeing that

he, would be some day Suprem Lord, &amp; Sove∣reign of the <HI>thirstie Ethrappels,</HI> which was shewn to him at that very same hour by a more evident signe; for when his mother <HI>Badebec</HI> was in the bringing of him forth, and that the Midwives did wait to receive him: there came first out of her belly threescore and eight <HI>Tregeneers</HI> (that is, Salt-sellers,) every one of them leading in a Halter a Mule hea∣vy loaden with salt: after whom issued forth nine Dromedaries, with great loads of gam∣mons of bacon, and dried neats tongues on their backs: then followed seven Camels loaded with links and chitterlins, Hogs pud∣dings and salciges: after them came out five great waines, full of leeks, garlick, onions and chibols, drawn with five and thirty strong Cart-horses, which was six for every one, besides the <HI>Thiller.</HI> At the sight hereoi the said Midwives were much amazed; yet some of them said, Lo, here is good provi∣sion, and indeed we need it; for we drink but lazily, as if our tongues walked on crutches, and not lustily like <HI>Lansman dutches:</HI> truly this is a good signe, there is nothing here but what is fit for us, these are the spurres of wine that set it a going. As they were ratling thus together after their own manner of chat, behold, out comes <HI>Pantagruel</HI> all hairie like a Beare, whereupon one of them inspired with a prophetical Spirit, said, This will be a ter∣rible

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of the grief wherewith</HI> Gargantua <HI>was mo∣ved at the decease of his wife</HI> Badebec.</HEAD>
<P>WHen <HI>Pantagruel</HI> was borne, there was none more astonished and perplexed then was his father <HI>Gargantua;</HI> for of the one side, seeing his wife <HI>Badebec</HI> dead, and on the other side his sonne <HI>Pantagruel</HI> born, so faire and so great, he knew not what to say nor what to do: and the doubt that troubled his braine, was to know whether he should cry for the death of his wife, or laugh for the joy of his sonne: he was <HI>hinc indè</HI> choaked with sophistical arguments, for he framed them very well <HI>in modo &amp; figura,</HI> but he could not resolve them, remaining pestered and entangled by this means, like a mouse catch't in a trap, or kite snared in a ginne: Shall I weep (said he?) Yes, for why? my so good wife is dead, who was the most <HI>this,</HI> the most <HI>that,</HI> that ever was in the world: never shall I see her, never shall I recover such another, it is unto me an inestimable losse! O my
<PB N="16" REF="148"/>
good God, what had I done that thou should∣est thus punish me? why didst thou not take me away before her? seeing for me to live without her is but to languish. Ah <HI>Badebec, Badebec,</HI> my minion, my dear heart, my su∣gar, my sweeting, my honey, my little C... (yet it had in circumference full six acres, three rods, five poles, foure yards, two foot, one inche and a half of good woodland measure) my tender peggie, my Codpiece darling, my bob and hit, my slipshoe-lovie, never shall I see thee! Ah, poor <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> thou hast lost thy good mother, thy sweet nurse, thy well-beloved Lady! O false death, how injurious and despightful hast thou been to me? how malicious and outragious have I found thee? in taking her from me, my well-beloved wife, to whom immortality did of right belong. With these words he did cry like a Cow, but on a sudden fell a laughing like a Calfe, when <HI>Pantagruel</HI> came into his minde: Ha, my little sonne, (said he, my childilollie, fedli<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ondie, dandlichuckie, my ballockie, my pretty rogue; O how jollie thou art, and how much am I bound to my gracious God, that hath been pleased to be∣stow on me a sonne, so faire, so spriteful, so lively, so smiling, so pleasant, and so gentle. <HI>Ho, ho, ho, ho,</HI> how glad I am?

drive out these dogs, blow this fire, light candles, shut that door there, cut this bread in sippets for brewis, send away these poore folks in giving them what they ask, hold my gown, I will strip my self into my doublet, <HI>(ēn cuerpo)</HI> to make the Gossips merry, and keep them company.</P>
<P>As he spake this, he heard the Letanies and the <HI>memento's</HI> of the Priests that carried his wife to be buried, upon which he left the good purpose he was in, and was suddenly ravished another way, saying, Lord God, must I again contrist my self? this grieves me; I am no longer young, I grow old, the weather is dangerous; I may perhaps take an ague, then shall I be foiled, if not quite un∣done; by the faith of a Gentleman, it were better to cry lesse, and drink more.</P>
<P>My wife is dead, well, by G<HI>—(da jurandi)</HI> I shall not raise her again by my crying: she is well, she is in Paradise at least, if she be no higher: she prayeth to God for us, she is hap∣py, she is above the sense of our miseries, nor can our calamities reach her: what though she be dead, must not we also die? the same debt which she hath paid, hangs over our heads; nature will require it of us, and we must all of us some day taste of the same sauce: let her passe then, and the Lord pre∣serve the Survivors; for I must now cast a∣bout how to get another wife. But I will

tell you what you shall do, (said he) to the Midwives in <HI>France</HI> called <HI>wise women</HI> (Where be the good folks? I cannot see them,) go you to my wives interrement, and I will the while rock my sonne: for I finde my self somewhat altered and distempered, and should otherwayes be in danger of falling sick: but drink one good draught first, you will be the better for it; and beleeeve me upon mine honour, they at his request went to her burial and funeral obsequies: in the mean while, poor <HI>Gargantua</HI> staying at home, and willing to have somewhat in remem∣brance of her to be engraven upon her tomb, made this <HI>Epitaph</HI> in the manner as follow∣eth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Of the Infancie of</HI> Pantagruel.</HEAD>
<P>I Finde by the ancient Historiographers and Poets, that divers have been borne in this world, after very strange manners, which would be too long to repeat; reade therefore the seventh chapter of <HI>Pliny,</HI> if you have so much leisure: yet have you never heard of any so wonderful as that of <HI>Pantagruel;</HI> for it is a very difficult matter to beleeve, how in the little time he was in his mothers belly, he grew both in body and strength. That which <HI>Hercules</HI> did, was nothing, when in his Cradle he slew two serpents; for those serpents were but little and weak: but <HI>Pantagruel</HI> being yet in the Cradle, did farre more admirable things, and more to be amazed at. I passe by here the relation of how at every one of his meales he supped up the milk of foure thousand and six hundred Cowes: and how to make him a skellet to boil his milk in, there were set a work all the Brasiers of <HI>Somure</HI> in <HI>Anjou,</HI> of <HI>Villedieu</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and of <HI>Bra∣mont</HI> in <HI>Lorraine:</HI> and they served in this whitepot-meat to him in a huge great Bell, which is yet to be seen in the City of <HI>Bourge</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="150"/>
in <HI>Berrie,</HI> near the Palace; but his teeth were already so well grown, and so strength∣ened in vigour, that of the said Bell he bit off a great morsel, as very plainly doth appeare till this houre.</P>
<P>One day in the morning, when they would have made him suck one of his Cows, (for he never had any other Nurse, as the History tells us) he got one of his armes loose from the swadling bands, wherewith he was kept fast in the Cradle, laid hold on the said Cow under the left fore hamme, and grasp∣ing her to him, ate up her udder and half of her paunch, with the liver and the kidneys, and had devoured all up, if she had not cried out most horribly, as if the wolves had held her by the legs, at which noise company came in, and took away the said Cow from <HI>Pantagruel;</HI> yet could they not so well do it, but that the quarter whereby he caught her was left in his hand, of which quarter he gulp't up the flesh in a trice, even with as much ease as you would eate a salcige; and that so greedily with desire of more, that when they would have taken away the bone from him, he swallowed it down whole, as a Cormorant would do a little fish; and after∣wards began fumblingly to say, <HI>Good, good, good,</HI> for he could not yet speak plaine; gi∣ving them to understand thereby, that he had found it very good, and that he did lack
<PB N="21" REF="150"/>
but so much more; which when they saw that attended him, they bound him with great cable-ropes, like those that are made at <HI>Tain,</HI> for the carriage of salt to <HI>Lyons;</HI> or such as those are, whereby the great <HI>French</HI> ship rides at Anchor, in the Road of <HI>New∣haven</HI> in <HI>Normandie.</HI> But on a certain time, a great Beare which his father had bred, got loose, came towards him, began to lick his face, for his Nurses had not throughly wiped his chaps, at which unexpected approach be∣ing on a sudden offended, he as lightly rid himself of those great cables, as <HI>Samson</HI> did of the haulser ropes wherewith the <HI>Phili∣stines</HI> had tied him, and by your leave, takes me up my Lord the Beare, and teares him to you in pieces like a pullet, which served him for a gorge-ful or good warme bit for that meale.</P>
<P>Whereupon <HI>Gargantua</HI> fearing lest the childe should hurt himself, caused foure great chaines of iron to be made to binde him, and so many strong wooden arches unto his Cradle, most firmely stocked and mortaised in huge frames: of those chaines you have one at <HI>Rochel.</HI> which they draw up at night betwixt the two great towers of the Haven: Another is at <HI>Lyons:</HI> A third at <HI>Angiers:</HI> And the fourth was carried away by the de∣vils to binde <HI>Lucifer,</HI> who broke his chaines in those dayes, by reason of a cholick that did
<PB N="22" REF="151"/>
extraordinarily torment him, taken with eating a Serjeants soule fried for his break∣fast, and therfore you may beleeve that which <HI>Nicolas de Lyra</HI> saith upon that place of the <HI>Psalter,</HI> where it is written, <HI>Et Og regem Ba∣san,</HI> that the said <HI>Og</HI> being yet little, was so strong and robustious, that they were faine to binde him with chaines of iron in his Cradle; thus continued <HI>Pantagruel</HI> for a while very calme and quiet, for he was not able so easily to break those chaines, espe∣cially having no room in the Cradle to give a swing with his armes. But see what hap∣pened, once upon a great Holiday, that his father <HI>Gargantua</HI> made a sumptuous banquet to all the Princes of his Court: I am apt to beleeve, that the menial officers of the house were so imbusied in waiting each on his proper service at the feast, that no body took care of poor <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> who was left <HI>a re∣culorum,</HI> behinde-hand all alone, and as for∣saken. What did he? Heark what he did, good people: he strove and essayed to break the chaines of the Cradle with his armes but coold not, for they were too strong for him: then did he keep with his feet such a stamp∣ing stirre, and so long, that at last he beat out the lower end of his Cradle, which not∣withstanding was made of a great post five foot in square: and assoon as he had gotten out his feer, he slid down as well as he could,
<PB N="23" REF="151"/>
till he had got his soales to the ground; and then with a mighty force he rose up, carry∣ing his Cradle upon his back, bound to him like a Tortoise that crawles up against a wall; and to have seen him, you would have thought it had been a great <HI>Carrick</HI> of five hundred tunne upon one end. In this man∣ner he entred into the great Hall, where they were banquetting, and that very boldly, which did much affright the companie; yet because his armes were tied in, he could not reach any thing to eate, but with great pain stooped now and then a little, to take with the whole flat of his tongue some lick, good bit or morsel.</P>
<P>Which when his father saw, he knew well enough that they had left him without giving him: any thing to eate, and therefore com∣manded that he should be loosed from the said chains, by the counsel of the Princes and Lords there present: besides that, also the Physicians of <HI>Gargantua</HI> said, that if they did thus keep him in the Cradle, he would be all his life-time subject to the stone. When he was unchained they made him to sit down, where after he had fed very well, he took his Cradle, and broke it into more then five hundred thousand pieces with one blow of his fist, that he struck in the midst of it, swearing that he would never come into it again.</P>

<P>THus grew <HI>Pantagruel</HI> from day to day, and to every ones eye waxed more and more in all his dimensions, which made hrs father to rejoyce by a natural affection: therefore caused he to be made for him, whilest he was yet little, a pretty Crosse∣bowe, wherewith to shoot at small birds, which now they call the great Crossebowe at <HI>Chantelle.</HI> Then he sent him to the school to learn, and to spend his youth in vertue: in the prosecution of which designe he came first to <HI>Poictiers,</HI> where, as he studied and profited very much, he saw that the Scholars were oftentimes at leisure, and knew not how to bestow their time, which moved him to take such compassion on them, that one day he took from a long ledge of rocks (cal∣led there <HI>Passelourdin,)</HI> a huge great stone, of about twelve fathom square, and fourteen handfuls thick, and with great ease set it up∣on foure pillars in the midst of a field, to no other end, but that the said Scholars when they had nothing else to do, might passe their
<PB N="25" REF="152"/>
time in getting up on that stone, and feast it with store of gammons, pasties and flag∣gons, and carve their names upon it with a knife, in token of which deed, till this houre the stone is called the lifted stone: and in re∣membrance hereof there is none entered in∣to the Register and matricular Book of the said University, or accounted capable of ta∣king any degree therein, till he have first drunk in the <HI>Caballine</HI> fountain of <HI>Croustel∣les,</HI> passed at <HI>Passelourdin,</HI> and got up upon the <HI>lifted stone.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards reading the delectable Chro∣nicles of his Ancestors, he found that <HI>Jafrey</HI> of <HI>Lusinian</HI> called <HI>Jafrey</HI> with the great tooth, Grandfather to the Cousin in law of the eldest Sister of the Aunt of the Son in law of the Uncle of the good daughter of his Stepmother, was interred at <HI>Maillezais;</HI> therefore one day he took <HI>campos,</HI> (which is a little vacation from study to play a while,) that he might give him a visit as unto an ho∣nest man: and going from <HI>Poictiers</HI> with some of his companions, they passed by the <HI>Guge,</HI> visiting the noble Abbot <HI>Ardillon:</HI> then by <HI>Lusinian,</HI> by <HI>Sansay,</HI> by <HI>Celles,</HI> by <HI>Coalon∣ges,</HI> by <HI>Fontenay</HI> the <HI>Conte,</HI> saluting the learn∣ed <HI>Tiraqueau,</HI> and from thence arrived at <HI>Maillezais,</HI> where he went to see the Se∣pulchre of the said <HI>Jafrey</HI> with the great tooth; which made him somewhat afraid,
<PB N="26" REF="153"/>
looking upon the picture, whose lively draughts did set him forth in the represen∣tation of a man in an extreme fury, drawing his great <HI>Malchus</HI> faulchion half way out of his scabbard: when the reason hereof was demanded, the Chanons of the said place told him, that there was no other cause of it, but that <HI>Pictoribus atque Poetis, &amp;c.</HI> that is to say, that Painters and Poets have liberty to paint and devise what they list after their own fancie: but he was not satisfied with their answer, and said, He is not thus painted without a cause; and I suspect that at his death there was some wrong done him, whereof he requireth his Kinred to take revenge: I will enquire further into it, and then do what shall be reasonable; then he returned not to <HI>Poictiers,</HI> but would take a view of the other Universities of <HI>France:</HI> therefore go∣ing to <HI>Rochel,</HI> he took shipping and arri∣ved at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> where he found no great exercise, only now and then he would see some Marriners and Lightermen a wrestling on the key or strand by the river-side: From thence he came to <HI>Tholouse,</HI> where he learned to dance very well, and to <HI>play</HI> with the <HI>two-handed sword,</HI> as the fashion of the Scho∣lars of the said University is to bestir them∣selves in <HI>games,</HI> whereof they may have their <HI>hands full:</HI> but he stayed not long there, when he saw that they did cause bury their <HI>Re∣gents</HI>

<P>He went then to <HI>Monpellier,</HI> where he met with the good wives of <HI>Mirevaux,</HI> and good jovial company withal, and thought to have set himself to the study of Physick▪ but he considered that that calling was too troublesome and melancholick; and that Phy∣sicians did smell of glisters like old devils. Therefore he resolved he would studie the lawes; but seeing that there were but three scauld, and one bald-pated Legist in that place, he departed from thence, and in his way made the Bridge of <HI>Gard,</HI> and the <HI>Am∣phitheater</HI> of <HI>Neems</HI> in lesse then three houres, which neverthelesse seems to be a more di∣vine then humane work. After that he came to <HI>Avignon,</HI> where he was not above three dayes before he fell in love; for the women there take great delight in playing at the close buttock-game, because it is Papal ground; which his Tutor and Pedagogue <HI>Epistemon</HI> perceiving, he drew him out of that place, and brought him to <HI>Valence</HI> in the <HI>Dauphinee,</HI> where he saw no great matter of recreation, only that the Lubbards of the Town did beat the Scholars, which so incen∣sed him with anger, that when upon a certain very faire Sunday, the people being at their
<PB N="28" REF="154"/>
publick dancing in the streets, and one of the Scholars offering to put himself into the ring to partake of that sport, the foresaid lubbardly fellowes would not permit him the admittance into their society; He taking the Scholars part, so belaboured them with blowes, and laid such load upon them, that he drove them all before him, even to the brink of the river <HI>Rhosne,</HI> and would have there drowned them, but that they did squat to the ground, and there lay close a full halfe league under the river. The hole is to be seen there yet.</P>
<P>After that he departed from thence, and in three strides and one leap came to <HI>Angiers,</HI> where he found himself very well, and would have continued there some space, but that the plague drove them away. So from thence he came to <HI>Bourges,</HI> where he studied a good long time, and profited very much in the fa∣culty of the Lawes: and would sometimes say, that the books of the Civil Law, were like unto a wonderfully precious, royal and triumphant robe of cloth of gold, edged with dirt; for in the world are no goodlier books to be seen, more ornate, nor more elo∣quent then the texts of the Pandects; but the bordering of them, that is to say, the glosse of <HI>Accursius</HI> is so scurvie, vile, base and unsavourie, that it is nothing but filthi∣nesse and villany.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="154"/>
Going from <HI>Bourges,</HI> he came to <HI>Orleans,</HI> where he found store of swaggering Scho∣lars that made him great entertainment at his coming, and with whom he learned to play at tennis so well, that he was a Master at that game; for the Students of the said place make a prime exercise of it; and sometimes they carried him unto <HI>Cupids</HI> houses of com∣merce (in that City termed <HI>Islands,</HI> because of rheir being most ordinarily environed with other houses, and not contiguous to a∣ny,) there to recreate his person at the sport of <HI>Poussevant,</HI> which the wenches of <HI>London</HI> call the <HI>Ferkers in and in.</HI> As for breaking his head with over-much study, he had an espe∣cial care not to do it in any case, for feare of spoiling his eyes; which he the rather obser∣ved, for that it was told him by one of his Teachers, (there called Regents,) that the paine of the eyes was the most hurtful thing of any to the sight: for this cause when he one day was made a <HI>Licentiate,</HI> or Graduate in law, one of the Scholras of his acquaintance, who of learning had not much more then his burthen, though in stead of that he could dance very well, and play at tennis, made the blason and device of the <HI>Licentiates</HI> in the said University, saying,</P>

<P>VPon a certain day, I know not when, <HI>Pantagruel</HI> walking after supper with some of his fellow-Students, without that gate of the City, through which we enter on the rode to <HI>Paris,</HI> encountered with a young spruce-like Scholar that was coming upon the same very way; and after they had sa∣luted one another, asked him thus; My friend, from whence comest thou now? the <HI>Scholar</HI> answered him: From the alme, in∣clyte and celebrate Academie, which is <HI>voci∣tated Lutetia.

<P><HI>Prut, tut,</HI> (said <HI>Pantagruel,)</HI> what doth this foole mean to say?

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>How</HI> Pantagruel <HI>came to</HI> Paris, <HI>and of the choise Books of the Library of</HI> St. Victor.</HEAD>
<P>AFter that <HI>Pantagruel</HI> had studied very well at <HI>Orleans,</HI> he resolved to see the great University at <HI>Paris;</HI> but before his de∣parture, he was informed that there was a huge big bell at St. <HI>Anian</HI> in the said town of <HI>Orleans,</HI> under the ground, which had been
<PB N="35" REF="157"/>
there above two hundred and fourteen years; for it was so great that they could not by any device get it so much as above the ground, although they used all the meanes that are found in <HI>Vitruvius de Architectura, Albertus de re aedificatoria, Euclid, Theon, Archimedes,</HI> and <HI>Hero de ingeniis:</HI> for all that was to no purpose, wherefore condescending heartily to the humble request of the Citizens and In∣habitants of the said Town, he determined to remove it to the tower that was erected for it: with that he came to the place where it was, and lifted it out of the ground with his little finger, as easily as you would have done a Hawks bell, or Bell-weathers tingle tangle: but before he would carry it to the foresaid tower or steeple appointed for it, he would needs make some Musick with it about the Town, and ring it alongst all the streets, as he carried it in his hand, wherewith all the people were very glad; but there happened one great inconveniency, for with carrying it so, and ringing it about the streets, all the good <HI>Orleans</HI> wine turned instantly, waxed flat, and was spoiled, which no body there did perceive till the night following; for eve∣ry man found himself so altered, and a dry with drinking these flat wines, that they did nothing but spit, and that as white as <HI>Maltha</HI> cotton, saying: We have of the <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> and our very throats are salted. This done, he came
<PB N="36" REF="158"/>
to <HI>Paris</HI> with his retinue, and at his entry e∣very one came out to see him, (as you know well enough, that the people of <HI>Paris</HI> is sot∣tish by <HI>nature,</HI> by <HI>B. flat,</HI> and <HI>B. sharp,)</HI> and beheld him with great astonishment, mixed with no lesse feare, that he would carry away the Palace into some other countrey <HI>a remo∣tis,</HI> and farre from them, as his father former∣ly had done the great peal of Bells at our <HI>Ladies</HI> Church, to tie about his Mares neck. Now after he had stayed there a pretty space, and studied very well in all the seven liberal Arts, he said it was a good towne to live in, but not to die; for that the grave-digging rogues of <HI>St. Innocent,</HI> used in frostie nights to warme their bums with dead mens bones.

other my good friends, as I was wont to do: which conversation of mine, although it was not without sin, (because we are all of us tres∣passers, and therefore ought continually to beseech his divine Majesty, to blot our trans∣gressions out of his memory) yet was it by the help and grace of God, without all man∣ner of reproach before men.</P>
<P>Wherefore if those qualities of the minde but shine in thee, wherewith I am endowed, as in thee remaineth the perfect image of my body, thou wilt be esteeined by all men to be the perfect guardian and treasure of the im∣mortality of our name: but if otherwise, I shall truly take but small pleasure to see it, considering that the lesser part of me, which is the body, would abide in thee: and the best, to wit, that which is the soule, and by which our name continues blessed amongst men, would be degenerate and abastardised: This I do not speak out of any distrust that I have of thy vertue, which I have heretofore already tried, but to encourage thee yet more earnestly to proceed from good to better: and that which I now write unto thee, is not so much that thou shouldest live in this ver∣tuous course, as that thou shouldest rejoyce in so living and having lived, and cheer up thy self with the like resolution in time to come; to the prosecution and accomplish∣ment of which enterprise and generous un∣dertaking

thou mayest easily remember how that I have spared nothing, but have so help∣ed thee, as if I had had no other treasure in this world, but to see thee once in my life, compleatly well bred and accomplished, as well in vertue, honesty and valour, as in all liberal knowledge and civility: and so to leave thee after my death, as a mirrour, re∣presenting the person of me thy father, and if not so excellent, and such <HI>indeed</HI> as I do wish thee, yet such in my <HI>desire.</HI></P>
<P>But although my deceased father of happy memory <HI>Grangousier,</HI> had bent his best endea∣vours to make me profit in all perfection and Political knowledge, and that my labour and study was fully correspondent to, yea, went beyond his desire: neverthelesse, as thou mayest well understand, the time then was not so proper and fit for learning as it is at present, neither had I plenty of such good Masters as thou hast had; for that time was dark some, obscured with clouds of ignorance, and savouring a little of the infelicity and ca∣lamity of the <HI>Gothes,</HI> who had, whereever they set footing, destroyed all good literature, which in my age hath by the divine good∣nesse been restored unto its former light and dignity, and that with such amendment and increase of the knowledge, that now hardly should I be admitted unto the first forme of the little Grammar-school-boyes:
<PB N="54" REF="164"/>
I say, I, who in my youthful dayes was, (and that justly) reputed the most learned of that age; which I do not speak in vain boasting, although I might lawfully do it in writing unto thee, in verification whereof thou hast the authority of <HI>Marcus Tullius</HI> in his book of old age, and the sentence of <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in the book intituled how a man may praise himself without envie: but to give thee an emulous encouragement to strive yet further.</P>
<P>Now is it that the mindes of men are qua∣lified with all manner of discipline, and the old sciences revived, which for many ages were extinct: now it is, that the learned lan∣guages are to their pristine purity restored, <HI>viz. Greek,</HI> (without which a man may be ashamed to account himself a scholar,) <HI>He∣brew, Arabick, Chaldaean</HI> and <HI>Latine.</HI> Print∣ing likewise is now in use, so elegant, and so correct, that better cannot be imagined, al∣though it was found out but in my time by divine inspiration, as by a diabolical suggesti∣on on the other side was the invention of Ordnance. All the world is full of knowing men, of most learned Schoolmasters, and vast Libraries: and it appears to me as a truth, that neither in <HI>Plato</HI>'s time, nor <HI>Cicero</HI>'s, nor <HI>Papinian</HI>'s, there was ever such conveniency for studying, as we see at this day there is: nor must any adventure henceforward to come in publick, or present himself in com∣pany,

<P>What shall I say? the very women and children have aspired to this praise and cele∣stial Manna of good learning: yet so it is, that in the age I am now of, I have been con∣strained to learn the <HI>Greek</HI> tongue, which I contemned not like <HI>Cato,</HI> but had not the lea∣sure in my younger yeares to attend the stu∣dy of it: and take much delight in the read∣ing of <HI>Plutarchs</HI> Morals, the pleasant Dia∣logues of <HI>Plato,</HI> the Monuments of <HI>Pau∣sanias,</HI> and the Antiquities of <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> in waiting on the houre wherein God my Cre∣ator shall call me, and command me to depart from this earth and transitory pilgrimage. Wherefore (my sonne) I admonish thee, to imploy thy youth to profit as well as thou canst, both in thy studies and in vertue. Thou art at <HI>Paris,</HI> where the laudable ex∣amples of many brave men may stirre up thy minde to gallant actions, and hast like∣wise for thy Tutor and <HI>Paedagogue</HI> the learn∣ed <HI>Epistemon,</HI> who by his lively and vocal do∣cuments may instruct thee in the Arts and Sciences.</P>
<P>I intend, and will have it so, that thou learn

the Languages perfectly: first of all, the <HI>Greek,</HI> as <HI>Quintilian</HI> will have it: secondly, the <HI>Latine;</HI> and then the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> for the holy Scripture-sake: and then the <HI>Chaldee</HI> and <HI>A∣rabick</HI> likewise, and that thou frame thy stilein <HI>Greek</HI> in imitation of <HI>Plato;</HI> and for the <HI>Latine,</HI> after <HI>Cicero,</HI> let there be no history which thou shalt not have ready in thy memory; unto the prosecuting of which designe, books of <HI>Cosmographie</HI> will be very conducible, and help thee much. Of the liberal Arts of <HI>Geo∣metry, Arithmetick</HI> and <HI>Musick,</HI> I gave thee some taste when thou wert yet little, and not above five or six yeares old; proceed further in them, &amp; learn the remainder if thou canst. As for <HI>Astronomy,</HI> study all the rules thereof, let passe neverthelesse the divining and judicial <HI>Astrology,</HI> and the Art of <HI>Lullius,</HI> as being nothing else but plain abuses and vanities. As for the <HI>Civil Law,</HI> of that I would have thee to know the texts by heart, and then to conferre them with <HI>Philosophie.</HI></P>
<P>Now in matter of the knowledge of the works of Nature, I would have thee to stu∣dy that exactly, and that so there be no sea, river nor fountain, of which thou doest not know the fishes, all the fowles of the aire, all the several kindes of shrubs and trees, whe∣ther in forrests or orchards: all the sorts of herbes and flowers that grow upon the ground: all the various mettals that are hid
<PB N="57" REF="165"/>
within the bowels of the earth: together with all the diversity of precious stones, that are to be seen in the Orient &amp; South-parts of the world, let nothing of all these be hidden from thee. Then faile not most carefully to peruse the books of the <HI>Greek, Arabian</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI> Physicians, not despising the <HI>Talmu∣dists</HI> and <HI>Cabalists;</HI> and by frequent Ana∣tomies get thee the perfect knowledge of the other world, called the Microcosme, which is man: and at some houres of the day apply thy minde to the study of the holy Scriptures: first in <HI>Greek,</HI> the New Testament with the Epistles of the Apostles; and then the Old Testament in <HI>Hebrew</HI> In brief, let me see thee an Abysse, and bottomlesse pit of know∣ledge: for from hence forward, as thou grow∣est great and becomest a man, thou must part from this tranquillity and rest of study, thou must learn chivalrie, warfare, and the exer∣cises of the field, the better thereby to de∣fend my house and our friends, and to suc∣cour and protect them at all their needs a∣gainst the invasion and assaults of evil doers.</P>
<P>Furthermore, I will that very shortly thou try how much thou hast profited, which thou canst not better do, then by maintaining pub∣lickly <HI>Theses</HI> and Conclusions in all Arts, a∣gainst all persons whatsoever, and by haunt∣ing the company of learned men, both at <HI>Pa∣ris</HI> and otherwhere.

man <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, <HI>Wisdome entereth not into a malicious minde;</HI> and that knowledge with∣out conscience is but the ruine of the soule, it behooveth thee to serve, to love, to feare God, and on him to cast all thy thoughts and all thy hope, and by faith formed in charity to cleave unto him, so that thou mayest ne∣ver be separated from him by thy sins. Su∣spect the abuses of the world: set not thy heart upon vanity; for this life is transitory, but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever. Be serviceable to all thy neighbours, and love them as thy self: reverence thy Praece∣ptors: shun the conversation of those whom thou desirest not to resemble, and receive not in vaine the graces which God hath bestowed upon thee: and when thou shalt see that thou hast attained to all the knowledge that is to be acquired in that part, return unto me, that I may see thee, and give thee my blessing before I die, <HI>My sonne,</HI> the peace and grace of our Lord be with thee. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>How</HI> Pantagruel <HI>found</HI> Panurge, <HI>whom he lo∣ved all his life-time.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ONe day as <HI>Pantagruel</HI> was taking a walk without the City, towards <HI>St. Antonies</HI> Abbey, discoursing and philosophating with his own servants and some other Scholars, met with a young man of a very comely sta∣ture, and surpassing handsome in all the linea∣ments of his body, but in several parts there∣of most pitifully wounded; in such bad equi∣page in matter of his apparel, which was but totters and rags, and every way so far out of order, that he seemed to have been a fight∣ing with mastiffe-dogs, from whose fury he had made an escape, or to say better, he look∣ed in the condition wherein he then was, like an Apple-gatherer of the countrey of <HI>Perche.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="167"/>
As farre off as <HI>Pantagruel</HI> saw him, he said to those that stood by:. Do you see that man there, who is a coming hither upon the road from <HI>Charanton-bridge?</HI> by my faith, he is only poor in fortune; for I may assure you, that by his <HI>Physiognomie</HI> it appeareth, that na∣ture hath extracted him from some rich and noblerace, and that too much curiosity hath thrown him upon adventures, which possibly have reduced him to this indigence, want and penurie. Now as he was just amongst them, <HI>Pantagruel</HI> said unto him, Let me intreat you, <HI>(friend)</HI> that you may be pleased to stop here a little, and answer me to that which I shall ask you, and I am confident you will not think your time ill bestowed; for I have an extream desire, (according to my ability) to give you some supply in this distresse, where∣in I see you are; because I do very much commiserate your case, which truly moves me to great pity; Therefore (my friend) tell me, who you are? whence you come? whither you go? what you desire? and what your name is? the <HI>companion</HI> answered him in the <HI>Dutch</HI> tongue, thus.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>How</HI> Pantagruel <HI>judged so equitably of a Contro∣versie, which was wonderfully obscure and difficult: that by reason of his just de∣cree therein, he was reputed to have a most admirable judgement.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>PAntagruel,</HI> very well remembring his fathers letter and admonitions, would one day make trial of his knowledge. There∣upon in all the <HI>Carrefours,</HI> that is, throughout all the foure quarters, streets and corners of the City, he set up Conclusions to the num∣ber of nine thousand seven hundred sixty and foure, in all manner of learning, touching in them the hardest doubts that are in any sci∣ence. And first of all, in the <HI>fodder-street</HI> he held dispute against all the <HI>Regents</HI> or Fel∣lowes of Colledges, <HI>Artists</HI> or Masters of Arts, and Oratours, and did so gallantly, that he overthrew them, and set them all upon their tailes, he went afterwards to the <HI>Sor∣bone,</HI> where he maintained argument against all the <HI>Theologians</HI> or Divines, for the space of six weeks, from foure a clock in the morn∣ing, until six in the evening, except an inter∣val of two houres to refresh themselves, and
<PB N="68" REF="171"/>
take their repast: and at this were present the greatest part of the Lords of the Court, the Masters of Requests, Presidents, Counsel∣lors, those of the Accompts, Secretaries, Ad∣vocates and others: as also the Sheriffes of the said town, with the Physicians and Pro∣fessors of the canon-law; amongst which it is to be remarked, that the greatest part were stubborn jades, and in their opinions obstinate; but he took such course with them, that for all their <HI>Ergo's</HI> and fallacies, he put their backs to the wall, gravelled them in the deepest questions, and made it visibly appear to the world, that compared to him, they were but monkies, and a knot of mufled calves: Whereupon, every body began to keep a bustling noise, and talk of his so mar∣vellous knowledge, through all degrees of persons in both sexes, even to the very Laun∣dresses, Brokers, Rostmeat-sellers, Penknife-makers and others, who, when he past along in the street, would say, This is he; in which he took delight, as <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Greek</HI> Oratours did, when an old crouch∣ing wife, pointing at him with her fingers, said, That is the man.</P>
<P>Now at this same very time there was a processe or suit in law, depending in Court between two great Lords, of which one was called my Lord <HI>Kissebreech,</HI> Plaintiffe of one side, and the other my Lord <HI>Suckfist,</HI> De∣fendant
<PB N="69" REF="171"/>
of the other; whose Controversie was so high and difficult in Law, that the Court of Parliament could make nothing of it. And therefore by the Command∣ment of the King, there were assembled foure of the greatest, and most learned of all the Par∣liaments of <HI>France,</HI> together with the great Councel, and all the principal Regents of the Universities, not only of <HI>France,</HI> but of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> also and <HI>Italy,</HI> such as <HI>Jason, Philippus-Decius, Petrus de Petronibus,</HI> and a rabble of other old <HI>Rabbinists:</HI> who being thus met together, after they had thereupon consult∣ed for the space of six and fourty weeks, finding that they could not fasten their teeth in it, nor with such clearnesse understand the case, as that they might in any manner of way be able to right it, or take up the differ∣ence berwixt the two aforesaid Parties, it did so grievously vex them, that they most vil∣lanously conshit themselves for shame. In this great extremity, one amongst them na∣med <HI>Du Douhait,</HI> the learnedst of all, and more expert and prudent then any of the rest, whilest one day they were thus at their wits end, all-to-be-dunced and <HI>philogrobo∣lized</HI> in their braines, said unto them: We have been here (my Masters,) a good long space without doing any thingelse, then trifle away both our time and money, and can ne∣verthelesse finde neither brim nor bottome in
<PB N="70" REF="172"/>
this matter; for the more we study about it, the lesse we understand therein, which is a great shame and disgrace to us, and a heavy burthen to our consciences; yea such, that in my opinion we shall not rid our selves of it without dishonour, unlesse we take some other course; for we do nothing but doat in our consultations.</P>
<P>See therefore what I have thought upon: you have heard much talking of that worthy personage named Master <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> who hath been found to be learned above the ca∣pacity of this present age, by the proofs he gave in those great disputations, which he held publickly against all men: my opinion is, that we send for him, to conferre with him about this businesse; for never any man will encompasse the bringing of it to an end, if he do it not.</P>
<P>Hereunto all the Counsellors and Doctors willingly agreed, and according to that their result having instantly sent for him, they in∣treated him to be pleased to canvass the pro∣cesse, and sift it throughly, that after a deep search and narrow examination of all the points thereof, he might forthwith make the report unto them, such as he shall think good in true and legal knowledge: to this effect they delivered into his hands the bags where∣in were the Writs and Pancarts concerning that suit, which for bulk and weight were

almost enough to lade foure great <HI>couillard</HI> or stoned Asses; but <HI>Pantagruel</HI> said unto them, Are the two Lords, between whom this debate and processe is, yet living? it was answered him, Yes: To what a devil then (said he,) serve so many paultry heapes, and bundles of papers and copies which you give me? is it not better to heare their Con∣troversie from their own mouthes, whilest they are face to face before us, then to reade these vile fopperies, which are nothing but trumperies, deceits, diabolical cosenages of <HI>Cepola,</HI> pernicious slights and subversions of equity? for I am sure, that you, and all those thorough whose hands this processe hath past, have by your devices added what you could to it <HI>pro &amp; contra,</HI> in such sort, that although their difference perhaps was clear and easie enough to determine at first, you have obscured it, and made it more intricate, by the frivolous, sot∣tish, unreasonable and foolish reasons, and opi∣nions of <HI>Accursius, Baldus, Bartolus, de castro, de imola, Hippolytus, Panormo, Bertachin, A∣lexander, Curtius,</HI> and those other old Ma∣stiffs, who never understood the least law of the Pandects, they being but meer block∣heads &amp; great tithe-calvs, ignorant of all that which was needful for the understanding of the lawes; for (as it is most certain) they had not the knowledge either of the <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>La∣tine</HI> tongue, but only of the <HI>Gothick</HI> and <HI>Bar∣barian;</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="173"/>
the lawes neverthelesse were first taken from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> according to the testi∣mony of <HI>Ulpian. l. poster. de origine juris,</HI> which we likewise may perceive by that all the lawes are full of <HI>Greek</HI> words and senten∣ces: and then we finde that they are reduced into a <HI>Latine</HI> stile, the most elegant and or∣nate, that whole language is able to afford, without excepting that of any that ever wrote therein; nay, not of <HI>Salust, Varo, Ci∣cero, Seneca, Titus Livius,</HI> nor <HI>Quintilian:</HI> how then could these old dotards be able to understand aright the text of the lawes, who never in their time had looked upon a good <HI>Latine</HI> book, as doth evidently, enough ap∣pear by the rudenesse of their stile, which is fitter for a Chimney-sweeper, or for a Cook or a Scullion, then for a Jurisconsult and Do∣ctor in the Lawes.</P>
<P>Furthermore, seeing the Lawes are ex∣cerpted out of the middle of moral and natu∣ral Philosophie, how should these fooles have understood it, that have by G—studied lesse in Philosophie then my Mule? in respect of humane learning, and the knowledge of An∣tiquities and History, they were truly laden with those faculties as a toad is with fea∣thers: and yet of all this the Lawes are so full, that without it they cannot be under∣stood, as I intend more fully to shew unto you in a peculiar Treatise, which on that pur∣pose
<PB N="73" REF="173"/>
I am about to publish. Therefore if you will that I take any medling in this pro∣cesse; first, cause all these papers to be burnt: secondly, make the two Gentlemen come personally before me; and afterwards, when I shall have heard them, I will tell you my opinion freely without any feignednes or dis∣simulation whatsoever.</P>
<P>Some amongst them did contradict this motion, as you know that in all companies there are more fooles then wise men, and that the greater part alwayes surmounts the bet∣ter, as saith <HI>Titus Livius,</HI> in speaking of the <HI>Carthaginians:</HI> but the foresaid <HI>Du Douet</HI> held the contrary opinion, maintaining that <HI>Pantagruel</HI> had said well, and what was right, in affirming that these records, bills of in∣quest, replies, rejoinders, exceptions, depo∣sitions, and other such diableries of truth-in∣tangling Writs, were but Engines where∣with to overthrow justice, and unnecessarily to prolong such suits as did depend before them; and that therefore the devil would car∣ry them all away to hell, if they did not take another course, and proceeded not in times coming according to the Prescripts of Evan∣gelical and Philosophical equity. In fine, all the papers were burnt, and the two Gentle∣men summoned and personally convented; at whose appearance before the Court, <HI>Pan∣tagruel</HI> said unto them, Are you they that

and a halfpeny, forasmuch as the <HI>Riphaean</HI> mountaines had been that yeare opprest with a great sterility of counterfeit gudgions, and shewes without substance, by meanes of the babling tattle, and fond fibs, seditiously rai∣sed between the gibblegablers, and <HI>Accursian</HI> gibberish-mongers, for the rebellion of the <HI>Swissers,</HI> who had assembled themselves to the full number of the bum-bees, and myrmi∣dons, to go a handsel-getting on the first day of the new yeare, at that very time when they give brewis to the oxen, and deliver the key of the coales to the Countrey-girles, for serving in of the oates to the dogs. All the night long they did nothing else (keep∣ing their hands still upon the pot) but dis∣patch both on foot and horseback, leaden-sealed Writs or letters, (to wit, Papal Com∣missions commonly called Bulls,) to stop the boats: for the Tailors and Seamsters would have made of the stollen shreds and clippings a goodly sagbut to cover the face of the O∣cean, which then was great with childe of a potfull of cabbidge, according to the opini∣on of the hay-bundle-makers: but the Phy∣sicians said, that by the Urine they could dis∣cern no manifest signe of the Bustards pace, nor how to eat double-tongued mattocks with mustard, unlesse the Lords and Gentle∣men of the Court should be pleased to give by <HI>B. mol</HI> expresse command to the pox, not

to run about any longer, in gleaning up of Coppersmiths and Tinkers; for the Jober∣nolls had already a pretty good beginning in their dance of the Brittish gig, called the <HI>e∣strindore,</HI> to a perfect <HI>diapason,</HI> with one foot in the fire, and their head in the middle, as good man <HI>Ragot</HI> was wont to say.</P>
<P>Ha <HI>(my Masters,)</HI> God moderates all things, and disposeth of them at his pleasure, so that against unluckie fortune a Carter broke his frisking whip, which was all the winde-instrument he had: this was done at his return from the little paultry town, even then when Master <HI>Amitus of Cresseplots</HI> was licentiated, and had past his degrees in all dullerie and blockishnesse, according to this sentence of the Canonists, <HI>Beati Dunces, quo∣niam ipsi stumblaverunt.</HI> But that which makes lent to be so high, by St. <HI>Fiacre</HI> of <HI>Bry,</HI> is for nothing else, but that the <HI>Pentecost</HI> never comes, but to my cost; yet <HI>on afore there hoe,</HI> a little rain stills a great winde, and we must think so, seeing that the Serjeant hath propounded the matter so farre above my reach, that the Clerks and Secondaries could not with the benefit thereof lick their fingers feathered with gaunders, so orbicu∣larly, as they were wont in other things to do. And we do manifestly see, that every one acknowledgeth himself to be in the errour, wherewith another hath been charged, re∣serving
<PB N="77" REF="175"/>
only those cases whereby we are ob∣liged to take an ocular inspection in a perspe∣ctive glasse of these things, towards the place in the Chimney, where hangeth the signe of the wine of fourty girths; which have been al∣wayes accounted very necessary for the num∣ber of twenty pannels and pack-saddles of the bankrupt Protectionaries of five yeares respit; howsoever at least he that would not let flie the fowle before the Cheesecakes, ought in law to have discovered his reason why not, for the memory is often lost with a wayward shooing: Well, God keep <HI>Theo∣bald Mit ain</HI> from all danger. Then said <HI>Pan∣tagruel,</HI> Hold there: Ho, <HI>my friend,</HI> soft and faire, speak at leisure, and soberly without putting your self in choler; I understand the case, go on. Now then <HI>(my Lord)</HI> said <HI>Kisse∣breech,</HI> the foresaid goodwoman, saying her <HI>gaudez and audinos,</HI> could not cover her selfe with a treacherous backblow, ascending by the wounds and passions of the priviledges of the Universitie: unlesse by the vertue of a warming-pan she had Angelically fomented every part of her body, in covering them with a hedge of garden-beds: then giving in a swift unavoidable thirst very near to the place where they sell the old rags, whereof the Painters of <HI>Flanders</HI> make greatuse, when they are about neatly to clap on shoes on grashop∣pers, locusts, <HI>cigals,</HI> and such like flie-fowles,

so strange to us, that <HI>I</HI> am wonderfully asto∣nished why the world doth not lay, seeing it is so good to hatch.</P>
<P>Here the Lord of <HI>Suckfist</HI> would have in∣terrupted him and spoken somewhat, where∣upon <HI>Pantagruel</HI> said unto him, <HI>St,</HI> by St. <HI>Anto∣nies</HI> belly, doth it become thee to speak with∣out command? I sweat here with the extre∣mity of labour and exceeding toile I take to understand the proceeding of your mu∣tual difference, and yet thou comest to trouble and disquiet me: peace, in the devils name, peace, thou shalt be permitted to speak thy belly full, when this man hath done, and no sooner Go on, (said he) to <HI>Kissebreech,</HI> speak calmly, and do not over-heat your self with too much haste.</P>
<P>I perceiving then (said <HI>Kissebreech)</HI> that the praginatical sanction did make no menti∣on of it, and that the holy Pope to every one gave liberty to fart at his own ease, if that the blankets had no streaks, wherein the liars were to be crossed with a ruffian-like crue: &amp; the rain-bow being newly sharpned at <HI>Milan</HI> to bring forth larks, gave his full consent that the good woman should tread down the heel of the hipgut-pangs, by vertue of a solemn protestation put in by the little testiculated or codsted fishes, which to tell the truth, were at that time very necessary for understand∣ing the syntax and construction of old boots.

Therefore <HI>Iohn Calfe</HI> her Cosen gervais once removed with a log from the woodstack, ve∣ry seriously advised her not to put her selfe into the hazard of quagswagging in the Lee, to be scowred with a buck of linnen clothes, till first she had kindled the paper: this coun∣sel she laid hold on, because he desired her to take nothing, and throw out, for <HI>Non de ponte vadit, qui cum sapientia cadit:</HI> matters thus standing, seeing the Masters of the chamber of Accompts, or members of that Com∣mittee, did not fully agree amongst them∣selves in casting up the number of the <HI>Al∣manie</HI> whistles, whereof were framed those spectacles for Princes, which have been late∣ly printed at <HI>Antwerp:</HI> I must needs think that it makes a bad return of the Writ; and that the adverse Party is not to be beleeved, <HI>in sacer verbo dotis;</HI> for that having a great de∣sire to obey the pleasure of the King, I arm∣ed my self from toe to top with belly furni∣ture, of the soles of good venison-pasties, to go see how my grape-gatherers and vinta∣gers had pinked and cut full of small holes their high coped-caps, to lecher it the better, and play at <HI>in and in.</HI> And indeed the time was very dangerous in coming from the Faire, in so farre that many trained bowe-men were cast at the muster, and quite rejected, al∣though the chimney-tops were high enough, according to the proportion of the <HI>wind∣galls</HI>

<P>Should I endure, that, when I am eating my pottage equall with the best, and that without either thinking or speaking any man∣ner of ill, they rudely come to vexe, trouble, and perplex my braines with that antick Pro∣verb which saith,

and good Lady, how many great Captaines have we seen in the day of battel, when in open field the Sacrament was distributed in lunchions of the sanctified bread of the Con∣fraternity, the more honestly to nod their heads, play on the lute, and crack with their tailes, to make pretty little platforme leaps, in keeping level by the ground: but now the world is unshackled from the corners of the packs of <HI>Leycester.</HI> One flies out lewdly and becomes debauch't, another likewise five, four and two, and that at such randome, that if the Court take not some course therein, it will make as bad a season in matter of glean∣ing this yeare, as ever it made, or it will make goblets. If any poor creature go to the stoves to illuminate his muzzle with a

Cow-shard, or to buy winter-boots, and that the Serjeants passing by, or those of the watch happen to receive the decoction of a clystere, or the fecal matter of a close-stool, upon their rustling-wrangling-clutter-keep∣ing masterships, should any because of that make bold to clip the shillings and testers, and fry the wooden dishes? sometimes when we think one thing, God does another; and and when the Sunne is wholly set, all beasts are in the shade: let me never be be∣leeved again, if I do not gallantly prove it by several people that have seen the light of the day.</P>
<P>In the yeare thirty and six, buying a <HI>Dutch</HI> curtail, which was a middle sized horse, both high and short, of a wool good e∣nough, and died in graine, as the Gold∣smiths assured me, although the Notarie put an <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in it; I told really, that I was not a Clerk of so much learning as to snatch at the Moon with my teeth; but as for the Butter∣firkin, where <HI>Vulcanian</HI> deeds and eviden∣ces were sealed, the rumour was, and the re∣port thereof went currant, that salt-beefe will make one finde the way to the wine without a candle, though it were hid in the bottom of a Colliers sack, and that with his drawers on he were mounted on a barbed horse furnished with a fronstal, and such armes, thighs and leg-pieces as are requisite

for the well frying and broyling of a swag∣gering sawcinesse. Here is a sheeps head, and it is well they make a proverb of this, that it is good to see black Cowes in burnt wood, when one attains to the enjoyment of his love. I had a consultation upon this point with my Masters the Clerks, who for resolution concluded in <HI>frisesomorum,</HI> that there is nothing like to mowing in the sum∣mer, and sweeping clean away in water, well garnished with paper, ink, pens and penknives of <HI>Lyons</HI> upon the river of <HI>Rosne; dolopym do∣lopof, tarabin tarabas, tut prut pish:</HI> for incon∣tinently after that armour begins to smell of garlick, the rust will go near to eat the liver, not of him that weares it, and then do they nothing else but withstand others courses, and wry-neckedly set up their bristles 'gainst one another, in lightly passing over their after∣noons sleep, and this is that which maketh salt so dear. My Lords, beleeve not, when the said good woman had with bird-lime, caught the shovelar fowle, the better before a Serjeants witnesse, to deliver the younger sons portion to him, that the sheeps pluck, or hogs haslet, did dodge and shrink back in the Usurers purses, or that there could be a∣ny thing better to preserve one from the Cannibals, then to take a rope of onions, knit with three hundred turneps, and a little of a Calves Chaldern of the best allay that

Now if the dice will not favour you with a∣ny other throw but ambesace, and the chance of three at the great end, mark well the ace, then take me your dame, settle her in a cor∣ner of the bed, and whisk me her up drille-trille there there, <HI>tourelouralala,</HI> which when you have done, take a hearty draught of the best, <HI>despicando grenovillibus,</HI> in despight of the frogs; whose faire course bebuskined stockins shall be set apart for the little green geese, or mued goslings, which fatned in a coope, take delight to sport themselves at the wagtaile game, waiting for the beating of the mettal, and heating of the waxe by the sla∣vering drivellers of consolation.</P>

And put the case, that at the coupling together of the buck-hounds, the little puppies should have wax∣ed proud before the Notarie could have given an account of the serving of his Writ by the Cabalistick Art, it will necessarily follow (un∣der correction of the better judgement of the Court,) that six acres of medow ground of the greatest breadth, will make three butts of fine ink, without paying ready money: considering that at the Funeral of King <HI>Charles,</HI> we might have had the fathom in

Such another sentence after the homeliest manner was pro∣nounced in the seventeenth yeare, because of the bad government of <HI>Louzefougarouse,</HI> whereunto it may please the Court to have regard. I desire to be rightly understood; for truly I say not, but that in all equity, and with an upright conscience, those may very well be dispossest, who drink holy wa∣ter, as one would do a weavers shuttle, where∣of suppositories are made to those that will not resigne, but on the termes of ell and tell, and giving of one thing for another. <HI>Tunc</HI> (my Lords) <HI>quid juris pro minoribus?</HI> for the common custom of the <HI>Salick</HI> law is such, that the first incendiarie or fire-brand of se∣dition, that flayes the Cow, and wipes his nose in a full consort of musick, without blowing in the Coblers stitches, should in the

They answered him, We have indeed heard it, but have not understood the devil so much as one circumstance of the case; and therefore we beseech you <HI>unâ voce,</HI> and in courtesie re∣quest you, that you would give sentence as you think good, and <HI>ex nunc prout ex tunc,</HI> we are satisfied with it, and do ratifie it with our full consents: Well, my Masters (said <HI>Pantagruel)</HI> seeing you are so pleased, I will do it: but I do not truly finde the case so difficult as you make it: your paragraph <HI>Ca∣ton:</HI> the law <HI>Frater,</HI> the law <HI>Gallus,</HI> the law <HI>Quinque pedum,</HI> the law <HI>Vinum,</HI> the law <HI>Si Dominus,</HI> the law <HI>Mater,</HI> the law <HI>Mulier bona,</HI> the law <HI>Si quis,</HI> the law <HI>Pomponius,</HI> the law <HI>Fundi,</HI> the law <HI>Emptor,</HI> the law <HI>Praetor,</HI> the law <HI>Venditor,</HI> and a great many others are farre more intricate in my opinion. After he had spoke this, he walked a turn or two about the hall, plodding very profoundly as one may think; for he did groan like an Asse, whilest they girth him too hard, with the ve∣ry intensivenesse of considering how he was bound in conscience to do right to both par∣ties, without varying or accepting of per∣sons. Then he returned, sate down, and began to pronounce sentence as follow∣eth.</P>
<P>Having seen, heard, calculated and well considered of the difference between the

Lords of <HI>Kissebreech</HI> and <HI>Suckfist;</HI> the Court saith unto them, that in regard of the sudden quaking, shivering and hoarinesse of the flick∣ermouse bravely declining from the estival solstice, to attempt by private means the sur∣prisal of toyish trifles in those, who are a little unwell for having taken a draught too much, through the lewd demeanour and vexation of the beetles, that inhabit the <HI>Diarodal</HI> cli∣mate of an hypocritical Ape on horseback, bending a Crossebowe backwards.

<P>The Court therefore doth condemn and amerce him in three porringers of curds, well cemented and closed together, shining like pearles, and Codpieced after the fashion of the Countrey, to be payed unto the said Defendant, about the middle of <HI>August</HI> in <HI>May:</HI> but on the other part the Defendant shall be bound to furnish him with hay and stubble, for stopping the caltrops of his throat, troubled and <HI>impulregafized,</HI> with gabardines garbeled shufflingly, and friends as before, without costs and for cause.</P>

Which sentence being pronounced, the two Parties departed both contented with the decree, which was a thing almost incre∣dible; for it never came to passe since the great rain, nor shall the like occur in thirteen jubilees hereafter, that two Parties contra∣dictorily contending in judgment, be equal∣ly satisfied and well pleased with the defini∣tive sentence. As for the Counsellors, &amp; other Doctors in the law, that were there present, they were all so ravished with admiration at the more then humane wisdom of <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> which they did most clearly perceive to be in him, by his so accurate decision of this so difficult and thornie cause, that their spirits, with the extremity of the rapture, being ele∣vated above the pitch of actuating the or∣gans of the body, they fell into a trance and sudden extasie, wherein they stayed for the space of three long houres, and had been so as yet in that condition, had not some good people fetched store of vineger and rose-wa∣ter, to bring them again unto their former sense and understanding, for the which God be praised every where; And so be it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. <HI>How</HI> Panurge <HI>related the manner how he esca∣ped out of the hands of the</HI> Turks.</HEAD>
<P>THe great wit and judgement of <HI>Panta∣gruel,</HI> was immediately after this made known unto all the world, by setting forth his praises in print, and putting upon record this late wonderful proof he hath gi∣ven thereof amongst the Rolls of the Crown, and Registers of the Palace, in such sort, that every body began to say, that <HI>Solomon,</HI> who by a probable guesse only, without any fur∣ther certainty, caused the childe to be deli∣vered to its own mother, shewed never in his time such a Master-piece of wisdom, as the good <HI>Pantagruel</HI> hath done; happy are we therefore that have him in our Countrey. And indeed they would have made him thereupon Master of the Requests, and Pre∣sident in the Court: but he refused all, very graciously thanking them for their offer, for (said he) there is too much slavery in these offices, and very hardly can they be saved that do exercise them, considering the great cor∣ruption that is amongst men: which makes me beleeve, if the empty seats of Angels be
<PB N="94" REF="184"/>
not fil'd with other kind of people then those, we shall not have the final judgement these seven thousand sixty and seven jubilees yet to come; and so <HI>Cusanus</HI> will be deceived in his conjecture: Remember that I have told you of it, and given you faire advertisement in time and place convenient.</P>
<P>But if you have any hogsheads of good wine, I willingly will accept of a present of that, which they very heartily did do, in sending him of the best that was in the City, and he drank reasonably well, but poor <HI>Pa∣nurge</HI> bibbed and bowsed of it most villain∣ously, for he was as dry as a red-herring, as lean as a rake, and like a poor, lank, slender cat, walked gingerly as if he had trod upon egges: so that by some one being admonish∣ed, in the midst of his draught of a large deep bowle, full of excellent Claret, with these words, Faire and softly, <HI>Gossip,</HI> you suck up as if you were mad: I give thee to the devil, (said he) thou hast not found here thy little tipling sippers of <HI>Paris,</HI> that drink no more then the little bird called a <HI>spink</HI> or <HI>chaffinch,</HI> and never take in their beak ful of liquour, till they be bobbed on the tailes after the manner of the sparrows. O companion, if I could mount up as well as I can get down, I had been long ere this above the sphere of the Moon with <HI>Empedocles.</HI> But I cannot tell what a devil this meanes. This wine is so
<PB N="95" REF="184"/>
good and delicious, that the more I drink thereof, the more I am athirst; I beleeve that the shadow of my Master <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> engendereth the altered and thirsty men, as the Moon doth the catarres and defluxions; at which word the company began to laugh: which <HI>Pantagruel</HI> perceiving, said, <HI>Panurge</HI> What is that which moves you to laugh so? Sir, said he, I was telling them that these de∣villish Turks are very unhappy, in that they never drink one drop of wine, and that though there were no other harme in all <HI>Ma∣homets Alcoran,</HI> yet for this one base point of abstinence from wine, which therein is com∣manded, I would not submit my self unto their law. But now tell me, (said <HI>Pantagruel)</HI> how you escaped out of their hands. By G—Sir (said <HI>Panurge)</HI> I will not lie to you in one word.</P>
<P>The rascally <HI>Turks</HI> had broached me upon a spit all larded like a rabbet, (for I was so dry and meagre, that otherwise of my flesh they would have made but very bad meat) and in this manner began to rost me alive. As they were thus roasting me, I recom∣mended my self unto the divine grace, ha∣ving in my minde the good St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and alwayes hoped in God that he would deliver me out of this torment, which came to passe, and that very strangely; for as I did com∣mit my self with all my heart unto God,
<PB N="96" REF="185"/>
crying, Lord God help me, Lord God save me, Lord God take me out of this pain and hellish torture, wherein these traiterous dogs detain me for my sincerity in the mainte∣nance of thy law: the roster or turn-spit fell asleep by the divine will, or else by the ver∣tue of some good <HI>Mercury,</HI> who cunningly brought <HI>Argus</HI> into a sleep for all his hundred eyes: when I saw that he did no longer turne me in roasting, I looked upon him, and per∣ceived that he was fast asleep, then took I up in my teeth a firebrand by the end where it was not burnt, and cast it into the lap of my roaster, and another did I throw as well as I could under a field-couche, that was placed near to the chimney, wherein was the straw∣bed of my Master turnspit; presently the fire took hold in the straw, and from rhe straw to the bed, and from the bed to the loft, which was planked and seeled with firre, after the fashion of the foot of a lamp: but the best was, that the fire which I had cast into the lap of my paultry roaster, burnt all his groine, and was beginning to cease upon his cullions, when he became sensible of the danger, for his smelling was not so bad, but that he felt it sooner then he could have seen day-light: then suddenly getting up, and in a great a∣mazement running to the window, he cried out to the streets as high as he could, <HI>dalbaroth, dalbaroth, dalbaroth,</HI> which is as much to say
<PB N="97" REF="185"/>
as, <HI>Fire, fire, fire:</HI> incontinently turning a∣bout, he came streight towards me, to throw me quite into the fire, and to that effect had already cut the ropes, wherewith my hands were tied, and was undoing the cords from off my feet; when the Master of the house hearing him cry, Fire, and smelling the smoke from the very street where he was walking with some other <HI>Baashaws</HI> and <HI>Mustaphaes,</HI> ran with all the speed he had to save what he could, and to carry away his Jewels; yet such was his rage (before he could well resolve how to go about it,) that he caught the broach whereon I was spitted, and therewith killed my roaster stark dead, of which wound he died there for want of government or o∣therwise; for he ran him in with the spit a little above the navel, towards the right flank, till he pierced the third lappet of his liver, and the blow flanting upwards from the mid∣riffe or <HI>diaphragme,</HI> through which it had made penetration, the spit past athwart the <HI>pericardium,</HI> or capsule of his heart, and came out above at his shoulders, betwixt the <HI>spon∣dyls</HI> or turning joints of the chine of the back, and the left <HI>homoplat,</HI> which we call the shoul∣der-blade.</P>
<P>True it is, (for I will not lie,) that in draw∣ing the spit out of my body, I fell to the ground near unto the Andirons, and so by the fall took some hurt, which indeed had
<PB N="98" REF="186"/>
been greater, but that the <HI>lardons,</HI> or little sli∣ces of bacon, wherewith I was stuck, kept off the blow. My <HI>Baashaw</HI> then seeing the case to be desperate, his house burnt without re∣mission, and all his goods lost, gave himselfe over unto all the devils in hell, calling upon some of them by their names, <HI>Gringoth, Asta∣roth, Rappalus,</HI> and <HI>Gribouillis,</HI> nine several times, which when <HI>I</HI> saw, <HI>I</HI> had above six pence worth of feare, dreading that the de∣vils would come even then to carry away this foole, and seeing me so near him would per∣haps snatch me up too: <HI>I</HI> am already (thought <HI>I)</HI> halfe rosted, and my lardons, will be the cause of my mischief; for these devils are very lickorous of lardons, according to the authority which you have of the Philosopher <HI>Jamblicus</HI> and <HI>Murmault,</HI> in the Apology of <HI>Bossuris,</HI> adulterated <HI>pro magistros nostros:</HI> but for my better security <HI>I</HI> made the signe of the Crosse; crying, <HI>Hageos, athanatos, hotheos,</HI> and none came: at which my rogue <HI>Baashaw</HI> being very much aggrieved, would in trans∣piercing his heart with my spit have killed himself; and to that purpose had set it against his breast, but it could not enter, because it was not sharp enough; whereupon <HI>I</HI> percei∣ving that he was not like to work upon his bo∣dy the effect which he intended, although he did not spare all the force he had to thrust it forward, came up to him and said, Master <HI>Bu∣grino,</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="186"/>
thou dost here but trifle away thy time, or rashly lose it, for thou wilt never kill thy self thus as thou doest: well thou mayest hurt or bruise somewhat within thee, so as to make thee languish all thy life-time most pi∣tifully amongst the hands of the Chirurgions; but if thou wilt be counselled by me, I will kill thee clear out-right, so that thou shalt not so much as feel it, and trust me, for I have killed a grear many others, who have found themselves very well after it: Ha, my friend, said he, I prethee do so, and for thy paines I will give thee my Codpiece, take, here it is, there are six hundred Seraphs in it, and some fine Diamonds, and most excellent Rubies. And where are they (said <HI>Episte∣mon?)</HI> By St. <HI>John</HI> (said <HI>Panurge)</HI> they are a good way hence, if they alwayes keep going: but where is the last yeares snow? this was the greatest care that <HI>Villon</HI> the <HI>Parisien</HI> Poet took. Make an end (said <HI>Pantagruel)</HI> that we may know how thou didst dresse thy <HI>Baashaw:</HI> By the faith of an honest man (said <HI>Panurge) I</HI> do not lie in one word, <HI>I</HI> swadled him in a scurvie swathel-binding, which I found lying there half burnt, and with my cords tied him royster-like both hand and foot, in such sort that he was not able to winse, then past my spit thorough his throat, and hanged him thereon, fastening the end thereof at two great hooks or cramp-irons, upon which they
<PB N="100" REF="187"/>
did hang their Halberds; and then kindling a faire fire under him, did flame you up my <HI>Milourt,</HI> as they use to do dry herrings in a chimney: with this, taking his budget, and a little javelin that was upon the foresaid hooks, <HI>I</HI> ran away a faire gallop-rake, and God he knows how <HI>I</HI> did smell my shoulder of mut∣ton.</P>
<P>When <HI>I</HI> was come down into the street, <HI>I</HI> found every body come to put out the fire with store of water, and seeing me so halfe-roasted, they did naturally pity my case, and threw all their water upon me, which by a most joyful refreshing of me, did me very much good: then did they present me with some victuals, but <HI>I</HI> could not eat much, be∣cause they gave me nothing to drink but wa∣ter afrer their fashion. Other hurt they did me none, only one little villainous <HI>Turkie</HI> knobbreasted rogue, came thiefteously to snatch away some of my lardons, but <HI>I</HI> gave him such a sturdie thump and sound rap on the fingers, with all the weight of my jave∣lin, that he came no more the second time. Shortly after this, there came towards me a pretty young <HI>Corinthian</HI> wench, who brought me a box full of Conserves, of round <HI>Mi∣rabolan</HI> plums, called <HI>Emblicks,</HI> and looked upon my poor <HI>Robin</HI> with an eye of great compassion, as it was flea-bitten and pinked with the sparkles of the fire from whence it
<PB N="101" REF="187"/>
came, for it reached no further in length, (be∣leeve me) then my knees; but note, that this roasting cured me entirely of a Sciatick, whereunto <HI>I</HI> had been subject above seven yeares before, upon that side, which my roast∣er, by falling asleep, suffered to be burnt.</P>
<P>Now whilest they were thus busie about me, the fire triumphed, never ask, How? for it took hold on above two thousand houses, which one of them espying, cried out, say∣ing, By <HI>Mahooms</HI> belly all the City is on fire, and we do neverthelesse stand gazing here, without offering to make any relief: upon this every one ran to save his own; for my part, <HI>I</HI> took my way towards the gate. When <HI>I</HI> was got upon the knap of a little hillock, not farre off, <HI>I</HI> turned me about as did <HI>Lots</HI> wife, and looking back, saw all the City burning in a faire fire, whereat <HI>I</HI> was so glad, that <HI>I</HI> had almost beshit my selfe for joy: but God punished me well for it: How? said <HI>Panta∣gruel:</HI> Thus, said <HI>Panurge;</HI> for when with pleasure <HI>I</HI> beheld this jolly fire, jesting with my self, and saying, Ha poor flies, ha poor mice, you will have a bad winter of it this yeare, the fire is in your reeks, it is in your bed-straw, out came more then six, yea more then thirteen hundred and eleven dogs great and small, altogether out of the town, flying away from the fire; at the first approach they ran all upon me, being carried on by the
<PB N="102" REF="188"/>
sent of my leacherous half-roasted flesh, and had even then devoured me in a trice, if my good Angel had not well inspired me with the instruction of a remedy, very sovereign a∣gainst the tooth-ache. And wherefore (said <HI>Pantagruel)</HI> wert thou afraid of the tooth-ache, or paine of the teeth? wert thou not cured of thy Rheumes? By Palme-sunday, (said <HI>Panurge)</HI> is there any greater pain of the teeth, then when the dogs have you by the legs? but on a sudden, (as my good Angel directed me) <HI>I</HI> thought upon my lardons, and threw them into the midst of the field a∣mongst them: then did the dogs run, and fight with one another at faire teeth, which should have the lardons: by this means they left me, and <HI>I</HI> left them also bustling with, and hairing one another. Thus did <HI>I</HI> escape frolick and lively, grammercie roastmeat and cookery.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. <HI>How</HI> Panurge <HI>shewed a very new way to build the walls of</HI> Paris.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PAntagruel</HI> one day to refresh himself of his study, went a walking towards St. <HI>Marcels</HI> suburbs, to see the extravagancie
<PB N="103" REF="188"/>
of the <HI>Gobeline</HI> building, and to taste of their spiced bread. <HI>Panurge</HI> was with him, having alwayes a flaggon under his gown, and a good slice of a gammon of bacon; for without this he never went, saying, that it was as a Yeoman of the guard to him, to preserve his body from harme, other sword carried he none: and when <HI>Pantagruel</HI> would have given him one, he answered, that he needed none, for that it would but heat his milt. Yea but (said <HI>Epistemon)</HI> if thou shouldest be set upon, how wouldest thou defend thy self? With great <HI>buskinades</HI> or brodkin blowes, answered he, provided thursts were forbidden. At their return, <HI>Panurge</HI> considered the walls of the City of <HI>Paris,</HI> and in derision said to <HI>Panta∣gruel,</HI> See what faire walls here are! O how strong they are, and well fitted to keep geese in a mue or coop to fatten them! by my beard they are competently scurvie for such a City as this is; for a Cow with one fart would go near to overthrow above six fa∣thoms of them. O my friend (said <HI>Panta∣gruel)</HI> doest thou know what <HI>Agesilaus</HI> said, when he was asked, Why the great City of <HI>Lacedemon</HI> was not inclosed with walls? Lo here (said he) the walls of the City, in shew∣ing them the inhabitants and Citizens there∣of, so strong, so well armed, and so expert in military discipline; signifying thereby, that there is no wall but of bones; and that Towns
<PB N="104" REF="189"/>
and Cities cannot have a surer wall, nor bet∣ter fortification then the prowesse and vertue of the Citizens and Inhabitants; so is this City so strong, by the great number of war∣like people that are in it, that they care not for making any other walls. Besides, whoso∣ever would go about to wall it, as <HI>Strasbourg, Orleans</HI> or <HI>Ferrara,</HI> would finde it almost im∣possible, the cost and charges would be so ex∣cessive. Yea, but (said <HI>Panurge)</HI> it is good neverthelesse to have an out-side of stone, when we are invaded by our enemies, were it but to ask, Who is below there? As for the enormous expence, which you say would be needful for undertaking the great work of walling this City about, if the Gentlemen of the Town will be pleased to give me a good rough cup of wine, I will shew them a pretty, strange and new way how they may build them good cheap. How (said <HI>Panta∣gruel?)</HI> Do not speak of it then (answered <HI>Panurge,)</HI> and I will tell it you. I see that the <HI>sine quo nons, killibistris,</HI> or <HI>contrapunctums</HI> of the women of this Countrey, are better cheap then stones: of them should the walls be built, ranging them in good symmetrie by the rules of Architecture, and placing the largest in the first ranks, then sloping down∣wards ridgewayes, like the back of an Asse, the middle sized ones must be ranked next, and last of all the least and smallest. This
<PB N="105" REF="189"/>
done, there must be a fine little interlacing of them, like points of Diamonds, as is to be seen in the grear Tower of <HI>Bourges,</HI> with a like number of the <HI>nudinnudo's, nilnisistando's,</HI> and stiffe <HI>bracmards,</HI> that dwell in amongst the claustral Codpieces. What devil were able to overthrow such walls? there is no metal like it to resist blowes, in so farre that if Culverin-shot should come to grease upon it, you would incontinently see distill from thence the blessed fruit of the great pox, as small as raine: beware in the name of the de∣vils, and hold off; furthermore, no thunder∣bolt or lightning would fall upon it, for why? they are all either blest or consecrated: I see but one inconveniency in it: Ho, ho, ha, ha, ha, (said <HI>Pantagruel,)</HI> and what is that? It is that the flies would be so lickorish of them, that you would wonder, and would quickly ga∣ther there together, and there leave their or∣dure and excretions, and so all the work would be spoiled. But see how that might be remedied, they must be wiped and made rid of the flies with faire fox-tailes, or good great <HI>viedazes</HI> (which are Asse-pizzles) of <HI>Provence.</HI> And to this purpose I will tell you (as we go to supper,) a brave example set down by <HI>Frater Lubinus libro de compotationi∣bus mendicantium;</HI> in the time that the beasts did speak, which is not yet three dayes since.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="190"/>
A poor Lion, walking through the for∣test of <HI>Bieure,</HI> and saying his own little pri∣vate devotions, past under a tree, where there was a roguish Collier gotten up to cut down wood, who seeing the Lion, cast his hatchet at him, and wounded him enormously in one of his legs, whereupon the Lion halting, he so long toiled and turmoiled himself in roam∣ing up and down the forrest to finde helpe, that at last he met with a Carpenter, who wil∣lingly look't upon his wound, cleansed it as well as he could, and filled it with mosse, telling him that he must wipe his wound well, that the flies might not do their excrements in it, whilest he should go search for some yarrow or millefoile, commonly called the Carpenters herbe. The Lion being thus heal∣ed, walked along in the forrest, at what time a sempiternous Crone and old Hag, was pick∣ing up, and gathering some sticks in the said forrest, whoseeing the Lion coming towards her, for feare fell down backwards, in such sort, that the winde blew up her gown, coats and smock even as farre as above her shoul∣ders; which the Lion perceiving, for pity ran to see whether she had taken any hurt by the fall, and thereupon considering her <HI>how do you call it,</HI> said, O poor woman, who hath thus wounded thee? which words when he had spoken, he espied a fox, whom he called to come to him, saying, <HI>Gossip Renard,</HI> hau, hi∣ther,
<PB N="107" REF="190"/>
hither, and for cause: when the fox was come, he said unto him, My gossip and friend, they have hurt this good woman here be∣tween the legs most villainously, and there is a manifest solution of continuity, see how great a wound it is, even from the taile up to the navel, in measure foure, nay full five handfulls and a half; this is the blow of an hatchet, I doubt me it is an old wound, and therefore that the flies may not get into it, wipe it lustily well and hard; I prethy, both within and without; thou hast a good taile and long, wipe, my friend, wipe, I beseech thee, and in the mean while I will go get some mosse to put into it; for thus ought we to succour and help one another, wipe it hard, thus, my friend, wipe it well, for this wound must be often wiped, otherwise the Party cannot be at ease: go to, wipe well, my little gossip, wipe, God hath furnished thee with a taile, thou hast a long one, and of a bignesse proportionable, wipe hard and be not weary. A good <HI>wiper,</HI> who in <HI>wiping</HI> continually, <HI>wi∣peth</HI> with his <HI>wipard,</HI> by wasps shall never be wounded: wipe, my pretty minion, wipe, my little bullie, <HI>I</HI> will not stay long. Then went he to get store of mosse; and when he was a little way off, he cried out in speaking to the fox thus, Wipe well still, gossip, wipe, and let it never grieve thee to wipe well, my little gossip, <HI>I</HI> will put thee into service to be wiper
<PB N="108" REF="191"/>
to <HI>Don Pedro de Castille,</HI> wipe, only wipe, and no more: the poor fox wiped as hard as he could, here and there, within and witho u: but the false old trot did so fizzle and fist, that she stunk like a hundred devils, which put the poor fox to a great deal of ill ease, for he knew not to what side to turn himself, to escape the unsavoury perfume of this old womans po∣stern blasts, and whilest to that effect he was shifting hither and thither, without knowing how to shun the annoyance of those unwhole∣som gusts, he saw that behinde there was yet another hole, not so great as that which he did wipe, out of which came this filthy and infectious aire. The Lion at last return∣ed, bringing with him of mosse more then eighteen packs would hold, and began to put into the wound, with a staffe that which he had provided for that purpose, and had already put in full sixteen packs and a half, at which he was amazed: What a devil? (said he) this wound is very deep, it would hold above two cart-loads of mosse. The fox perceiving this, said unto the Lion, O gossip Lion, my friend, I pray thee do not put in all thy mosse there, keep somewhat; for there is yet here ano∣ther little hole, that stinks like five hundred devils; I am almost choaked with the smell thereof, it is so pestiferous and impoison∣ing.</P>
<P>Thus must these walls be kept from the
<PB N="109" REF="191"/>
flies, and wages allowed to some for wiping of them. Then said <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> How dost thou know that the privy parts of women are at such a cheap rate? for in this City there are many vertuous, honest and chaste women besides the maids: <HI>Et ubi prenus,</HI> said <HI>Pa∣nurge?</HI> I will give you my opinion of it, and that upon certain and assured knowledge. I do not brag that I have bumbasted four hun∣dred and seventeen, since I came into this City, though it be but nine dayes ago: but this very morning I met with a good fellow, who in a wallet, such as <HI>Aesops</HI> was, carried two little girles of two or three yeares old at the most, one before, and the other behinde: he demanded almes of me, but <HI>I</HI> made him answer, that <HI>I</HI> had more cods then pence; af∣terwards <HI>I</HI> asked him, <HI>Good man,</HI> these two girles are they maids? Brother, said he, <HI>I</HI> have carried them thus these two yeares, and in regard of her that is before, whom <HI>I</HI> see continually, in my opinion she is a Virgin, neverthelesse <HI>I</HI> will not put my finger in the fire for it; as for her that is behinde, doubt∣lesse I can say nothing. Indeed (said <HI>Panta∣gruel)</HI> thou art a gentile companion, <HI>I</HI> will have thee to be apparelled in my liverly, and therefore caused him to be clothed most gallantly according to the fashion that then was, only that <HI>Panurge</HI> would have the Cod∣piece of his breeches three foot long, and in
<PB N="110" REF="192"/>
shape square, not round, which was done and was well worth the seeing. Often∣times was he wont to say that the world had not yet known the emolument and u∣tility that is in wearing great Codpieces; but time would one day teach it them, as all things have been invented in time. God keep from hurt (said he) the good fellow whose long Codpiece or Braguet hath saved his life: God keep from hurt him, whose long Braguet hath been worth to him in one day, one hundred threescore thousand and nine Crowns: God keep from hurt him, who by his long Braguet hath saved a whole City from dying by famine. And by G—I will make a book of the commodity of long Bra∣guets, when I shall have more leasure. And indeed he composed a faire great book with figures, but it is not printed as yet that I know of.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. <HI>Of the qualities and conditions of</HI> Panurge.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PAnurge</HI> was of a middle stature, not too high, nor too low, and had somewhat an Aquiline nose, made like the handle of a ra∣sor: he was at that time five and thirty years
<PB N="111" REF="192"/>
old or thereabouts, fine to gild like a leaden dagger; for he was a notable cheater and cony-catcher, he was a very gallant and pro∣per man of his person, only that he was a little leacherous, and naturally subject to a kinde of disease, which at that time they cal∣led lack of money: it is an incomparable grief, yet notwithstanding he had chreescore and three tricks to come by it at his need, of which the most honourable and most ordi∣nary was in manner of thieving, secret pur∣loining and filching; for he was a wicked lewd rogue, a cosener, drinker, royster, ro∣ver, and a very dissolute and debautch'd fel∣low, if there were any in <HI>Paris;</HI> otherwise, and in all matters else, the best and most ver∣tuous man in the world: and he was still con∣triving some plot, and devising mischief a∣gainst the Serjeants and the watch.</P>

gave it the brangle, hurling it with all their force down the hill, and so overthrew all the poor watchmen like pigs, and then ran away upon the other side; for in lesse then two dayes, he knew all the streets, lanes and turn∣ings in <HI>Paris,</HI> as well as his <HI>Deus det.</HI></P>
<P>At another time he made in some faire place, where the said watch was to passe, a traine of gun-powder, and at the very instant, that they went along, set fire to it, and then made himself sport to see what good grace they had in running away, thinking that St. <HI>Antonies</HI> fire had caught them by the legs. As for the poor Masters of Arts, he did per∣secute them above all others: when he en∣countered with any of them upon the street, he would not never faile to put some trick or other upon them, sometimes putting the bit of a fried turd in their graduate hoods: At o∣ther times pinning on little fox-tails, or hares-eares behinde them, or some such other ro∣guish prank. One day that they were appoint∣ed all to meet in the <HI>fodder-street,</HI> he made a <HI>Borbonnesa</HI> tart, or filthy and slovenly com∣pound, made of store of garlick, of <HI>Assa foe∣tida,</HI> of <HI>Castoreum,</HI> of dogs turds very warm, which he steeped, temper'd and liquifi'd in the corrupt matter of pockie biles, and pestife∣rous botches, and very early in the morning, therewith anointed all the pavement, in such sort, that the devil could not have endured it,
<PB N="113" REF="193"/>
which made all these good people, there to lay up their gorges, and vomit what was up∣on their stomacks before all the world, as if they had flayed the fox; and ten or twelve of them died of the plague, fourteen became lepers, eighteen grew lousie, and above seven and twenty had the pox but he did not care a button for it. He commonly carried a whip under his gowne wherewith he whipt with∣out remission the pages, whom he found car∣rying wine to their Masters, to make them mend their pace. In his coat he had above six and twenty little fabs and pockets alwayes full, one with some lead-water, and a little knife as sharp as a glovers needle, wherewith he used to cut purses: Another with some kinde of bitter stuffe, which he threw into the eyes of those he met: another with clotburrs, penned with little geese or capons feathers, which he cast upon the gowns and caps of honest people: and often made them faire hornes, which they wore about all the City, sometimes all their life. Very often also up∣on the womens <HI>French</HI> hoods would he stick in the hind-part somewhat made in the shape of a mans member. In another he had a great many little hornes full of fleas and lice, which he borrowed from the beggars of St. <HI>Innocent,</HI> and cast them with small canes or quills to write with, into the necks of the daintiest Gentlewomen that he could finde▪
<PB N="114" REF="194"/>
yea even in the Church, for he never seated himself above in the quire, but alwayes sate in the body of the Church amongst the wo∣men, both at Masse, at Vespres, and at Ser∣mon. In another, he used to have good store of hooks and buckles, wherewlth he would couple men and women together, that sate in company close to one another, but especial∣ly those that wore gownes of crimson taf∣faties, that when they were about to go away, they might rent all their gownes. In another, he had a squib furnished with tinder, matches, stones to strike fire, and all other tackling necessary for it: in another, two or three burning glasses, wherewith he made both men and women sometimes mad, and in the Church put them quite out of counte∣nance; for he said that there was but an <HI>An∣tistrophe,</HI> or little more difference then of a literal inversion between a woman, <HI>folle a la messe,</HI> and <HI>molle a la fesse;</HI> that is, <HI>foolish at the Masse,</HI> and <HI>of a pliant buttock.</HI></P>
<P>In another he had a good deal of needles and thread, wherewith he did a thousand little devillish pranks. One time at the entry of the Palace unto the great Hall, where a certain gray Friar or <HI>Cordelier</HI> was to say Masse to the Counsellors: He did help to ap∣parel him, and put on his vestments, but in the accoutring of him, he sowed on his alb, surplice or stole to his gowne and shirt, and
<PB N="115" REF="194"/>
then withdrew himself, when the said Lords of the Court, or Counsellors came to heare the said Masse; but when it came to the <HI>Ite, missa est,</HI> that the poor <HI>Frater</HI> would have laid by his <HI>stole</HI> or surplice (as the fashion then was) he plucked off withal both his frock and shirt which were well sowed together, and therby stripping himself up to the very shoul∣ders, shewed his <HI>bel vedere</HI> to all the world, together with his <HI>Don Cypriano,</HI> which was no small one, as you may imagine: and the Friar still kept haling, but so much the more did he discover himself, and lay open his back-parts, till one of the Lords of the Court said, How now, what's the matter? will this faire Father make us here an offering of his taile to kisse it? nay, St. <HI>Antonies</HI> fire kisse it for us. From thenceforth it was ordained that the poor Fathers should never disrobe them∣selves any more before the world, but in their vestry-room, or sextry, as they call it; espe∣cially in the presence of women, lest it should tempt them to the sin of longing, and disor∣dinate desire. The people then asked, why it was the Friars had so long and large genito∣ries? the said <HI>Panurge</HI> resolved the <HI>Probleme</HI> very neatly, saying, That which makes Asses to have such great eares, is that their dams did put no biggins on their heads, as <HI>Alliaco</HI> mentioneth in his <HI>suppositions:</HI> by the like rea∣son, that which makes the genitories or gene∣ration-tooles
<PB N="116" REF="195"/>
of those faire <HI>Fraters</HI> so long is, for that they ware no bottomed breech∣es, and therefore their jolly member having no impediment, hangeth dangling at liberty, as farre as it can reach, with a wigle-wagle down to their knees, as women carry their <HI>patinotre</HI> beads: and the cause wherefore they have it so correspondently great, is, that in this constant wig-wagging the humours of the body descend into the said member: for according to the <HI>Legists,</HI> Agitation and conti∣nual motion is cause of attraction.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> he had another pocket full of itching powder, called <HI>stone-allum,</HI> whereof he would cast some into the backs of those women, whom he judged to be most beautiful and stately, which did so ticklishly gall them, that some would strip themselves in the open view of the world, and others dance like a cock upon hot embers, or a drumstick on a taber: others again ran about the streets, and he would run after them: to such as were in the stripping veine, he would very civilly come to offer his attendance, and cover them with his cloak, like a courteous and ve∣ry gracious man.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> in another he had a little leather bottle full of old oile, wherewith, when he saw any man or woman in a rich new hand∣some suit, he would grease, smutch and spoil all the best parts of it under colour and pre∣tence
<PB N="117" REF="195"/>
of touching them, saying, This is good cloth, this is good sattin, good taffaties; <HI>Ma∣dam,</HI> God give you all that your noble heart desireth; you have a new suit, <HI>pretty Sir;</HI> and you a new gown, <HI>sweet Mistris,</HI> God give you joy of it, and maintain you in all prospe∣rity, and with this would lay his hand upon their shoulder, at which touch such a villain∣ous spot was left behinde, so enormously engraven to perpetuity in the very soule, bo∣dy and reputation, that the devil himself could never have taken it away: Then upon his departing, he would say, <HI>Madam,</HI> take heed you do not fall, for there is a filthy great hole before you, whereinto if you put your foot, you will quite spoile your self. Ano∣ther he had all full of <HI>Euphorbium,</HI> very fine∣ly pulverised, in that powder did he lay a faire handkerchief curiously wrought, which he had stollen from a pretty Seamstresse of the Palace, in taking away a lowse from off her bosome, which he had put there himself: and when he came into the company of some good Ladies, he would trifle them into a dis∣course of some fine workmanship of bone∣lace, then immediately put his hand into their bosome, asking them, And this work, is it of <HI>Flanders,</HI> or of <HI>Hainault?</HI> and then drew out his handkerchief, and said, Hold, hold, look what work here is, it is of <HI>Foutiman</HI> or of <HI>Foutarabia▪</HI> and shaking it hard at their nose,
<PB N="118" REF="196"/>
made them sneeze for foure houres without ceasing: in the mean while he would fart like a horse, and the women would laugh and say, How now, do you fart, <HI>Panurge?</HI> No, no, <HI>Madam</HI> (said he,) I do but tune my taile to the plain song of the Musick, which you make with your nose. In another he had a picklock, a pellican, a crampiron, a crook, and some other iron tooles, wherewith there was no door nor coffer which he would nor pick open. He had another full of little cups, wherewith he played very artificially, for he had his fingers made to his hand, like those of <HI>Minerva</HI> or <HI>Arachne,</HI> and had here∣tofore cried <HI>Triacle.</HI> And when he changed a teston, cardecu, or any other piece of mo∣ney, the changer had been more subtil then a fox, if <HI>Panurge</HI> had not at every time made five or six sols, (that is some six or seven pence) vanish away invisibly, openly and ma∣nifestly, without making any hurt or lesion, whereof the changer should have felt nothing but the winde.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. <HI>How</HI> Panurge <HI>gained the pardons, and married the old women, and of the suit in law which he had at</HI> Paris.</HEAD>
<P>ONe day I found <HI>Panurge</HI> very much out of countenance, melancholick and si∣lent, which made me suspect that he had no money; whereupon I said unto him, <HI>Panurge,</HI> you are sick, as I do very well perceive by your physiognomie, and I know the disease, you have a flux in your purse; but take no care I have yet seven pence half penny, that never saw father nor mother, which shall not be wanting, no more then the pox in your necessity: whereunto he answered me, Well, well, for money, one day <HI>I</HI> shall have but too much; for I have a Philosophers stone, which attracts money out of mens purses, as the a∣damant doth iron; but will you go with me to gaine the pardons, said he? By my faith (said he) I am no great pardon-taker in this world; if <HI>I</HI> shall be any such in the other, <HI>I</HI> cannot tell: yet let us go in Gods Name, it is but one farthing more or lesse. But (said he) lend me then a farthing upon interest. No, no, (said I) <HI>I</HI> will give it you freely,
<PB N="120" REF="197"/>
and from my heart, <HI>Grates vobis dominos,</HI> said he.</P>
<P>So we went along, beginning at St. <HI>Ger∣vase,</HI> and I got the pardons at the first boxe only, for in those matters very little con∣tenteth me: then did I say my small suffra∣ges, and the prayers of St. <HI>Brigid,</HI> but he gained them at all the boxes, and alwayes gave money to every one of the <HI>Pardoners;</HI> from thence we went to our <HI>Ladies</HI> Church, to St. <HI>Johns,</HI> to St. <HI>Antonies,</HI> and so to the other Churches, where there was a banquet of pardon, for my part, I gained no more of them: but he at all the boxes kissed the relicks, and gave at every one: to be brief, when we were returned, he brought me to drink at the Castle-tavern, and there shewed me ten or twelve of his little bags full of mo∣ney, at which I blest my self, and made the signe of the Crosse, saying, Where have you recovered so much money in so little time? unto which he answered me, that he had ta∣ken it out of the basins of the pardons; For in giving them the first farthing (said he) I put it in with such slight of hand, and so dex∣terously that it appeared to be a three-pence; thus with one hand I took three-pence, nine-pence or six-pence at the least, and with the other as much, and so thorough all the Churches where we have been. Yea, but (said I) you damn your self like a snake, and
<PB N="121" REF="197"/>
are withal a thief and sacrilegious person. True (said he) in your opinion, but I am not of that minde; for the Pardoners do give me it, when they say unto me in presenting the relicks to kisse, <HI>Centuplum accipies,</HI> that is, that for one penny I should take a hundred; for <HI>accipies</HI> is spoken according to the manner of the Hebrewes, who use the future tense in stead of the imperative, as you have in the law, <HI>Diliges Dominum,</HI> that is, <HI>dilige:</HI> even so when the Pardon-bearer sayes to me, <HI>Cen∣tuplum accipies,</HI> his meaning is, <HI>centuplum ac∣cipe;</HI> and so doth <HI>Rabbi Kimy,</HI> and <HI>Rabbi Aben Ezra</HI> expound it, and all the <HI>Massorets, &amp; ibi Bartholus.</HI> Moreover, Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> gave me fifteen hundred francks of yearly pension (which in <HI>English</HI> money is a hundred and fifty pounds) upon his Ecclesiastical revenues and treasure, for having cured him of a canc∣krous botch, which did so torment him, that he thought to have been a Cripple by it all his life. Thus I do pay my self at my owne hand (for otherways I get nothing) upon the said Ecclesiastical treasure. Ho, my friend, (said he) if thou didst know what advantage <HI>I</HI> made, and how well <HI>I</HI> feathered my nest, by the Popes bull of the Croisade, thou wouldest wonder exceedingly. It was worth to me a∣bove six thousand <HI>florins</HI> (in <HI>English</HI> coine six hundred pounds,) and what a devil is become of them? (said <HI>I)</HI> for of that money
<PB N="122" REF="198"/>
thou hast not one half penny. They returned from whence they came (said he,) they did no mote but change their Master.</P>
<P>But <HI>I</HI> employed at least three thousand of them (that is, three hundred pounds <HI>English,)</HI> in marrying (not young Virgins; for they finde but too many husbands) but great old sempiternous trots, which had not so much as one tooth in their heads; and that out of the consideration <HI>I</HI> had, that these good old women had very well spent the time of their youth in playing at the close-buttock-game to all commers, serving the foremost first, till no man would have any more dealing with them. And by G<HI>—I</HI> will have their skin-coat shaken once yet before they die; by this meanes, to one I gave a hundred florins, to another six score, to another three hundred, according to that they were infamous, detest∣able and abominable; for by how much the more horrible and execrable they were, so much the more must I needs have giventhem, otherwayes the devil would not have jum'd them. Presently I went to some great and fat wood-porters, or such like, and did my self make the match, but before I did shew him the old Hags, <HI>I</HI> made a faire muster to him of the Crownes, saying, Good fellow, see what <HI>I</HI> will give thee, if thou wilt but con∣descend to dufle, dinfredaille, or lecher it one good time: then began the poor rogues to
<PB N="123" REF="198"/>
gape like old mules, and I caused to be pro∣vided for them a banquet, with drink of the best, and store of spiceries, to put the old wo∣men in rut and heat of lust. To be short, they occupied all like good soules, only to those that were horribly ugly and ill-favoured, I caused their head to be put within a bag, to hide their face.</P>
<P>Besides all this, I have lost a great deal in suits of law: And what law-suits couldest thou have? (said I) thou hast neither house norlands. My friend, (said he) the Gentlewomen of this City had found out, by the instigation of the devil of hell, a manner of high-mount∣ed bands, and neckerchiefs for women, which did so closely cover their bosomes, that men could no more put their hands under; for they had put the slit behinde, and those neck-cloths were wholly shut before, where∣at the poor sad contemplative lovers were much discontented. Upon a faire <HI>Tuesday,</HI> I presented a Petition to the Court, making my self a Party against the said Gentlewo∣men, and shewing the great interest that I pretended therein, protesting that by the same reason, <HI>I</HI> would cause the Codpeece of my breeches to be sowed behinde, if the Co ur would not take order for it. In summe, the Gentlewomen put in their defences, shewed the grounds they went upon, and constituted their Atturney for the prosecuting of the
<PB N="124" REF="199"/>
cause, but <HI>I</HI> pursued them so vigorously, that by a sentence of the Court it was decreed, those high neckclothes should be no longer worne, if they were not a little cleft and open before, but it cost me a good summe of mo∣ney. <HI>I</HI> had another very filthy and beastly processe against the dung-farmer (called Ma∣ster <HI>Fifi)</HI> and his Deputies, that they should no more reade privily the pipe, punchon, nor quart of sentences, but in faire full day, and that in the fodder schools, in face of the <HI>Ar∣rian</HI> Sophisters, where <HI>I</HI> was ordained to pay the charges, by reason of some clause mis∣taken in the relation of the Serjeant. Ano∣ther time <HI>I</HI> framed a complaint to the Court, against the mules of the Presidents, Coun∣sellors and others, tending to this purpose, that when in the lower Court of the Pa∣lace, they left them to champ on their bridles: some bibs were made for them, that with their drivelling they might not spoile the pavement, to the end, that the Pages of the Palace might play upon it with their dice, or at the game of coxbody, at their own ease, without spoiling their breeches at the knees; and for this <HI>I</HI> had a faire decree, but it cost me deare. Now reckon up what expence <HI>I</HI> was at in little banquets, which from day to day <HI>I</HI> made to the Pages of the Palace, and to what end, said <HI>I?</HI> My friend (said he) thou hast no
<PB N="125" REF="199"/>
passe-time at all in this world, <HI>I</HI> have more then the King, and if thou wilt joyne thy selfe with me, we will do the devil toge∣ther. No, no, (said <HI>I)</HI> by St. <HI>Adauras</HI> that will <HI>I</HI> not, for thou wilt be hanged one time or another: And thou (said he) wilt be interred somtime or other; now which is most honourable, the aire or the earth? Ho, grosse pecore, whilest the Pages are at their banqueting, <HI>I</HI> keep their mules, and to some one <HI>I</HI> cut the stirrup-leather of the mounting side, till it hang but by a thin strap or thread, that when the great puffe-guts of the Counsellor or some other hath taken his swing to get up, he may fall flat on his side like a pork, and so furnish the Spectators with more then a hundred francks worth of laughter. But <HI>I</HI> laugh yet further, to think how at his home-coming the Master-page is to be whipt like green rie, which makes me not to repent what I have bestowed in feasting them. In brief, he had (as <HI>I</HI> said before) threescore and three wayes to acquire mony, but he had two hundred and fourteen to spend it, besides his drinking.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. <HI>How a great Scholar of</HI> England <HI>would have argued against</HI> Pantagruel, <HI>and was o∣vercome by</HI> Panurge.</HEAD>
<P>IN that same time, a certain learned man, named <HI>Thaumast,</HI> hearing the fame and re∣nown of <HI>Pantagruels</HI> incomparable know∣ledge, came out of his own countrey of <HI>England,</HI> with an intent only to see him, to try thereby, and prove, whether his know∣ledge in effect was so great as it was reported to be. In this resolution, being arrived at <HI>Paris,</HI> he went forthwith unto the house of the said <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> who was lodged in the Palace of St. <HI>Denys,</HI> and was then walking in the garden thereof with <HI>Panurge,</HI> philosophi∣zing after the fashion of the Peripateticks. At his first entrance he startled, and was al∣most out of his wits for feare, seeing him so great, and so tall, then did he salute him cour∣teously as the manner is, and said unto him, Very true it is, (saith <HI>Plato</HI> the Prince of Phi∣losophers,) that if the image and knowledge of wisdom were corporeal and visible to the eyes of mortals, it would stirre up all the world to admire her: which we may the ra∣ther
<PB N="127" REF="200"/>
beleeve, that the very bare report there∣of, scattered in the air, if it happen to be recei∣ved in to the eares of men, who for being stu∣dious, and lovers of vertuous things, are cal∣led Philosophers, doth not suffer them to sleep nor rest in quiet, but so pricketh them up, and sets them on fire, to run unto the place where the person is, in whom the said knowledge is said to have built her Temple, and uttered her Oracles, as it was manifestly shewen unto us in the Queen of <HI>Sheba,</HI> who came stom the utmost borders of the East and Persian sea, to see the order of <HI>Solomons</HI> house, and to heare his wisdom; in <HI>Anachar∣sis,</HI> who came out of <HI>Scythia,</HI> even unto <HI>A∣thens,</HI> to see <HI>Solon;</HI> in <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> who tra∣velled farre to visit the <HI>Memphitical</HI> Vatici∣nators; in <HI>Platon,</HI> who went a great way off to see the <HI>Magicians</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Archit as</HI> of <HI>Tarentum;</HI> in <HI>Apollonius Tianeus,</HI> who went as farre as unto Mount <HI>Caucasus,</HI> passed along the <HI>Scythians,</HI> the <HI>Massagetes,</HI> the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> and sailed over the great river <HI>Phison,</HI> even to the <HI>Brachmans</HI> to see <HI>Hiarchas;</HI> as likewise unto <HI>Babybon, Chaldea, Media, As∣syria, Barthia, Syria, Phoenicia, Arabia, Pale∣stina</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> even unto <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> to see the <HI>Gymnosoph sts:</HI> the like example have we of <HI>Titus Livius,</HI> whom to see and heare, divers studious persons came to <HI>Rome,</HI> from the Consines of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spaine; I</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="201"/>
dare not reckon my self in the number of those so excellent persons, but well would be called studious, and a lover, not only of learning, but of learned men also: and in∣deed, having heard the report of your so in∣estimable knowledge, <HI>I</HI> have left my coun∣trey, my friends, my kindred and my house, and am come thus farre, valuing at nothing the length of the way, the tediousnesse of the sea, nor strangenesse of the land, and that only to see you, and to conferre with you about some passages in Philosophy, of <HI>Geo∣mancie,</HI> and of the Cabalistick Art; whereof <HI>I</HI> am doubtful, and cannot satisfie my minde, which if you can resolve, <HI>I</HI> yield my self un∣to you for a slave henceforward, together with all my posterity; for other gift have <HI>I</HI> none, that I can esteem a recompence suffi∣cient for so great a favour: I will reduce them into writing, and to morrow publish them to all the learned men in the City, that we may dispute publickly before them.</P>
<P>But see in what manner, I mean that we shall dispute: I will not argue <HI>pro &amp; contra,</HI> as do the sottish <HI>Sophisters</HI> of this town, and other places; likewise I will not dispute after the manner of the <HI>Academicks</HI> by declamati∣on: nor yet by numbers, as <HI>Pythagoras</HI> was wont to do, and as <HI>Picus de la mirandula</HI> did of late at <HI>Rome:</HI> but <HI>I</HI> will dispute by signes only without speaking, for the matters are so
<PB N="129" REF="201"/>
abstruse, hard and arduous, that words pro∣ceeding from the mouth of man, will never be sufficient for unfolding of them to my li∣king. May it therefore please your Magnifi∣cence to be there, it shall be at the great Hall of <HI>Navarre</HI> at seven a clock in the morning. When he had spoke these words, <HI>Pantagruel</HI> very honourably said unto him, Sir, of the graces that God hath bestowed upon me, <HI>I</HI> would not deny to communicate unto any man to my power; for whatever comes from him is good, and his pleasure is, that it should be increased, when we come amongst men worthy and fit to receive this celestial Manna of honest literature: in which number, be∣cause that in this time (as <HI>I</HI> do already very plainly perceive,) thou holdest the first rank, <HI>I</HI> give thee notice that at all houres thou shalt finde me ready to condescend to every one of thy requests, according to my poor abili∣ty: although <HI>I</HI> ought rather to learn of thee, then thou of me, but as thou hast protested, we will conferre of these doubts together, and will seek out the resolution, even unto the bottom of that undrainable Well, where <HI>He∣raclitus</HI> sayes the truth lies hidden: and <HI>I</HI> do highly commend the manner of arguing which thou hast proposed, to wit, by signes with∣out speaking; for by this means thou and <HI>I</HI> shall understand one another well enough, and yet shall be free from this clapping of
<PB N="130" REF="202"/>
hands, which these blockish Sophisters make, when any of the Arguers hath gotten the better of the Argument: Now to morrow <HI>I</HI> will not faile to meet thee at the place and houre that thou hast appointed, but let me intreat thee that there be not any strife or up∣roare between us, and that we seek not the honour and applause of men, but the truth only: to which <HI>Thaumast</HI> answered, The Lord God maintain you in his favour and grace, and instead of my thankfulnesse to you, poure down his blessings upon you, for that your Highnesse and magnificent greatnesse, hath not disdained to descend to the grant of the request of my poor basenesse, so farewel till to morrow? Farewel, said <HI>Pantagruel.</HI> Gentle∣men, you that read this present discourse, think not that ever men were more elevated and transported in their thoughts, then all this night were both <HI>Thaumast</HI> and <HI>Pantagruel;</HI> for the said <HI>Thaumast,</HI> said to the Keeper of the house of <HI>Cluny,</HI> where he was lodged, that in all his life he had never known himself so dry, as he was that night. <HI>I</HI> think (said he) that <HI>Pantagruel</HI> held me by the throat; Give order, <HI>I</HI> pray you, that we may have some drink, and see that some fresh water be brought to us, to gargle my palat: on the other side <HI>Pantagruel</HI> stretched his wits as high as he could, entring into very deep and seri∣ous meditations, and did nothing all that

<P>My Lord, leave all these thoughts and go to bed; for <HI>I</HI> perceive your spirits to be so troubled by a too intensive bending of them, that you may easily fall into some Quotidian Fever, with this so excessive thinking and plodding: but having first drunk five and twenty or thirty good draughts, retire your self and sleep your fill: for in the morning I will argue against, and answer my Master the <HI>Englishman;</HI> and if I drive him not <HI>ad metam non loqui,</HI> then call me Knave: Yea, but (said he) my friend <HI>Panurge,</HI> he is mar∣vellously learned, how wilt thou be able to answer him? Very well, (answered <HI>Panurge)</HI> I pray you talk no more of it, but let me a∣lone; is any man so learned as the devils are? No, indeed (said <HI>Pantagruel,)</HI> without Gods especial grace: Yet for all rhat (said <HI>Panurge)</HI> I have argued against them, gravel∣led and blanked them in disputation, and laid rhem so squat upon their tailes, that I have
<PB N="132" REF="203"/>
made them look like Monkies; therefore be assured, that to morrow I will make this vain-glorious <HI>Englishman</HI> to skite vineger be∣fore all the world. So <HI>Panurge</HI> spent the night with tipling amongst the Pages, and played away all the points of his breeches at <HI>primus secundus,</HI> and at peck point (in <HI>French</HI> called <HI>Lavergette.)</HI> Yet when the condescended on time was come, he failed not to conduct his Master <HI>Pantagruel</HI> to the appointed place, un∣to which (beleeve me) there was neither great nor small in <HI>Paris</HI> but came; thinking with themselves that this devillish <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> who had overthrown and vanquished in dispute all these doting fresh-water Sophisters, would now get full payment and be tick∣led to some purpose; for this <HI>Englishman</HI> is a terrible bustler, and horrible coyle-keeper, we will see who will be Conquerour, for he never met with his match before.</P>
<P>Thus all being assembled, <HI>Thaumast</HI> stayed for them, and then when <HI>Pantagruel</HI> and <HI>Pa∣nurge</HI> came into the Hall, all the School-boyes, Professors of Arts, Senior-Sophisters and Batchelors began to clap their hands, as their scurvie custome is. But <HI>Pantagruel</HI> cri∣ed out with a loud voice, as if it had been the sound of a double canon, saying, Peace. with a devil to you, peace: by G—you rogues, if you trouble me here, I will cut off the heads of every one of you: at which words
<PB N="133" REF="203"/>
they remained all daunted and astonished, like so many ducks, and durst not do so much as cough, although they had swallowed fif∣teen pounds of feathers: withal they grew so dry with this only voice, that they laid out their tongues a full half foot beyond their mouthes, as if <HI>Pantagruel</HI> had salted all their throats. Then began <HI>Panurge</HI> to speak, saying to the <HI>Englishman,</HI> Sir, are you come hither to dispute contentiously in those Pro∣positions you have set down, or otherwayes but to learn and know the truth? To which answered <HI>Thaumast,</HI> Sir, no other thing brought me hither, but the great desire I had to learn, and to know that of which <HI>I</HI> have doubted all my life long, and have neither found book nor man able to content me in the resolution of those doubts which I have proposed: and as for disputing contentiously, I will not do it, for it is too base a thing, and therefore leave it to those sottish <HI>Sophisters,</HI> who in their disputes do not search for the truth, but for contradiction only and debate. Then said <HI>Panurge,</HI> if I who am but a mean and inconsiderable disciple of my Master my Lord <HI>Pantagruel;</HI> content and satisfie you in all and every thing, it were a thing below my said Master, wherewith to trouble him: there∣fore is it fitter that he be Chair-man, and sit as a Judge and Moderator of our discourse and purpose, and give you satisfaction in ma∣ny
<PB N="134" REF="204"/>
things, wherein perhaps <HI>I</HI> shall be want∣ing to your expectation. Truly (said <HI>Thau∣mast)</HI> it is very well said: begin then. Now you must note that <HI>Panurge</HI> had set at the end of his long Codpiece, a pretty tuft of red silk, as also of white, green and blew, and within it had put a faire orange.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. <HI>How</HI> Panurge <HI>put to a</HI> non-plus <HI>the</HI> English∣man, <HI>that argued by signes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>EVery body then taking heed, and heark∣ening with great silence, the <HI>Englishman</HI> lift up on high into the aire his two hands se∣verally, clunching in all the tops of his fin∣gers, together after the manner which <HI>(alachi∣nonnese)</HI> they call the hens arse, and struck the one hand on the other by the nailes foure se∣veral times: then he opening them, struck the one with the flat of the other, till it yielded a clashing noise, and that only once: again in joyning them as before he struck twice, and afterwards foure times in opening them; then did he lay them joyned, and ex∣tended the one towards the other, as if he had been devoutly to send up his prayers un∣to God. <HI>Panarge</HI> suddenly lifted up in the
<PB N="135" REF="204"/>
aire his right hand, and put the thumb there∣of into the nostril of the same side, holding his foure fingers streight out, and closed or∣derly in a parallel line to the point of his nose, shutting the left eye wholly, and making the other wink with a profound depression of the eye-brows and eye-lids. Then lifted he up his left hand, with hard wringing and stretch∣ing forth his foure fingers, and elevating his thumb, which he held in a line directly correspondent to the situation of his right hand, with the distance of a cubit and a halfe between them. This done, in the same forme he abased towards the ground, both the one and the other hand; Lastly, he held them in the midst, as aiming right at the <HI>English</HI> mans nose: And if <HI>Mercurie,</HI> said the <HI>English</HI> man: there <HI>Panurge</HI> interrupted him, and said, You have spoken <HI>Mask.</HI></P>
<P>Then made the <HI>English</HI> man this signe, his left hand all open he lifted up into the aire, then instantly shut into his fist the foure fin∣gers thereof, and his thumb extended at length he placed upon the gristle of his nose: Presently after, he lifted up his right hand all open, and all open abased and bent it down∣wards, putting the thumb thereof in the ve∣ry place where the little finger of the left hand did close in the fist, and the foure right hand fingers he softly moved in the aire: then contrarily he did with the right hand what he
<PB N="136" REF="205"/>
had done with the left, and with the left what he had done with the right.</P>
<P><HI>Panurge</HI> being not a whit amazed at this, drew out into the aire his <HI>Trismegist</HI> Codpiece with the left hand, and with his right drew forth a trunchion of a white oxe-rib, and two pieces of wood of a like forme, one of black eben, and the other of incarnation brasil, and put them betwixt the fingers of that hand in good symmetrie: then knocking them toge∣ther, made such a noise as the Lepers of <HI>Bri∣tanie</HI> use to do with their clappering click∣ets, yet better resounding, and farre more harmonious; and with his tongue contracted in his mouth, did very merrily warble it, al∣wayes looking fixedly upon the <HI>English</HI> man. The Divines, Physicians and Chirurgions that were there, thought that by this signe he would have inferred that the <HI>English</HI> man was a Leper: the Counsellors, Lawyers and Decretalists conceived, that by doing this he would have concluded some kinde of mor∣tal felicity to consist in Leprosie, as the Lord maintained heretofore,</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> man for all this was nothing daunted, but holding up his two hands in the aire, kept them in such forme, that he closed the three master-fingers in his fist, and pas∣sing his thumbs thorough his indical, or fore∣most and middle fingers, his auricularie or little fingers remained extended and stretch∣ed
<PB N="137" REF="205"/>
out, and so presented he them to <HI>Panurge;</HI> then joyned he them so, that the right thumb touched the left, and the left little finger touched the right. Hereat <HI>Panurge,</HI> without speaking one word, lift up his hands and made this signe.</P>
<P>He put the naile of the forefinger of his left hand, to the naile of the thumb of the same, making in the middle of the distance as it were a buckle, and of his right hand shut up all the fingers into his fist, except the forefinger which he often thrust in and out through the said two others of the left hand: then stretched he out the forefinger, and middle finger or medical of his right hand, holding them asunder as much as he could, and thrusting them towards <HI>Thaumast.</HI> Then did he put the thumb of his left hand upon the corner of his left eye, stretching out all his hand like the wing of a bird, or the finne of a fish, and moving it very daintily this way and that way, he did as much with his right hand upon the corner of his right eye. <HI>Thau∣mast</HI> began then to waxe somewhat pale, and to tremble, and made him this signe.</P>
<P>With the middle finger of his right hand, he struck against the muscle of the palme or pulp, which is under the thumb: then put he the forefinger of the right hand in the like buckle of the left, but he put it under and not over, as <HI>Panurge</HI> did. Then <HI>Panurge</HI> knock∣ed
<PB N="138" REF="206"/>
one hand against another, and blowed in his palme and put again the forefinger of his right hand into the overture or mouth of the left, pulling it often in and out; then held he out his chinne, most intentively looking up∣on <HI>Thaumast.</HI> The people there which under∣stood nothing in the other signes, knew ve∣ry well what therein he demanded (without speaking a word to <HI>Thaumast,)</HI> What do you mean by that? In effect, <HI>Thaumast</HI> then be∣gan to sweat great drops, and seemed to all the Spectators a man strangely ravished in high contemplation. Then he bethought himself, and put all the nailes of his left hand against those of his right, opening his fin∣gers as if they had been semicircles, and with this signe lift up his hands as high as he could. Whereupon <HI>Panurge</HI> presently put the thumb of his right hand under his jawes, and the little finger thereof in the mouth of the left hand, and in this posture made his teeth to sound very melodiously, the upper against the lower. With this <HI>Thaumast</HI> with great toile and vexation of spirit rose up, but in rising let a great bakers fart, for the bran came after, and pissing withal very strong vi∣neger, stunk like all the devils in hell: the company began to stop their noses; for he had conskited himself with meer anguish and perplexity. Then lifted he up his right hand, clunching it in such sort, that he brought the
<PB N="139" REF="206"/>
ends of all his fingers to meet together, and his left hand he laid flat upon his breast: whereat <HI>Panurge</HI> drew out his long Codpiece with his tuffe, and stretched it forth a cubit and a half, holding it in the aire with his right hand, and with his left took out his orange, and casting it up into the aire seven times, at the eight he hid it in the fist of his right hand, holding it steadily up on high, and then be∣gan to shake his faire Codpiece, shewing it to <HI>Thaumast.</HI></P>
<P>After that <HI>Thaumast</HI> began to puffe up his two cheeks like a player on a bagpipe, and blew as if he had been to puffe np a pigs blad∣der; whereupon <HI>Panurge</HI> put one finger of his left hand in his nockandrow, by some cal∣led St. <HI>Patricks</HI> hole, and with his mouth suck't in the aire, in such a manner as when one eats oysters in the shell, or when we sup up our broth; this done, he opened his mouth somewhat, and struck his right hand flat upon it, making therewith a great and a deep sound, as if it came from the superficies of the midriffe through the <HI>trachiartere</HI> or pipe of the lungs, and this he did for sixteen times; but <HI>Thaumast</HI> did alwayes keep blow∣ing like a goose. Then <HI>Panurge</HI> put the fore∣finger of his right hand into his mouth, pres∣sing it very hard to the muscles thereof; then he drew it out, aud withal made a great noise, as when little boyes shoot pellets out
<PB N="140" REF="207"/>
of the pot-canons made of the hollow sticks of the branch of an aulder-tree, and he did it nine times.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Thaumast</HI> cried out, Ha, my Ma∣sters, a great secret; with this he put in his hand up to the elbow; then drew out a dag∣ger that he had, holding it by the point down∣wards; whereat <HI>Panurge</HI> took his long Cod∣piece, and shook it as hard as he could against his thighes; then put his two hands intwined in manner of a combe upon his head, laying out his tongue as farre as he was able; and turning his eyes in his head, like a goat that is ready to die. Ha, I understand (said <HI>Thau∣mast)</HI> but what? making such a signe, that he put the haft of his dagger against his breast, and upon the point thereof the flat of his hand, turning in a little the ends of his fin∣gers; whereat <HI>Panurge</HI> held down his head on the left side, and put his middle fin∣ger into his right eare, holding up his thumb bolt upright; then he crost his two armes upon his breast, and coughed five times, and at the fifth time he struck his right foot a∣gainst the ground: then he lift up his left arme, and closing all his fingers into his fist, held his thumbe against his forehead, striking with his right hand six times against his breast. But <HI>Thaumast,</HI> as not content therewith, put the thumb of his left hand upon the top of his nose, shutting the rest of his said hand:
<PB N="141" REF="207"/>
whereupon <HI>Panurge</HI> set his two Master-fin∣gers upon each side of his mouth, drawing it as much as he was able, and widening it so, that he shewed all his teeth: and with his two thumbs pluck't down his two eye-lids very low, making therewith a very ill-favour'd countenance, as it seemed to the com∣pany.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. <HI>How</HI> Thaumast <HI>relateth the vertues, and know∣ledge of</HI> Panurge.</HEAD>
<P>THen <HI>Thaumast</HI> rose up, and putting off his cap, did very kindly thank the said <HI>Panurge,</HI> and with a loud voice said unto all the people that were there, My Lords, Gentlemen and others, at this time may I to some good purpose speak that Evangelical word, <HI>Et ecce plus quàm Salomon hîc:</HI> You have here in your presence an incomparable trea∣sure, that is, my Lord <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> whose great renown hath brought me hither, out of the very heart of <HI>England,</HI> to conferre with him about the insoluble problemes, both in <HI>Magick, Alchymie,</HI> the <HI>Caballe, Geomancie, Astrologie</HI> and <HI>Philosophie,</HI> which I had in my minde: but at present I am angry, even with
<PB N="142" REF="208"/>
fame it self, which I think was envious to him, for that it did not declare the thou∣sandth part of the worth that indeed is in him: You have seen how his disciple only hath satisfied me, and hath told me more then <HI>I</HI> asked of him: besides, he hath opened unto me, and resolved other inestimable doubts, wherein I can assure you he hath to me discovered the very true Well, Fountain and Abysse of the <HI>Encyclopedeia</HI> of learning; yea in such a sort, that I did not think I should ever have found a man that could have made his skill appear, in so much as the first elements of that concerning which we disputed by signes, without speaking either word or half word. But in fine, I will reduce into writing that which we have said and con∣cluded, that the world may not take them to be fooleries, and will thereafter cause them to be printed, that every one may learne as I have done. Judge then what the Master had been able to say, seeing the disciple hath done so valiantly; for, <HI>Non est discipulus su∣per Magistrum.</HI> Howsoever God be praised, and <HI>I</HI> do very humbly thank you, for the ho∣nour that you have done us at this Act: God reward you for it eternally: the like thanks gave <HI>Pantagruel</HI> to all the company, and go∣ing from thence, he carried <HI>Thaumast</HI> to din∣ner with him, and beleeve that they drank as much as their skins could hold, or, as the
<PB N="143" REF="208"/>
phrase is, with unbottoned bellies, (for in that age they made fast their bellies with buttons, as we do now the colars of our doublets or jerkins) even till they neither knew where they were, nor whence they came. Blessed Lady, how they did ca∣rouse it, and pluck (as we say) at the Kids leather: and flaggons to trot, and they to toote, Draw, give (page) some wine here reach hither, fill with a devil, so? There was not one but did drink five and twenty or thirty pipes, can you tell how? even <HI>Sicut terra sine aqua;</HI> for the weather was hot, and besides, that they were very dry. In matter of the exposition of the Propositi∣ons set down by <HI>Thaumast:</HI> and the signisi∣cation of the signes which they used in their disputation, <HI>I</HI> would have set them down for you according to their own relation: but I have been told that <HI>Thaumast</HI> made a great book of it imprinted at <HI>London,</HI> where∣in he hath set down all without omitting any thing, and therefore at this time I do passe by it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. <HI>How</HI> Panutge <HI>was in love with a Lady of</HI> Paris.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PAnurge</HI> began to be in great reputation in the City of <HI>Paris,</HI> by means of this dis∣putation, wherein he pre vailed against the <HI>English</HI> man, and from thenceforth made his Codpiece to be very useful to him, to which effect he had it pinked with pretty little Em∣broideries after the <HI>Romanesca</HI> fashion; And the world did praise him publickly, in so farre that there was a song made of him, which little children did use to sing, when they went to fetch mustard: he was withal made wel∣come in all companies of Ladies and Gentle∣women, so that at last he became presumptu∣ous, and went about to bring to his lure one of the greatest Ladies in the City: and in∣deed leaving a rabble of long prologues and protestations, which ordinarily these dolent contemplative Lent-lovers make, who ne∣ver meddle with the flesh; one day he said un∣to her, <HI>Madam;</HI> it would be a very great be∣nefit to the Common-wealth, delightful to you, honourable to your progeny, and ne∣cessary for me, that I cover you for the pro∣pagating
<PB N="145" REF="209"/>
of my race, and beleeve it, for ex∣perience will teach it you: the Lady at this word thrust him back above a hundred leagues, saying, You mischievous foole, is it for you to talk thus unto me? whom do you think you have in hand? be gone, ne∣ver to come in my sight again; for if one thing were not, I would have your legs and armes cut off. Well, (said he) that were all one to me, to want both legs and armes, pro∣vided you and <HI>I</HI> had but one merry bout to∣gether, at the brangle buttock-game; for here within is (in shewing her his long Cod∣piece) Master <HI>John Thursday,</HI> who will play you such an <HI>Antick,</HI> that you shall feel the sweetnesse thereof even to the very mar∣row of your bones: He is a gallant, and doth so well know how to finde out all the corners, creeks and ingrained inmates in your carnal trap, that after him there needs no broom, he'l sweep so well before, and leave nothing to his followers to work upon: whereunto the Lady answered, Go, villain, go, if you speak to me one such word more, <HI>I</HI> will cry out, and make you to be knocked down with blowes. Ha, (said he) you are not so bad as you say, no, or else <HI>I</HI> am de∣ceived in your physiognomie, for sooner shall the earth mount up unto the Heavens, and the highest Heavens descend unto the Hells, and all the course of nature be quite
<PB N="146" REF="210"/>
perverted, then that in so great beauty and neatnesse as in you is, there should be one drop of gall or malice: they say indeed, that hardly shall a man ever see a faire woman that is not also stubborn: yet that is spoke only of those vulgar beauties, but yours is so ex∣cellent, so singular, and so heavenly, that I beleeve nature hath given it you as a para∣gon, and master-piece of her Art, to make us know what she can do, when she will imploy all her skill, and all her power. There is no∣thing in you but honey, but sugar, but a sweet and celestial Manna: to you it was, to whom <HI>Paris</HI> ought to have adjudged the golden Apple, not to <HI>Venus,</HI> no, nor to <HI>Ju∣no,</HI> nor to <HI>Minerva;</HI> for never was there so much magnificence in <HI>Juno,</HI> so much wis∣dom in <HI>Minerva,</HI> nor so much comelinesse in <HI>Venus,</HI> as there is in you. O heavenly <HI>gods</HI> and <HI>goddesses!</HI> how happy shall that man be to whom you will grant the favour to embrace her, to kisse her, and to rub his bacon with hers? by G—that shall be I, I know it well; for she loves me already her belly full, I am sure of it, and so was I predestinated to it by the <HI>Fairies:</HI> and therefore that we lose no time, put on, thrust out your gamons, and would have embraced her, but she made as if she would put out her head at the window, to call her neighbours for help. Then <HI>Panurge</HI> on a sudden ran out, and in his running away,
<PB N="147" REF="210"/>
said, <HI>Madam,</HI> stay here till I come again, I will go call them my self, do not you take so much paines: thus went he away not much caring for the repulse he had got, nor made he any whit the worse cheer for it. The next day he came to the Church, at the time that she went to Masse, at the door he gave her some▪ of the holy water, bowing himself ve∣ry low before her, afterwards he kneeled down by her very familiarly, and said unto her, <HI>Madam,</HI> know that I am so amorous of you, that I can neither pisse nor dung for love: <HI>I</HI> do not know <HI>(Lady,)</HI> what you mean, but if <HI>I</HI> should take any hurt by it, how much would you be too blame? Go, said she, go, <HI>I</HI> do not care, let me alone to say my prayers. <HI>I</HI> but (said he) equivocate upon this; <HI>a Beau∣mon le viconte,</HI> or to faire mount the pric∣cunts: <HI>I</HI> cannot, said she: It is, said he, <HI>a beau con le vit monte,</HI> or to a faire C... the pr... mounts: and upon this pray to God to give you that which your noble heart desireth, and <HI>I</HI> pray you give me these patenotres. Take them (said she) &amp; trouble me no longer: this done, she would have taken off her pate∣notres, which were made of a kinde of yel∣low stone called <HI>Cestrin,</HI> and adorned with great spots of gold, but <HI>Panurge</HI> nimbly drew out one of his knives, wherewith he cut them off very handsomly, and whilest he was going away to carry them to the Brokers, he
<PB N="148" REF="211"/>
said to her, Will you have my knife? No, no, said she: But (said he) to thepurpose, <HI>I</HI> am at your commandment, body and goods, tripes and bowels.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Lady was not very well content with the want of her patinotres; for they were one of her implements to keep her countenance by in the Church: then thought with her self, this bold flowting Roy∣ster, is some giddy, fantastical, light-headed foole of a strange countrey; <HI>I</HI> shall never re∣cover my patenotres again, what will my husband say, he will no doubt be angry with me; but I will tell him that a thief hath cut them off from my hands in the Church, which he will easily beleeve, seeing the end of the riban left at my girdle. After dinner <HI>Pa∣nurge</HI> went to see her carrying in his sleeve a great purse full of Palace-crowns called counters, and began to say unto her, Which of us two loveth other best, you me, or I you? whereunto she answered, As for me, I do not hate you; for as God commands, I love all the world: But to the purpose, (said he) are not you in love with me? I have (said she) told you so many times already, that you should talk so no more to me, and if you speak of it again, I will teach you, that I am not one to be talked unto dishonestly: get you hence packing, and deliver me my pate∣notres, that my husband may not ask me for them.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="211"/>
How now, <HI>(Madam)</HI> said he, your pate∣notres? nay, by mine oath I will not do so, but I will give you others; had you rather have them of gold well enameled in great round knobs, or after the manner of love-knots, or otherwise all massive, like great <HI>in∣gots,</HI> or if you had rather have them of <HI>Ebene,</HI> of <HI>Jacinth,</HI> or of <HI>grained</HI> gold, with the marks of fine <HI>Turkoises,</HI> or of faire <HI>Topazes,</HI> marked with fine <HI>Saphirs,</HI> or of <HI>baleu Rubies,</HI> with great marks of <HI>Diamonds</HI> of eight and twenty squares? No, no, all this is too little; I know a faire bracelet of fine <HI>Emeraulds,</HI> marked with spotted <HI>Ambergris,</HI> and at the buckle a <HI>Persian pearle</HI> as big as an Orange: it will not cost above five and twenty thousand ducates, I will make you a present of it, for <HI>I</HI> have rea∣dy coine enough, and withal he made a noise with his counters as if they had been <HI>French</HI> Crownes.</P>
<P>Will you have a piece of velvet, either of the violet colour, or of crimson died in graine: or a piece of broached or crimson sattin? will you have chaines, gold, tablets, rings? You need no more but say, Yes, so farre as fifty thousand ducates may reach, it is but as nothing to me; by the vertue of which words he made the water come in her mouth: but she said unto him, No, I thank you, <HI>I</HI> will have nothing of you. By G—said he, but I will have somewhat of you; yet shall
<PB N="150" REF="212"/>
it be that which shall cost you nothing, nei∣ther shall you have a jot the lesse, when you have given it, hold, (shewing his long Cod∣piece) this is Master <HI>John Good fellow,</HI> that askes for lodging, and with that would have embraced her; but she began to cry out, yet not very loud. Then <HI>Panurge</HI> put off his counterfeit garb, changed his false visage, and said unto her, You will not then otherwayes let me do a little, a turd for you, you do not deserve so much good, nor so much honour: but by G—I will make the dogs ride you, and with this he ran away as fast as he could, for feare of blowes, whereof he was natural∣ly fearful.</P>

<P>And as she was opening this paper to see what it was, <HI>Panurge</HI> very promptly and lightly scattered the drug that he had, upon her in divers places, but especially in the plaits of her sleeves, and of her gowne: then said he unto her, Madam, the poor lovers are not alwayes at ease; as for me, <HI>I</HI> hope that those heavy nights, those paines and trou∣bles which <HI>I</HI> suffer for love of you, shall be a deduction to me of so much paine in Purgatory: yet at the least pray to God to give me patience in my misery. <HI>Panurge</HI> had no sooner spoke this, but all the dogs that were in the Church came running to this Lady with the smell of the drugs that he had strowed upon her, both small and great, big and little, all came, laying out their member; smelling to her, and pissing every where up∣on her, it was the greatest villainy in the world. <HI>Panurge</HI> made the fashion of dri∣ving them away: then took his leave of her, and withdrew himself into some Chappel or
<PB N="153" REF="213"/>
Oratory of the said Church, to see the sport; for these villainous dogs did compisse all her habiliaments, and left none of her attire un∣besprinkled with their staling, in so much that a tall grey-hound pist upon her head, others in her sleeves, others on her crupper-piece, and the little ones pissed upon her pa∣taines: so that all the women that were round about her had much ado to save her. Whereat <HI>Panurge</HI> very heartily laughing, he said to one of the Lords of the City, <HI>I</HI> beleeve that the same Lady is hot, or else that some grey-hound hath covered her lately. And when he saw that all the dogs were flocking about her, yarring at the retardment of their accesse to her, and every way keeping such a coyle with her, as they are wont to do about a proud or salt bitch, he forthwith departed from thence, and went to call <HI>Pantagruel:</HI> not forgetting in his way alongst all the streets, thorough which he went, where he found any dogs to give them a bang with his foot, saying, Will you not go with your fellowes to the wed∣ding? Away, hence, avant, avant, with a de∣vil avant: And being come home, he said to <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> Master, <HI>I</HI> pray you come and see all the dogs of the countrey, how they are as∣sembled about a Lady, the fairest in the City, and would dufle and line her; whereunto <HI>Pantagruel</HI> willingly condescended, and saw the mystery, which he found very pretty and
<PB N="154" REF="214"/>
strange: But the best was at the Procession, in which were seen above six hundred thou∣sand and fourteen dogs about her, which did very much trouble and molest her, and whithersoever she past, those dogs that came afresh, tracing her footsteps, followed her at the heeles, and pist in the way where her gown had touched. All the world stood ga∣zing at this spectacle, considering the coun∣tenance of those dogs, who leaping up got about her neck, and spoiled all her gorgeous accoutrements, for the which she could finde no remedy, but to retire unto her house, which was a Palace: Thither she went, and the dogs after her; she ran to hide her self, but the Chamber-maids could not abstaine from laughing. When she was entered into the house, and had shut the door upon her self, all the dogs came running, of halfe a league round, and did so well bepisse the gate of her house, that there they made a stream with their urine, wherein a duck might have very well swimmed, and it is the same current that now runs at St. <HI>Victor,</HI> in which <HI>Gobelin</HI> dieth scarlet, for the specifical vertue of these pisse-dogs, as our Master <HI>Doribus</HI> did heretofore preach publickly. So may God help you; a Mill would have ground corne with it; yet not so much as those of <HI>Basacle</HI> at <HI>Toulouse.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. <HI>How</HI> Pantagruel <HI>departed from</HI> Paris, <HI>hearing newes, that the</HI> Dipsodes <HI>had invaded the Land of the</HI> Amaurots: <HI>and the cause wherefore the leagues are so short in</HI> France.</HEAD>
<P>A Little while after <HI>Pantagruel</HI> heard newes that his father <HI>Gargantua</HI> had been translated into the land of the Fairies by <HI>Morgue,</HI> as heretofore were <HI>Oger</HI> and <HI>Arthur</HI> together, and that the report of his transla∣tion being spread abroad, the <HI>Dipsodes</HI> had is∣sued out beyond their borders, with inrodes had wasted a great part of <HI>Utopia,</HI> and at that very time had besieged the great City of the <HI>Amaurots;</HI> whereupon departing from <HI>Paris,</HI> without bidding any man farewel, for the businesse required diligence, he came to <HI>Rowen.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>Pantagruel</HI> in his journey, seeing that the leagues of that little territory about <HI>Pa∣ris</HI> called <HI>France,</HI> were very short in regard of those of other Countreys, demanded the cause and reason of it from <HI>Panurge,</HI> who told him a story which <HI>Marotus</HI> set down of the <HI>lac Monachus,</HI> in the acts of the Kings of <HI>Ca∣narre,</HI>
<PB N="156" REF="215"/>
saying, that in old times Countreys were not distinguished into leagues, miles, furlongs, nor parasanges, until that King <HI>Pharamond</HI> divided them, which was done in manner as followeth. The said King chose at <HI>Paris</HI> a hundred faire, gallant, lustie, briske young men, all resolute and bold adventu∣rers in <HI>Cupids</HI> duels, together with a hundred comely, pretty, handsome, lovely and well complexioned wenches of <HI>Picardie,</HI> all which he caused to be well entertained, and highly fed for the space of eight dayes; then having called for them, he delivered to every one of the young men his wench, with store of money to defray their charges, and this in∣junction besides, to go unto divers places here and there, and wheresoever they should biscot and thrum their wenches, that thy setting a stone there, it should be accounted for a league: thus went away those brave fel∣lows and sprightly blades most merrily, and because they were fresh, and had been at rest, they very oftenjum'd and fanfreluched almost at every sields end, and this is the cause why the leagues about <HI>Paris</HI> are so short; but when they had gone a great way, and were now as weary as poor devils, all the oile▪ in their lamps being almost spent, they did not chink and dufle so often, but content∣ed themselves, <HI>(I</HI> mean for the mens part,) with one scurvie paultry bout in a day, and
<PB N="157" REF="215"/>
this is that which makes the leagues in <HI>Bri∣tany, Delanes, Germany,</HI> and other more remote Countreys so long: other men give other reasons for it, but this seems to me of all other the best. To which <HI>Panta∣gruel</HI> willingly adhered. Parting from <HI>Rowen,</HI> they arrived at <HI>Honfleur,</HI> where they took shipping, <HI>Pantagruel, Panurge, Epistemon, Eust∣henes</HI> and <HI>Carpalim.</HI></P>
<P>In which place, waiting for a favourable winde, and caulking their ship, he received from a Lady of <HI>Paris</HI> (which <HI>I</HI> had former∣ly kept, and entertained a good long time,) a letter directed on the out-side thus, <HI>To the best beloved of the faire women, and least loyal of the valiant men,</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. <HI>A Letter which a messenger brought to</HI> Pan∣tagruel <HI>from a Lady of</HI> Paris, <HI>together with the exposition of a Posie, writ∣ten in a gold Ring.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHen <HI>Pantagruel</HI> had read the super∣scription, he was much amazed, and therefore demanded of the said messenger
<PB N="158" REF="216"/>
the name of her that had sent it: then open∣ed he the letter, and found nothing written in it, nor otherwayes inclosed, but only a gold ring, with a square table-diamond. Wondering at this, he called <HI>Panurge</HI> to him, and shewed him the case; whereupon <HI>Panurge</HI> told him, thar the leafe of paper was written upon, but with such cunning and ar∣tifice▪ that no man could see the writing at the first sight, therefore to finde it out he set it by the fire, to see if it was made with <HI>Sal Armoniack</HI> soaked in water; then put he it into the water, to see if the letter was written with the juice of <HI>Tithymalle:</HI> after that he held it up against the candle, to see if it was written with the juice of white onions.</P>
<P>Then he rubbed one part of it with oile of nuts, to see if it were not written with the lee of a fig-tree: and another part of it with the milk of a woman giving suck to her el∣dest daughter, to see if it was written with the blood of red toads, or green earth-frogs: Afterwards he rubbed one corner with the ashes of a Swallowes nest, to see if it were not written with the dew that is found within the herb <HI>Alcakengie,</HI> called the winter-cherry. He rubbed after that one end with eare-wax, to see if it were not written with the gall of a Raven: then did he dip it into vineger, to try if it was not written with the juice of the garden <HI>Spurge:</HI> After that he greased it with
<PB N="159" REF="216"/>
the fat of a bat or flittermouse, to see if it was not written with the sperm of a whale, which some call ambergris: Then put it ve∣ry fairly into a basin full of fresh water, and forthwith took it out, to see whether it were written with stone allum: But after all expe∣riments, when he perceived that he could finde out nothing, he called the messenger, and asked him, Good fellow, the Lady that sent thee hither, did she not give thee a staffe to bring with thee? thinking that it had been according to the conceit, whereof <HI>Aulus Gel∣lius</HI> maketh mention, and the Messenger an∣swered him, <HI>No, Sir.</HI> Then <HI>Panurge</HI> would have caused his head to be shaven, to see whe∣ther the Lady had written upon his bald pate, with the hard lie whereof sope is made, that which she meant; but perceiving that his hair was very long, he forbore, considering that it could not have grown to so great a length in so short a time.</P>
<P>Then he said to <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> Master, by the vertue of G—I cannot tell what to do nor say in it; for to know whether there be any thing written upon this or no; <HI>I</HI> have made use of a good part of that which Master <HI>Fran∣cisco di Nianto,</HI> the <HI>Tuscan</HI> sets down, who hath written the manner of reading letters that do not appear; that which <HI>Zoroastes</HI> published, <HI>peri grammaton acriton;</HI> and <HI>Cal∣phurnius Bassus de literis illegibilibus:</HI> but <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="160" REF="217"/>
can see nothing, nor do I beleeve that there is any thing else in it then the Ring: let us therefore look upon it, which when they had done, they found this in <HI>Hebrew</HI> written with∣in, <HI>Lamach sabathani;</HI> whereupon they called <HI>Epistemon,</HI> and asked him what that meant? to which he answered, that they were <HI>He∣brew</HI> words, signifying, <HI>Wherefore hast thou forsaken me?</HI> upon that <HI>Panurge</HI> suddenly re∣plied: <HI>I</HI> know the mystery, do you see this diamond? it is a false one; this then is the exposition of that which the Lady meanes, <HI>Diamant faux,</HI> that is, false lover, why hast thou forsaken me? which interpretation <HI>Pan∣tagruel</HI> presently understood, and withal re∣membering, that at his departure he had not bid the Lady farewel, he was very sorry, and would faine have returned to <HI>Paris,</HI> to make his peace with her; but <HI>Epistemon</HI> put him in minde of <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s departure from <HI>Dido,</HI> and the saying of <HI>Heraclitus</HI> of <HI>Tarentum,</HI> That the ship being at anchor when need re∣quireth, we must cut the cable rather then lose time about untying of it, and that he should lay aside all other thoughts to succour the City of his Nativity, which was then in dan∣ger; and indeed within an houre after that, the winde arose at the North-north-west, wherewith they hoised saile, and put out, even into the maine sea, so that within few dayes, passing by <HI>Porto Sancto,</HI> and by the <HI>Maderas,</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="217"/>
they went ashore in the <HI>Canarie</HI> islands; part∣ing from thence, they passed by <HI>Capobianco;</HI> by <HI>Senege,</HI> by <HI>Capoverde,</HI> by <HI>Gambre,</HI> by <HI>Sa∣gres,</HI> by <HI>Melli,</HI> by the <HI>Cap di buona Speranza,</HI> and set ashore againe in the Kingdom of <HI>Melinda;</HI> parting from thencc, they sailed a∣way with a tramoutan or northerly winde, passing by <HI>Meden,</HI> by <HI>Uti,</HI> by <HI>Uden,</HI> by <HI>Ge∣lasim,</HI> by the isles of the Fairies, and alongst the Kingdome of <HI>Achorie,</HI> till at last they arrived at the port of <HI>Utopia,</HI> distant from the City of the <HI>Amaurots</HI> three leagues and somewhat more.</P>
<P>When they were ashore; and pretty well refreshed, <HI>Panurge</HI> said, Gentlemen, the City is not farre from hence, therefore were it not amisse before we set forward, to advise well what is to be done, that we be not like the <HI>A∣thenians,</HI> who never took counsel until after the fact: Are you resolved to live and die with me? Yes, Sir, said they all, and be as confi∣dent of us, as of your own fingers. Well (said he) there is but one thing that keeps my minde in great doubt and suspense, which is this, that I know not in what order nor of what number the enemie is, that layeth siege to the City; for if <HI>I</HI> were certain of that, I should go forward, and set on with the bet∣ter assurance. Let us therefore consult toge∣ther, and be think our selves by what meanes we may come to this intelligence: where∣unto
<PB N="162" REF="218"/>
they all said, Let us go thither and see, and stay you here for us, for this very day, without further respite do we make account to bring you a certain report thereof.</P>
<P>My self (said <HI>Panurge)</HI> will undertake to enter into their camp, within the very midst of their guards, unespied by their watch, and merrily feast and lecher it at their cost, with∣out being known of any, to see the Artille∣ry and the Tents of all the Captaines, and thrust my self in with a grave and magni∣fick carriage, amongst all their troops and companies, without being discovered; the devill would not be able to peck me out with all his circumventions: for I am of the race of <HI>Zopyrus.</HI></P>
<P>And I (said <HI>Epistemon)</HI> know all the plots and stratagems of the valiant Captaines, and warlike Champions of former ages, together with all the tricks and subtilties of the Art of warre; I will go, and though I be detected and revealed, I will escape, by making them beleeve of you whatever <HI>I</HI> please, for I am of the race of <HI>Sinon.</HI></P>
<P>I (said <HI>Eusthenes)</HI> will enter and set upon them in their trenches, in spight of their Sentries, and all their guards; for <HI>I</HI> will tread upon their bellies, and break their legs and armes, yea though they were every whit as strong as the devil himself; for I am of the race of <HI>Heroules.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="218"/>
And I (said <HI>Carpalin)</HI> will get in there, if the birds can enter, for I am so nimble of body, and light withal, that I shall have leap∣ed over their trenches, and ran clean through all their camp, before that they perceive me; neither do I feare shot, nor arrow; nor horse, how swift soever, were he the <HI>Pega∣sus</HI> of <HI>Persee,</HI> or <HI>Pacolet;</HI> being assured that <HI>I</HI> shall be able to make a safe and sound escape before them all, without any hurt: <HI>I</HI> will undertake to walk upon the eares of corne, or grasse in the meddows, without making ei∣ther of them do so much as bow under me; for <HI>I</HI> am of the race of <HI>Camilla</HI> the <HI>Ama-Zone.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. <HI>How</HI> Panurge, Carpalin, Eusthenes <HI>and</HI> E∣pistemon <HI>(the Gentlemen Attendants of</HI> Pantagruel,) <HI>vanquished and discom∣fited six hundred and threescore horsemen very cunningly.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS he was speaking this, they perceived six hundred and threescore light horse∣men, gallantly mounted, who made an out-rode thither, to see what ship it was that was newly arrived in the harbour, and came in a
<PB N="164" REF="219"/>
full gallop to take them if they had been able: Then said <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> my Lads, re∣tire your selves unto the ship, here are some of our enemies coming apace, but I will kill them here before you like beasts, although they were ten times so many, in the meane time withdraw your selves, and take your sport at it. Then answered <HI>Panurge,</HI> No, Sir, there is no reason that you should do so, but on the contrary retire you unto the ship, both you and the rest; for I alone will here discomfit them, but we must not linger, come, set forward; whereunto the others said, It is well advised, Sir, withdraw your self, and we will help <HI>Panurge</HI> here, so shall you know what we are able to do: Then said <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> Well, I am content, but if that you be too weak, <HI>I</HI> will not faile to come to your assistance. With this <HI>Panurge</HI> took two great cables of the ship, and tied them to the kemstock or capstane which was on the deck towards the hatches, and fastened them in the ground, making a long circuit, the one further off, the other within that. Then said he to <HI>Epistemon,</HI> Go aboard the ship, and when <HI>I</HI> give you a call, turn about the capstane upon the orlop diligently, drawing unto you the two cable-ropes: and said to <HI>Eusthenes,</HI> and to <HI>Carpalin, My Bullies,</HI> stay you here, and offer your selves freely to your enemies, do as they bid you, and make as if you would
<PB N="165" REF="219"/>
yield unto them: but take heed you come not within the compasse of the ropes, be sure to keep your selves free of them; and presently he went aboard the ship, and took a bundle of straw, and a barrel of gun-pow∣der, strowed it round about the compasse of the cordes, and stood by with a brand of fire or match lighted in his hand. Presently came the horsemen with great fury, and the foremost ran almost home to the ship, and by reason of the slipperinesse of the bank, they fell they and their horses, to the num∣ber of foure and fourty, which the rest see∣ing, came on, thinking that resistance had been made them at theit arrival: But <HI>Pa∣nurge</HI> said unto them, My Masters, <HI>I</HI> be∣leeve that you have hurt your selves, <HI>I</HI> pray you pardon us, for it is not our fault, but the slipperinesse of the sea-water, that is alwayes flowing; we submit our selves to your good pleasure; so said likewise his two other fel∣lowes, and <HI>Epistemon</HI> that was upon the deck; in the mean time <HI>Panurge</HI> withdrew himselfe, and seeing that they were all within the com∣passe of the cables, and that his two compa∣nions were retired, making room for all those horses which came in a croud, thronging up∣on the neck of one another to see the ship, and such as were in it cried out on a sudden to <HI>Epistemon,</HI> Draw, draw: then began <HI>E∣pistemon</HI> to winde about the capstane, by do∣ing
<PB N="166" REF="220"/>
whereof the two cables so intangled and impestered the legs of the horses, that they were all of them thrown down to the ground easily, together with their Riders: but they seeing that, drew their swords, and would have cut them: whereupon <HI>Panurge</HI> set fire to the traine, and there burnt them up all like damned souls, both men and horses, not one escaping save one alone, who being mounted on a fleet <HI>Turkie</HI> courser, by meere speed in flight got himself out of the circle of the ropes; but when <HI>Carpalin</HI> perceived him, he ran after him with such nimblenesse and celerity, that he overtook him in lesse then a hundred paces; then leaping close behinde him upon the crupper of his horse, clasped him in his armes, and brought him back to the ship.</P>
<P>This exploit being ended <HI>Pantagruel</HI> was very jovial, and wondrously commended the industry of these Gentlemen, whom he called his fellow-souldiers, and made them re∣fresh themselves, and feed well and merrily upon the sea-shore, and drink heartily with their bellies upon the ground, and their pri∣soner with them, whom they admitted to that familiarity: only that the poor devil was somewhat afraid that <HI>Pantagruel</HI> would have eaten him up whole, which, considering the widenesse of his mouth, and capacity of his throat, was no great matter for him to
<PB N="167" REF="220"/>
have done; for he could have done it, as ea∣sily as you would eate a small comfit, he shewing no more in his throat, then would a graine of millet-seed in the mouth of an Asse.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI. <HI>How</HI> Pantagruel <HI>and his company were weary in eating still salt meats: and how</HI> Car∣palin <HI>went a hunting to have some Venison.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THus as they talked &amp; chatted together, <HI>Carpalin</HI> said, And by the belly of St. <HI>Quenet,</HI> shal we never eat any venison? this salt meat makes me horribly dry, <HI>I</HI> will go fetch you a quarter of one of those horses which we have burnt, it is well roasted already: as he was rising up to go about it, he perceived under the side of a wood a fair great roe-buck, which was come out of his Fort (as I conceive) at the sight of <HI>Panurge</HI>'s fire: him did he pur∣sue and run after with as much vigour and swiftnesse, as if it had been a bolt out of a Crossebowe, and caught him in a moment; and whilest he was in his course, he with his hands took in the aire foure great bustards, seven bitterns, six and twenty gray partridges,
<PB N="168" REF="221"/>
two and thirty red legged ones, sixteen phea∣sants, nine woodcocks, nineteen herons, two and thirty coushots and ring-doves; and with his feet killed ten or twelve hares and rab∣bets, which were then at relief and pretty big withal, eighteen rayles in a knot toge∣ther, with fifteen young wilde boares, two little Bevers, and three great foxes: so stri∣king the Kid with his fauchion athwart the head he killed him, and bearing him on his back, he in his return took up his hares, rayls, and young wilde boares and as far off as he could be heard, cried out, &amp; said, <HI>Panurge</HI> my friend, vineger, vineger: then the good <HI>Pan∣tagruel,</HI> thinking he had fainted, commanded them to provide him some vineger; but <HI>Pa∣nurge</HI> knew well that there was some good prey in hands, and forthwith shewed unto noble <HI>Pantagruel</HI> how he was bearing upon his back a faire roe-buck, and all his girdle bordered with hares; then immediately did <HI>Epistemon</HI> make in the name of the nine Mu∣ses, nine antick wooden spits: <HI>Eusthenes</HI> did help to flay, and <HI>Panurge</HI> placed two great cuirasier saddles, in such sort that they served for Andirons and making their prisoner to be their Cook, they roasted their venison by the fire, wherein the horsemen were burnt: and making great chear with a good deal of vineger, the devil a one of them did forbear from his victuals, it was a triumphant and
<PB N="169" REF="221"/>
incomparable spectacle to see how they ra∣vened and devoured. Then said <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> Would to God every one of you had two paires of little <HI>Anthem</HI> or <HI>Sacring</HI> bells hang∣ing at your chin, and that <HI>I</HI> had at mine the great clocks of <HI>Renes,</HI> of <HI>Poitiers,</HI> of <HI>Tours,</HI> and of <HI>Cambray,</HI> to see what a peale they would ring with the wagging of our chaps; But, said <HI>Panurge,</HI> it were better we thought a little up∣on our businesse, and by what meanes we might get the upper hand of our enemies: That is well remembered, said <HI>Pantagruel;</HI> therefore spoke he thus to the prisoner, My friend, tell us here the truth, and do not lie to us at all, if thou wouldest not be flayed a∣live, for it is <HI>I</HI> that eat the little children: re∣late unto us at full the order, the number and the strength of the Army: to which the pri∣soner answered, Sir, know for a truth that in the army there are three hundred giants, all armed with armour of proof, and wonderful great: neverthelesse, not fully so great as you, except one that is their head, named <HI>Loup-garou,</HI> who is armed from head to foot with <HI>Cyclopical</HI> annuils; furthermore, one hundred threescore and three thousand foot, all armed with the skins os hobgoblins, strong and valiant men: eleven thousand foure hun∣dred men at armes or cuirasiers: three thou∣sand six hundred double canons, and harque∣busiers without number; fourescore and
<PB N="170" REF="222"/>
fourteen thousand Pioneers: one hundred and fifty thousand whores, faire like goddes∣ses, (that is, for me said <HI>Panurge,)</HI> whereof some are <HI>Amazons,</HI> some <HI>Lionnoises,</HI> others <HI>Parisiennes, Taurangelles, Angevines, Poicte∣vines, Normandes,</HI> and high <HI>dutch,</HI> there are of them of all Countreys, and all Lan∣guages,</P>
<P>Yea, but (said <HI>Pantagruel)</HI> is the King there? Yes Sir, (said the prisoner) he is there in person, and we call him <HI>Anarchus,</HI> King of the <HI>Dipsodes,</HI> which is as much to say as thirsty people, for you never saw men more thirsty, nor more willing to drink, and his tent is guarded by the Giants: It is e∣nough (said <HI>Pantagruel)</HI> come brave boyes, are you resolved to go with me? To which <HI>Panurge</HI> answered, God confound him that leaves you: I have already bethought my self how I will kill them all like pigs, and so, that the devil one leg of them shall escape: but I am somewhat troubled about one thing: And what is that? said <HI>Pantagruel:</HI> It is (said <HI>Pa∣nurge)</HI> how I shall be able to set forward to the jusling and bragmardising of all the whores that be there this afternoon, in such sort, that there escape not one unbumped by me, breasted and jum'd after the ordinary fa∣shion of man and woman, in the Venetian conflict. Ha, ha, ha, ha, said <HI>Pantagruel.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Carpalin</HI> said; The devil take these

sink-holes, if by G—I do not bumbast some one of them: Then said <HI>Eusthenes,</HI> What shall not I have any, whose paces since we came from <HI>Rowen,</HI> were never so well winded up, as that my needle could mount to ten or eleven a clock till now, that <HI>I</HI> have it hard, stiffe and strong, like a hundred de∣vils? Truly, (said <HI>Panurge,)</HI> thou shalt have of the fattest, and of those that are most plump, and in the best case.</P>
<P>How now? (said <HI>Epistemon)</HI> every one shall ride, and <HI>I</HI> must lead the Asse, the devil take him that will do so, we will make use of the right of warre, <HI>Qui potest capere, capiat:</HI> No, no, said <HI>Panurge,</HI> but tie thine Asse to a crook, and ride as the world doth: And the good <HI>Pantagruel</HI> laughed at all this, and said unto them, You reckon without your host; I am much afraid, that before it be night I shall see you in such taking, that you will have no great stomach to ride, but more like to be rode upon, with sound blowes of pike and lance: <HI>Baste,</HI> (said <HI>Epistemon)</HI> e∣nough of that, I will not faile to bring them to you, either to roste or boile, to fry or put in paste: they are not so many in number, as were in the army of <HI>Xerxes,</HI> for he had thirty hundred thousand fighting men, if you will beleeve <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Trogus Pompeius:</HI> and yet <HI>Themistocles</HI> with a few men over∣threw them all: for Gods sake take you no

care for that. <HI>Cobsminnie, Cobsminnie,</HI> (said <HI>Panurge)</HI> my Codpiece alone shall suffice to overthrow all the men; and my St. <HI>Sweep-hole</HI> that dwells within it, shall lay all the wo∣men squat upon their backs.

<P>BEfore we depart hence, (said <HI>Pantagruel)</HI> in remembrance of the exploit that you have now performed, I will in this place erect a faire <HI>Trophee:</HI> then every man a∣mongst them with great joy, and fine little Countrey-songs set up a huge big post, whereunto they hanged a great cuirasier saddle, the fronstal of a barbed horse, bridle-bosses, pullie-pieces for the knees, stirrup-leathers, spurres, stirrups, a coat of male, a corslet tempered with steel, a battel-axe, a

strong, short and sharp horsemans sword, a gantlet, a horsemans mace, gushet-armour for the arme-pits, leg-harnesse, and a gorget, with all other furniture needful for the de∣corement of a triumphant arch, in signe of a <HI>Trophee.</HI> And then <HI>Pantagruel</HI> for an eter∣nal memorial, wrote this victorial <HI>Ditton,</HI> as followeth.</P>
<LG>
<L>Here was the prowesse made apparent of</L>
<L>Foure brave and valiant champions of proof,</L>
<L>Who without any armes but wit, at once</L>

Whilest <HI>Pantagruel</HI> was writing these fore∣said verses, <HI>Panurge</HI> halved and fixed upon a great stake the hornes of a roe-buck, toge∣ther with the skin, and the right forefoot thereof, the eares of three levrets, the chine of a coney, the jawes of a hare, the wings of two bustards, the feet of foure queest-doves, a bottle or <HI>borracho</HI> full of vineger, a horne wherein to put salt, a wooden spit, a larding stick, a scurvie kettle full of holes, a dripping pan to make sauce in, an earthen salt-cellar, and a goblet of <HI>Beauvais.</HI> Then in imitation of <HI>Pantagruels</HI> verses and Tro∣phee, wrote that which followeth:</P>
<LG>
<L>Here was it that foure jovial blades sate down</L>
<L>To a profound carowsing, and to crown</L>
<L>Their banquet with those wines, which please best great</L>
<L><HI>Bacchus,</HI> the Monarch of their drinking state:</L>
<L>Then were the reines and furch of a young hare,</L>
<L>With salt and vineger, displayed there,</L>
<L>Of which to snatch a bit or two, at once</L>
<L>They all fell on like hungry scorpions:</L>

All out, and of</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>But it is bad to eat of young hares flesh,</L>
<L>Unlesse with vineger we it refresh:</L>
<L>Receive this tenet then without controll,</L>
<L>That vineger of that meat is the soul.</L>
</LG>
<P>Then (said <HI>Pantagruel,)</HI> Come, my lads, let us be gone, we have stayed here too long a∣bout our victuals; for very seldom doth it fall out, that the greatest eaters do the most martial exploits, there is no <HI>shadow</HI> like that of flying colours, no <HI>smoke</HI> like that of hor∣ses, no <HI>clattering</HI> like that of armour: at this <HI>Epistemon</HI> began to smile, and said, There is no <HI>shadow</HI> like that of the kitchin, no <HI>smoke</HI> like that of pasties, and no <HI>clattering</HI> like that of goblets: unto which answered <HI>Panurge,</HI> There is no <HI>shadow</HI> like that of courtaines, no <HI>smoke</HI> like that of womens breasts, and no <HI>clattering</HI> like that of ballocks: then forth∣with rising up he gave a fart, a leap, and a whistle, and most joyfully cried out aloud, E∣ver live <HI>Pantagruel:</HI> when <HI>Pantagruel</HI> saw that, he would have done as much; but with the fart that he let, the earth trembled nine leagues about, wherewith and with the cor∣rupted aire, he begot above three and fifty thousand little men, ill favoured dwarfes, and with one fisg that he let, he made as ma∣ny
<PB N="176" REF="225"/>
little women, crouching down, as you shall see in divers places, which never grow but like Cowes tailes downwards, or like the <HI>Limosin</HI> radishes, round. How now (said <HI>Panurge)</HI> are your farts so fertile and fruitful? by G—here be brave farted men, and fisgued women, let them be married together, they will beget fine hornets and dorflies; so did <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> and called them Pygmies; those he sent to live in an island thereby, where since that time they are increased mightily: but the cranes make warre with them conti∣nually, against which they do most couragi∣ously defend themselves; for these little ends of men and dandiprats, (whom in <HI>Scot∣land</HI> they call whiphandles, and knots of a tarre-barrel) are commonly very teastie and cholerick: the Physical reason whereof is, because their heart is near their spleen.</P>
<P>At this same time, <HI>Panurge</HI> took two drinking glasses that were there, both of one bignesse, and filled them with water up to the brim, and set one of them upon one stool, and the other upon another, placing them a∣bout five foot from one another: then he took the staffe of a javelin, about five foot and a half long, and put it upon the two glas∣ses, so that the two ends of the staffe did come just to the brims of the glasses: This done, he took a great stake or billet of wood, and said to <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> and to the rest: <HI>My
<PB N="177" REF="225"/>
Masters,</HI> behold, how easily we shall have the victory over our enemies; for just as I shall break this staffe here upon these glasses, without either breaking or crazing of them▪ nay, which is more, without spilling one drop of the water that is within them, even so shall we break the heads of our <HI>Dipsodes,</HI> without receiving any of us any wound or losse in our person or goods: but that you may not think there is any <HI>witchcraft</HI> in this, hold (said he to <HI>Eusthenes)</HI> strike upon the midst as hard as thou canst with this log: <HI>Eusthenes</HI> did so, and the staffe broke in two pieces, and not one drop of the water fell out of the glasses: Then said he, I know a great many such tricks, let us now there∣fore march boldly, and with assurance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII. <HI>How</HI> Pantagruel <HI>got the victory very strangely over the</HI> Dipsodes, <HI>and the Giants.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFter all this talk, <HI>Pantagruel</HI> took the pri∣soner to him, and sent him away, saying, Go thou unto thy King in his Camp, and tell him tidings of what thou hast seen, and let him resolve to feast me to morrow about noon; for assoon as my galleys shall come,
<PB N="178" REF="226"/>
which will be to morrow at furthest; I will prove unto him by eighteen hundred thou∣sand fighting men, and seven thousand Gi∣ants, all of them greater then I am; that he hath done foolishly and against reason, thus to invade my countrey, wherein <HI>Pantagruel</HI> feigned that he had an army at sea; but the Prisoner answered, that he would yield him∣self to be his slave, and that he was content never to return to his own people, but rather with <HI>Pantagruel</HI> to fight against them, and for Gods sake besought him, that he might be permitted so to do: whereunto <HI>Pantagruel</HI> would not give consent, but commanded him to depart thence speedily, and be gone as he had told him, and to that effect gave him a box full of <HI>Euphorbium,</HI> together with some grains of the black <HI>chameleon thistle,</HI> steeped into <HI>aqua vitae,</HI> and made up into the condiment of a wet sucket, commanding him to carry it to his King, and to say unto him, that if he were able to eate one ounce of that without drinking after it, he might then be able to resist him, without any feare or appre∣hension of danger.</P>
<P>The Prisoner then besonght him with joynt hands, that in the houre of the battel he would have compassion upon him: whereat <HI>Pantagruel</HI> said unto him, After that thou hast delivered all unto the King, put thy whole confidence in God,
<PB N="179" REF="226"/>
and he will not forsake thee; because, al∣though for my part <HI>I</HI> be mighty, as thou mayest see, and have an infinite number of men in armes, I do neverthelesse trust neither in my force nor in mine industry, but all my confidence is in God my Protectour, who doth never forsake those that in him do put their trust and confidence. This done, the Prisoner requested him that he would afford him some reasonable composition for his ran some: to which <HI>Pantagruel</HI> answered, that his end was not to rob nor ran som men, but to enrich them, and reduce them to total liberty; Go thy way (said he) in the peace of the living God, and never follow evil company, lest some mischief befall thee. The Prisoner being gone, <HI>Pantagruel</HI> said to his men, Gentlemen, I have made this Prisoner believe that we have an army at sea, as also that we will not assault them till to morrow at noon, to the end, that they doubting of the great arrival of our men, mayspend this night in providing and strengthening themselves, but in the mean time my intention is, that we charge them about the houre of the first sleep.</P>
<P>Let us leave <HI>Pantagruel</HI> here with his A∣postles, and speak of King <HI>Anarchus</HI> and his army. When the Prisoner was come, he went unto the King, and told him how there was a great Giant come, called <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> who had overthrown, and made to be cruelly roasted
<PB N="180" REF="227"/>
all the six hundred and nine and fifty horse∣men, and he alone escaped to bring the news: besides that, he was charged by the said Gi∣ant, to tell him, that the next day about noon he must make a dinner ready for him, for at that houre he was resolved to set upon him: then did he give him that boxe wherein were those confitures; but assoon as he had swallow∣ed down one spoonful of them, he was taken with such a heat in the throat, together with an ulceration in the flap of the top of the winde-pipe, that his tongue peel'd with it, in such sort that for all they could do unto him, he found no ease at all, but by drinking only without cessation, for assoon as ever he took the goblet from his head, his tongue was on a fire, and therefore they did nothing but still poure in wine into his throat with a fun∣nel, which when his Captains, <HI>Bashawes,</HI> and guards of his body did see, they tasted of the same drugs, to try whether they were so thirst-procuring and alterative or no: but it so befell them as it had done their King, and they plied the flaggon so well, that the noise ran throughout all the Camp, how the Pri∣soner was returned, that the next day they were to have an assault, that the King and his Captains did already prepare themselves for it, together with his guards, and that wiah carowsing lustily, and quaffing as hard as they could, every man therefore in the army
<PB N="181" REF="227"/>
began to tipple, ply the pot, swill and guzzle it as fast as they could. In summe, they drunk so much, and so long, that they fell asleep like pigs, all out of order throughout the whole Camp.</P>
<P>Let us now return to the good <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> and relate how he carried himself in this busi∣nesse, departing from the place of the <HI>Tro∣phies,</HI> he took the mast of their ship in his hand like a Pilgrims staffe, and put within the top of it two hundred and seven and thirty poinsons of white wine of <HI>Anjou,</HI> the rest was of <HI>Rowen,</HI> and tied up to his girdle the bark all full of salt, as easily as the <HI>Lans∣kennets</HI> carry their little panniers, and to set onward on his way with his fellow-souldiers. When he was come near to the enemies Camp, <HI>Panurge</HI> said unto him, <HI>Sir,</HI> if you would do well, let down this white wine of <HI>Anjou,</HI> from the scuttle of the mast of the ship, that we may all drink thereof, like <HI>Bri∣tains.</HI></P>
<P>Hereunto <HI>Pantagruel</HI> very willingly con∣sented, and they drank so neat, that there was not so much as one poor drop left, of two hundred and seven and thirty punchons, ex∣cept one <HI>Boracho</HI> or leathern bottle of <HI>Tours,</HI> which <HI>Panurge</HI> filled for himself, (for he cal∣led that his <HI>vade mecum,)</HI> and some scurvie lees of wine in the bottom, which served him in stead of vineger. After they had whitled
<PB N="182" REF="228"/>
and curried the canne pretty handsomely; <HI>Panurge</HI> gave <HI>Pantagruel</HI> to eate some devil∣lish drugs, compounded of <HI>Lithotripton,</HI> (which is a stone-dissolving ingredient,) <HI>ne∣phrocatarticon,</HI> (that purgeth the reines) the marmalade of the Quinces, (called <HI>Codinias)</HI> a confection of <HI>Cantharides,</HI> (which are green flies breeding on the tops of olive-trees) and other kindes of <HI>diuretick</HI> or pisse-procuring simples. This done, <HI>Pantagruel</HI> said to <HI>Car∣palin,</HI> Go into the City, scrambling like a cat up against the wall, as you can well do, and tell them that now presently they come out, and charge their enemies as rudely as they can, and having said so, come down ta∣king a lighted torch with you, wherewith you shall set on fire all the tents and pavil∣lions in the Camp, then cry as loud as you are able with your great voice, and then come a∣way from thence. Yea, but, said <HI>Carpalin,</HI> were it not good to cloy all their ordnance? No, no, (said <HI>Pantagruel)</HI> only blow up all theit powder. <HI>Carpalin</HI> obeying him, departed suddenly, and did as he was appointed by <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> and all the Combatants came forth that were in the City, and when he had set fire in the tents and pavillions, he past so lightly through them, and so highly and pro∣foundly did they snort and sleep, that they ne∣ver perceived him. He came to the place where their Artillery was, and set their mu∣nition
<PB N="183" REF="228"/>
on fire: but here was the danger, the fire was so sudden, that poor <HI>Carpalin</HI> had almost been burnt; and had it not been for his wonderful agility, he had been fried like a roasting pig: but he departed away so speedi∣ly, that a bolt or arrow out of a Crossebowe could not have had a swifter motion. When he was clear of their trenches, he shooted a∣loud, and cried out so dreadfully, and with such amazement to the hearers, that it seem∣ed all the devils of hell had been let loose: at which noise the enemies awaked, but can you tell how? even no lesse astonished then are <HI>Monks,</HI> at the ringing of the first peale to <HI>Matins,</HI> which in <HI>Lusonnois</HI> is called <HI>Rub∣balock.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Pantagruel</HI> began to sowe the salt that he had in his bark, and because they slept with an open gaping mouth, he filled all their throats with it, so that those poor wretches were by it made to cough like foxes. Ha, <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> how thou addest great∣er heat to the firebrand that is in us. Sudden∣ly <HI>Pantagruel</HI> had will to pisse, by meanes of the drugs which <HI>Panurge</HI> had given him, and pist amidst the Camp so well and so copiously, that he drowned them all, and there was a particular deluge, ten leagues round about, of such considerable depth, that the history saith, if his fathers great mare had been there, and pist likewise, it would undoubtedly have
<PB N="184" REF="229"/>
been a more enormous deluge then that of <HI>Deucalion;</HI> for she did never pisse, but she made a river, greater then is either the <HI>Rhosne,</HI> or the <HI>Danow,</HI> which those that were come out of the City seeing, said, They are all cruelly slain, see how the blood runs along: but they were deceived in thinking <HI>Panta∣gruels</HI> urine had been the blood of their ene∣mies; for they could not see but by the light of the fire of the pavillions, and some small light of the Moon.</P>
<P>The enemies after that they were awaked, seeing on one side the fire in the Camp, and on the other the inundation of the urinal de∣luge, could not tell what to say, nor what to think; some said, that it was the end of the world, and the final judgement, which ought to be by fire: Others again thought that the sea-gods, <HI>Neptune, Protheus, Triton,</HI> and the rest of them did persecute them, for that in∣deed they found it to be like sea-water and and salt.</P>
<P>O who were able now condignely to re∣late, how <HI>Pantagruel</HI> did demean himfelf against the three hundred Giants; O my Muse, my <HI>Calliope,</HI> my <HI>Thalia,</HI> inspire me at this time, restore unto me my spirits; for this is the <HI>Logical</HI> bridge of asses: here is the pit∣sall, here is the difficultie, to have ability e∣nough to expresse the horrible battel that was fought; Ah, would to God that I had now

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. <HI>How</HI> Pantagruel <HI>discomfited the three hundred Giants armed with free stone, and</HI> Loup∣garou <HI>their Captain.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Giants seeing all their Camp drown∣ed, carried away their King <HI>Anarchus</HI> upon their backs, as well as they could out of the Fort, as <HI>Aeneas</HI> did to his father <HI>An∣chises,</HI> in the time of the conflagration of <HI>Troy.</HI> When <HI>Panurge</HI> perceived them, he said to <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> Sir, yonder are the Giants co∣ming forth against you, lay on them with your mast gallantly like an old Fencer; for now is the time that you must shew your self a brave man and an honest And for our part we will not faile you: I my self willl kill to you a good many boldly enough; for why, <HI>David</HI> killed <HI>Goliah</HI> very easily; and then, this great Lecher <HI>Eusthenes,</HI> who is stronger then foure oxen, will not spare him∣self. Be of good courage therefore, and va∣liant, charge amongst them with point and edge, and by all manner of meanes. Well▪
<PB N="186" REF="230"/>
(said <HI>Pantagruel,)</HI> of courage <HI>I</HI> have more then for fifty francks, but let us be wise, for <HI>Hercules</HI> first never undertook against two; that is well cack'd, well scummered, (said <HI>Pa∣nurge)</HI> do you compare your self with <HI>Hercu∣les?</HI> You have by G—more strength in your teeth, and more sent in your bum, then ever <HI>Hercules</HI> had in all his body and soul: so much is a man worth as he esteems himfelf. Whilest they spake those words behold, <HI>Lougarou</HI> was come with all his Giants, who seeing <HI>Panta∣gruel</HI> in a manner alone, was carried away with temerity and presumption, for hopes that he had to kill the good man; whereupon he said to his companions the Giants, You Wenchers of the low countrey, by <HI>Mahoom,</HI> if any of you undertake to fight against these men here, I will put you cruelly to death: it is my will that you let me fight single, in the mean time you shall have good sport to look upon us: then all the other Giants retired with their King, to the place where the flag∣gons stood, and <HI>Panurge</HI> and his <HI>Camerades</HI> with them, who counterfeited those that have had the pox, for he wreathed about his mouth, shrunk up his fingers, and with a harsh and hoarse voice said unto them, I forsake—od (fellow souldiers) if I would have it to be be∣leeved, that we make any warre at all; Give us somewhat to eat with you, whilest our Masters fight against one another; to this the
<PB N="187" REF="230"/>
King and Giants joyntly condescended, and accordingly made them to banquet with them. In the mean time <HI>Panurge</HI> told them the follies of <HI>Turpin,</HI> the examples of St. <HI>Ni∣cholas,</HI> and the tale of a tub. <HI>Lougarou</HI> then set forward towards <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> with a mace all of steel, and that of the best sort, weighing nine thousand seven hundred kin∣tals, and two quarterons, at the end whereof were thirteen pointed diamonds, the least whereof was as big as the greatest bell of our <HI>Ladies</HI> Church at <HI>Paris,</HI> (there might want perhaps the thicknesse of a naile, or (at most that <HI>I</HI> may not lie) of the back of those knives which they call cut-lugs or eare-cut∣ters, but for a little off or on, more or lesse, it is no matter) and it was inchanted in such sort, that it could never break, but contrarily all that it did touch, did break immediately. Thus then as he approached with great fierce∣nesse and pride of heart: <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> casting up his eyes to heaven, recommended himself to God with all his soule, making such a Vow as followeth.</P>
<P>O thou Lord God, who h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> alwayes been my Protectour, and my Saviour, thou seest the distresse wherein I am at this time: no∣thing brings me hither but a natural zeale, which thou hast permitted unto mortals, to keep and defend themselves, their wives and children, countrey and family, in case thy

own proper cause were not in question, which is the faith; for in such a businesse thou wilt have no Coadjutors, only a Catholick Con∣fession and service of thy Word, and hast forbidden us all arming and defence; for thou art the Almighty, who in thine owne cause, and where thine own businesse is taken to heart, canst defend it far beyond all that we can conceive, thou who hast thousand thousands of hundreds of millions of legi∣gions of Angels, the least of which is able to kill all mortal men, and turn about the Hea∣vens and earth at his pleasure, as heretofore it very plainly appeared in the army of <HI>Sen∣nacherib,</HI> if it may please thee therefore at this time to assist me, as my whole trust and confi∣dence is in thee alone: <HI>I</HI> vow unto thee, that in all Countreys whatsoever, wherein <HI>I</HI> shall have any power or authority, whether in this of <HI>Utopia,</HI> or elsewhere, <HI>I</HI> will cause thy ho∣ly Gospel to be purely, simply and entirely preached, so that the abuses of a rabble of hy∣pocrites and false prophets, who by humane constitutions, and depraved inventions, have impoisoned all the world, shall be quite exter∣minated from about me. This Vow was no sooner made, but there w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s heard a voice from heaven, saying, <HI>Hoc fac, &amp; vinces:</HI> that is to say, <HI>Do this, and thou shalt over∣come.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> seeing that <HI>Loupgarou</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="231"/>
with his mouth wide open was drawing near to him, went against him boldly, and cried out as loud as he was able, Thou diest, vil∣lain, thou diest, purposing by his horrible cry to make him afraid, according to the dis∣cipline of the <HI>Lacedemonians.</HI> Withal, he im∣mediately cast at him out of his bark which he wore at his girdle, eighteen cags, and foure bushels of salt, wherewith he filled both his mouth, throat, nose and eyes: at this <HI>Loup∣garou</HI> was so highly incensed, that most fiercely setting upon him, he thought even then with a blow of his mace to have beat out his braines: but <HI>Pantagruel</HI> was very nimble, and had alwayes a quick foot, and a quick eye, and therefore with his left foot did he step back one pace, yet not so nimbly, but that the blow falling upon the bark, broke it in foure thousand, fourescore and six pieces, and threw all the rest of the salt about the ground: <HI>Pantagruel</HI> seeing that, most gal∣lantly displayed the vigour of his armes, and according to the Art of the axe, gave him with the great end of his mast a homethrust a little above the breast: then bringing along the blow to the left side, with a slash struck him between the neck and shoulders: After that, advancing his right foot, he gave him a push upon the couillons, with the upper end of his said mast, wherewith breaking the scuttle, on the top thereof he spilt three or
<PB N="190" REF="232"/>
foure punchons of wine that were left therein.</P>
<P>Upon that <HI>Loupgarou</HI> thought that he had pierced his bladder, and that the wine that came forth had been his urine: <HI>Pantagruel</HI> being not content with this, would have doubled it by a side-blow; but <HI>Loupgarou</HI> lift∣ing up his mace, advanced one step upon him, and with all his force would have dash't it upon <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> wherein (to speak the truth) he so sprightfully carried himself, that if God had not succoured the good <HI>Panta∣gruel,</HI> he had been cloven from the top of his head to the bottom of his milt, but the blow glanced to the right side, by the brisk nimblenesse of <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> and his mace sank into the ground above threescore and thirteen foot, through a huge rock, out of which the fire did issue greater then nine thousand and six tuns. <HI>Pantagruel</HI> seeing him busie about plucking out his mace, which stuck in the ground between the rocks, ran upon him, and would have clean cut off his head, if by mischance his mast had not touch∣ed a little against the stock of <HI>Loupgarous</HI> mace, which was inchanted, as we have said before: by this meanes his mast broke off about three handfuls above his hand, where∣at he stood amazed like a Bell-Founder, and cried out, Ah <HI>Panurge,</HI> where art thou? <HI>Pa∣nurge</HI> seeing that, said to the King and the
<PB N="191" REF="232"/>
Giants, By G—they will hurt one another, if they be not parted; but the Giants were as merry as if they had been at a wedding: then <HI>Carpalin</HI> would have risen from thence to help his Master; but one of the Giants said un∣to him, By <HI>Golfarin</HI> the Nephew of <HI>Mahoon,</HI> if thou stir hence I will put thee in the bot∣tom of my breeches, in stead of a Supposi∣tory, which cannot chuse but do me good; for in my belly I am very costive, and can∣not well <HI>eagar,</HI> without gnashing my teeth, and making many filthy faces. Then <HI>Panta∣gruel,</HI> thus destitute of a staffe, took up the end of his mast, striking athwart and alongst upon the Giant, but he did him no more hurt then you would do with a filip upon a Smiths Anvil. In the time <HI>Loupgarou</HI> was drawing his mace out of the ground, and ha∣ving already plucked it out, was ready there∣with to have struck <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> who being ve∣ry quick in turning, avoided all his blowes, in taking only the defensive part in hand, un∣til on a sudden he saw that <HI>Loupgarou</HI> did threaten him with these words, saying, Now, villain, will not I faile to chop thee as small as minced meat, and keep thee henceforth from ever making any more poor men athirst; for then without any moreado, <HI>Pantagruel</HI> struck him such a blow with his foot against the bel∣ly, that he made him fall backwards, his heels over his head, and dragged him thus along at
<PB N="192" REF="233"/>
flay-buttock above a flight-shot. Then <HI>Loupgarou</HI> cried out, bleeding at the throat, <HI>Mahoon, Mahoon, Mahoon,</HI> at which noise all the Giants arose to succour him: but <HI>Panurge</HI> said unto them, Gentlemen, do not go, if you will beleeve me, for our Master is mad, and strikes athwart and alongst, he cares not where, he will do you a mischief; but the Gi∣ants made no account of it, seeing that <HI>Panta∣gruel</HI> had never a staffe.</P>
<P>And when <HI>Pantagruel</HI> saw those Giants ap∣proach very near unto him, he took <HI>Loupga∣rou</HI> by the two feet, and lift up his body like a pike in the aire, wherewith (it being harnish∣ed with Anvils) he laid such heavy load a∣mongst those Giants, armed with free stone, that striking them down as a Mason doth little knobs of stones, there was not one of them that stood before him, whom he threw not flat to the ground, and by the breaking of this stony armour there was made such a hor∣rible rumble, as put me in minde of the fall of the butter-tower of St. <HI>Stephens</HI> at <HI>Bourge,</HI> when it melted before the Sunne. <HI>Panurge,</HI> with <HI>Carpalin</HI> and <HI>Eusthenes,</HI> did cut in the mean time the throats of those that were struck down; in such sort that there escaped not one. <HI>Pantagrnel</HI> to any mans sight was like a Mower, who with his sithe (which was <HI>Loupgarou,)</HI> cut down the meddow grasse (to wit the Giants,) but with this fencing of <HI>Pan∣tagruels,
<PB N="193" REF="233"/>
Loupgarou</HI> lost his head, which hap∣pened when <HI>Pantagruel</HI> struck down one whose name was <HI>Riflandouille</HI> or pudding-plunderer, who was armed <HI>cap-a-pe</HI> with grison stones, one chip whereof splintring abroad cut off <HI>Epistemons</HI> neck clean and faire: for otherwise the most part of them were but lightly armed with a kinde of sandie brittle stone, and the rest with slaits: at last when he saw that they were all dead, he threw the body of <HI>Loupgarou,</HI> as hard as he could a∣gainst the City, where falling like a frog up∣on his belly, in the great <HI>piazza</HI> thereof, he with the said fall killed a singed he-cat, a wet she-cat, a farting duck, and a brideled goose.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX. <HI>How</HI> Epistemon, <HI>who had his head cut off, was finely healed by</HI> Panurge, <HI>and of the newes which he brought from the devils, and the damned people in hell.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis Gigantal victory being ended, <HI>Pantagruel</HI> withdrew himself to the place of the flaggons, and called for <HI>Panurge</HI> and the rest, who came unto him safe and sound, except <HI>Eusthenes,</HI> (whom one of the Giants had scratched a little in the face,
<PB N="194" REF="234"/>
whilest he about the cutting of his throat, and <HI>Epistemon,</HI> who appeared not at all: whereat <HI>Pantagruel</HI> was so aggrieved that he would have killed himself; but <HI>Panurge</HI> said unto him, Nay, Sir, stay a while, and we will search for him amongst the dead, and finde out the truth of all: thus as they went seeking after him, they found him stark dead, with his head between his armes all bloody. Then <HI>Eusthenes</HI> cried out, Ah cruel death! hast thou taken from me the perfectest amongst men? At which words <HI>Pantagruel</HI> rose up with the greatest grief that ever any man did fee, and said to <HI>Panurge,</HI> Ha, my friend, the prophecy of your two glasses, and the jave∣lin staffe was a great deal too deceitful, but <HI>Panurge</HI> answered, My dear bullies all, weep not one drop more, for he being yet all hot, <HI>I</HI> will make him as sound as ever he was; in saying this, he took the head, and held it warme fore-gainst his Codpiece, that the winde might not enter into it, <HI>Eusthenes</HI> and <HI>Carpalin</HI> carried the body to the place where they had banqueted, not out of any hope that ever he would recover, but that <HI>Panta∣gruel</HI> might see it.</P>
<P>Neverthelesse <HI>Panurge</HI> gave him very good comfort, saying, If I do not heale him, I will be content to lose my head (which is a fooles wager,) leave off therefore crying and help me. Then cleansed he his neck very well
<PB N="195" REF="234"/>
with pure white wine, and after that, took his head, and into it <HI>synapised</HI> some powder of <HI>diamerdis,</HI> which he alwayes carried about him in one of his bags. Afterwards, he an∣ointed it with I know not what ointment, and set it on very just, veine against veine, si∣new against sinew, and spondyle against spondyle, that he might not be wry-necked, (for such people he mortally hated,) this done, he gave it round about some fifteen or sixteen stitches with a needle, that it might not fall off again, then on all sides, and every where he put a little ointment on it, which he called <HI>resuscitative.</HI></P>
<P>Suddenly <HI>Epistemon</HI> began to breath, then opened his eyes, yawned, sneezed, and af∣terwards let a great houshold fart; whereup∣on <HI>Panurge</HI> said, Now certainly he is healed, and therefore gave him to drink a large full glasse of strong white wine, with a sugred toast. In this fashion was <HI>Epistemon</HI> finely healed, only that he was somewhat hoarse for above three weeks together, and had a dry cough of which he could not be rid, but by the force of continual drinking: and now he began to speak, and said that he had seen the divel, had spoken with <HI>Lucifer</HI> familiarly, and had been very merry in hell, and in the <HI>Elysian</HI> fields, affirming very seriously be∣fore them all, that the devils were boone companions, and merry fellowes: but in re∣spect
<PB N="196" REF="235"/>
of the damned, he said he was very sor∣ry that <HI>Panurge</HI> had so soon called him back into this world again; for (said he) I took wonderful delight to see them: How so? said <HI>Pantagruel:</HI> because they do not use them there (said <HI>Epistemon)</HI> so badly as you think they do: their estate and condition of living is but only changed after a very strange man∣ner; for I saw <HI>Alexander</HI> the great there, a∣mending and patching on clowts upon old breeches and stockins, whereby he got but a very poor living.</P>

<P>After this manner, those that had been great Lords and Ladies here, got but a poor scurvie wretched living there below. And on the contrary, the Philosophers and others, who in this world had been altogether indi∣gent and wanting, were great Lords there in their turne. <HI>I</HI> saw <HI>Diogenes</HI> there strout it out most pompously, and in great magnificence, with a rich purple gown on him, and a golden Scepter in his right hand. And which is more, he would now and then make <HI>Alex∣ander</HI> the great mad, so enormously would he abuse him, when he had not well patched his breeches; for he used to pay his skin with sound bastinadoes; <HI>I</HI> saw <HI>Epictetus</HI> there most gallantly apparelled after the <HI>French</HI> fa∣shion, sitting under a pleasant Arbour, with store of handsom Gentlewomen, frolicking, drinking, dancing, and making good cheare, with abundance of Crowns of the Sunne.

<P>When he saw me, he invited me to drink with him very courteously, and <HI>I</HI> being wil∣ling to be intreated, we tipled and chopined together most theologically. In the mean time came <HI>Cyrus</HI> to beg one farthing of him for the honour of <HI>Mercurie,</HI> therewith to buy a few onions for his supper? No, no, said <HI>Epictetus,</HI> I do not use in my almes-giving to bestow farthings, hold thou Varlet, there's a crown for thee, be an honest man: <HI>Cyrus</HI> was exceeding glad to have met with such a bootie; but the other poor rogues, the Kings that are there below, as <HI>Alexander, Da∣rius,</HI> and others stole it away from him by night. I saw <HI>Pathelin</HI> the Treasurer of <HI>Rha∣damantus,</HI> who in cheapening the pudding∣pyes that Pope <HI>Julius</HI> cried, asked him, How much a dozen? Three blanks (said the Pope:) Nay (said <HI>Pathelin)</HI> three blowes with a cudg∣el, lay them down here you rascal, and go fetch more: the poor Pope went away weep∣ing, who when he came to his Master the Pye-maker, told him that they had taken away his
<PB N="202" REF="238"/>
pudding-pyes; whereupon his Master gave him such a sound lash with an eele-skin, that his own would have been worth nothing to make bag-pipe-bags of. <HI>I</HI> saw Master <HI>John le maire,</HI> there personate the Pope in such fashi∣on, that he made all the poor Kings and Popes of this world kisse his feet, and taking great state upon him, gave them his benediction, saying, Get the pardons, rogues, get the par∣dons, they are good cheap: I absolve you of bread and pottage, and dispense with you to be never good for any thing: then calling <HI>Caillet</HI> and <HI>Triboulet,</HI> to him, he spoke these words, My Lords the Cardinals dispatch their bulls, to wit, to each of them a blow with a Cudgel upon the reines, which ac∣cordingly was forthwith performed.</P>
<P>I heard Master <HI>Francus Villou</HI> ask <HI>Xeroces,</HI> How much the messe of mustard? A farthing, said <HI>Xerxes:</HI> to which the said <HI>Villou</HI> answer∣ed, The pox take thee for a villain: as much of square-ear'd wheat is not worth half that price, and now thou offerest to inhance the price of victuals: with this he pist in his pot as the mustard-makers of <HI>Paris</HI> use to do. I saw the trained bowe-man of the bathing tub, (known by the name of the <HI>Francarcher de baignolet)</HI> who being one of the trustees of the Inqusition, when he saw <HI>Pierce Forrest</HI> making water against a wall, in which was painted the fire of St. <HI>Antonie,</HI> declared him
<PB N="203" REF="238"/>
heretick, and would have caused him to be burnt alive, had it not been for <HI>Morgant,</HI> who for his <HI>Proficiat</HI> and other small fees gave him nine tuns of beer. Well (said <HI>Panta∣gruel,)</HI> reserve all these faire stories for ano∣ther time, only tell us how the Usurers are there handled: I saw them (said <HI>Epistemon)</HI> all very busily employed in seeking of rustie pins, and old nailes in the kennels of the streets, as you see poor wretched rogues do in this world; but the <HI>quintal</HI> or hundred weight of this old iron ware, is there valued but at the price of a cantle of bread, and yet they have but a very bad dispatch and rid∣dance in the sale of it: thus the poor Misers are sometimes three whole weeks, without eating one morsel or crumb of bread, and yet work both day and night looking for the faire to come: neverthelesse, of all this la∣bour, toile and misery they reckon nothing, so cursedly active they are in the prosecution of that their base calling, in hopes at the end of the yeare, to earne some scurvie penny by it.</P>
<P>Come, (said <HI>Pantagruel)</HI> let us now make our selves merry one bout, and drink (my Lads) <HI>I</HI> beseech you, for it is very good drinking all this moneth: then did they un∣case their flaggons by heaps and dozens, and with their leaguer-provision made excellent good chear: but the poor King <HI>Anarchus</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="239"/>
could not all this while settle himselfe to∣wards any fit of mirth; whereupon <HI>Panurge</HI> said, Of what trade shall we make my Lord the King here, that he may be skilful in the Art, when he goes thither to sojourn, a∣mongst all the devils of hell? Indeed (said <HI>Pantagruel)</HI> that was well advised of thee, do with him what thou wilt: I give him to thee: Grammercie (said <HI>Panurge)</HI> the pre∣sent is not to be refused, and I love it from you.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI. <HI>How</HI> Pantagruel <HI>entered into the City of the</HI> Amaurots, <HI>and how</HI> Panurge <HI>married King</HI> Anarchus <HI>to an old Lantern-carrying Hag, and made him a Cryer of green sauce.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFter this wonderful victory, <HI>Pantagruel</HI> sent <HI>Carpalin</HI> unto the City of the <HI>A∣maurots,</HI> to declare and signifie unto them how the King <HI>Anarchus</HI> was taken prisoner, and all the enemies of the City overthrown, which news when they heard, all the inhabi∣tants of the City came forth to meet him in good order, and with a great triumphant pomp, conducting him with a heavenly joy
<PB N="205" REF="239"/>
into the City, where innnumerable bone-fires were set on, thorough all the parts there∣of, and faire round tables which were fur∣nished with store of good victuals, set out in the middle of the streets; this was a renew∣ing of the golden age in the time of <HI>Saturn,</HI> so good was the cheere which then they made.</P>
<P>But <HI>Pantagruel</HI> having assembled the whole Senate, and Common Councel-men of the town, said (My Masters) we must now strike the iron whilest it is hot; it is therefore my will, that before we frolick it any longer, we advise how to assault and take the whole Kingdom of the <HI>Dipsodes:</HI> to which effect let those that will go with me provide them∣selves against to morrow after drinking; for then will I begin to march, not that <HI>I</HI> need any more men then I have to help me to con∣quer it; for I could make it as sure that way as if <HI>I</HI> had it already, but <HI>I</HI> see this City is so full of inhabitants, that they scarce can turn in the streets; <HI>I</HI> will therefore carry them as a Colonie into <HI>Dipsodie,</HI> and will give them all that Countrey, which is fair, wealthie, fruitful and pleasant, above all other Countreys in the world as many of you can tell who have been there heretofore every one of you therefore that will go along, let him provide himself as <HI>I</HI> have said. This counsel and resolution be∣ing published in the City, the next morning
<PB N="206" REF="240"/>
there assembled in the <HI>piazza,</HI> before the Pa∣lace, to the number of eighteen hundred fifty six thousand and eleven, besides women and little children: thus began they to march straight into <HI>Dipsodie,</HI> in such good order as did the people of <HI>Israel</HI> when they departed out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> to passe over the red-sea.</P>
<P>But before we proceed any further in this purpose, I will tell you how <HI>Panurge</HI> handled his prisoner the King <HI>Anarchus:</HI> for having remembred that which <HI>Epistemon</HI> had rela∣ted, how the Kings and rich men, in this world were used in the <HI>Elysian</HI> fields, and how they got their living there by base and ig∣noble trades; he therefore one day apparel∣led his King in a pretty little canvass doub∣let, all jagged and pinked like the tippet of a light horsemans cap, together with a paire of large Mariners breeches, and stockins without shoes; For (said he) they would but spoile his sight; and a little peach-coloured bonnet, with a great capons feather in it: I lie, for <HI>I</HI> think he had two: and a very hand∣some girdle of a sky-colour and green, (in <HI>French</HI> called <HI>pers &amp; vert)</HI> saying, that such a livery did become him well, for that he had alwayes been <HI>perverse:</HI> and in this plight bringing him before <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> said unto him, Do you know this royster? No indeed, said <HI>Pantagruel:</HI> It is (said <HI>Panurge)</HI> my Lord, the King of the three batches, or thread-bare
<PB N="207" REF="240"/>
sovereign: <HI>I</HI> intend to make him an honest man. These devillish Kings which we have here are but as so many calves, they know nothing, and are good for nothing, but to do a thousand mischiefs to their poor sub∣jects, and to trouble all the world with warre for their unjust and detestable pleasure: I will put him to a trade, and make him a Crier of green sauce: Go to, begin and cry, <HI>Do you lack any green sauce?</HI> and the poor devil cried: That is too low (said <HI>Panurge;)</HI> then took him by the eare, faying, Sing higher in <HI>Gosolreut:</HI> So, so, (poor devil) thou hast a good throat: thou wert never so happy as to be no longer King: and <HI>Pantagruel</HI> made himself merry with all this; for I dare bold∣ly say, that he was the best little gafer that was to be seen between this and the end of a staffe. Thus was <HI>Anarchus</HI> made a good Crier of green sauce, two dayes thereafter <HI>Panurge</HI> married him with an old Lanterne-carrying Hag, and he himselfe made the wed∣ding with fine sheeps-heads, brave haslets with mustard, gallant salligots with garlick, of which he sent five horse-loads unto <HI>Panta∣gruel,</HI> which he ate up all, he found them so appetizing: and for their drink, they had a kinde of small well-watered wine, and some sorbapple-cider: and to make them dance he hired a blinde man, that made musick to them with a windbroach.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="241"/>
After dinner he led them to the Palace, and shewed them to <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> and said, pointing to the married woman, You need not feare that she will <HI>crack:</HI> Why? said <HI>Pan∣tagruel:</HI> Because, said <HI>Panurge,</HI> she is well slit and broke up already; What do you mean by that? said <HI>Pantagruel:</HI> Do not you see? said <HI>Panurge,</HI> that the chestnuts which are roasted in the fire, if they be whole, they <HI>crack</HI> as if they were mad; and to keep them from <HI>cracking,</HI> they make an incision in them, and slit them; so this new Bride is in her lower parts well slit before, and therefore will not crack behinde.</P>
<P><HI>Pantagruel</HI> gave them a little lodge near the lower street, and a mortar of stone wherein to bray and pound their sauce, and in this manner did they do their little businesse, he being as pretty a Crier of green sauce, as ever was seene in the Countrey of <HI>Utopia:</HI> but <HI>I</HI> have been told since that his wife doth beat him like plaister, and the poor sot dare not defend himself, he is so simple.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII. <HI>How</HI> Pantagruel <HI>with his tongue covered a whole Army, and what the Author saw in his mouth.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THus as <HI>Pantagruel</HI> with all his Army had entered into the Countrey of the <HI>Dipsodes,</HI> every one was glad of it, and in∣continently rendred themselves unto him, bringing him out of their own good wills the Keyes of all the Cities where he went, the <HI>Almirods</HI> only excepted, who being resolved to hold out against him, made answer to his Heraulds that they would not yield but upon very honourable and good conditions.</P>
<P>What? (said <HI>Pantagruel)</HI> do they ask any better termes, then the hand at the pot, and the glasse in their fist? Come let us go sack them, and put them all to the sword: then did they put themselves in good order, as being fully determined to give an assault, but by the way passing through a large field, they were overtaken with a great shower of raine, whereat they began to shiver and tremble, to croud, presse and thrust close to one an∣other. When <HI>Pantagruel</HI> saw that, he made their Captains tell them, that it was nothing,

and that he saw well above the clouds, that it would be nothing but a little dew; but howsoever, that they should put themselves in order, and he would cover them: then did they put themselves in a close order, and stood as near to other as they could: and <HI>Pantagruel</HI> drew out his tongue only half-wayes and covered them all, as a hen doth her chickens. In the mean time I, who relate to you these so veritable stories, hid my self under a burdock-leafe, which was not much lesse in largenesse then the arch of the bridge of <HI>Montrible;</HI> but when I saw them thus covered, I went towards them to shelter my self likewise, which I could not do; for that they were so (as the saying is) <HI>At the yards end there is no cloth left.</HI> Then as well as <HI>I</HI> could, I got upon it, and went along full two leagues upon his tongue, and so long marched, that at last I came into his mouth: but oh gods and goddesses, what did I see there? <HI>Jupiter</HI> confound me with his trisulk lightning if I lie: I walked there as they do in <HI>Sophie</HI> and <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and saw there great rocks like the mountains in <HI>Denmark,</HI> I beleeve that those were his teeth, <HI>I</HI> saw also faire meddows, large forrests, great and strong Cities, not a jot lesse then <HI>Lyons</HI> or <HI>Poictiers,</HI> the first man <HI>I</HI> met with there, was a good honest fellow planting coleworts, whereat being very much amazed, <HI>I</HI> asked him, My
<PB N="211" REF="242"/>
friend, what dost thou make here? I plant coleworts, said he: But how, and wherewith said I? Ha Sir, said he, every one cannot have his ballocks as heavy as a mortar, neither can we be all rich: thus do <HI>I</HI> get my poor li∣ving, and carry them to the market to sell in the City which is here behinde Jesus! (said <HI>I)</HI> is there here a new world? Sure (said he) it is never a jot new, but it is commonly re∣ported, that without this there is an earth, whereof the inhabitants enjoy the light of a Sunne and a Moone, and that it is full of, and replenished with very good commodi∣ties; but yet this is more ancient then that: Yea, but (said I) my friend, what is the name of that City, whither thou car∣riest thy Coleworts to sell? It is called <HI>Al∣pharage,</HI> (said he) and all the indwellers are Christians, very honest men, and will make you good chear. To be brief, I resolved to go thither. Now in my way, I met with a fellow that was lying in wait to catch pigeons, of whom <HI>I</HI> asked, (My friend) from whence come these pigeons? Sir, (said he) they come from the other world: then I thought, that when <HI>Panta∣gruel</HI> yawned, the pigeons went into his mouth in whole flocks, thinking that it had been a pigeon-house.</P>
<P>Then I went into the City, which <HI>I</HI> found faire, very strong, and seated in a good aire▪
<PB N="212" REF="243"/>
but at my entry the guard demanded of me my passe or ticket: whereat <HI>I</HI> was much astonished, and asked them, (My Masters) is there any danger of the plague here? O Lord, (said they) they die hard by here so fast, that the cart runs about the streets; Good God! (said <HI>I)</HI> and where? whereunto they answered that it was in <HI>Larinx</HI> and <HI>Phae∣rinx,</HI> which are two great Cities, such as <HI>Rowen</HI> and <HI>Nants,</HI> rich and of great trading: and the cause of the plague was by a stink∣ing and infectious exhalation, which lately vapoured out of the abismes, whereof there have died above two and twenty hundred and threescore thousand and sixteen persons within this sevennight; then <HI>I</HI> considered, calculated and found, that it was a rank and unsavoury breathing, which came out of <HI>Pantagruels</HI> stomack, when he did eat so much garlick, as we have aforesaid.</P>
<P>Parting from thence, I past amongst the rocks, which were his teeth, and never left walking till <HI>I</HI> got up on one of them; and there <HI>I</HI> found the pleasantest places in the world, great large tennis-Courts, faire gal∣leries, sweet meddows, store of Vines, and an infinite number of banqueting summer out-houses in the fields, after the <HI>Italian</HI> fa∣shion, full of pleasure and delight, where I stayed full foure moneths, and never made better cheer in my life as then. After that I
<PB N="213" REF="243"/>
went down by the hinder teeth to comt to the chaps; but in the way <HI>I</HI> was robbed by thieves in a great forrest, that is in the terri∣tory towards the eares: then (after, a little further travelling) <HI>I</HI> fell upon a pretty pet∣ty village, (truly <HI>I</HI> have forgot the name of it) where <HI>I</HI> was yet merrier then ever, and got some certain money to live by, can you tell how? by sleeping; for there they hire men by the day to sleep, and they get by it six pence a day, but they that can short hard get at least nine pence. How <HI>I</HI> had been robbed in the valley <HI>I</HI> inform∣ed the Senators, who told me that in very truth the people of that side were bad li∣vers, and naturally theevish, whereby I perceived well, that as we have with us the Countreys <HI>cisalpin</HI> and <HI>transalpine,</HI> that is, behither and beyond the mountains, so have they there the Countreys <HI>cidentine</HI> and <HI>tra∣dentine,</HI> that is, behither and beyond the teeth: but it is farre better living on this side, and the aire is purer. There <HI>I</HI> began to think, that it is very true which is common∣ly said, that the one half of the world know∣eth not how the other half liveth; seeing none before my self had ever written of that Countrey, wherein are above five and twen∣ty Kingdomes inhabited, besides deserts, and a great arme of the sea: concerning which purpose, <HI>I</HI> have composed a great book inti∣tuled

<P>At last I was willing to return, and pas∣sing by his beard, I cast my self upon his shoulders, and from thence slid down to the ground, and fell before him: assoon as I was perceived by him, he asked me, Whence comest thou, <HI>Alcosribas?</HI> I answered him, Out of your mouth, <HI>my Lord?</HI> and how long hast thou been there? said he. Since the time (said I) that you went against the <HI>Almirods;</HI> That is, about six moneths ago, said he: and wherewith didst thou live? what didst thou drink? I answered, My Lord, of the same that you did, and of the daintiest morsels that past through your throat I took toll: Yea, but said he, where didst thou shite? In your throat (my Lord) said I: Ha, ha, thou art a merry fellow, said he. We have with the help of God conquer∣ed all the land of the <HI>Dipsodes,</HI> I will give thee the <HI>Chastelleine,</HI> or Lairdship of <HI>Salmi∣gondin;</HI> Grammercy, my Lord, said I, you gratifie me beyond all that I have deserved of you.</P>

<P>A While after this the good <HI>Pantagruel</HI> fell sick, and had such an obstruction in his stomack, that he could neither eate nor drink: and because mischief seldome comes alone, a hot pisse seised on him, which tormented him more then you would be∣leeve: His Physicians neverthelesse helped him very well, and with store of lenitives and diuretick drugs made him pisse away his paine: his urine was so hot, that since that time it is not yet cold, and you have of it in divers places of <HI>France,</HI> according to the course that it took, and they are called the hot Baths, as</P>

<P>And <HI>I</HI> wonder much at a rabble of foolish Philosophers and Physicians, who spend their time in disputing, whence the heat of the said waters cometh, whether it be by reason of <HI>Borax,</HI> or sulphur, or allum, or salt-peter that is within the mine; for they do nothing but dote, and better were it for them to rub their arse against a thistle, then to waste away their time thus in disputing of that, whereof they know not the original; for the resolution is easie, neither need we to enquire any further, then that the said baths came by a hot pisse of the good <HI>Pantagruel.</HI></P>
<P>Now to tell you after what manner he was cured of his principal disease; <HI>I</HI> let passe how for a <HI>minorative,</HI> or gentle potion, he took foure hundred pound weight of <HI>Colo∣phoniack Scammonee:</HI> six score and eighteen cart-loads of <HI>Cassia:</HI> an eleven thoufand and nine hundred pound weight of <HI>Rubarb,</HI> be∣sides other confused jumblings of sundry drugs: You must understand, that by the advice of the <HI>Physicians,</HI> it was ordained that what did offend his stomach should be taken away; and therefore they made seventeen great balls of copper, each whereof was big∣ger

then that which is to be seen on the top of St. <HI>Peters</HI> needle at <HI>Rome,</HI> and in such sort, that they did open in the midst, and shut with a spring. Into one of them entered one of his men carrying a Lanterne and a torch lighted, and so <HI>Pantagruel</HI> swallowed him down like a little pill: into seven others went seven Countrey-fellows, having every one of them a shovel on his neck: into nine o∣thers entred nine wood-carriers, having each of them a basket hung at his neck, and so were they swallowed down like pills: when they were in his stomack, every one undid his spring, and came out of their ca∣bins: the first whereof was he that carried the Lantern, and so they fell more then half a league into a most horrible gulph, more stinking and infectious then ever was <HI>Me∣phitis,</HI> or the marishes of <HI>Camerina,</HI> or the abominably unsavoury lake of <HI>Sorbona,</HI> whereof <HI>Strabo</HI> maketh mention. And had it not been, that they had very well an∣tidoted their stomach, heart and wine-pot, which is called the noddle, they had been altogether suffocated and choaked with these detestable vapours. O what a per∣fume! O what an evaporation wherewith to beray the masks or muflers of young mangie queans: after that with groping and smelling they came near to the fecal matter and the corrupted humours; finally
<PB N="218" REF="246"/>
they found a <HI>montjoy</HI> or heap of ordure and filth: then fell the Pioneers to work to dig it up, and the rest with their shovels filled the baskets; and when all was cleansed, e∣very one retired himself into his ball.</P>
<P>This done, <HI>Pantagruel</HI> enforcing himself to a vomit, very easily brought them out, and they made no more shew in his mouth, then a fart in yours: but when they came merrily out of their pills, I thought upon the <HI>Grecians</HI> coming out of the <HI>Trojan</HI> horse: by this meanes was he healed, and brought unto his former state and convalescence; and of these brazen pills, or rather cop∣per-balls, you have one at <HI>Orleans,</HI> upon the steeple of the Holy Crosse Church.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV. <HI>The Conclusion of this present Book, and the excuse of the Author.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOw (my Masters) you have heard a beginning of the horrisick history of my Lord and Master <HI>Pantagruel:</HI> Here will I make an end of the first book; My head akes a little, and I perceive that the Regi∣sters of my braine, are somewhat jumbled and disordered with this septembral juice. You shall have the rest of the history at <HI>Franckfort mart</HI> next coming, and there shall you see how <HI>Panurge</HI> was married and made a Cuckold within a moneth after his wed∣ding: how <HI>Pantagruel</HI> found out the Philo∣sophers stone, the manner how he found it, and the way how to use it: how he past o∣ver the <HI>Caspian</HI> mountaines, and how he sailed thorough the <HI>Atlantick</HI> sea, defeated the <HI>Cannibals,</HI> and conquered the isles of <HI>Perles,</HI> how he married the daughter of the King of <HI>India,</HI> called <HI>Presian,</HI> how he fought against the devil, and burnt up five cham∣bers of hell, ransacked the great black chamber, threw <HI>Proserpina</HI> into the fire,
<PB N="220" REF="247"/>
broke five teeth to <HI>Lucifer,</HI> and the horne that was in his arse. How he visited the re∣gions of the Moon, to know whether in∣deed the Moon were not entire and whole, or if the women had three quarters of it in their heads, and a thousand other little mer∣riments all veritable. These are brave things truly; Good night, Gentlemen, <HI>Perdonate mi,</HI> and think not so much upon my faults, that you forget your own. If you say to me, (Master) it would seem that you were not ve∣ry wise in writing to us these flimflam stories, and pleasant fooleries.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> answer you, that you are not much wi∣ser to spend your time in reading them: ne∣verthelesse, if you read them to make your selves merry, as in manner of pastime <HI>I</HI> wrote them, you and <HI>I</HI> both are farre more worthy of pardon, then a great rabble of squint-minded fellowes, dissembling and counterfeit Saints, demure lookers, hypo∣crites, pretended zealots, tough Fryars, bus∣kin-Monks, and other such sects of men, who disguise themselves like Maskers to de∣ceive the world, for whilest they give the common people to understand, that they are busied about nothing but contemplati∣on and devotion in fastings, and maceration of their sensuality; and that only to sustain and aliment the small frailty of their humani∣ty: It is so far otherwise, that on the contrary
<PB N="221" REF="247"/>
(God knows) what cheer they make, <HI>Et Curios simulant, sed bacchanalia vivunt.</HI> You may reade it in great letters, in the colouring of their red snowts, and gulching bellies as big as a tun, unlesse it be when they per∣fume themselves with sulphur; as for their study it is wholly taken up in reading of <HI>Pan∣tagruelin</HI> books, not so much to passe the time merrily, as to hurt some one or other mis∣chievously, to wit, in <HI>articling, sole-articling, wry-neckifying, buttock-stirring, ballocking,</HI> and <HI>diabliculating,</HI> that is, calumniating; wherein they are like unto the poor rogues of a village, that are busie in stirring up and scra∣ping in the ordure and filth of little children, in the season of cherries and guinds, and that only to finde the kernels, that they may sell them to the druggists, to make thereof po∣mander-oile. Fly from these men, abhorre and hate them as much as <HI>I</HI> do, and upon my faith you will finde your selves the better for it. And if you desire to be good <HI>Pantagru∣elists</HI> (that is to say, to live in peace, joy, health, making your selves alwayes merry) never trust those men that alwayes peep out at one hole.</P>
