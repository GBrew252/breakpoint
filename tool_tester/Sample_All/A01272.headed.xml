thynke he was not deceaued and as this iii
{per}sōs were not like so toke they the answere
made to them not a lyke / More &amp; Rochestre
thought foule scorne (see what the glorye of

doth) that a ionge man of smale reputaciō
shulde take vppon him so cleane contrarye
to their opinion to wrytte agaynst thē. And

they could neuer after be quyet in their

Rastell though he {per}ceyued his natural rea∣son
to be sore sayd to / yet was he not mali∣cious
as the other were And therfore wrote
he agayne / which worke of Rastell came to
his handes when he was presonner in the
Tower of London / where he made the an∣swer
folowyng to the same which answere
after Rastell had reade / he was well contēt

causes of the makyng of youre .i.
boke of purgatory without alle∣ginge
any textes of scripture for
the proue therof which are the cō¦trouersye
of .ii. sortes of people.
One sorte you say be those that beleue not ī
Christ / but denie christ &amp; his scripture as be
the turkes paynims &amp; suh other miscreaūts
An other sorte be they that beleue in chryste
&amp; his scripture nor wyll denye no texte of ho∣ly
scripture / but yet they wyll cōstrue expōde
and interprete this textes after theyr owue
wylles and obstinate mynde. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now let vs cōsyder your forsayd causes
&amp; pōder whether your boke haue or may do
any such good as you say pretended / &amp; whe∣ther
it haue cōuerted those sortes of people / or
els by any thynge likely to do suche a fa∣cte.
And fyrst let vs se what it profyteth the
fyrste sorte which are infideles not beleuīge
ī chryst nor his scripture.<NOTE PLACE="marg">John. 3.</NOTE> Our sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iour christ
saieth / he that beleueth is not dāpned / &amp; Ihō
Bap. cōfirmeth the same saying: he that be∣leueth
in the son̄e hath euerlastīge lyffe / but
he that beleueth not in the sonē shall not se
lyfe / but the wrath of god abydeth vppō hī.
Here it is euident not be my exposicyō / but
by the cōsent of all christē men / that those in
fideles are dāpned / for what entēt thā shulde
Rastel teache thē that there is a purgatory:
without christ their is no way but dāpnacy
<PB REF="6"/>
on as scripture &amp; all faythfull men testifye.
Thē wolde I know by what way he wolde
{per}swade that there were a purgatory (which
shulde be away &amp; ameane to saluacion and
not to dāpnaciō) for them which beleue not
in Chryst. This I am sure of (&amp; I thīke Ra∣stell
beleueth it also) that the infydeles shall
neuer come in it thoughe theire were one?
This you maye se that his fyrst cause is ve¦rye
vayne / &amp; that yf they dyd beleue it they
were in dead deceyued.</P>
<P>Now let vs {pro}cede vnto the secōde sorte of
poeple (which beleue in christ &amp; his scripture
&amp; yet misconstrue it / expoūding it after their
owne willes) And let vs se what frute they
take of this boke &amp; what it profyteth them &amp;
we shall fynde that it lesse serueth these mē
thē the fryste: for if this men beleue in chryst
&amp; in his scripture / thē is it not possyble that
they shulde receaue or admytte that thynge
whiche is against the scripture bothe by the
exposiciō of thē selues &amp; of al the worlde For
this is both agaynst scrypture and all faith∣full
men that there shulde be anye waye to
helth yf we exclude Christ and his scripture
And syth purgatorye is counted awaye to
helthe / he that wolde go aboute to proue it / secludynge
Chryst and scrypture is against
scrypture and all faythfull men.</P>
<P>Besydes that yf they be so obsty∣nate
that they wyll not receaue the verye

scripture but expounde it after theyr owne
wylles &amp; wrest it after the same / then wyll
they moche lesse receaue your boke which is
so playne against scripture / and therfore yf
yow wolde thīke that they coulde be tamed
by your boke which notwitstonding so wre¦steth
scrypture / thē may I verye well lyken
yow to him that hath a wilde horse to tame
which when he {per}ceueth that he cā not holde
him with a scokry she snafle wyll yet labour
to breake hī with a rotyn twyne threde: So
that I can espye no maner of profyte that
can come of youre boke yf yowe can allege
no better causes thē yow yet shew / but that
it had ben a greate dele better on wryten.</P>
<P>And brother Rastel where yow say that
I auaunce &amp; boste my selfe moch more then
becometh me / and that I detraycte &amp; slander
my neyghbours / and that I prouoke all mē

<P>I am sure there are many that merueyll<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rastell.</NOTE>

But my wordes are this / I am sure that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Frith</NOTE>
there are manye that wyll moche meruayll
that I beynge so ionge and of so small ler∣ning
dare dispute this matter &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here Rastell leueth out the wordes (and
of so smake lernynge) for yf he had put that
in he had be wrayed him selfe. For I thynke
no man so madde as to saye that he which
sayeth him selfe to be both yonge &amp; of small
lerninge shulde prayse &amp; boste him selfe.</P>
<P>Also immediatly after the wordes of his

as touchinge my lerninge I muste nedes a∣knowlege
(as the trueth is) that it is verye
smal which I thynke is but a base bostīge / and

coloure of rethoryke / and is called auanto∣podosis
that is to saye an answer to an ob∣iecciō
that a mā myghte haue here made on
this maner: thou grauntest thy selfe yonge
and so smale lernynge doste thou thē thinke
that we shall once reade or regarde thy bo∣ke
/ speciallye sythe it is wryten agaynste
auncyent men bothe of great wytte and dig¦nyte?
to this twoo poyntes I answere pre∣uentinge
theyr obieccion that they shuld not
dispyse it because of my youthe / for as the
sprete of god is bounde to no place / euen so
is he not addicte to anye age or person but
enspyreth where he wyll and when he wyll
&amp; brenge in for an ensample that he espyred
yonge Tymothe prouinge ther by that the
youth of it selfe is not to be dispised / but ac¦cordinge
to the lernynge whiche it bryngeth
and that therfore they maye not dispise my
youth but fyrst read what doctrine I brīge
and therafter do iudge it: no more in this I
proued not that I am enspyred and haue
the sprete of god as Tymothe had / but on∣ly
proue that God maye enspyre youthe as

the fauour &amp; kyndnes that our louing
father hath shewed vs in his sone chryst Ie¦su / and
that he hath recōcyled vs vnto him∣selfe
by the bloude of his sone / then beginne
we to loue hī / the more we hate the body of
synne &amp; lament and be sory that our mēbres
are so frayle / that they can not fulfyll the
lawe of God and so in mornynge and be∣waylynge
oure infyrmyte / it causeth vs to
abstayne from bothe / meate &amp; drinke &amp; all
worldly pleasures which is the pure fastīge

appoynted to thentēt that it shulde in tyme

before. This is the maner of repētaūce
which I fynde in scrypture / but this helpeth
that we shulde synne no more / but what Ra∣stell
dremethe I woote not. But to expresse
to the vttermoste what I meane by repen∣taunce
/ marke this example yf a man bylde
an house which doth coste him moch labour
and mony / &amp; haue layde no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sure fundacion / but
that whē a tempeste cōmith his house
doth fall / then wyll he be very sory / and re∣pēt
that he hath so folishly bestowed his mo∣ny
&amp; labour. Notwithstōdinge al this great
sorow and repentaunce can not set vp his
house agayne which is fallen / but only it ta∣keth
an occasyon by the ruyne of the house
to teache the owner witte againste another
tyme that when he buildeth agayne he may
make a sure foundacion. Euen so though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
thou repent neuer so much that cā not gette
remission for the synnes that is paste / but
that muste be pardoned onlye by the faythe
of Chrystes bloude. Neuerthelesse it dothe

<P>EVery chyld may answer him to this yf
he ouer reade or {per}ceyue what I wrote
before of repentaunce / for as they take repē∣taunce
for the sorowe and mornyng that fo∣loweth
the cryme / euē so they calle penaūce
the good workes that ensue of repētance / &amp;
this good workes which folow do mortifie

that we synne no more / but they
can get no more remission of the syn̄e which
is once past thē that which they call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> repen¦taunce
&amp; yet do we neyther destroye sorow∣ynge
for syn̄e nor good workes as he falslye
reporteth by vs / but we teach you how they
ought to be done &amp; that they are fruytes of
fayth / &amp; mortifye our membres and are pro¦fitable
to our neyghbour / &amp; a testymony vn¦to
vs that we ar chyldrē of our heuēly fat.
as by exāple I say that nother the son̄e nor the
mon̄e do iustifie vs / or purchase remissi∣on

shulde saye that I denye or destroye the

that we can haue no day / &amp; that we can not
be without thē / and as touching the soluciō
of this that penaūce takinge in his largest
significacion / both for good workes &amp; takīg
of paynes is not satisfaction for synnes / I
muste tell you once againe that there are .ii.
maner of satisfacciōs / the one is to god / the
other to my neyghbour. To god can not all
the world make satisfactiō for one crime / in
so moche that yf euery grasse of the grounde
were a man as holy as euer was. Paull or
Peter &amp; shulde pray to god all ther lyfe lōge
for one cryme / yet coulde they not make sa∣tisfaction
for it / but it is only the bloude of
chryste that hath made full satisfactiō vnto
god / for all suche crymes. heb. 7.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebreo. 7</NOTE> or els were
there no nother remedye / but we shuld al pe¦ryshe.
There is an other satisfactiō whiche
is to my neighbor whō I haue offēded / whō
I am boūde to pacifie as we .ii. cā agre / &amp; as
the lawes of the realme determine betwene
vs / as if I had deformed hī: thē am I boūde

childish as to thinke that this ciuile satisfa¦ctiō

gods wrath for breking his law: for if thou
morther a mā &amp; shuld dye a c. times for it yet
except thou haue satisfactiō of cristes bloud
<PB REF="25"/>
thou shalt be dāpned therto: and so I spake

he wyl say the son̄e is not auailable because
